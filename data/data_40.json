Sadie was born on December 3, 2020. She is good with people of all ages and other dogs. Sadie's Momma is a Black Mouth Cur mix, but we never knew Sadie's Dad, so we can't be sure what Sadie's actual breed mix is. Sadie found herself stuck in a kill shelter with her Momma and siblings. A shelter is a dangerous place for a young puppy, and it was likely that Sadie wouldn't make it out alive. So as soon as we received a plea to help Sadie, we of course said YES! and Sadie was on her way to happiness. If you're looking for puppy love, and the more puppy kisses the better, Sadie is your girl! Please apply online to adopt Sadie (SC) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

The trainer says she's a well-behaved, curious girl who loves walks and runs in the park, and plenty of belly rubs!\n\nJudy was tested in the shelter's play yard with another calm dog and did fine, but our trainer will do a full assessment to determine the temperament of dogs that she prefers. \n\nJudy is house-trained, crate-trained, and weighs 65 lbs. She enjoys car rides and would love to accompany you on errands!  She would do best in a single-family home with a backyard so she has room to poke around and play.",

He is so friendly and easy going that he is often a participant in \"meets and greets\" to see how reactive other dogs are. Doyle always passed the test, even if others didn't! Sadly, Doyle arrived heartworm positive, so he is being treated. However, he is still available for foster to adopt, which means he can bond with his new family while under the veterinarian's care here. For an application to adopt Doyle, email humanesociety@hsscg.org. Doyle is neutered, microchipped, current on core vaccines and under our veterinarian's care for heartworms.",

Axel is high energy and would love a family to go on adventures with. He is good with dogs, not good with cats, and good with kids. Axel does not like going to the vet (who does?!) and needs proper muzzle training/sedation to safely take him to the vet. \n\nAxel has to find my new forever home because the current owner is experiencing health issues and cannot also care for Axel.\n\nAdoption requirements are as such:\n\n\n\tLarge breed experince \n\tNot a first time dog parent \n\n\nPlease note, Axel is part of Happy Trails Animal Rescues rehoming program. She has not been tested or evaluated and the information gathered is from the current owners personal statements regarding health and temperament. The owner is subject to placement outside of our organization. We cannot guarantee availability.",

Mavi also enjoys play groups with other dogs that are smaller then her; dogs that are larger than her make her nervous and wouldn't be a goof fit. She does LOVE puppies! We aren't sure about cats but her friendly nature with little fluffy dogs leads us to believe she could possibly be ok - we can further test her if the need arises. Mavi is always down for a good snuggle on the couch and might possibly be defined as a couch potato. \nIf you would like to learn more about Mavi, please fill out an application and we would love to schedule a Meet & Greet! \n\nStaff Highlights: \n\nWhitney: \"I love how she loves kids. She is gentle and kind.\"\nCourtney: \"Love how gentle and motherly she is to the puppies.\"\nWendy: \"She loves attention and will snuggle with you.\"\nRegina: \"She has never met a stranger!\"",

With that little black and white face...how can anyone resist?\nCurtis does really well in our play groups and loves to run with the big dogs! His favorite game is to carry the leashes of the bog dogs while out in play group.\nHe's a pretty laid back, happy go lucky guy. He's working on his manners and as part of our Puppy Academy, any adopter must be willing to continue his training through Halo. \n\nStaff Highlights:\nRegina: \"One of the most stable pups I've met! Easy going and able to read dog body language.\"\nWendy: \"Curtis is smart and easy to train.\"\nKelsey: \"Curtis is soooo chill.\"",

She does great with other dogs and gets along with cats. Honey needs to lose 10lbs since she has hip dysplasia in both hips. Slow, leisurely walks are beneficial, also. More than a few steps in a home are not the best for the girl. Honey is house trained and crate trained. If you are looking for someone to keep you company, Honey is the one for you. She is looking for a fabulous foster family or a fantastic forever family. Email us with questions at lizzyshospice@gmail.com.\n\n",

I do like to dig in the yard when bored. I'm ready to find my forever home.\n\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm tested negative (age 7 months and older) and microchipped. We do not ship or transport. A senior dog's adoption donation is $100. There is a $5 fee for credit/debit cards.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please fill out an online application here: www.heartlandsmallanimalrescue.org/canine-application.html",

She is house trained and doesn\u2019t bark. She is great with older kids and is very loyal.   She\u2019s happy going for walks, taking rides in the car or laying around being a couch potato.\n\nShe tolerates her foster dog-brother but doesn\u2019t love him. She has not been around any other dogs or cats in our home.  She\u2019s okay being in a crate on her own terms but doesn\u2019t appreciate when we close the door. \nShe sleeps with her tongue out. ?.\n\nMolly came to us in very poor conditions.  She has received her last heartworm injection on December 30th.  She needs to stay chilled out for 6 weeks(until Feb 10th) and then she can go back to being a normal dog.  \n   Molly can be adopted now to a quiet home or if it is a more active home she can be adopted after February 10th.   She will live a perfectly normal and happy life after that. She will be required to be on heartworm prevention for the rest of her life, as all dogs should be anyway. \n   Molly is $175.  She is spayed and up to date on vet care. We are looking for her forever home.   \n  If interested we will need you to fill out an application and then we will get you in touch with the foster home, who knows her best!   \n  She is being fostered in Excelsior Springs Mo.",

Jazz has severe cataracts and is blind but he doesn't let that slow him down. He is house trained and knows \"step up and step down\" to navigate steps. He quickly learned where the furniture is in his foster home and has no issues getting around. Jazz is a cuddler and would like a lap to sit on 24 hours a day. He prefers to be inside because he doesn't like getting his feet wet. He does fine with other dogs but he needs a home without children.",

            "description": "Scout is a 4-ish years, 10-pound neutered male terrier mix, with pearly white teeth! He was unadoptable at the ACC due to behavioral issues and Waggytail scooped him up and placed him into a top-notch, 5 week Board & Train Program with ClarityK9.com (check him out on their fantastic Instagram stories https://www.instagram.com/clarity.k9/). Scout is now crate trained, housebroken, with good manners, basic obedience, tolerates cats and other dogs and is terrific on leash during his walks. Scout's training is a work in progress and we are looking for a dedicated person(s) who will agree to book Scout's trainer for several sessions in order to fully transfer and lock in his good behavior. Consistency is key to keeping Scout on track for a chance at a long and have a happy life, in a loving forever home, where he will reach new heights in his journey to becoming a perfect play buddy. Scout's adopter(s) will be taught to safely play fetch and tug with him, which he loves! In order to keep Scout's newly acquired good manners intact, he must be crated at night and is not allowed on human furniture. He needs a disciplined owner who will agree to follow a consistent routine of hand-feeding while continuing his obedience training. If you think you have the time and energy to continue Scout's journey from naughty to nice, and you are located in or near Brooklyn, Queens or Manhattan, please fill out an adoption application. \n\nScout needs to be an only dog with no small children in the home. \n\nPlease confirm in your adoption application that you agree to retain and work with Scout's current trainer. Tell us a little bit about your interest in learning how to continue his training routines.\n\nVaccinated for rabies, DA2PP, and bordetella. Neutered, microchipped, and heartworm negative. \n\nPlease contact us DIRECTLY using the instructions below if you are interested in adopting one of our Waggytails! Visit our website (www.waggytailrescue.org) for an adoption application. It is important to fill out an application as soon as possible for consideration, and we require a complete application for you to meet an animal. \n\nAdoptions: waggyadopt@gmail.com\n\nWaggytail Rescue CANNOT guarantee the exact age of any adoptable dog, or final size of any of our adoptable puppies. We rely on the information provided to us by veterinarians, shelters, owner surrenders and other circumstances bringing the dog into our rescue.",

She says I look like a manatee with a possum tail (bc I'm husky and I've lost a little bit of fur back there). I think she means to say that I am very handsome!\n\nI mostly enjoy lounging on the couch or a dog bed. And although I am around 8 years old, I will still play with the young pups for short spurts! I get along fine with the other dogs in my foster home and even the cat! I also enjoy getting massages. If I'm standing, I will lean in to you as if to say, \"more please!\"\n\nI am house-trained, crate-trained, know commands like \"stay\", \"come\", \"sit\", and \"in\" (my crate). I'm an all-around great catch! Will you be my forever?\n\nMy adoption fee is $175. I am up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, heartworm tested, neutered, and microchipped.\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, microchipped and if over 6 months of age, heartworm tested and on heartworm preventative in their foster home.\n\nWe require an approved application to meet any of our dogs. We do not have a shelter location and will not arrange a meeting without an approved application.\n\nWe strive to make sure the bios provided for our dogs are complete and accurate; we do understand that mistakes happen, however, so if you absolutely cannot find the answer to your question in the dog's bio, you can contact us for more information.\n\nWe require a home visit for each dog we adopt out, so we adopt within a 2 hour radius of Dayton, OH. If you are outside of this radius, we encourage you to contact your local rescue or shelter.",

She is a small, 5-6 year old beagle. \n\nWhen Daphne arrived she was full of intestinal worms and underweight and really didn't feel great so we didn't get to know her true personality. Now that she has been treated for the worms and putting on weight she is coming out of her shell. She is a snuggler with her foster mom. She is not afraid of adults or children. She does like other dogs but doesn't like them getting right up in her face. She doesn't live with another dog so we don't know if she would resource guard food or toys at this time. \n\nShe is OK in a crate, doing well with housebreaking and leash walking.\n\nShe is scheduled to be spayed January 28th. She did test positive for heartworms so we started her on the Doxycycline and the monthly heartworm preventive. She will receive her vaccinations and micro-chipping when she is spayed, and then she will be ready for her forever home.\n\nIf interested in Daphne our application can be found at www.homesfurhounds.com. She is located in Williamsburg.",

She was clean and well cared-for. But the shelter is no place for a dog who's been used to being part of a family!\n\nWhen her family didn't come for Flora, we rescued her from the shelter and took her up to our trainer. Flora was initially quite shy--she needs to get used to new things--but ultimately got along great with cats and kids!! (Our trainer is waiting to assess her with other dogs.)\n\nFlora is playful and loves retrieving the tennis ball and going on leash walks with her human. She is learning leash manners and is proving to be a quick study.\n\nFlora is between 3-4 years old, and weighs 68 lbs. Though she is definitely coming out of her shell, she would love a family who will go slow with her and let her get used to a new situation.",

You can still adopt me, but the cost of the treatment will become your responsibility, ODHS always recommends you contact a vet to price this treatment if you are interested in adopting me beforehand.\n-I am Ehrlichia and Lyme positive. Treatment is 28 days of doxcycyline (an inexpensive antibiotic). The adopter is responsible for treatment of the dog. ODHS does not pay for this treatment. \n\nHi my name is Patriot! I\u2019m 2 years old and about 44 lbs! I\u2019m still learning about walking on my leash, but I love car rides, cuddles, and humans who give me love and attention. I do well in my crate when my foster is at work and I play well with the resident dogs.\n\nYou can come adopt me or even join our foster program to help the humans learn all the awesome things about new dogs like me! Learn more on our website! \n\nHope to see you soon! \n\nWhat breed am I? Mixed mutt! ODHS does not breed label (unless there\u2019s official paperwork), as studies show it is nearly impossible to tell the exact breed of each dog based off of their appearance.\n\nEducational articles:\n3/3/3 Rule;\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturdays. \nOur adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience.  Currently, the average timeframe for a response to your application is 1 week.\n\nLike us on Facebook \"Old Dominion Humane Society\"\nand be a part of promoting forever homes for dogs in need.\n#Adopt #Donate #Foster #Volunteer \n\nNote: ODHS only adopts to Virginia and surrounding states (including D.C.).

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please download and complete an Adoption Questionnaire from our website and email US at barbarak@k-9lifesavers.org\nYou can learn about the adoption process and find a Word, PDF and ONLINE version of the questionnaire by visiting: http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/howtoadopt/.\nDog's Name: Marshall\nEstimated Breed : Pointer Mix\nApproximate Age: 1 year\nApproximate Weight: approx. 48 lbs\nCurrently Living at: Boarding\nAdoption Fee: $300\nDOG'S DESCRIPTION\nMarshall is an energetic, happy boy looking for a forever home. He loves kids and other dogs, and loves to play in the yard. Because of his energy level, an apartment will not suit him. Will you give Marshall a loving home and family to call his own?\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

You wouldn\u2019t believe how many times we run into this situation.  We honestly don\u2019t understand how this becomes the only option for some people, but it does.\n\nJasper needs an experienced owner and preferably, a young and active family.  She is young and energetic, and needs training.  It\u2019s a good thing any dog adoption from ARC includes for free sessions with a certified canine trainer!  Yes, it\u2019s true!  We\u2019ll even provide expert training for your new pet! \n\nWhy not come out and meet this beauty today\u2026\n\nMy ideal home:\nA young, active and energetic home is what I need!\nI'm good with:\nMost Other Dogs Cats Older Children Men Women\nI'm not good with:\nYoung Children\n\nBirth date April 2020\n\n",

I'm an one year old Husky mix who'll steal your heart at first sight with my dazzling blue eyes and snow white coat. I'm both potty and crate trained, and respond pretty well to basic obedience commands-\"sit\", \"come\", \"paw\". You'll find that I'm a perfect companion! On those chilling days, I'll bright your mornings with sweet little kisses, and patiently wait for the opportunity to seat by your side and cuddle. And if you're up for an adventure, I bring plenty of energy-but nothing out of the extraordinary for a pup at my age that can't be easily managed with regular exercise. You can count on me to go on long walks, hiking trips or any other outdoor activities-sniffing is my thing! Love belly rubs, playing with other dogs, and chewing my bone. I don't bark, guard my toys or food, nor growl or give a stink eye. If you already have another dog, rest assure that I'll be a good brother.\n\nJust ask you to please be a bit patient and consistent with me as I can be stubborn sometimes and don't respond to commands right away (sorry, it's in my nature!). I get anxious when I'm alone by myself, and tend to gulp my food as fast as I can, but those are all littles things that I learned after spending too much time at the shelter. Your love will help me make those insecurity traits go away in a heart beat! Go to BAYAREASIBERIAN.org for contact information on the foster dog.",

I'm a little shy/nervous when I meet new people. I've met some kids and I do best with kids that are older and quieter. I love playing with toys and using my nose to sniff all the interesting smells I find on a walk. I'm looking forward to meeting my new family soon!\n\nDOB: 11/5/16\n\n\nMeet-Your-Match Canine-ality color is: Orange-Busy Bee\nFor safety's sake, we are looking for homes with physical fenced areas.\nPlease fill out our online adoption survey at www.mackenzies.info",

I am being evaluated for hip pain in my right hind leg, waiting to see if I will need surgery. I would like to go to a home that is more calm, so I can relax and keep my stress levels down. I am the most happy and sweet girl you will ever meet. I love the snow and I love my toys! I am a huge fan of cuddles and will never leave your side! I do good with other dogs, I just need them to give me my space if they are around so I do not extend my injury further. If you think your home would be a good space for me to heal, please give the shelter a call and come meet me! I am micro-chipped, vaccinated, and spayed.",

She knows commands including sit, stay, down, and shake. She loves a comfy chair, her crate and car rides. Lacey is a great companion with a sweet disposition and will thrive in a loving home. She would love a yard and a family who can take her on a few walks a day. If you are interested in meeting Lacey, please email edillon@aawl.org.\n\nI'm Beemer's Buddy!

She is spayed, micro-chipped, vaccinated and heartworm negative. She is good with other respectful dogs. She is a little too interested in cats. She is crate trained and housebroken. We do not know Baileys breed(s). She sheds (wire top coat and soft undercoat), is vocal likes to talk to you and has some terrier tendencies but also some husky tendencies. \n\nBailys ideal home would be with an owner who loves to go on walks and hikes. Bailey has great leash skills. She would love to have an owner who likes to work in their yard and garden. Bailey LOVES being outside. Baily is sweet. She likes things calm so no kids in the home. \n\nBailey requires a home with a fenced yard (chain link, wrought iron or privacy fencing). Rock walls or tree lines are not acceptable forms of fencing. Invisible (electric) fencing is not acceptable. We do not adopt out to homes with invisible (electric) fences. Applications received that do not meet our fencing guidelines will not be considered.\n\nPotential adopters must be over the age of 25 and live within a 25-mile radius of Peachtree City, GA. Other locations will be considered on a case-by-case basis depending on the availability of a home visit.\n\nLink to our adoption process (includes information on fees):\nhttps://houndsinpounds.com/process/\n\nLink to our application:\nhttps://petstablished.com/adoption_form/24581/generic",

            "description": "Everyone meet Festive/Rein! She is a playful, energetic, beautiful pup who we believe to be about a year old. She would do best in a family with lots of energy and preferably other dogs. Rein has lots of energy but is as sweet and gentle as they come. She would benefit from some training but overall is well behaved and picks things up quickly. She is almost fully potty trained and sleeps well in her crate at night. Reinis a bit timid of people, but is a total sweetheart who will lavish you with love. She does seem to have a bit of a prey drive- squirrels are her favorite! She does seem to get along fine with her kitty foster brother though (though she can be curious at times ). She is light heartworm positive, which the rescue will be responsible for her treatment. The rescue is considering slow-kill heartworm treatment for her and the adopter would need to commit to her medical follow ups and following the heartworm protocol.",

            "description": "Sweet Zeena is looking for her forever home! She is a 3yr old Chihuahua mix that weighs 10lbs and is full grown. Zeena came to us due to her owners not being able to care for her medically. After being in labor over 24 hours with a puppy stuck, she was surrendered to AZSDR where we rushed her to the emergency vet so she could have a C-section. She unfortunately lost all three of her puppies. AZSDR was quick to provide her with all the medical care she needed, and she has healed in a loving foster home. Now she is ready to find her forever home! Zeena's favorite activities are long walks and cuddling in her person's lap. This smart girl is potty trained, leash trained and enjoys rides in the car. Zeena likes to sleep in bed with her human. Zeena is learning to trust again and may be somewhat owner possessive. She is also chatty when she meets new people but is won over with pets and cuddles. Zeena is dog selective and needs to meet any other dogs in the home, preferably smaller quiet ones. She would also enjoy being the only spoiled doggie in the home.\n\nZeena has lived with cats before and has done well with them.\n\nShe is an escape artist and is known to dart through open doors so no apartments as she will keep running. Zeena also has some dermal cysts on her head which are not dangerous to her, the result of a dog attack three years ago but a vet was never seen for this until now. Zeena is the biggest sweetheart searching for a home where she can be safe and feel loved.\n\nShe is spayed and\n\nup to date on vaccines, microchipped and vet checked. H\n\ner\n\nadoption fee of $\n\n350\n\nincludes a\n\ncomplimentary\n\nvet visit.\n\nPlease email\n\nkim@chemkim.com\n\nfor more information about adopting this sweetie.\n\n--Covid update: To adhere to CDC guidelines, we are open for adoptions only at a max capacity of 15 people in the building at a time. Masks/face coverings are required. For the safety of our staff and customers, we ask that you practice social distancing, sanitization, and if exposed to Covid-19 or sick to please stay home.--\n\n***Visit our website or facebook page for special events schedules!***\n\nWebsite:\nwww.azsmalldog.org /\n\nFacebook:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/arizonasmalldogrescue/",

They are just delightful and can settle down and like to cuddle some as individuals and sit quietly when you rub their\nears...very sweet. \n\nThe adoption fee includes a training program that adopters will agree to participate in.  \n\nPlease complete an application on our website to set up an appointment to meet these little rascals.    www.adoptmountainpets.org\n\nAdopters will be considered on the totality of the application and how it matches the particular pet's needs.\n\nMost dogs who come from the shelter will not be house trained.\n\nWe do not know or make guarantees that a dog or cat will do well with all children, other animals or is house-trained.\n\nWe will need to talk to all of the adults in the home prior to making an appointment to visit with a pet. \n\nIn most cases its necessary to to have family dogs come into meet your potential adoptee.

She is taking medication and is prohibited from aerobic activity for 30 days while her leg continues to heal. She does not require crate rest and normal walking and activity is fine.\n\nYou are in for a treat with Belarus! This girl loves affection, treats, and you! A perfect day for her would be playing with the ball or learning a new trick. As long as it's with you, she will be happy!\n\nBelarus ended up at a small rural shelter with an injured left front leg, this adorable and sweet girl was in pain and needed some help. The team at the shelter has no vet care available at the shelter so they reached out to rescue to help this cutie pie get the medical attention she needs and recover in a warm loving foster home. Her foster mom saw her worried face and knew she had to help.\n\nBelarus is a fawn spayed female Shepherd mix that is 2 years old and weighs 39 pounds.\n\nShe is a sweet, affectionate, and playful girl that gets along with everyone, kids included, loves other dogs, and is nice to cats.\n\nBelarus is looking for a loving family with home that can provide lots of snuggles and cuddles and some limited exercise and no aerobic activity for 30 days for her leg to continue to heal.\n\nThe leg doesn't slow her down one bit so she needs someone to lovingly monitor her activity and make sure she gets plenty of rest too!\n\nShe walks great on a leash and loves to go on car ride adventures, and sleeps with her favorite toy, frequently with all four feet in the air.\n\nBelarus is crate and house trained.\n\nIf you think you might be the family where this little girl would fit right in forever on her road to recovery, please complete an application on our website and her foster mom will be in touch.\n\nBelarus is spayed, UTD on vaccinations, Heartworm Negative and Micro Chipped.\n\nHer leg treatment is covered by LHS.\n\nPlease apply at: http://legacyhumanesociety.org/adoptfoster/adoption-application/\nWe do not have a facility to house the dogs in our program. They are all kept in foster homes until they are adopted. Therefore, if you are interested in adopting from LHS, please complete an online application at http://legacyhumanesociety.org/adoptfoster/adoption-application/ and we will contact you asap about the status of your application.",

            "description": "Oh sweet, sweet Nelly! The first word that comes to mind for Nelly is PUPPY! She is a boxer/lab mix and is about 5 months old and weighs 40 lbs. Nelly is as friendly as can be. She's so excited when her people come home and gallops around like a baby horse. She loves snuggling up next to you or getting some scratches behind the ear. She is doing well with kennel training and sleeps through the night. Potty training is going great too, but she will appreciate your patience as she is young and still learning the rules. Nelly loves people and other dogs. We're not sure about kids or cats, but we guess that she'd do well. A fenced yard is required as she loves to run around and play. She is spayed and up to date on her shots. Nelly is ready to join your family and share her happy face with you everyday. Nelly\n's adoption fee is $250. All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. This dog is fostered in Hays, KS and adopter must drive to pick up. We do not ship or deliver. We do allow out of state adoptions, however qualified in state applications will be given preference. Please Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. To learn about Hands of Hope Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at HandsofHopeRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

They have been well taken care of and unfortunately, their human just doesn't have enough time in the day to be able to give them what that human feels is necessary for them. The dogs have a bond like no other and they compliment eachother so nicely and we would like to prevent them from having to be separated. They would do great in a home with a fenced in backyard.\u00a0 They love being outdoors! They are good with other dogs and with children. They have not been around cats.

She is still learning how to sit, but with the right family, she will learn quickly! She loves to run around and play, so a home with children will not be an issue for her. Unfortunately, Buttercup has tested positive for heartworms, but her heartworm treatment is a part of her adoption fee of $100, which would generally cost you over $1,000 to treat. You can't beat that! If you are interested in a dog such as Buttercup, come stop by the Pet Center today!",

Ruby is great on a leash but a little leery of other humans and dogs shemeets along the way. She doesn't bark, but prefers to have some distance. Ruby is hoping to find a forever home that will give her love, a warm and cozy place to settle in and take nice walks. If you are interested in Ruby please complete an application\n\nwww.lowridersofthewest.org\n\nRuby\u2019s adoption fee is $375.

            "description": "What\u2019s better than a sweet old Bluetick Coon Hound? Bosley is one fine man weighing in at 90lbs! He is a lover of people and other dogs. He might steal your toy but we will never fight him for it! His favorite toy here is his teddy bear. Bosley has blastomycosis, a fungal disease that will take about three months to cure. He is also heartworm positive and will take about six month to rid of them. Since this sweet old man has a slow course of action for both heartworm and fungal disease, he will need to go to a home with a foster who is willing to keep up his treatments. After he is given a clean bill of health he will be able to be neutered. Heartworm and Blastomycosis are rarely transferred to other pets in the home as long as they are on proper prevention. Who wouldn\u2019t want a big hunk-o-love like Bosley to keep them warm at night? \n\nAll potential Forever Fosters must reside within 100 miles of Mt Juliet, TN. All Forever Fosters dogs will have any medical expenses paid for by the sanctuary for the duration of their lives.\n\nTo fill out a Forever Foster application, please visit our website at ofsds.org",

My name is Tango and I am a \nneutered male Boxer about 7 yrs old and I weigh 62 lbs. I've been here several days and my owner hasn't come. I'll just go ahead and let you know I am heartworm positive.....I had all my toes crossed waiting on results to come back but....I feel pretty good though...no coughing or apparent health issues for now but it sure would be nice to find my forever home and someone who wouldn't mind helping me get treated. I'm a pretty sweet guy, quiet, laid back and get along well with other dogs. I'm just an older guy that needs a kind heart, a warm blanket and a family to call mine. If my owners don't come I will be available 1/26/21.  Adopting a dog from the Conway Animal Welfare Unit is a fairly easy process. The first step to adopting an animal is submitting an application. The application allows us to individually consider applicants and helps us to properly match our pets with new owners. We want to make sure that our pets are going to homes that are ready to provide for these pets long-term. Adoptions are $50 and this includes vaccinations, heartworm test, spay/neuter and microchip. As with any shelter animal, health is not guaranteed but we do our best to screen out those animals that are showing obvious signs of illness or disclose that information prior to adoption. All dogs are heartworm tested upon adoption. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting a dog and you reside OUTSIDE the city limits of Conway and the dog is less than 12 wks old, the cost is $75 which includes a spay/neuter and micropchip. The spay and neuter can only be performed at Vilonia Vet Clinic or Companion Animal Spay/Neuter Clinic. If the animal is less that 12 wks and you live inside the city limits the adoption fee is $25 dollars and you receive a voucher for $120 to use at select clinics for spay/neuter. The other option is that you provide us with proof of a pre-paid spay or neuter at YOUR vet of choice.",

This 10 year old baby was absolutely terrified in the shelter. He his in the corner and was fearful of all the noises.  But, from the moment he left that shelter, he has been nothing but hugs, love, and an absolute doll. He has done great with other dogs, and is loving life with his foster. We are currently working on his skin and helping heal his leg. \n\nJon Boy is going to make an AMAZING addition to someone\u2019s family. He also has the cutest little trot you have ever seen. This is not a senior that is limping around. He is happy, loving, and is ready to spend his Golden years with a person looking to receive as much love as they are willing to give. \n\nThanks for considering a Cane Rosso Rescue dog! \nWe place dogs mostly in Texas but have adopted out a few out-of-state as well.\n \nIf you are interested in one of our dogs, please first complete our adoption application.\nYou can find it at https://www.canerossorescue.org/adoption-application . His adoption fee is $150 plus tax. Our dogs are spayed or neutered, microchipped, vaccinated and heartworm tested and treated (if tested positive) before going to a new home.

He was born with heterochromia iridum, meaning he has two different colored eyes! He is truly a beautiful dog.\n\nHe is a very friendly dog and would love to find his furever people. He walks well on a leash and seems like he knows a few commands, so he would benefit from some training once settled into his home. \n\nClyde is a typical hound; loud and proud! He will let you know what's up. He mostly keeps his kennel clean, but may need a refresher on housetraining and manners. \n\nClyde loves toys, but we are not sure about other dogs. He would do best in an adult only household. He is a medium-high energy dog so someone with experience or looking for a dog to take on long walks or hikes would be best!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Clyde, please submit an application and we will be in touch to set up a meeting.

I'm super wiggly and happy when I meet a friend, and I absolutely ADORE belly rubs!! I can be a little shy with strangers at first, but I warm up quickly and have lots of love to give! I'm friendly, playful, energetic, and I really love toys! I do fine with other dogs, and I'm good with the kiddos! If you're looking for a new addition to the family, a walking buddy, active playmate, couch potato...I can be all of the above! Come by & see me, I'm available now! Adopting a dog from the Conway Animal Welfare Unit is a fairly easy process. The first step to adopting an animal is submitting an application. The application allows us to individually consider applicants and helps us to properly match our pets with new owners. We want to make sure that our pets are going to homes that are ready to provide for these pets long-term. Adoptions are $50 and this includes vaccinations, heartworm test, spay/neuter and microchip. As with any shelter animal, health is not guaranteed but we do our best to screen out those animals that are showing obvious signs of illness or disclose that information prior to adoption. All dogs are heartworm tested upon adoption. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting a dog and you reside OUTSIDE the city limits of Conway and the dog is less than 12 wks old, the cost is $75 which includes a spay/neuter and micropchip. The spay and neuter can only be performed at Vilonia Vet Clinic or Companion Animal Spay/Neuter Clinic. If the animal is less that 12 wks and you live inside the city limits the adoption fee is $25 dollars and you receive a voucher for $120 to use at select clinics for spay/neuter. The other option is that you provide us with proof of a pre-paid spay or neuter at YOUR vet of choice.",

            "description": "Happy has been in our system since October 2020! He came in very sick but after months of rehabilitation and a wonderful foster, Happy is now up for adoption. Happy got his name due to his really happy personality and how rapidly he wags his tail. Happy is an intelligent pup. He loves to sit and snuggle on the couch with a nice blanket and the tv. He enjoys his food with a little chicken broth. Happy likes Milk Bones when he goes into his kennel for a bedtime snack. After he eats he has to go potty about 15 minutes after with a brisk walk. \n\nHappy likes bacon treats after he comes back inside. He likes ice in his water bowl to keep it cool. He is a great dog one on one. Happy loves to be spoiled and does not like to share the attention with other animals including dogs and cats. Happy would be great for someone who loves to explore but also loves to nap. Happy is now fixed, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, up to date on flea/tick/heartworm prevention, and has regularly seen our veterinarian. To meet Happy, please check out our online adoption survey at http://www.secondchancenorman.com/index.php?survey",

If you contact the rescue, you will not get a response as we do not have information on this animal.\n\nPlease note that we are unable to receive correspondence through Petfinder\u2019s system. Any messages sent through Petfinder or any buttons on this listing will unfortunately not reach us. \n\nARCBCR courtesy lists dogs for individual owners, other rescues, and shelters wishing to place their Border Collies or Border Collie-mixes themselves.\n \nThese dogs are NOT in the ARCBCR program.\n\nARCBCR does not warranty any of the information provided about the following dogs. Should any issues arise, ARCBCR will not be held responsible. Fees requested and policies may differ from ARCBCR.\n\nMeet Leo a two year old male (neutered), handsome Border Collie! Leo is an amazing dog, and has so much potential in the right home. He originally was placed as a service dog prospect, and has service dog training. He knows basic commands, is house trained, rides well in the car, is crate trained, does good for grooming, nails etc. He does not have any sound phobias that I have seen. He loves people, especially children! But, he does not do well with other intact male dogs. He wants to correct them for bad behaviors (like if they jump up on you), and that can lead to a fight. He does amazing with my mother's neutered male BC, and my female BC; as well as my three rescues. He does great with small dogs, he is very gentle and mindful around my senior chihuahua. In his last home, he was raised around a small maltese mix. He would do best in a home without cats, as I think he would most likely chase them.  \n\nLeo is located in Seagrove NC, if you would like more information about Leo please email hannahaileen67@gmail.com\n\n",

Dee knows how to sit and lay down; she also has been working on not jumping on people. She is very food motivated and is eager to please people. Once in a play yard, she loves to cuddle and play with toys, but her favorite game is the \"you can't catch me\" game. We do not believe she would escape and go out of her way to attack another dog, but we recommend she be an only pet.

Moving)\n(11/27/20) Adopted\n(11/22/20) Stray\nSex: Male\nAge: 3yr\nAltered: Yes\n\nMedical Observation: \n(11/22) Normal; tartar\n\nBehavior Observation: \n1/29 (Per Staff) -- Buster should probably be walked with a toy to keep his mouth occupied.\nI took Buster out for a walk and he was very easy to leash and bring out of the kennel. Once outside it was very different. He immediately latched onto the leash and started tugging, he refused to let go and would walk while tugging thinking it was a game. He calmed down after many minutes and walked with me past the the large dog runs into the larger parking lot. the whole time he was walking with his tail between his legs. He then proceeded to tug on the leash again and I led him up the stairs into the side entrance. He went into his kennel without a problem. I ended the interaction with a few treats.\n1/21 (Per Previous Owner) -- energetic, trained, loyal but aggression towards other animals. sweet to humans, house trained and knows commands. He knowns commands like sit, stay, paw, lay down, up, down. they were working on roll over. Needs a single pet home with a yard\n12/27/20 (Volunteer Eval)-- Kennel Presentation--Nervous--On bed on approach but gets up and comes to front of kennel when handler calls for him. Tense body but accepts treats and is leashed without issue. Steps into kennel without issue on return. Is stiff when removing leash but allows leash to be removed.\nLeash Skills--Pulls Moderately On Leash\nHandleability--Tense/Allows all handling--In run, allows handling all over with tense body. When handler is sitting down, will climb upper body into lap and pushes head against hand for pets but remains tense throughout interaction.\n12/17/20 (Per Owner) -- Big cuddle bug, hyper, and super excited to meet people. Does not get along with around animals(gets mouthy and nips them). Learns quickly. Sit, lay down, stay, shake, leave it, come\n11/24/20 (Per Staff) -- Took Buster to the meet and greet room with two potential fosters. Buster was very good at first, excited and wiggly. After about 10 minutes he started to get very overstimulated, jumpy and biting his leash. I attempted to pick up the leash and he would snap at the leash near my hand. I got a second leash, and as soon as I tried to leash him he jumped up and bit the new leash, pulled it from my hands and bit through it. I went to get a third leash--this time he snapped at the leash but I was able to leash him. He continued jumping up and snapping several times but then walked pretty well back to the kennel. \nWhen I went to return him to the kennel he went in easily but then bit the leash again. I attempted several times to remove it, tried to bribe him with treats, but every time I reached to pull it off his neck he would whip his head up to snap at the leash/my hand. Every time he jumped or snapped he was clearly just trying to get the leash, but he did end up snapping close to my hand a few times. I was unable to remove the third leash and left it in the kennel with him.\n11/23/20 (Per Staff) -- Nervous in kennel. Whale-eyeing at front of kennel, but sniffed my hand gently and allowed leashing. Exited and re-entered kennel easily. Pulls Moderately On Leash--Strong, may benefit from harness. Tense/Allows all handling--Remained nervous in run but allowed petting and would jump into my lap.\n11/22/20 (Per Vet Staff) -- Friendly; BAR\n11/22/20 (Per Finder) -- Friendly, loves attention, petting, playful and puppy like, has lots of energy, very strong on leash, was good with finder's cat\n\nBITE DETAILS:\n(1/21) Buster bit another dog in an altercation on 1/21/21, but did not bite any humans. No bite quarantine is required. \n(12/17/20) The resident cat was running into the bedroom and Buster started to chase. The adopter went to intervene to separate the two of them and Buster got mouthy. She was able to get the cat in the hamper, Buster bit both the hamper and the adopters left wrist in the process.

I am a very happy-go-lucky girl and I love just about everyone, including other dogs and cats. I haven't had the most stable or reliable home situation, and I am SO READY to settle in to my forever home. I am goofy and love to play and entertain, but I also love to snuggle and give kisses, too. I'd definitely appreciate a family that is around often but may also do okay if I have some animal friends to keep me company while my humans are at work. Please call the Humane Society of North Iowa at 641-423-6241 for more information.\n\nAdoption fee covers the following veterinarian\u00a0services: spay/neuter surgery, age appropriate\u00a0vaccinations, flea and dewormer treatment, feline leukemia/FIV test in cats, and heartworm test for dogs.",

I am close to 100lbs and sometimes I tend to forget that. I am from another shelter and wasn\u2019t getting much attention from adopters, so I am hoping I will here. I will need a home with kids over 12 years old as I can be grabby and a little possessive of my yummy valuables. I do walk well on leash despite my size and am pretty good about my potty habits! I know sit and will do so nicely. I will need a feline free home, but I didn\u2019t mind the other dog I met! We walked together like gentlemen and I pretty much kept to myself. Despite being a big ol' bear of a dog, I have a spring in my step and love to romp with toys. I also have a really cool tail that has grey stripes. Have room for a big guy like me? If so, ask to meet me, Conrad!",

            "description": "What a handsome fella! Vail is about 64 pounds, 2 years old and looks like a Great Pyrenees or Samoyed mix. He has been a wonderful dog inside the home, and an extra fluffy cuddle buddy. We rescued Vail from a Kentucky shelter where he was bound for euthanasia. The hustle and bustle of the city life hasnt been helping Vail decompress well. While at first he was excitedly greeting other dogs and people on walks, he has been growing more reactive to dogs. \n\nInside, he is an excellent dog who is gentle, very relaxed and loves to just lounge around by his people or on the sofa. We believe he would do really well in a quiet home, preferably with a yard that he can explore, and with no other dogs or cats. A calmer surrounding can definitely help him gain more confidence and work on his leash manners. \n\nWe know that in the right environment, with a savvy adopter, or foster to adopt home, Vail will make great strides! \n\nIf you think you\u2019re the right fit, have a home without other dogs or cats, and can open your heart and home to help Vail,\napply to adopt at rescuecity.nyc/adopt.\n\n\nWe are currently facilitating safe adoptions with COVID-19 protocols and adopt out to NYC and surrounding states only - NY CT PA & NJ. \n\n(We will consider other nearby states for adoption on a case by case basis. You must be willing to travel Brooklyn, NY to finalize the adoption.)\n\n**If a dog is listed on petfinder as available then we are still accepting applications for that dog. We urge you to apply as soon as possible to be considered to adopt the dog you\u2019re interested **\n\nThank you for wanting to give one of our adoptables a loving home! Please follow us on Instagram at @rescuecity for more adoptable updates!\n",

I am completely housebroken, crate trained, and walk great on leash. I am dog friendly, but prefer dog friends that match my mellow energy. I haven't been able to meet cats just yet, so I'm not sure if we would be a good match. I am also currently going through heartworm treatment. This means I can only go for short walks, but I still manage to make lots of people friends. Sometimes I will let out a little bark to say hi and let them know I am there! So... *woof* are you my forever family?",

I was surrendered here because my family couldn\u2019t provide care for me anymore. I LOVE people and am super affectionate. I\u2019ll jump in your lap and drench you in kisses. I can be unsure of some handling and fearful to loud noises, so kids over 8 years old is recommended. Toys are my favorite and I will even bring them back for you to throw! We could have A LOT of fun together I think. I am not a fan of cats and can be scared of other dogs. I met a larger dog here and I was scared, but after a little while of hanging out together I would sniff him when he wasn\u2019t looking. I think a calmer dog friend would be best for me as I didn\u2019t really want to be bothered. I also am plenty of pup to be your one and only! That\u2019s all for now folks!",

They have received SO many applications since COVID began that it\u2019s been hard to keep up! So, they have temporarily taken all of us off Petfinder, Adopt a Pet, and the website while they catch up. We will be back soon! In the meantime, don\u2019t forget my name -  Demi!  If you're looking for a great dog, pick me! Pick me!\n\n\nIf you're within 250 miles of Lake Placid, NY, and would like to apply to adopt, please visit our website: https://www.joshuafundrescue.org/adoptioninfo\n ?? The Joshua Fund Dog Rescue is a registered 501c3 nonprofit organization. We are an all-volunteer organization and rely solely on donations to save dogs like this from high-kill shelters and put them in forever homes. Thank you for helping us save lives!",

She has some scars from her mom, but nonetheless she loves to love! She has done great with everyone she's met and loves to snuggle! She has a lot of energy, but once she's tired out, she just wants to be curled up at your feet or in your lap! Due to her playful, easy-going, and sweet temperament, our staff thinks she'd be great with an active family! Spot would make a great companion for any family, and has previously lived with kids of all ages.\n\nIf interested in adopting Spot, please submit an online adoption application! Due to COVID-19, all animal meetings must be scheduled by appointment. Once we receive and review your application, we will contact you to schedule an appointment. Thank you!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.German Shepherd dogs, as well as the other herding breeds that we have in rescue, are highly active, energetic, working breeds. They require considerable vetting, exercise, socialization, training, leadership and mental stimuli in order to be well-adjusted, well-balanced, and well-mannered dogs. Even if you exercise and play with your dog daily in your fenced yard, you MUST still take your dog out on daily walks and outings in order to work on his/her leash skills, manners, and social skills. These breeds make great additions to active families who will pamper them, but who will also work with them, as they are smart dogs who need leadership, structure, plenty of activity and mental stimulation. If you are new to German Shepherds (and other herding breeds), please research the breed to make sure this is the dog for you. We ask that you consider the time and financial commitment that your German Shepherd (or other herding breed) dog will require before applying for one. Please review the section on our website (www.heartlandgsrescue.org) 'Is a HUGS Dog Right for You?' for additional information.Dutchess is an adorable girl, full of personality, who was rescued from a reservation in South Dakota when she was a tiny puppy. She can be a little sassy but always charming with her big puppy eyes. She is almost 4 years old. Dutchess is around 55 lbs with a beautiful, fluffy coat. She loves toys and treats. She likes to playwrestle and chase and will occasionally get the zoomies. Dutchess loves to go out on walks and explore she is a curious dog so will want to sniff everything that comes across her. She walks well and doesn't pull.\nDutchess needs to be an only dog, with no young kids (no exceptions, please). She needs time to warm up to people. But once that happens, she will love you and ultimately take over your lap, watch movies and will gladly sleep next to you all night.\nThe adoption fee for Dutchess is $225, all of which goes back into offseting our high-cost vetting expenses and rescuing more dogs. We are a 100% volunteer-run rescue group and rely on adoption fees and donations to continue saving lives. Adoption fees include spay/neuter, current on age-appropriate vaccinations, fecal, deworming, flea/tick and heartworm preventative, heartworm tested if old enough (and treated if positive), and microchipped. Please visit http://heartlandgsrescue.rescuegroups.org/info/adoption for more information about our adoption process and requirements, and to apply. Like any of our dogs, Dutchess would make a great addition to an active home that will provide the love, structure, good leadership, activity and mental stimulation that her breed needs. Because of that, Dutchess's ideal owners will have prior GSD, or other herding breed experience. Even if you exercise and play with your dog daily in your fenced yard, please remember that you MUST still take your dog out on daily walks and outings, in order to provide sufficient stimulation, ward off boredom, and work on leash skills, and manners.Please review the information in the 'About Us', 'Important Considerations' and 'Adopt' sections on our website menu, as it contains useful information about the breed, adoption fees, the adoption process and our requirements, and how meeting the dogs works. 2/2/21 1:19 PM",

She was surrendered by a family who could  not afford to get her the medical care she desperately needed, since she had a horrible case of demodex mange.  With a lot of medical care and TLC, Leah is now ready to find a forever home.  This girl is so friendly and loves everyone she meets.  She has a lot of energy and would make a wonderful exercising companion.  She is very smart and has already learned some commands, she will focus and wants to learn.  She gets along well with other dogs, cats and even does ok with the chickens in her foster home.    \n\n\nAdoption fees cover age specific vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip, heartworm/lyme/ehrlichia test, worming and transport fees. \n\nAdoption fees: \nThrough 6 months of age $450; \n7 months to through 5 years $400; \n6 years and under 9 years $325: bonded pairs are $500; \n9 years and older $250: bonded pairs are $300 \n\nFOR PUPPIES: PLEASE READ!!\nHomes considering Puppies must be prepared for:\nFlexible Schedules for Potty Training.

Supervision with Children and Obedience training. \nSocialization; both with new people, children and other dogs outside of the home.\nHomes that want a well behaved dog, must be prepared to put the time, effort and costs associated to train a puppy. Well behaved dogs are not born, they are trained!  Please do not apply for a puppy if you cannot or do not have the time for a puppy.\n\nAlmost Home Rescue of New England is a 501 c 3 non-profit rescue; rescuing dogs since 2005.

She\u2019s about 7 months old and 35 pounds...To think she had been let down by humans in the past and still has so much love to give to anyone receptive to it. Hazelnut is SO SNUGGLY. Her foster mom says she is very affectionate and relaxed around people. She is a bit frightened of other dogs on walks but really wants to play and loves exploring outside. Hazelnut has lots of energy and is still working on her puppy mouthiness so would prefer a home with older children, and an active family who will take her on long walks and hikes. She enjoys spending time in her crate and chewing on her toys. Belly rubs are the key to this girl\u2019s heart and she\u2019ll take any and all the love she can get from people. She would love a home with a big yard to play in and a family that will continue working on her socialization and training.\nShe would surely make an excellent jogging buddy too, with some leash work. Want to make Hazelnut a part of your home? \n\nApply to adopt at rescuecity.nyc/adopt! here.\u00a0\n\n\nWe are currently facilitating safe adoptions with COVID-19 protocols and adopt out to NYC and surrounding states only - NY CT PA & NJ. \n\n(We will consider other nearby states for adoption on a case by case basis. You must be willing to travel Brooklyn, NY to finalize the adoption.)\n\n**If a dog is listed on petfinder as available then we are still accepting applications for that dog. We urge you to apply as soon as possible to be considered to adopt the dog you\u2019re interested **\n\nThank you for wanting to give one of our adoptables a loving home! Please follow us on Instagram at @rescuecity for more adoptable updates!\n",

Sadly, she spent most of her young life chained in a backyard, but thankfully she's a BarkVille girl now and is being housebroken & crate trained while learning leash/house manners & basic commands in her wonderful foster home. She is a smart, curious, confident pup looking for a loving, forever home with a fenced yard, another dog to play with, and a person/family who will continue training her to be the best girl she can be. Her play style is full blown puppy so a home with older kids would be great until she learns not to jump around children. If you've been searching for an adorable, young, eager to please pup to be a loyal, devoted member of your family, then Karmen is the girl for you!\n\nFor more information about Karme, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org. If you would like to adopt this sweet girl, please submit an application for her at https://www.barkvilledogrescue.org/applications",

            "description": "Milagro / Female / 3 Years / 40 lbs / Street Mix / Toronto\n\nMeet Milagro! Milagro was rescued off the streets of Mexico when it was clear she had suffered a traumatic injury. Her front leg had an exposed fracture and she was suffering from necrosis of the surrounding tissue. The vets only option at that point was to amputate her leg. After undergoing extensive rehabilitation, Milagro has fully adapted to her new life. Once she was cleared to fly, she made the long trip to Canada in search of her forever home!\n\nOnce you are in her circle of trust, Milagro is a total love bug. She loves to be close to her people and will snuggle whenever she gets an opportunity. She is described as playful, excitable, loving, active, affectionate, loyal and curious. The perfect family for Milagro would be an active one who is looking for a perfect adventure companion!\n\nWhen meeting new people for the first time Milagro will bark and be visibly anxious if someone tries to approach before she is ready. If strangers stand at a distance, avoid eye contact and allow her to approach in her own time, she will do so gently. In order for her become more comfortable with strangers, her trusted humans must always advocate for her safety and space. It takes multiple meetings to earn her trust so adopters should have realistic expectations when meeting her. She has not been tested with children but we predict she would do well with respectful children that are 10+. Adults will need to supervise in the beginning to ensure the children are cognizant of her body language and when she needs space.\n\nMilagro\u2019s fosters have been working diligently to create a successful crate schedule. She is high energy and needs to be encouraged to have calm or down time. She may take a few minutes to settle and it is best her humans are in view and allow her to settle before leaving her alone. She may chew on things when left without supervision so it is best she is left in a puppy proofed space.\n\nMilagro goes for three walks a day of varying duration. After a walk she still needs sufficient time to run around and play in the backyard. She requires a potty break at least every four hours to be successful. On leash she does well but will pull if she wants to do something. She does not like to to be approached by strange people or dogs while on leash. Given she receives adequate opportunities to use the washroom, she is fully potty trained.\n\nMilagro is very smart and eager to learn. She has already mastered sit, lie down, touch, come and relax. She is in the process of learning crate, place and leave it. Milagro will need additional obedience training and training in regards to her resource guarding. She tends to guard her toys the first few days in the home so she will require a structured environment.\n\nMilagro\u2019s ideal home would be a detached house, with a fully fenced back yard. She needs a secured space to get out her zoomies and run around outside. She is best suited for homes outside of the city, where she can work on her confidence building and focus while outside. Adopters should have some dog experience and have a solid understanding of her training and exercise needs. Milagro is nervous of dogs outside but did fine with them when she was living in the shelter. She would likely do well with another calm dog, granted proper introductions are made. Milagro has not been tested with cats.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Milagro please apply at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/adoption-info#adoption-form\n\nMilagro\u2019s adoption fee is $700.

They say big things come in small packages, and that's definitely me! I am a playful, cute little ball of fun. So far I have been enjoying the company of other dogs so I would potentially do well with another dog in a home. I would do best in an active home with a fenced yard (privacy fence is a plus) or where I can go on lots of leashed walks, since I am pretty active. If you'd like to make me your best pal, make sure to follow the link below, select \"large dogs\" and ask for Rogue! \n\nhttps://www.picktime.com/61eb69c2-2e72-47ff-bcf0-01e8ce01f1c5",

            "description": "Meet Chester! Chester is 4-5 years old, 50lb retriever mix. Chester has a very sad story - his owner died and a relative left Chester in the garage, only coming to feed and water him every few days for 2 years! Due to this, Chester had some anxiety when he first arrived in foster care and he always wants to be at his foster's feet! With a regular routine and structure, Chester is blossoming into a lovely dog. He is living with 5 other dogs of various sizes and gets along great with them. He has not yet learned how to play with other dogs but he loves toys and chew toys and playing fetch! He would also be happy as an only dog. Chester would prefer a quiet home with a fenced yard. He is a wanderer so a secure fence is a must. Chester loves attention and is eager for petting, he is housebroken and crate trained and ready to find his forever family! \n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $350 which includes routine vetting and spay/neuter. \n\nFor more information, please contact khasse@petconnectrescue.org\n**If you're viewing this on Petfinder, please visit www.petconnectrescue.org to complete our non-binding application.**",

Unfortunately, his loving owner of 2 years passed away and he was left homeless and was left outside. Thankfully friends from church reached out and were trying to do what was best for King and help him find a new home. He is more trusting of women versus men. We think he is mixed with Shar Pei. He may be prone to skin allergies which we are treating him for now.  King is a happy boy and doesn't seem bothered by others but will require a proper meet and greet with other dogs.  We have been told his favorite treats are carrots! We are not sure how he is with cats. For adoption, please fill out an adoption application at www.spcaeasttx.com!",

Kodi LOVES to play with other dogs, he's a very sweet boy who was an outdoor dog and is learning how to live inside.  He's mostly unsure of the inside of the house, but given how smart and young he is he will learn pretty quickly.  He lights up as soon as he goes in the backyard....he is bouncy and playful outside.  \n\nKodi definitely needs a home with a fully fenced in yard and a dog playmate would be amazing for him.  He weighs around 62 lbs.  \n\nwww.dogworldrescue.com/adopt \n\ncheck out his videos on our fb page:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Dog-World-Rescue-129693787057373\n\nOur adoption fee is $400 and paid directly to our vets office.  We are an all volunteer rescue \n",

He is so sweet but has that big dog of the house attitude.  He plays well with all his buds in the house.  He is curious and always seem to be in sight.  He is doing really well with potty training and crate training. He does sleep in a crate at night. \n\nChip will definitely make someone very happy!!   He will need a fenced yard and would do best with a dog buddy.  \n\nChip is neutered, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped.  The adoption fee is $175. \n\nIf you would like to adopt Chip, please apply at FYDRadopt.com!",

I would love to go home with a dog that can show me that the world is not so scary. I may do well with cats and my ideal home would be one that can exercise me daily.

Unfortunately that person became ill and couldn\u2019t care for Bruno. So Bruno grew up alone in a garage. Bruno was undersocialized. He only knew walls of his confinement as safe. The family was set to euthanize Bruno and that\u2019s when we intervened.\nBruno went straight into board and train with our trainers at See Spot Run and has come SO FAR. He\u2019s a dog who loves to dog! Leash training is on point. Fetch is fun and even more fun to not bring back the ball. Bruno has a new list for life and loves to learn. He\u2019s looking for an adult only household that understands overcoming a past, loving the present, while ready to have nothing but success in the future. Bruno would love a active household motivated in learning the world together.\n\nAnimals can be viewed by appointment only. We ask that you review our adoption information AND fill out an adoption application prior to setting an appointment so we have all your information and you understand our adoption procedures - you can do so online here.     \n\nPlease feel free to email us or call us anytime for additional information on any of our animals - info@mcprescue.org or 312-388-3928. Our typical adoption fee varies based on the age of the dog at the time of rescue: Under the age of 1 years old is $500; 1-5 years old is $400; over the age of 5 is $300. Fees include vaccinations, microchip, deworming and other vetting as needed. Our adoption process includes an application, reference check and home visit.",

Nyla has kennel cough and it is recommended that she be the only pet. A foster/foster to adopt must administer medication, and bring her to the shelter for wellness checks.\n\nWe ensure all of the animals adopted through our shelter are vaccinated, microchipped, and spayed or neutered.\n\nIf you love animals but cannot adopt, sponsoring an animal in our care is a meaningful way to help support the good work we do. For as little as $20 per month, you can sponsor a shelter pet and help pay for the cost of their care while they stay at the shelter. Secure your sponsorship online at njshelter.org.\n",

Tater definitely define \"cute puppy\".  He is so sweet but has that big dog of the house attitude.  He plays well with all his buds in the house.  He is curious and always seem to be in sight.  He is doing really well with potty training and crate training. He does sleep in a crate at night. \n\nTater will definitely make someone very happy!!   He will need a fenced yard and would do best with a dog buddy.  \n\nTater is neutered, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped.  The adoption fee is $175. \n\nIf you would like to adopt Tater, please apply at FYDRadopt.com!",

            "description": "Chester is looking for a hero! This cheerful guy seems to have a bright, curious mind and a playful spirit. He is active and eager to join you in all sorts of fun! Unfortunately, he seems to have been dealt a rough hand in life and arrived at the kennel heartworm positive, and with some symptoms that indicate it could be somewhat advanced. Friends of CITY DOGS Cleveland will cover the cost of treatment, but Chester needs a home where he can relax and recover! He'll be treated with a slower, more gradual method than usual and so may need to be on restricted activity for some months. This is a great opportunity for watching some Netflix together on the couch, and exploring all sorts of basic training, food puzzles, and more! While Chester is a fairly lively boy, we think once he settles into his new home he'll be quite content to spend lots of time snuggling. Chester is around 5 years old and weighs 64 lbs.\n\nPlease visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog to set up a meet and greet and find out more!\nDue to COVID-19, CITY DOGS is currently doing adoptions by APPOINTMENT ONLY. Please visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog to request a meet and greet! \n\nQuestions? Email: citydogs@city.cleveland.oh.us | Call: (216) 664-3476\nVisit: 9203 Detroit Avenue Cleveland, OH 44102\n\nHours:\n10 AM - 3 PM Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday\n10 AM - 6 pm Tuesday & Thursday\n\nFee: $61 | Includes spay/neuter, shots, microchip, license, 30 days free pet insurance (when registered upon adoption)\n\nThe CITY DOGS mission is to increase adoptions from the City Kennel by changing the image of the pit bulls who make up the majority of the kennel population, by preparing all adoptable dogs in the kennel for lives in loving homes and by creating as many opportunities as possible for the public to meet and get to know our dogs for the terrific pets they are meant to be.\n\nOur Adoption Process...\nHere's a little about how things work:\nAll of the CITY DOGS posted for adoption are available for direct adoption from the kennel, unless noted otherwise. You must schedule a meet with a dog in advance - we are not currently accepting walk-ins. Please look online first to see if there are any dogs you think would be a good fit for your home before scheduling a meet. To get the process started, visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog and fill out the form. One of our adoption counselors will get in touch to schedule and confirm your meet! At the kennel, an adoption counselor will introduce you and your family to the adoptable dogs, share information we know about them, and discuss our suggested ways for successfully integrating a new dog into your home. You are welcome to meet multiple dogs. If the dog you adopt is already fixed, he or she may leave with you that day - otherwise, the dog can go home after receiving the spay or neuter surgery.)\n\nAbout Our Dogs: All available dogs have gone through a behavioral and medical assessment. This assessment is a snapshot of who the dog is at that given time. We cannot make any guarantees with regard to behavior, temperament or health of any City Dog once they are in the home. Most of our dogs are picked up as strays, so we do not know what kind of home environment they were living in (i.e. with kids, other dogs or other cats), nor do we know if most of them are house trained. Everything we know about them is based on volunteer and staff observations. We do have some dogs in foster homes, where they will have more information about how the dog is in a home environment. It is very hard to tell with certainty whether or not a dog will be good with kids, cats or another dog. If you have kids in the home or another dog, we do require that they be present for a meet and greet with the dog you are considering for adoption.\n\nHeath/Vaccinations: Dogs that are adopted directly from the kennel need to go to your personal vet within two weeks of leaving the kennel. All dogs receive their DAPPL, Rabies, and Bordatella vaccines, though you may be required to get follow up boosters. All dogs come microchipped and with a Cuyahoga County license.?  \n\n\n\n \n",

He will need a patient and loving home who wants a dog that will be their Best Friend and loyal companion. Marvel would do best in a home with no small children. He is nervous around loud, active dogs but would probably be ok with other calm dogs like he is. Marvel walks well on a leash and truly just wants to be a couch potato. He is Neutered, Vaccinated and Heartworm Negative. He loves his crate. You can adopt this Precious boy for $85. He currently weighs 46 pounds. We found out that a 6 foot chain link fence won't keep him in so he will need a privacy fence and he shouldn't be left unattended in a yard.",

            "description": "Saul is a senior chihuahua or chihuahua mix. He\u2019s estimated to be 10 years old and weighs 5.8 pounds. According to his foster, \u201cSaul wants nothing more than to be near you at all times. Nothing makes him happier. But he also knows how to occupy himself on his designated comfy spot if you\u2019re busy. He will come running when he sees you sit down though because that\u2019s his most favorite thing! He will even let you carry him around and since he is so tiny, one hand will do so you can still get things done around the house. He LOVES to hide under blankets and chase small toys across the floor...especially ones that squeak.\u201d Saul does have some quirks that would make him do best in a home without children, but he gets along fine with other dogs and cats. To adopt a tiny new best friend, apply at ITVrescue.org.\n\nAll of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heartworm tested and treated if necessary.\n\nPlease realize that many of our animals are kept in foster homes. Please complete an adoption application at http://itvrescue.org/adoption-application/ in order to meet with one of our animals. There is no obligation in completing the application, but it helps us find an animal that is most appropriate for your family.  The ITV Rescue Center is open Tuesdays 12-5; Wednesdays 12-7; Thursdays 12-5; Fridays 12-5 and Saturdays 10-5.  The Rescue Center is located at 1417 N. Stockwell Road.  You are welcome to come to our rescue center during open hours to see all of our great adoptable animals. Thank you for your interest in our animals!\n\nNOTE: Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

He is also good with other dogs that he has met.\nSimba is in a foster home with school aged children that he does well with.\nPlease consider making this handsome boy a member of your family. As we are a foster based rescue, we do require a completed application to be submitted before we arrange a meet. This can be found on our website at : https://almosthomepetrescue.org/apply-now-1\n$150 adoption fee includes core vaccinations, rabies vaccination, heart worm test (in dogs over 6 months of age), microchip and registration, spay/neuter, wormer and flea and heart worm prevention while the dog is in our care.

He's still quite small, however, at about 10 lbs.\n\nRaz is still learning how to be a pet dog, so he is not yet available. He is a quiet dog but he harasses cats and challenges many male dogs. We recommend he is either an only dog or paired with a female. \n\nHe is not suitable for a house with kids at all \u2014 that includes visiting grandkids. \n\n?He is a loving dog who wants to be with his people. He loves to snuggle and get belly rubs. He is not fond of going outside, even in warmer winter weather so he needs to learn how fun a yard can be.\n\nRaz's forever person will need to be an EXPERIENCED dog owner who can put him in his place and continue his training. No exceptions.?\n\n?",

Izzie is with her owner, she's in Ohio, about an hour east of Athens, Ohio.\n\nIZZIE MUST BE THE ONLY DOG in her new home and NO CHILDREN UNDER 14!\n\nBelow is what her owner writes:\n\nIzzie is a vaccinated, spayed, 5 year old female German Shepherd.\nShe is about 75lbs\nShe knows all of the basic commands plus 40-50 tricks. \nShe must be in a home without young children and other dogs... but she does love the teenagers. \nShe is extremely loyal and loving. She pretty much follows us wherever we go. She LOVES being outside and playing fetch and car rides oh and she LOVES swimming.\nShe is very in tune with how we're feeling. She likes to comfort us if she can sense we're upset or emotional. \nShe is just a very sweet girl that needs to be the baby in the house. \nShe needs a home because she isn't doing well with the 20 mos old toddler and there's a new 2 mos old now too.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this dog please fill out the adoption application: https://www.dogshope.com/adoption_application2.html\n",

            "description": "Please READ entire bio before inquiring on this sweet animal. Due to our large volume of mails we receive daily any email sent without proper information requested will NOT be returned.\n\nMeet El Luchador. He is approximately 12 years old and weighs 13 lb.  He is a great old man with a bit of a hearing issue and some cloudiness in his eyes but he gets around great.  He loves to go for car rides, go for walks and eat. He DOES NOT want to be picked up or anyone in his face or he will turn into El Luchador!!  Other then that he will follow you everywhere and loves to sleep with his foster mom.  NO CHILDREN!  He is looking for his forever home. Could it be with you?\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this sweetheart, please provide the following required information:\n\nYour vet\u2019s name and number, your current pet(s) names and if you plan on doing obedience training. When we call your vet and if your pet(s) are not up to date on vaccines, and spayed/neutered we will not be able to adopt to you. Once approved, we will set up a meet and greet with the animal to ensure a good fit. We do not adopt on the spot, and our animals are not on a first come, first serve basis. Please do not inquire on an adoptable animal if you are leaving on a vacation or are not wanting an animal for months and want us to hold the animal for you. We ONLY show dogs at our events that have been properly approved by administration and have APPOINTMENTS! NO EXCEPTIONS!\n\nAdoption fee $200.00\n\nIf you have provided all the necessary information and have set up a meet and greet, please join us for our adoption event on SATURDAY, February 6th from 12-2pm at The Tractor Supply Company in Washington Township.\n\nWe only accept cash or check payments for our adoptions. Thank you. Due to the current situation we are in with COVID-19, please wear a mask.\n\nTheir address is:\n\nTractor Supply Co.\n66143 Van Dyke Ave.\nWashington Township, MI 48095\n\nFido and Fluffy's Rescue, Inc. is a 501(c)3 rescue dedicated to re-homing abandoned animals from throughout the Mid West and Puerto Rico. Therefore, we can\u2019t guarantee the dog\u2019s breed or predict the full grown size or weight. We do our best to answer questions in a timely manner; however, some answers are unknown because we don\u2019t know. Although we usually deal with dogs and concentrate on rescuing chihuahuas, we are also able to take in cats, rabbits, reptiles, and other small animals from time to time.\n\nAll of our animals are seen by a veterinarian where they receive a wellness exam, age appropriate vaccines, are heartworm tested (treated if necessary) have a fecal check (treated if necessary), and are spayed/neutered before going to their fur-ever homes. Every animal is kept on monthly heartworm and flea/tic prevention and is professionally groomed!\n\nMost of our dogs have come from the streets, previous neglect and abusive situations, or we have no background information at all. The breed(s) listed for the adoptable animal is a guess. We can not guarantee the breed of the dog listed especially if it is a puppy it could grow up to be a variety of breeds or grow up to be a weight way over or under our guess. If you are looking for a particular breed it is best to adopt an adult animal so we can better tell what breed(s) it is.\n\nPlease be aware that we are primarily a small dog rescue and our dogs may not be potty trained. If you are looking for a small perfectly potty trained dog we can not guarantee it. Sometimes there is a lot of work needed to put into the rescue companion but it is so worth it!\n\nFido and Fluffy is a 100% volunteer foster based rescue. We don\u2019t have a facility or any paid employees. All our adoptable dogs are in foster homes. We adopt dogs by appointment only at the Washington Twp., Tractor Supply store.\n\nThank you for your support and understanding.\n\nRespectfully,\nFido & Fluffy's Rescue, Inc",

            "description": "Meet JingleBells & Gingerbread! This pair will remain small to medium since they're about 20 weeks and under 20 pounds. They will need a fenced yard to enjoy and are being adopted as a pair. We have no idea what mixes they are.\n\nThe last couple of weeks have been dedicated to saving GB's ears. That's right... these grid contraptions were intended to help us NOT have to crop his ears. We should know soon if they were successful but the hopes of all are VERY high.\n\nHere's the deal: JB&GB were once living as a litter of eight newborns. They contracted Parvo, mange, and everyone else died. Only these two survived. When they came to us, post mange and post Parvo, they had severe ear infections. Those caused them to violently scratch their ears to the point of causing hematomas. We surgically repaired them both but GB's ears wouldn't heal. Several trips back to the doctor and several surgeries later, grids were sewn onto his ears to keep them protected yet allow airflow to help them heal. He was a CHAMP through the entire ordeal. GB has now lived 5-6 weeks with a cone on. Yet, his gentle and loving spirit remains! JB, in addition to having her ears drained, also had her own emergency when her spay site opened and her insides began seeping out! Another emergency trip to the vet to correct that, and she was awarded her own cone-time for several weeks.\n\nTo say these dogs have been through the wringer is an understatement. They've survived more than any should have to yet they're sweet and loving and playful as can be. They also ADORE one another. They live for outside time, love to explore, wrestle - should enjoy that more soon when there's no signs of a cone impeding them - and really like being a part of a family. They're perfect with the two little girls helping them heal and play nicely with the resident doggies, too.\n\nWhile they're not QUITE ready to transition to their forever home - we want to be sure his ears are fully healed first - they ARE ready to interview potential families!\n\nApplications for JingleBells & GingerBread @ maxxandme.org\n\nJB & GB are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped. Their adoption donation is only $500! As with all puppies adopted through Maxx & Me, his adopter will need to commit to continue working with a positive reinforcement trainer of their choice to help him continue to become a well mannered and confident boy.\n\nTo meet any of our dogs please fill out an application on www.maxxandme.org.\n\nMaxx & Me is an all volunteer, all foster home rescue and do not have a shelter. Please allow at least 48 hours for applications to be processed (missing information may slow the process, so please take your time and be thoughtful in your answers). All dogs posted are available (so no need to ask). We place dogs based on best home for each dog and not order of applications received. Email us at maxxandmerescue@gmail.com for updates and questions. Thank you for choosing rescue.",

He has learned to behave with cats.\n\nWalter is excellent with well behaved children. We recommend older children who can behave predictably and gently. He is good with people but takes a while to warm up to new people.\n\nHe enjoys a walk but due to his partial disability he needs his feet protected. He is incontinent due to disc damage but this is readily managed with size 2 baby diapers or Male Wraps. Walter would make a great pet in a quiet home with his people around frequently.\n\nWill you open your hearts and home to this sweet boy? if so please complete the online application below:\n\nhttps://www.dachshundrescueoflosangeles.com/applications/adoption-application/",

During that time, other dogs attacked me. As you can imagine, that was really hard on me, and I am anxious about new situations.  Trusting others will take time, and GPRA volunteers are already helping me.  When I first met them, they gave me chicken treats and showed me lots of affection. WOW, that is really great stuff, and I definitely want more of that kind of life!\n\nBasically, I am a really good boy that needs time to learn how to be an inside dog, patience to teach me dog manners, and lots of love and hugs to build my trust.  In return, I will be your faithful companion and loyal guardian.\n\nLooking for brighter days and a family that will love me forever.\n\n\u2013 Zeus\nPlease email info@greatpyratlanta.com",

I am a very shy and sweet little girl who loves to lounge about all day and get tons of dog treats! Currently I can be quite timid and shy and would really need a family who would take the time to earn my trust and let me get use to them. I have warmed up some to the staff here and do get excited when it's time to go for my daily walks. I would do best in a home with no children just because the staff is unsure how I would react to them wanting to play and be very hands on. I also should be your only furry friend in the house since I\u2019m not too fond of cats or dogs. If you would like the opportunity to get to meet me fill out an online application today and we will see if we click! To see some of the other pets that we currently have available, check our Available Pet webpages on our website at www.HSCIpets.org.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Name: Echo\nAge: DOB 02/07/2011\nGender: Female\nBreed: Rottie\nWeight: 62\nDog friendly: Yes\nCat friendly: Dog Savvy can be ok!\nKid friendly: No\nHouse Trained: yes\nCrate Trained: yes\nEnergy level: Moderate\nHistory: Breeder Release\nAdoption Fee: $300.00\n\nFrom the Foster:\n\nEcho is a one of a kind senior lady with a lot of personality, and I've gotten to know very well over the last year and half while we saw her through some medical issues (please see below).\n\nFirst off, she needs to go to a home with NO KIDS. She does not appreciate their loud noises and sudden movements, and she will bark and lunge towards them if they are doing these things in her general vicinity. I really feel she would do best in a quieter household overall. Our house is very quiet/calm, and we rarely have people over.\n\nShe does fine in a crate but has also done fine uncrated and left in a room to free roam. She also has gone to work with me many times, and just sleeps all day under my desk. She is not crated at night, and sleeps on one of the many dog beds or occasionally on the couch or our bed.\n\nShe does not signal to go outside, but does great on a schedule, and she has not had any accidents in months. We have a fenced yard so she is mostly used to going off leash, but she has also gone while on leash but it will take her significantly more time to go. She is also a poop eater any chance she gets. On the plus side, while everyone else in MN complains about a poopy yard after the snow melts, yours will be spotless due to you having to pick up poop right away.\n\nShe is a mature lady and doesn't come with any of those tiresome puppy behaviors like mouthing, jumping, destroying things that aren't hers, etc.\n\nShe lives with two adult human, two other large dogs (65-100#), and a cat. The dogs all get along well, but don't interact much with each other and like to do their own things. They are all more people oriented anyways! She does have some resource guarding with the other dogs when it comes to high value treats and toys. She has not guarded anything from me, but has with my boyfriend. If she can be left alone to enjoy her special treat/toy, that is ideal. She will also accept a trade for something else! She has been to the dog park and mostly just keeps to herself but is interested in what the others are doing. I do not think she knows how to play with another dog, and would probably do best in a household with low-key dogs. She would also be fine with no other dogs in the family. She had a difficult time with the cat for the first few weeks she was here. She was very fixated on him. We did total separation for awhile, then eventually eased off, and by that time, the novelty had worn off. Now she hardly glances his way and I've found them sleeping on the couch together a few times. She should either go to a cat-free home, or to one where it is possible to separate for as long as necessary, and ease into things. My cat is middle aged and pretty mellow, so I don't know how she would do with a more active cat. She does have prey drive with critters in the yard and on walks (squirrels, rabbits, etc).\n\nShe is unsure of new people at first, especially when meeting on her territory - she will bark at new visitors who come into the house, or when the human neighbors are out in the yard (doesn't care about their dogs). She does not like to be towered over and is unsure about deep, gruff voices. Other than when strangers encroach on her territory, she is not a vocal dog.\n\nOnce you are \"her people,\" she is the sweetest, goofiest dog. She does a little dance with her nubby tail wiggling when we come home. She loves to be pet and have her ears rubbed, and her head becomes dead weight in your hands. Aside from that, she's not a super cuddly dog who will want to curl up next to you on the couch, but she shows affection in her own way. She loooves tennis balls and to chase after them in the yard, or throw them around for herself to chase after. The squeaky ones are even better. She loves stuffed Kongs and all treats/bones/toys. She enjoys walks and does well on a leash and walking past other dogs, but does not have a ton of stamina to go long distances, especially in warm weather. (She loves a good dog stroller ride if you have one!) If you try to lift her up for any reason, she becomes a sack of potatoes and sinks into the floor. She loves car rides and when she knows you are getting ready to leave, will race to the door and just sit and wait. She is the best errand buddy and immediately passes out in the backseat. She often lays with her front legs crossed. She sleeps hard and snores. She farts often and loudly and doesn't care if it's at work during a meeting.\n\nEcho is a super special dog who needs a patient, calm, loving family committed to always setting her up to succeed and providing her the absolute best care through her twilight years. After 8 years of a mediocre breeder dog life, it's what she deserves.\n\nFrom our Vets: Echo has a history of recurrent UTIs that needs to be medically managed. Adopters should consider that her veterinary care needs to be more regular. She needs to remain on the Pala-Tech cranberry supplements lifelong, have her blood work checked every 6-12 months, and have a urinalysis and urine culture and susceptibility test run every 3-4 months.\n\nIf you think your home would a good match for Echo, apply today to meet her!\n2/2/21 5:06 PM",

            "description": "*Not suited for an apartment* \n*Structural fence required, door darter*\n*No kids*\n\nPoptart came to The Animal Care Society from an overcrowded rural shelter. He was just skin and bones when we got him. We are still working on putting weight on him but he has made a lot of progress so far. We aren't sure what all Poptart went through before coming here, but it has left him with some emotional scars. He is very scared of everything and everyone around him. You can tell that he wants so badly to come up to you for affection, but he is just too nervous. We have learned that when he's alone he can be somewhat destructive. This could change once he's in a home but we recommend that he goes into a crate when no one is around to supervise him. Poptart needs to go to a quiet home with a fenced-in yard. Because of his nervousness, he cannot go to a home with children. He seems to enjoy the company of other dogs, but he will steal food or treats from them which could end up causing an unwanted altercation, so he would need to be fed separately from other animals. Poptart needs someone to show him that whatever has happened to him in the past, is behind him. If you are interested in adopting Poptart, please put in an application on our website www.animalcaresociety.org. Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: White Weight: 18.8lbs Age: 2yrs 1mths 2wks Animal has been Neutered I am available for adoption at the Animal Care Society.",

            "description": "Beautiful Salem has cast a spell on us! This husky mix is about 49 pounds and 2 years old. Nine weeks ago today (1/22/21), Salem birthed eight BEAUTIFUL babies. Her #broodofbroomriders are nearly ready for their forever homes but Salem, definitely is! She has been a spectacular mother! She nursed, cleaned, doted on, disciplined, played with and taught her babies the last nine weeks and now... they're driving her bananas! Like all new mommas, Salem is craving adult time. So yesterday, she went to day care and LOVED it! Salem will be spayed next week and then on the hunt for her forever family! She will require a large fenced yard to enjoy and would like another playful friend but it isn't necessary. Salem isn't a fan of being left alone for long periods - she's a sensitive Husky mix gal - so someone home mostly is key. Salem is VERY friendly, VERY playful. Because she is so very Husky, a home with no cats, no small dogs, and no prey animals of any kind will be necessary. Salem runs like the wind and couldn't be any faster if she was riding a broom; so, a home with a securely fenced yard will be needed. Salem is enchanting. We know she will steal your heart as quickly as she stole ours. She is friendly with other respectfully playful pups and was drawn to the pre-teen she met today. An active family who can exercise Salem, play with her, and then let her crash with you is exactly what this girl needs.\n\nIt's time to show Salem the dedication and commitment she has shown her brood. We need someone committed to loving this girl fully and forever! Applications for Sweet Salem @ maxxandme.org\n\nSalem will be spayed soon, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped. Adoption donation is $250.\nIf you would like to meet any of our dogs, please fill out a foster or adoption application on www.maxxandme.org\nMaxx & Me is an all volunteer, all foster home rescue and do not have a shelter. Please allow at least 48 hours for applications to be processed (missing information may slow the process, so please take your time and be thoughtful in your answers). All dogs posted are available (so no need to ask). We place dogs based on best home for each dog and not order of applications received. Email us at maxxandmerescue@gmail.com for updates and questions. Thank you for choosing rescue.",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

            "description": "Cowboy is a sweetheart. This handsome, playful lab mix is about 45 lbs and 4 years old. He would do best with some outdoor space to play in and regular exercise. but when playtime is over he is a gentle angel. He is fine with other dogs. Cowboy likes his crate and is doing great with housebreaking. Cowboy is a love and will make a great companion or family dog.\n\nPlease email us at AlmostHome4Dogs@yahoo.com to find out if Cowboy is the right one for you! (Local adoptions preferred - Philadelphia and tri-state area [South Jersey and northern Delaware] only.)\n\nPLEASE READ BEFORE CONTACTING US!\nWe are NOT a shelter: All of our dogs live in private homes with foster families. Come and meet the Almost Home dogs and their fosters at our Meet & Greet events, where you can learn more about our wonderful dogs from the people who live with them, find out which dogs are on their way and when they'll arrive, and fill out an application to adopt or foster.\n\nWe cannot adopt to homes where electric-shock fencing systems or training collars are used. For more information on the dangers of electric-shock collars, please visit banshockcollars.ca/studies.php and http://www.hollysden.com/say_no_to_shock.htm (scroll down and click on the \"Invisible Fencing Systems\" link).\n\nWe do not have an online adoption application; to request an application, e-mail us at AlmostHome4Dogs@yahoo.com. To speed e-mail processing time, be sure to note the name of the dog you are inquiring about in the Subject line. For Meet & Greet times and locations, visit our home page, where you also will find information on our adoption process and fees.\n\nFOSTER FAMILIES ARE LIFESAVERS!! Can you open your heart and home for a few weeks to homeless shelter dog? Remember, by fostering a dog, you save TWO lives - that of your foster dog, and that of the dog who takes his place in the shelter! Come to a Meet & Greet and find out if fostering is for you - there's no reward quite like the feeling that you've saved a life ... or two!",

Once she's comfortable, she is fun to play with and enjoys walks. She is very nervous around new people and will take an extended amount of time to warm up. She seems more interested in playing with toys than being pet. She will need a patient, experienced owner who is willing to use positive reinforcement training and to give her all the time she needs to warm up. Her new home should have a fenced yard and should be without kids under 14. She can be posessive of toys and food around other animals and will need to be the only pet in the home. Myla may never be a good dog to take to social functions, but would prefer someone who can spend a lot of time with her one on one.",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Mikey. I LOVE to play: anywhere, any time, any place, any toy, I love to be on the move! I'm looking for a household without small kiddos, I tend to be a little too excited for them. I can't help it, I just love life so much!! Everyone calls me handsome, but I think I have a pretty great personality, too! I do my best with commands, like sits, and stays. But I think I might learn better if you have a treat or two to give me when I do good stuffs. Do you like me? Can we be friends? I'd love to hangout with you some time!! Let's take a walk and fall in love! Thanks for checking in! Due to the Covid-19 virus pandemic, our offices are operating differently than normal.

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application.

I need a home with children over 8 years old due to my size and strength.  \n\nSince I've come to the shelter they have made sure that I'm up to date on vaccinations, fixed, and also have a microchip. All I need now is someone super nice to come adopt me!\n\nAdoptions are conducted by appointment only with a pre-approved application. Please call the shelter at 724-539-2544 and leave a voicemail with your information and interest in adopting. We will call you back to do an application with you by phone. Once your adoption application is approved, we will setup an appointment for you to come to the shelter and meet the pet you are interested in. Please be patient in receiving a call back - we are experiencing a very high volume of calls each day with a limited staff.\n",

He is nose to the ground and becomes very excited when going outside.  He has settled in and has been able to trust that he isn't going to be left.  Duke walks well on leash with our volunteers.  He will need an owned home with a nice yard.  Like most hounds Duke likes to sing!  He will need to be a single pet in the home.  Breed experience is preferred.  \n\nIf you are interested in adopting a dog, please submit an application on our website:  thesimonfoundation.org",

I came to AFA from an \"overcrowded\" open door shelter. \n\nWhen I arrived at the shelter - I arrived with my 1 week old babies also.  They are all grown and ready to find their forever homes and so am I.  I need a home with children over 13 years old.  \n\nSince I've come to the shelter they have made sure that I'm up to date on vaccinations, fixed, and also have a microchip. All I need now is someone super nice to come adopt me!\n\nAdoptions are conducted by appointment only with a pre-approved application. Please call the shelter at 724-539-2544 and leave a voicemail with your information and interest in adopting. We will call you back to do an application with you by phone. Once your adoption application is approved, we will setup an appointment for you to come to the shelter and meet the pet you are interested in. Please be patient in receiving a call back - we are experiencing a very high volume of calls each day with a limited staff.\n",

Lila Belle was very emaciated when she arrived, but has been steadily gaining weight! \n\nLila Belle is a super sweet girl! She's very lovable & affectionate. She likes other dogs, but is a little awkward with other dogs. We don't think she ever learned how to play with other dogs. She's been doing well in her play group & is picking up skills quickly! Lila Belle is medium energy. She's equally happy exploring the outdoors as curled up cuddling with you! She's going to make a wonderful companion!\n\n\n\n\nCOMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES! IF you are interested in adopting, the FIRST step is to complete an application! Please email for an Application or copy and paste the following URL: \n\nhttps://fs26.formsite.com/nogreaterlove/form2/index.html \n\nUpon receipt of your application, the rescuer and foster in AL will contact you so you can ask any specific questions you may have! If there is more than one decision maker in the home, all of them should be in agreement! \n\n Adoption Donation: Unless otherwise stated in the pet's bio, our standard adoption fee is $250 which covers age appropriate vaccines (DHPP vax) and (Rabies vax if 12 weeks and older), utd on flea/tick prevention and heartworm prevention, worming, heartworm test @ age 6 months or older, microchip, fostering costs and health certificate.\n\nThank you for your understanding and consideration and for helping the dogs and puppies in need!\n\nWe do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21",

            "description": "Arabella is a 1.5 year female that weighs 50 lbs. Our vet believes she is a boxer mix. Arabella has one of the showiest brindle coats we have seen! And it\u2019s very soft, perfect for petting. Arabella was found as a stray and it did take some work to catch her. For that reason, a calmer home will probably be a better fit. Kennel staff says she does have a playful side and enjoys romping in the yard. She\u2019s such a gentle soul and once she realizes she\u2019s home, she\u2019s going to fall hard for you. A dog that truly knows she\u2019s been rescued. Arabella can do meet and greets with other dogs, but she is too interested in cats. To adopt this brindle beauty, apply at ITVrescue.org.\n\nAll of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heartworm tested and treated if necessary.\n\nPlease realize that many of our animals are kept in foster homes. Please complete an adoption application at http://itvrescue.org/adoption-application/ in order to meet with one of our animals. There is no obligation in completing the application, but it helps us find an animal that is most appropriate for your family.  The ITV Rescue Center is open Tuesdays 12-5; Wednesdays 12-7; Thursdays 12-5; Fridays 12-5 and Saturdays 10-5.  The Rescue Center is located at 1417 N. Stockwell Road.  You are welcome to come to our rescue center during open hours to see all of our great adoptable animals. Thank you for your interest in our animals!\n\nNOTE: Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

She does need a handler who can help teach her manners. She tends to pull very hard on the leash and she likes to jump up on people. Katie will need to go to a home with a fenced in yard to make room for her zoomies and to accommodate her active lifestyle. With a little work, this sweet girl will make a great addition to a family. \n\n**COVID PROCEDURE***  Please fill out an adoption application at www.cedar-rapids.org/animal. After the application is submitted, a staff member will contact you to schedule an appointment to meet the pet!\n\n* The spay/ neuter surgery is included in the adoption fee of $125.\n\n* We always prefer that our animals go to indoor homes.\n\n*OWNING a pet is a life time commitment!  Please be ready to make that commitment before you adopt a pet!\n\n*BREED DISCLOSURE: Due to the fact that most of our adoptable pets are strays, we can not guarantee their breed. We list the pets breed as the one that best matches the physical appearance, temperament, and personality of the animal-in some cases it's purely a guess. The pet may also be listed as a mix when it\u2019s actually a purebred.",

Once separated, Harley was able to relax a bit and has come a long way with impulse control.  We are looking for an experienced handler that will work on obedience, stress management and impulse control.  Chevy is a wonderful outdoor athlete that will need daily exercise.  He takes a bit to trust but will develop a strong bond with his family.  Okay with older teens and adults, only pet home.  Chevy will be a wonderful companion and is definitely worth a look!!!  \n\nIf you are interested in adopting a dog, please submit an application to adopt on our website:  thesimonfoundation.org",

Potty training and kennel training are going well, but she is a baby and will need continued training to perfect them!

My original family surrendered me because they could no longer afford the bills that came with owning a pup. I'm the biggest snuggle bug. I'm a mountain of love and energy and make a great 40lb lap dog. Ear scratches, belly rubs and food are my jam. At only a year, I'm in my awkward phase of having a puppy brain in a grown pup body. I need an active family that will take me on walks, hikes, and preferably has a fenced yard. I'm very smart and pick up new things quickly! After only 3 days, I learned sit and wait at my foster home. I'm working on leash manners, stay, and leave it. I'm looking for a furever family that will love me for always!\nI am crate trained and house trained. I do great with people. I'd do best in a home with older kids. I don't know anything about cats as I've never met one before. My foster home has one other dog that I get along with great (one could say we are besties)! Are you my pawfect match?",

He dies love his humans and will snuggle up with you as you binge watch your favorite shows.  If you would like to learn more about Dylan, please complete an application and then reach out to Roxy@bigfluffydogs.com\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

I am a two-year-old retriever mix that needs to relocate! I had a home that I loved, but my owner just couldn\u2019t handle me!  She brought me in hoping the shelter could find an appropriate owner.  The shelter made sure I had all of my vaccinations, that I had a microchip, and that I was spayed.  One little problem did show up on my health check up. I am heartworm positive. Whoever adopts me will need to have me treated. If you would like to donate to my treatment that would be so kind of you. If you would like to foster me and then adopt me well that would be just great!! Now I know with a name like Snooki you may be expecting lots of drama like on The Jersey Shore, but I promise I am a no drama type dog! All I want is a stable home and a loving family!",

Somehow, I ended up at animal control, so Mostly Mutts has stepped in to be sure I spend my golden years receiving the love and care that I deserve.  I have one eye (and sight in it is limited due to age) and some hearing loss which is typical at my age as well. \n\n\u2022 OTHER DOGS/CATS/KIDS:  I met the other dogs in my foster home and do fine with them, though we don\u2019t interact or play, so if you have a nice doggie who isn\u2019t looking for a playmate, let\u2019s meet / Cats unknown, but I likely would not be interested in them / I also haven\u2019t met kids yet at Mostly Mutts, but older kids may be best in my new home.  I am a senior guy, and younger children may expect me to be playful, and I am not.\n\n\u2022 PERSONALITY/ENERGY LEVEL:  My foster describes me as a \u2018sweet gentleman\u2019 who is happiest just chilling with my people, so if you are looking for a TV or book reading buddy \u2013 sign me up!  Long or short life ahead of me \u2013 I want to live large in comfort and love.  Since I have sight loss please keep me safe from falling down the stairs and out in the yard etc.  / My energy level is 1-3.\n\n\u2022 SKILLS/CRATE/POTTY:  I don\u2019t know any doggie commands, but I don\u2019t mind \u2013 I\u2019m all good / I don\u2019t use a crate in my foster home / I need frequent let outs to avoid potty accidents, and I need to go out right away upon waking from a nap.  My foster uses a belly band with me, though it does not always stay on \u2013 losing weight should help with this.  My foster has learned my potty habits (if I get up and immediately start walking around, its potty time), so accidents have decreased.  I\u2019ve also just started a medication to help with incontinence.\n\n\u2022 LIKES/DISLIKES:  I love the closeness of being with my people and enjoy hanging out or napping near my people on the couch.  You\u2019ll want to keep a pee pad on there, as I sometimes have accidents in my sleep.  I also enjoy treats / I can\u2019t think of any dislikes, but I would not be happy if I didn\u2019t get the love and attention on which I thrive.\n\n\u2022 MEDICAL:  I'm current on vaccinations, micro-chipped and neutered.  I am on special kidney food and taking medicine to help with my incontinence.  I also take glucosamine and fish oil to help keep my joints as healthy as possible.  I\u2019ve just had a dental cleaning, so the remaining teeth I have are healthy again!  \n\nI am looking for a special family who will give me the love I deserve in my golden years.  My adoption fee is $299.00, and I\u2019m located in Kennesaw, Ga.  \n\n",

APPLICATIONS ARE CONSIDERED IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY ARE RECEIVED. http://www.redbarnrescue.com/adoption-application.html\n________________\n\nSweet Nell has a way of charming people. In October she was taken to Countyview Vet in Kinston to be treated for a neck injury, apparently from a dog attack. They liked her so much that after she was treated,  they committed to keep her until a good rescue situation was found. So she arrived at Red Barn Rescue on January 20th and is winning our hearts already!\n\nNell is a 22-pound Feist mix, approximately 3 to 5 years old. She likes dogs and plays well with dogs of similar size. She loves her walks and would enjoy an owner who wants a walking partner. She is bright-eyed and alert, enjoys sniffing and investigating as she walks. \n\nShe is a little careful of new people, but within minutes her tail is wagging and she is receptive and loving.  Her past is unknown, but because she is a bit uncertain of some circumstances we think her owners should be adults without small kids which may make her nervous. \n\nNell will be spayed, microchipped, vaccinated and up to date on heartworm and flea/tick preventative. She had tested positive for heartworms and has already begun treatment. Our $300 adoption fee helps to cover these expenses.\n\n",

            "description": "Bobino is an estimated 12 year old chihuahua, that weighs in at about 7 pounds.\n\nHe's an unsure boy, of life around him, but he doesn't take long too warm right up to anyone who gives him kindness and love and move into high cuddling gear.\n\nHe found himself in a Canadian shelter, after his owners said they had suddenly developed an allergy to him.  We think it's more based on his medical needs, as Bobino arrived to us with a bad cough, and after seeing our cardiologist, it was determined he has mitral valve insufficiency.  \n\n________________________________________\n\nClinical History:\n\nGrade 5/6 murmur. Coughing. Started furosemide 5 mg BID and doxycycline yesterday.\n\nEchocardiographic Findings [Keith A. Blass, DVM, MS, DACVIM (Cardiology)]:\n\nThere is moderate to severe left atrial dilation (LA 28.1 mm). The mitral valve leaflets are thickened and exhibit systolic prolapse. A moderate to severe jet of eccentric mitral regurgitation is present. There is moderate to severe left ventricular dilation (LVIDd 28.9 mm; LVIDs 15.3 mm). Left ventricular systolic\nfunction (FS 47%) is hyperdynamic. The aorta and aortic valve appear normal, though trace aortic insufficiency is present. Right atrial and right ventricular dimensions are normal. The tricuspid appears normal, though trace tricuspid regurgitation is present. TR velocity (TR 2.78 m/s) does not suggest the\npresence of pulmonary hypertension. \n\nThe pulmonary artery and pulmonic valve are normal. No pericardial effusion or cardiac masses are seen.\n  \nECG: Sinus arrhythmia\n\nAssessment/Recommendations:\nDegenerative mitral valve disease\n\nThis examination demonstrates moderate to severe mitral regurgitation resulting from degenerative valve disease. Secondary to his regurgitation, Bobino has moderate to severe dilation of both his left atrium and left ventricle, though his left ventricular systolic function is well-preserved. \n\nGiven the severity of his disease, Bobino is at relatively high risk for the development of left-sided congestive heart failure, and it\u2019s likely that mainstem bronchial compression is contributing to his cough.\n\nContinued use of furosemide appears to be warranted based on this exam, as is therapy with benazepril (1.25 mg BID), and pimobendan (1.25 mg am, 0.625 mg pm), as these medications should help to improve any cardiogenic component of Bobino\u2019s cough, as well as slow the progression of his cardiac disease.\n________________________________________\n\nBobino will need to be on heart medication the rest of his life (estimated to be about $100/month), so this is something you must take into consideration when adopting and we highly suggest you speak with your veterinarian about the medication costs when considering this boy.\n\nWith his heart medication, he can go on to live a really terrific, long life.  But we absolutely can not guarantee this, but typically it's a really slow progressing disease that responds well to medication.  Speak with your veterinarian for their opinion on the case.\n\nBobino is a really fun little dog.  He's not a fan of other dogs, but is in foster with other dogs and being tolerable.  We'd love to see this boy in a quiet home to call his own, as an only pet.\n\nYou must love walking, because this boy is a walker and gets REALLY excited when he can get out and adventure in the world.\n\nBobino also showed signs of separation anxiety the first few days of being in foster when his foster Mom went to work, but slowly settled into a routine and manages fine on his own.  That said, a home where someone is home most often or can take their dog to work is what we'll be seeking for Bobino.\n\nBobino is just a super quirky guy, that likely has been unsocialized in life,  that now deserves lots of love and compassion and an opportunity to live a really amazing rest of his life.\n\n------------------------------------\nFROM HIS FOSTER MOM:\n\nHe\u2019s awesome! \n\nHe needs a lot of love. Approach him slowly but he definitely likes to be pet and loved. Just leery at first.\n\nHe kept jumping up on the front of the couch wanting to come up and join me...and gives kisses! And he lets me pick him up and cuddle. He also likes to snuggle up in bed. He knows how to get to my heart!! ?\n\nHe\u2019s super spry!! No apparent issues with joints or pain. Great walker.\n\nHe\u2019s cautious of the dogs but it's manageable.\n------------------------------------\n\nFROM THE INTAKE FORM SHELTER/PREVIOUS OWNER:\n\nWas living w/ 2 seniors \nWas getting along w/ everyone in the home \u2013 per owner \nFearful, vocal w/ house guests \u2013 per owner \nUnknown w/ kids \u2013 per owner \nUnknown w/ dogs, never in contact. Barks when sees them - per owner \nPersonality: active, excited, affectionate, playful and fearful \u2013 per owner \nHas been seen by the vet this past year for coughing \u2013 per owner \nHouse trained on pee pads \u2013 per owner \nEats kibbles from vet clinic \u2013 per owner \nNot crate trained \u2013 per owner \nCalm when left alone \u2013 per owner \nNo bite history \u2013 per owner \nHave to respect his \u201cbubble\u201d, if approached too fast he can charge. Other than that he is ok \u2013 per owner  \nDoes not like sudden movements \u2013 per owner \nBad habits: vocal, afraid of thunderstorms, reactive on leash \u2013 per owner \nLoves car rides \u2013 per owner \nNervous disposition + does not like being held \u2013 per owner \nUsed to go to groomer \u2013 per owner \n\n____________________________________________\n\nAs of today, though our protocols could change tomorrow, we are still moving forward with adoptions. Our process has changed from some of the previous elements: We are a registered animal welfare organization, so we are deemed an essential service.\n\nAll paperwork completed online, video home visits, meet and greets outside respecting social distancing, leashes/collars/supplies wiped down and disinfected (GermiCide 3 wipes), disinfectant on the dog prior to handoff (Aqueos wipes for dogs)\n\n-----------------------\n\nTo note: the above description is relevant to this dog in his current setting. Home changes & adopter personalities can bring out different behaviours not previously seen.\n\nWe do not specifically kid/cat test our dogs when they arrive at Mattie's Place. That just wouldn't be fair to the dog or child/cat.\n\nWe also do not claim, endorse, suggest or hint at, that any of our dogs are hypoallergenic, low shed or no-shed.\n\nAdoption fee includes: spay/neuter, deworming, defleaing, vaccinations, nose to tail health exam, leash|collar, 6 months of preventative based on season/need, DNA test for entertainment purposes, dishes, poop bags, food and any extras she has accumulated in foster care.\n\n\n",

Indigo was surrendered to the shelter after being too rough with the kids in the home. Her previous family told us that she does well with other dogs as long as they aren't puppies, she wasn't around cats, and she usually did well with their kids but she can get a little too rough sometimes. Indigo is potty trained, knows basic commands, and walks well on a leash! She does well on car rides and was described as friendly, playful, noisy, outgoing, high energy, cuddly, and protective. Indigo loves to run and go for walks and once she has had her exercise she mellows out quite a bit. She is cuddly, loves milkbones for treats, and doesn't like people messing with her tail. Indigo loves to be around other dogs but she can't be around puppies. She will need frequent grooming and daily exercise in her new home! If you would like to meet Indigo give us a call so we can set up an appointment!",

            "description": "Charlie is the happiest dog around, who is looking to find a forever family! Charlie is housetrained, incredibly sweet, and would love to meet you! He loves to stay near his human companion for cuddles, and enjoys gentle leash walks and playing fetch. He would be a wonderful companion in a home with older children who would love to work with him on his basic commands that he is learning and play ball with him!\n\nCharlie is currently in a foster home, and his foster family says that:\n\n\"Charlie is a very happy, sweet dog who wants to please. He would enjoy (but not need) being in a placement with another dog, as he is so social and thrives on interaction. He is remarkably active for an older dog, and he needs an owner(s) who will take him on a long walk every day once he completes heartworm treatment.\"\n \"Charlie is completely housetrained. Bottom line, he is a very happy, friendly dog who wants to please. Medium energy--he gets up in the morning quite energetic and wants to play and jump up on me and constantly interact. He is fairly content being outside by himself, and as he has gotten more used to being here, he is starting to \"guard\" the yard and bark sometimes at things he sees, which is a good job/challenge for him. He hasn't been an excessive barker at all. When he can't spend time outside, going on a walk or throwing the ball every couple of hours helps to meet his need for physical and mental exercise. \nI think that he would love to be in a house with another dog, and this would help to channel his energy. My guess is that he would be too cluelessly energetic with a cat--he has more friendly enthusiasm than good manners.\"\n\nThe foster also says that \"He would enjoy children, but he would knock over smaller children when he is in one of his enthusiastic moods. He is very strong for his size and he needs ongoing work to stop his jumping up on people when he is overly energetic. \nIt is important to teach Charlie basic commands such as no, sit, stay, lie down, which will provide structure for him and help him feel safe. It seems that someone has taught him to drop the ball in front of his person after he retrieves it. This is success that he could continue to work on.\nHe is okay in a crate. I usually leave him in the crate no more than an hour. He sleeps on my bed, but I think he would get used to being in the crate at night. He settles down very quickly to sleep and is a very good sleeper.\nHe needs something to chew on both inside and outside. He has a ball in the yard and a couple inside since they get misplaced sometimes. A rubber ball is his favorite--don't bother with tennis balls, as he destroys them in minutes! He much prefers a rubber ball over the rubber bone that I got him.\"\n\nCharlie does have some issues with his esophagus that make him cough occasionally, but using a harness for walks helps tremendously!\n\n\nDo you think I am the perfect match for you? Click on the link below for the Meet Your Match questionnaire. We will forward your information to the foster parent for follow up. This information will be used to make sure this is a good fit before we schedule a meet and greet.\nLet's get started on meeting me! https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeOSn7D67PzZ98rWlpCkNUL9aaxFLVAk7m1ucMF3fFj7JWzgQ/viewform?usp=sf_link",

I think I'm the sweetest 52lbs you'll find anywhere. I'm generally calm, easy going, tolerant of almost everything and friendly with people. I'm easily collared and leashed, but my walking habits can be hit and miss (sometimes I'm a little too eager to get to the next destination). I love soft/squishy blankets, bones, treats, car rides and spending time with humans. Though I warm up quickly, I'd like to meet any fur-siblings before going home (just to make sure it's the right fit for everyone). I'm so excited to find my loving forever home.",

If there is an applicant, it will say PENDING ADOPTION next to the dog's name. If not, please submit an Application that can be found on our site, www.fluffydog.net. \n\nMY AGE: approx. 2 yrs  WEIGHT: approx. 38 lbs.  WHERE I AM FROM: AL (arrival 1/30) \n\nMY STORY: Buddy was a neighborhood stray. \n\nGreat inside dog, few mistakes. Was great at the vet. Was worried to begin with but loves strangers. Absolutely hates crates, being confined for any reason. Gives kisses, sleeps on the couch. Doesn\u2019t play with the other dogs, would prefer people. Not mean to them, just loves sitting by us. Doesn\u2019t like many treats, but loves his food with warm beef broth mixed in. Would do great with a single guy that dotes on him. Would still leave if he would get out the front door as he was a wanderer for so long, but would come back at dinner. Loves being outside or inside. Did I say- hates crates and confinement ?. I\u2019ll have to give him something for transport to make it in his crate.\n\nDogs are held for two weeks after arrival date. You are welcome to apply, but applications will be processed closer to the available date.\n\nDogs needing foster homes are available for adoption This dog does need a foster home. Have you ever considered fostering a dog?  For more information, see the Fluffy dog rescue home page. This dog does shed and is not hypoallergenic.\n\nHOUSEBROKEN?   GOOD WITH DOGS?

Their current home is being told they can only keep one and they can\u2019t tear them apart and would rather they find a new home together.  The male (Tri Color) is Daredevil, AKA Devil. He is 6 years old and quite possibly the chillest dog on earth. He is neutered and has had his first and second shots. He is, obviously, overweight and is something they have been working on for some time. Aside from that he is very mild tempered and calm, he is the best cuddle buddy on earth. He loves hanging out with you no matter what you are doing.  The Black and White is a female and her name is \nIndianna Joanna Jones, AKA Indie. She is 5 years old and is the complete opposite of Devil. She is not spayed (but will be before they are adopted out) and has only had her first shots (she will be getting her second set once she gets into her foster home). She is the healthiest of the two, thankfully. She is very hyperactive and loves to be all up in your business! No matter what you are doing she will want to do it with you. She would be a good jogging buddy for sure. Although she is always down for cuddles too.  We believe these two pups have been around people who were on meth and abused them.  They are bonded and Devil completely relies on Indie to keep him happy and warm.  These two are looking for a home that will give them love and allow them to be together.  We are looking for a foster home for these two until little Indie can be spayed, then will be taking applications for their adoption.  If you would like to meet them to see if they would be a good fit at your home please fill out an application at\n\nwww.lowridersofthewest.org\n\nWhey would make the best companions for anyone wanting a walking partner or just a couple of snuggle bugs.   \n\n\n",

Leo, 52lbs and tall, dark and handsome and dainty 18lb Reyna have discovered life is better together.  They are both about 11-months-old and medium energy.  They love each other and Reyna is a good influence on shy, skittish Leo.   They love to play together, (watch video) walk together and nap together.  \n\nReyna is absolutely fearless of everything and has never met a dog or person she doesn't love.  She's ready to get the party started at the drop of a hat but is also crate trained and will settle in for a good nap if nothing is going on.  Leo is a shy kind of guy who gains confidence around his girlfriend.  Currently, they sleep together in a crate and that's the way they like it.   Leo will take a while to warm up to people and will do best in a quiet home with no children because kids can overwhelm him.  If he could choose his perfect home, it would be a home headed by a woman who could give him the time and patience to learn to trust but having his girlfriend with him ensures he will get there quickly.  \n\n",

Nash was adopted as a puppy but was re-homed a few weeks ago due to a fight with the other dog in his home. (We have no clue who started it, and they had always been buddies, so it's def strange.) He was adopted and doing very well, but sadly, his new mom is very sick right now, and she can't care for him. SOOOO.....here we go again. Nash is a house trained 1 year old, 60 lb Pit mix who may look tough, but he's actually a mushy lover boy. He's is a very affectionate boy who absolutely LOVES all people and always has to be touching someone when cuddling. Hes loves happy to play and has typical puppy energy (although not an excessive amount), but his favorite activity is snoozing outside in the warm sunshine. He's a work in progress on the leash, but he's getting there! We're looking for home with loving parents who understand that Nash has been bounced around and are willing to give him the time and patience he needs as he settles in. We'd prefer he be an only dog in his new home. Nash is neutered, microchipped, and vaccinated, and his adoption fee is $400.",

Even if you've raised puppies in the past, this is an invaluable resource to help make your new addition successful!\n\n\"Hi there, my name is Lefty! I am a long-legged handsome boy with a knack for adventure. I might be big, but I do not realize my own size. I love to explore the outdoors with a human by my side. I enjoy playing fetch and have a pony-like gallop. My floppy ears are quite endearing.\nI like toys with squeakers and my favorite snack is a Kong filled with peanut butter. I am not a big cuddler, but I am content being by your side while you watch television, cook dinner, or read a book. Small children tend to make me nervous, so for this reason I would do better in a home with mature children or adults only. Dogs interest me quite a bit and I feel that, with a proper introduction, I could make a furry friend or two! I have so much potential and want a family of my own to give me the love and attention I deserve! \"\n\nLefty is currently attending training with GymDog in Johnson City. He is doing extremely well in meeting his true potential.\n\nIf interested in the handsome guy, please email humanesociety@hswctn.org for more information.",

He loves dogs and prefers to run in a fenced-in yard. Zachary loves other dogs but may be too playful for some. Zachary is looking for a patient, dog-savvy adopter, willing to put in the time and training to help him thrive in adoption. He is looking for a suburban home, with or without another similar active dog. He has done well with daycare in his foster home but should be fed separately from other dogs. Zachary has not lived with kids while in his foster homes, so it is unknown how he would do but older kids would likely be best. \n\nZachary has lots of energy and is looking for an active adopter who help continue providing him with structure and manners training. He can get a bit mouthy when he's overstimulated so he needs to be shown what's appropriate for play time. He will repay with lots of kisses! When he's done with all of his play time, he's a champion napper. He is still a puppy, so his future adopters will need to be willing to puppy proof since he can be curious and chew. \n\nZachary is excited to meet his forever family!\n\nAge: 9 mos\nWeight: 50 lbs.\n\nPlease Note: All dogs currently available for adoption are posted on our website.

I've got a purple dot because I have had no training in the past, and I definitely need it to be a good companion. I'd do best with an experienced dog owner with no children at home so that I can safely learn my manners. Lucky for me, my pals at HSSC are including free obedience courses with my adoption! I'm very rude with other dogs, so I'd probably be best suited as an only dog. I REALLY like to play with toys, I'm not picky at all. Some might say I like them a little too much; I can be very snappy taking toys, so I need to learn \"drop it\" and \"leave it\" to make playtime safer. As you can probably tell, I have lots of energy and I need room to move, so I'd do best in a single-family home as opposed to an apartment or condo. If you have a backyard, I'd be thrilled! If not, I hope you're a runner! If you understand my needs and you're ready to take me home, please come to see me! Maybe we can have a slumber party!\n\nWhat's HW+? I'm currently being treated for heartworms. I'll need to keep a calm lifestyle until finished and may require an appointment or two. Please don't be deterred, my lifespan isn't shortened, and I'm not contagious to your other pets.\n\nTake me on a Slumber Party! You can bring me home for a 3 day - 30 day trial period. HSSC will provide food, medications, and necessities. If I'm not the one for you, just bring me back to HSSC and provide feedback on what would be the best home for me.",

He loves romping around the yard and patrolling for squirrels. Ted is an aficionado of stuffed animals and he can often be seen carrying one around the shelter or during walks. \n\nTed is housebroken and generally well mannered. He is dog selective and would be best as the only dog or with a low key, respectful dog. No cats. Children 12 and up. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in meeting Ted, please visit www.almosthomeli.org for an adoption application.",

            "description": "Lily is a sweet and spunky little chihuahua; she is 9 years old and approx. 6 pounds\n\nShe takes time to warm up to new people and will likely bark at them inside or outside of the home but warms up relatively fast (usually within an hour or two) as long as they respect her space and let her come to them.\n\nShe is great with cats and the foster parent's larger dog but not tested with small dogs. She isn't afraid to tell them if they are bothering her and likes her space when resting but does so in an appropriate manner.\n\nLily loves going for walks; she did show some reactivity towards people but that has calmed down for the most part, although she continues to be reactive to dogs when out. We have not tried on leash greetings so we are not sure how she would do. Lily gets nervous of busy streets, loud noises and spooks if something touches her (like her leash) but has good recovery. She also tends to bark at noises she hears in apartment hallways, doorbells and other dogs barking.\n\nIt is a joy to come home as Lily is always excited to greet people she knows with silly dances and full body wags. She enjoys playing with soft toys and her humans as well as trying to play with the resident cats even though they aren't open to playing back.\n\nLily enjoys cuddling with her humans but is also happy to find a soft bed or couch to nap on alone.\n\nWe are currently enrolled in a virtual training class for basic obedience and she is catching on quickly. She is learning her sits and downs (although not comfortable doing them unless on something soft like a bed or towel). We are starting to learn loose leash walking and mat work which she loves! She also knows touch and recall indoors.\n\nLily will eventually need dental work but is otherwise rather healthy. She is fine going up and down stairs and is happy to go on walks to sniff and explore.\n\nLily would likely do fine in a home with other animals but happy to be the only dog as well.\n\nShe can be sensitive about her nails being clipped. We can wipe her paws with a cloth but she does try to pull away. She is okay with getting her sweater and coat on but she still gets nervous while it's being done. No biting or snapping but she's not a fan\n\nShe would not be suited to a family with young chidren; that was the reason she came into rescue because she was struggling to live with the toddler",

Though a bit shy at first, she warms up quickly and proves to be very affectionate. She does warm up to calm dogs quickly, but if going to a home with another canine or canines, time and patience with her is key. \nShe LOVES all people and that includes kids! Typical of the breed she loves being outside and running, playing. She is fine on the leash but does really prefer off leash play. She likes her crate; it's her \"safe\" spot. \n\nIdeal home for Juno that knows, loves and respects this breed. One that will give the time and space to warm up in her own time. A fenced in yard is key since she adores playing fetch, etc. Daily sufficient exercise via walks, hikes, outdoor yard play is essential Kids are fine; as are other dogs, but slow intros are important. \n\nJuno is about 1 1/2 yrs old and weighs abotu 40 lbs. She is utd on her shots and is vaccinated. \n\nWant to know more? Arrange a visit? Please contact reboundhounds@gmail.com and her rescue will get right back to you, thanks!\n\nAPPLICATION REQUIRED; REHOMING FEE IS $400. HOME VISIT. \n\nJUNO IS IN FOSTER IN GRANTVILLE, PA",

He would love to have a dog sibling to keep him company and not feel alone when the humans are away. Moss would be happy to be part of any size pack. \n\n\n\nIf you have any doggie friends in your life, please be sure to bring them with you and staff will set up a meet to make sure everyone gets along.

            "description": "Our adoption area is limited to UT, NV, ID, OR, WA and MT with a home visit. If you are outside of this area please do a search for your local GSP/GWP/Pointer rescue group.\n\n--------\n\nWELCOME SMORE! (you pushy, dominant, noisy, uninhibited boy, you!) ?  Smore spent Two Whole Days at Casa UPP....... during which he learned not to whine in his crate, fling himself against the crate to get to the cats, bark every time he heard something new.......... and He Had A Bath! ?  Omygoodness!  Rescue Lady is  getting too old for these willful 3-year olds!  \n\nOn the bright side Smore really wants to be a good boy (despite his irrepressible enthusiasm for getting in trouble).  He could be loved all day long.  He's never going to be a cat kind of guy.  He's house trained (a huge plus).  And he's pretty good about getting a bath.  He's very fluffy when he's clean and his white parts glisten.  Smore could stand to gain a pound or 5. Smore's approx. DOB is 11/06/2017 so he's the perfect age to be a great companion for many years.\n\n---------\n\nGENERAL APPLICATION NOTES:\n\nWe strongly urge adopters to consider a male canine companion if they already have a female GSP/GWP. We get asked several times a year to take in one member of a 2-female GSP family because there are control issues between their girls that result in pretty ferocious fights. Interestingly that never happens among males. Go figure.\n\nDogs under 2 years of age need to go to a home with another well-socialized canine companion of a similar size (when grown) and within a few years of the pup\u2019s age. This is how they maintain and continue their learning/socialization process. Socialization outside the home is important but doesn\u2019t replace the in-home learning that is so important as the pup ages. https://www.facebook.com/ UtahsPerfectPointers/posts/ 1460968517254816\n\nMost older dogs aren\u2019t interested in having a puppy incessantly chewing on it and demanding attention. If you live outside of the Salt Lake area and are sure that your older dog just loves puppies, please arrange a visit at your home with a 2-4 month old pup for a couple of hours and make sure that your older dog feels the same way about this that you do. Please video the interactions and send it to us.\n\nJust a word of caution........ most pointer types need jobs. Otherwise they're not good pets. They need to be able to utilize their brains and no amount of exercise without a \"work\" or \"thinking\" component is adequate. The job doesn't need to be hunting. But it does need to be something that satisfies their genetic predispositions - nose work, agility, tracking, dock diving, etc. The job cannot just be obedience. If they can't use their innate senses they're just never going to be the dog you want for the next 15 years.\n\nA physical fence is required for most of our dogs.\n\nAs far as other breeds go, the pointers are generally good with most other breeds with the exception of the Arctic breeds and bulldogs. I'm not sure why, but if there's ever an altercation in daycare between a UPP dog and another dog, it's generally one of those two breeds. It may be the difference in energy levels. It may be some ancient behavior we know nothing about...... Not sure.\n\nUtah's Perfect Pointers is a very small rescue group and doesn't have the resources to adopt to states except for the ones noted above. If you are interested in adopting a GSP please contact the closest groups below.

I have received at least my first vaccination for parvo, distemper, adenovirus, coronavirus and bordatella (kennel cough) and possibly more dependant on my age and how long I have been at the center.  If the dog is 12 weeks old it may have received a rabies vaccination.  All canines are dewormed on intake and at regular intervals.  All parasites are also treated such as fleas and ticks as well.  All dogs 6 months of age and older are tested for heartworm disease and all dogs regardless of age are place on heartworm preventative.  All dogs are microchipped so that if they get lost they can find their way back home to you quickly.  All pets adopted from the center come with a one month free pet insurance which will help to ensure their health and well-being. \nThe animal center does its best to help assure that the adopting person and or family finds a pet suitable and compatable for your lifestyle.  \nPurebred canine adoption fee is $125.  Puppies up to 4 months $125.  Dogs over 4 months $100.  Some of our canine friends have been sponsored by generous patrons- this allows the adoption fee to be reduced from original fee minus sponsorship amount to good homes.",

            "description": "Our adoption area is limited to UT, NV, ID, OR, WA and MT with a home visit. If you are outside of this area please do a search for your local GSP/GWP/Pointer rescue group.\n\n--------\n\nI'm AMAR! I got my name because I'm a little lover.  I became a \"perfect pointer\" in Dec. 2020 because the shelter was concerned at how thin and I was.  They think I'm 1/2 labrador retriever and 1/2 GSP.  I was pretty overwhelmed when I got to Casa UPP and spent a lot of time in my crate because I just didn't know how to interact with the other dogs and cats.  After a couple of days Rescue Lady put a muzzle on me and tossed me outside with the herd.  I tried to chomp on a couple of them but they didn't even notice and continued playing.   After a couple of days I decided to join them and the muzzle came off.\n\nThen, wouldn't you know it, my left front paw started to swell up.  My vet thought it might be a foxtail, so tried to flush the wound but didn't find anything.  I'm on antibiotics to see if it might just be a deep-seated infection.  And...... after 2 months I finally get to go to daycare and get some new experiences with all kinds of other dogs and people!\n\nI've turned into a lovely boy.  I'm going to be on the timid side for awhile but I love being with my people and other dogs (and even cats).  I'm ready for a home of my very own!\n\nMy approx. DOB is 12/02/2019 so I'm the perfect age to be a great companion for many years.  I'm about 25\" at my withers.  I was only 38 lbs when I got to Casa UPP but I'm a perfect 54 lbs now.  I'm still lanky, like most big kids.  My coat glistens and is so soft.\n\nI'd like at least one friendly, well-socialized dog in my new home to interact with and show me the ropes.\n\n---------\n\nGENERAL APPLICATION NOTES:\n\nWe strongly urge adopters to consider a male canine companion if they already have a female GSP/GWP. We get asked several times a year to take in one member of a 2-female GSP family because there are control issues between their girls that result in pretty ferocious fights. Interestingly that never happens among males. Go figure.\n\nDogs under 2 years of age need to go to a home with another well-socialized canine companion of a similar size (when grown) and within a few years of the pup\u2019s age. This is how they maintain and continue their learning/socialization process. Socialization outside the home is important but doesn\u2019t replace the in-home learning that is so important as the pup ages. https://www.facebook.com/ UtahsPerfectPointers/posts/ 1460968517254816\n\nMost older dogs aren\u2019t interested in having a puppy incessantly chewing on it and demanding attention. If you live outside of the Salt Lake area and are sure that your older dog just loves puppies, please arrange a visit at your home with a 2-4 month old pup for a couple of hours and make sure that your older dog feels the same way about this that you do. Please video the interactions and send it to us.\n\nJust a word of caution........ most pointer types need jobs. Otherwise they're not good pets. They need to be able to utilize their brains and no amount of exercise without a \"work\" or \"thinking\" component is adequate. The job doesn't need to be hunting. But it does need to be something that satisfies their genetic predispositions - nose work, agility, tracking, dock diving, etc. The job cannot just be obedience. If they can't use their innate senses they're just never going to be the dog you want for the next 15 years.\n\nA physical fence is required for most of our dogs.\n\nAs far as other breeds go, the pointers are generally good with most other breeds with the exception of the Arctic breeds and bulldogs. I'm not sure why, but if there's ever an altercation in daycare between a UPP dog and another dog, it's generally one of those two breeds. It may be the difference in energy levels. It may be some ancient behavior we know nothing about...... Not sure.\n\nUtah's Perfect Pointers is a very small rescue group and doesn't have the resources to adopt to states except for the ones noted above. If you are interested in adopting a GSP please contact the closest groups below.

These girls lived their entire lives in an outdoor kennel and didn't even have names. They were given the names Sunflower & Tulip by one of our volunteer's 9-year-old daughter, who absolutely adored these two sisters.\nThey do well with other dogs and love kids but are very timid. They have been bathed and vaccinated and are scheduled to be spayed. Both are heartworm negative and have been treated for internal parasites.\nTulip is the more timid of the two and will need a little extra love. She doesn't know what to do when a leash is attached to her collar but we are working on that. Tulip is available for foster-to-adopt as well.\n\nThey are currently be boarded in Lewis Center while they learn to love their new comforts--blankets and warmth. Apply to adopt one (or both) of these sweet girls or schedule a visit.",

I am a young, male Labrador Retriever mix, about 1 year old and 46 pounds, but because I am brand new to these parts, there's not much more known about me just yet.  However, I NEED ANOTHER DOG IN MY FOREVER HOME! If you check back a little later, I'm sure my foster parents will have a lot more information to post about me. If you have any questions, feel free to send an email to info@animalalliesrescue.org, or if you just think it's love at first sight, please fill out an adoption application at this site - http://www.animalalliesrescue.org and choose me - Raja!!\n\nMy adoption fee is $350.00 and  includes all of my routine vetting, rabies and distemper/parvo vaccinations, FelV/FIV testing (kitties), deworming, spay/neuter surgery, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention, microchip, boarding and transportation costs if applicable, along with an offer for 30 days of free 24PetWatch pet insurance!\n\n*Dependent on meeting eligibility requirements: Dogs 8 weeks to 10 years of age and cats 8 weeks to 12 years of age.

I can\u2019t tell you what, but it made me very defensive with other dogs. I\u2019m manageable, when walking past but prefer they be at a distance. I am crazy smart and very treat motivated. I can run on the treadmill and will NEED a very active family. While I love kids, I want them to be where I want them to be, so older kids are probably best. Toys are my fav. I will entertain myself or would love for you to throw them for me. I would love a family who can work on my socializing and help me run out my energy. Could you be it? \n\nAdoption fee: $200\n\nFor an application to adopt this pet, please visit our website! www.heavenafterhellrescue.org \nOnce approved to adopt, the adoption fee can be paid in cash or check.\n \nAdoption includes:\n \nSpay or neuter\nHeartworm test\nAge appropriate vaccines\nRabies\nBordetella\nAge appropriate wormer\nFlea Preventative\nHeartworm preventative\nMicrochip w/registration\n \nWe cannot hold animals more than 7 days after we receive a deposit as we don't want them to miss out on a forever home.\nAdopters are required to come to us to meet the pets.

Mitch is a quiet dog who gets along well with people and other dogs.  He doesn\u2019t hear well and needs a little extra effort to get his attention to go outside and he loves to be outside exploring in the sunshine.  He is 90% house trained and does best when he has access to the outdoors every 2 or 3 hours. \n\n\n\n\n\nOur adoption fee of $125.00 helps cover expenses (vaccinations, microchips, spay/neuter, food, housing) for the homeless pets we rescue.  UAF does NOT ship or adopt our adoptables out of state (Arizona) and to ensure the best fit, UAF conducts a home visit to meet other pets and verify a safe, secure yard.\n\nTo start the process of adopting this dog or any other dog, please fill out our matchmaking form which can be accessed by copying the following address and pasting it into your browser.  Filling out this form does not obligate you to adopt.\n\nhttps://www.unitedanimalfriends.org/index.php?option=com_rsform&view=rsform&formId=2\n\nPlease email uafdogs20@gmail.com to learn more about this dog.",

That's exactly what's happened to Boss, a really sweet dog who was brought to the shelter by his family Jan. 21 because they believed he was too old, at age 11, and didn't want to take care of him anymore. The family adopted him as a puppy and taught him well -- he knows sit, stay and lay down and probably more. His family said he is house-trained and good with kids. He's a great old boy who aims to please and is in good shape for his age, except perhaps a bit chubby at 56 pounds. Boss has not been neutered and because of his age, that procedure cannot be done at the shelter. He is up-to-date on vaccinations, heartworm tested negative and will be microchipped upon adoption. Come meet him in Run 77 using ID#626969.\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

His special favorite toy is the sugar plum fairy plushie, but he is beginning to enjoy a good game of soccer as well! At his age, Bonsai still has some learning to do about manners and is working on more polite ways to get your attention rather than jumping up or nibbling on your sleeve. H has improved quite a bit in his time here, but he has plenty left to learn as well. Sometimes he gets a little nervous with all the strange masks and hats people are wearing these days, but he quickly warms up, especially for a toy or treat. Bonsai currently knows how to sit, lie down, and come when called. He is also working on stay and putting on his harness. We would not recommend a home with small children due to Bonsai's mouthing behaviors. Bonsai would also require a home without cats, as he has a high prey drive. He has participated in our playgroup program and seems to struggle to interact appropriately with other dogs, so we would recommend him as a single dog. He is sure to be plenty of love and energy all on his own!",

Really I am goofy and will answer to anything because I am a hound and we are wonderful creatures, though our noses do get the best of us. That's how I ended up here. I came in as a stray and my humans never came to reclaim me. Like every other hound these humans have met, I don't care about the other dogs and I love human attention. I walk decent on a leash, but do need to work on my house manners as I was likely an outside dog and was never really housetrained. They estimate me to be around 7 years old. I am not yet neutered, but am up to date on all vaccines and prevention!",

He is a rockstar in our shelter playgroups and has done great with the dogs in his foster home, he is a rough and rowdy player! Rebel is a mixed breed that will do best in a home with children over 12 years of age. Won't you apply for this sweet fella? Adoption questionnaires are processed in the order in which they're received. All of our dogs and puppies go home spayed/neutered, microchipped, heartworm tested (if at least 7 months old), and up to date on age-appropriate vaccinations. We do our best to update information on adoptable pets as frequently as we can. If you're interested in a specific pet, we recommend that you call the shelter and ask if he or she still is available.\nFor current adoption fees, please see our website, www.dearbornanimals.org. Adoption fee includes: age-appropriate vaccinations, spay or neuter, microchip, ID tag, fecal / worming, basic physical and behavior assessment.

            "description": "Whether you're an experienced dog owner or someone looking for their first four-legged buddy, please consider Buster Brown. Just 1-year-old, he's a 55-lb. mixed breed package of pup who's a rough and tumble guy. While he's sweet and generally upbeat, he's still young and in need of some training and guidance. He's familiar with \"\"sit\"\" and \"\"stay\"\" but needs needs additional attention. Because he can be jumpy when he's excited, he'd do best in a home with children over 8 years of age. Apply today for an appointment to meet Buster Brown. Adoption questionnaires are processed in the order in which they're received. All of our dogs and puppies go home spayed/neutered, microchipped, heartworm tested (if at least 7 months old), and up to date on age-appropriate vaccinations.

He was diagnosed with Perianal Fistulas. This condition can be very painful for a dog.\n\nRocky is going to require a game plan.\n\nStarting with regulating him with medication along with a perfect diet. Rocky is not stable yet, but we are hoping by having him be in a foster home, he will be able to get the medical care and attention he needs in order to thrive.\n\nThis is going to be a long slow road starting with setting him up with a vet that is familiar with perianal fistulas and can help with a direction.\n\nIf you would like to donate to Rockys care we would really appreciate it and it would go to a good cause.\n\nRocky is not yet available for adoption but please donate.\n \n\nYou can visit calpaws.org and press the donate button.\n\nRocky and Cal Paws would like to thanks you for your support.",

            "description": "Irresistibly cute ears? Check. Cool color pattern? Check. Adorable stubby legs? Check. Hi, my name is Bear and I am about 11 months old and 31 pounds. I've had no stability in my short life so I put on a nervous facade when meeting new people but once I warm up and my true personality shines (which will take time) you'll see I'm a loving goofball! I would love to live with another dog who is outgoing and could help me gain some confidence. I would do best in a calm home environment with mature people. I would benefit greatly from attending doggy classes! I could learn new things, bond with you, socialize with others, and exercise my mind all at the same time! If I sound like your kind of guy, please apply today! \n\nPlacement Recommendations:\nOwner Experience Level: Experienced\nCats: Yes \nDogs: Yes\nKids: High School +Want to know more? Please call us! We've found that back and forth via email regarding a specific animal is not always effective and quick because our email is not monitored on a regular basis. So, for specific information regarding this wonderful pet, please contact one of our adoption counselors at (715) 232-9790. They are available between the hours of 8 am and 7 pm (7 days a week, excluding holidays). Thanks for your interest!",

She was found as a stray and has made her way here, where she has acclimated quickly and loves to wear a sweater or coat on cold, snowy days. Cindy is a huge cuddle bug! She loves to be near her humans and will stare up at you with her huge golden eyes until you can't help but pet her. Cindy is a little nervous the first few minutes she meets you but she warms up quickly. She would do well with a family who is home a good portion of the time (even after things go back to normal post Covid) since she loves to spend time with you. During the week she spends most days in my office and in the evenings she follows wherever the family is. She is the bestest girl with a sweet disposition and would love to become your new best friend.\n\n \n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

            "description": "This is fun loving Dante/ Quincy. He is a terrier mix, abt 2-3 yrs old, gets along well with other dogs & loves to play & cuddle. He is not quick to trust people and takes a little patience and time to get to know. He is very protective of his family & house and does not take to strangers ready, so it is important that his adoptive family work with him and understand his anxiety, quirks and signals. He needs to be with adults that will be patient & kind to earn his trust. Once he trusts you, he will be your best buddy. We recommend he go to a family without small children and one that is a little more dog experienced to help him with his trust & anxiety issues. It would be best to have a fence since he doesn't like strangers. He is a great dog, but not one to be instantly your best friend. As his foster, I can say he is worth your patience. He is fully vetted, neutered, and microchipped. \n\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm tested negative (age 7 months and older) and microchipped. We do not ship or transport. A dog's adoption donation is $200. There is a $5 fee for credit/debit cards.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please fill out an online application here: www.heartlandsmallanimalrescue.org/canine-application.html",

She is very much slower to warm up with men. Chloe is good with dogs and cats. No children please. Chloe previously belonged to an older woman who could no longer take care of her. She had her to the vet for regular care and checkups and occational allergy shots (a mix of depo-medrol and vetalog that cost $10).\n\nAll available dogs are spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm tested, and given a broad spectrum dewormer .\n\nThe adoption fee for dogs is $150 for Adult dogs 15lbs, $100 for Seniors 8yr+, and $200 for Small breed dogs and Puppies 6 months \n\nIf you decide to apply for this or another animal, you can complete the application online here https://www.petstablished.com/adoption_form/570/generic\n\nIf you would like to email or call, you can reach us here: mustangshelterfriends@gmail.com or 405-578-4738\nOur volunteers would love to talk to you about available pets, but please allow time for them to get back to you, they do this in their free time. Thank you for chosing to adopt!",

In addition to his dashing good looks, Ozark has all the qualities of a sophisticated and distinguished gentleman. Not only is he gorgeous, he is also a friendly, curious, and resilient boy and ready to start the next chapter of his life in his forever home. Ozark can be a little shy meeting new people, and prefers that his new friends take things slowly, but earning his trust is worth the effort! He is sweet, loyal, and happy to see his regular volunteer and staff friends during his daily outings at APA!. If you're looking for a walking companion, Ozark would be the perfect buddy - he loves getting outside, taking easy-paced strolls with plenty of stops to sniff all the things. He's not in a rush, and just wants to enjoy the moment and explore his surroundings. On a recent sleepover with a staff member, Ozark was noted to be a quiet, well-mannered house guest and enjoyed looking out the window and watching all the activity going on outside. He also likes riding in the car playing with toys! He's really just a sweet senior guy that is hoping to find a low-key home with a nice adult or two to enjoy his golden years. If you're looking for a companion who is both ready for adventures and for relaxing at home, ask about Ozark today!",

This smart, active youngster loves going for walks with his human friends and is working on his leash skill, learning fast. He's a sweet boy who loves affection and enjoys pleasing and playing with his humans and with other dogs. In his previous foster home, he also loved playing tug-o-war and chewing his toys and Kong. This mischievous boy gives his humans great kisses. He's also learning to answer to 'sit' and to pause jumping up on his human friends. He's also been happy to go to his crate for cookies and toys. Franky hopes for a home with active adults and teenagers who can take him for walks and hiking adventures. He'd also love an experienced dog buddy who can continue showing him the ropes, and a big backyard for zoomies and playtime. Come give him some petting and cookies and he'll follow you right home!",

Our adoption center is located next to CAL Ranch at 232 North Jones (I-95) Suite 170.    \n\nGroucho Marks is about  10 mo old and weighs about  101 lbs.   He came into a shelter as a stray.  \n He is VERY high energy and pulls on leash.  We have tools for the pulling.  He is very sweet natured and a HUGE goofball who thinks he weighs 10 lbs.   He is a bit mouthy in play, so children should be over 10 yrs old.  He has done well on the dogs tests with social dogs, but did not do well on the cat test. \n \nHe needs a home where you have experience with large sized power breeds. This breed does drool, so make sure you are cool with that.   More will be known about me soon.   \n\nA Path 4 Paws holds adoption events at our Adoptions Store,  located at 232 N. Jones Blvd, Suite 170  right next to CAL Ranch (North Jones/ I-95).   Please bring your dog(s) for a meet and greet (if applicable)  Please bring your entire family so everyone can meet. \n\nIf you are interested in Groucho Marks, please contact dogrescuelv@hotmail.com to confirm the dog you are interested in,  will be attending that particular event.  We have limited space at the store, therefore we can not take every dog out to the event.\n\nGroucho Marks is spayed/neutered, has current vaccinations and includes a microchip, deworming and 2 free vet visits.  Adoption fee applies.  Please make sure you have read the information listed on the homepage for requirements and restrictions. \n\nFoster homes & volunteers are always needed.  Please contact us regarding how you can help by fostering or volunteering for our organization.",

She loves to play with her stuffed toys showing her puppy side and enjoys her outdoor walks as well. At 50 pounds she doesn't know she is not a lap dog but really prefers to be. She wants to snuggle with her human all day long if allowed. She can't get enough pets and has fallen asleep under my hand numerous times.. A firm but kind voice is all the correction she needs to guide her in the right direction like when she wants to wrestle with the cat. Evie is just a big Love Bug who needs a lively family of her own who will include her in their daily activities. Evie would do best being the only dog in an adult household or with a similarly active dog.  Additionally, a household with kids, requires they be 12 years and up due to her exuberant energy.Evie is a 4-year-old active girl just looking for her next family adventure.

Additionally, Evie's ideal home is in an adult household or in a family with respectful children 12 years or older.\n\n(A $300 adoption fee is required.) If you are interested in this dog, please go to the Adopt page of our website where you will find a link to an adoption application form  https://www.chewdogrescue.org/index.php/component/rsform/form/5-adoption-application-form\n \nIf you have previously submitted an application form, there is no need to re-apply. Just let us know you're interested in this dog. We do our best to match families and dogs so everyone is pleased and the placement is permanent. We reserve the right to refuse an applicant if the home situation is incompatible with the needs of the rescue dog. Rescue is about doing our best for the dog. We do home and reference checks.  All of our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and are up to date with current vaccinations, before being placed in their forever homes.\n\nFOSTER HOMES NEEDED! We are always looking for good foster homes. Our rescue is foster based and we can always save more dogs if we have foster homes for them to go into. It is not a long term commitment. We have been able to find good forever homes in a short time. We also welcome volunteers who can help transport dogs and help with our outreach and fund raising efforts. Please contact us if you can help.",

She allows all over handling and seeks attention on her own once she becomes comfortable. \n\nShe came into the shelter with other dogs, but really does not seem to like other dogs outside of her pack.  She would do best as the only dog in the home.   She did not do well on the cat test.  More will be known about me soon.   \n\nA Path 4 Paws holds adoption events at our Adoptions Store,  located at 232 N. Jones Blvd, Suite 170  right next to CAL Ranch (North Jones/ I-95).   Please bring your dog(s) for a meet and greet (if applicable)  Please bring your entire family so everyone can meet. \n\nIf you are interested in Banana, please contact dogrescuelv@hotmail.com to confirm the dog you are interested in,  will be attending that particular event.  We have limited space at the store, therefore we can not take every dog out to the event.\n\nBanana is spayed/neutered, has current vaccinations and includes a microchip, deworming and 2 free vet visits.  Adoption fee applies.  Please make sure you have read the information listed on the homepage for requirements and restrictions. \n\nFoster homes & volunteers are always needed.

At my age I\u2019m still considered a puppy. I\u2019ve come a long way, considering I had no training from my previous owners and when the grand-kids came to live with us I was kicked out the door. I lived my life on a chain during the day and spend my nights in a cold garage. However, life is very different here at the rescue. Once here all of the mats and filth I came with were clipped and washed away.  I stood on the grooming table like a gentleman while I was clipped, bathed and blown dry.  I had a pedicure and my coat is glorious!   I have blossomed and I have been doing well with my training. I like to play with my neighbor dogs and I\u2019m really kind of goofy, but I have a heart of gold. I promise that if you will spend the time to continue my training, it will help me to become the dog you want me to be.  I promise to make you proud of me and will work very hard to please you I am also very handsome, not the least bit shy, and would love to sit in your lap all 109 pounds of me!  I just wanna be with you and like all the dogs here, I just want to be loved and cared about.   I will work very hard to please you. The only thing larger than my stature is my heart and I want to give it to someone who will take good care of it. Is that you?",

            "description": "NO LONGER ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS!\n\nMeet Ava! Someone saw this cute, fluffy puppy standing by a dumpster, all alone, and took her in. They reached out to us to find her a home. She was healthy when we had her checked out, so we suspect she was not on her own for very long.\n\nAva is currently living in a foster home with teenage kids and another dog. She loves playing with other dogs and would love to have another pup companion in her new home to show her the ropes. Ava's foster mom shared this update:\n\n\"Ava is a perfect mix of playful and snuggly. When she's awake, she's energetic, bouncy, curious and wants to be near and touching people. She is mostly quiet using her bark only as a way to tell you she is not done playing yet. She's a great sleeper...She sleeps often and hard throughout the day, and sleeps through the night without a peep. She sleeps in a penned area we have in our family room and will go over to use her pee pee pads 90% of the time. Ava just wants to play with the other dogs and is a very social pup. She comes bounding over to Lily with her tail wagging the whole time. Ava looks like a lab but her fur is thicker and fluffier than a lab. She is mostly black with a couple of tufts of white on her chest and the tips of her paws. She is a very sweet girl.\"\n\nThis pretty girl needs a fun, active family ready for puppy mode and committed to training. She is very cute now but will grow to be a strong and energetic dog who needs a committed handler. Another established, social dog in the home is always helpful for them to learn from, but she's a pretty social pup, and could be an only dog too.\n\nRequirements:\n\nActive family\n\nLarge breed dog experience\n\nFlexible, puppy-friendly schedule\n\nWill only be adopted to families in the DC metro and surrounding areas\n\nNOTE: Ava is still too young to be spayed, but having her spayed at the appropriate age will be part of her adoption terms. We will require that proof of spay is provided to the rescue at the appropriate time.\n\nVictoria will be coming to N. VA on 2/6/21, and we plan for her to go straight home. More pics coming soon.\n\nApply today!\n\nBREED ESTIMATE: Black Lab Mix\nGENDER: Female\nAPPROXIMATE WEIGHT: 7 lbs (will be around 50lbs fully grown)\nAPPROXIMATE AGE: ~9 weeks\nCOAT TYPE: medium\nADOPTION FEE: $400\nOTHER INFO: UTD on shots/dewormed/microchipped\nLOCATION: Rock Hill, SC\n\nFOR MORE INFO OR TO ADOPT: Please go to https://adopt.worthydog.org and complete the application.\n\nYou can also help save dogs like this one by becoming a foster, providing a rescue dog with a temporary home and giving them the love and care they need until they are permanently adopted. Every person who fosters is directly responsible for saving the life of a dog, because we can only save as many dogs as we have foster families available to welcome them into their homes. If you think you might be interested in becoming a foster and want to learn more, please go to https://foster.worthydog.org and fill out an application.\n\nWorthy Dog Rescue is an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue that primarily adopts to families in the DC Metro area.",

We play so well together. I love love love humans and can get along with pretty much anyone and anything! I love snuggling and giving kisses. I'm very much a loving pup and I can't wait to find my very own family to love on. I don't go too far from my foster family because I love being around them so much. I'm not really sure what \"potty trained means but I don't ever do my business inside. I guess because I was a street dog I'm used to doing my business outside! I sleep in my kennel at night and when my foster family isn't in the house because I'm not too confident yet by myself.\n\nBasically, if you're looking for a snuggle bud that loves you unconditionally and is perfectly fine being a couch potato with a walk thrown in there everyday, I am YOUR GUY.\n\nBrent is a Male 2 y/o male Shepherd/Chihuahua mix and weighs 30 lbs",

Chloe is one of the extreme lucky ones. In Russia their hope for a home or long term survival is very dismal. The situation in Russia is pure desperation and the virus has made it even more extremely challenging to save these precious dogs. On January 21st, her dreams came true, and she arrived to Los Angeles and to LIFE to now search for a new future and a life she once only dreamed possible. Chloe is a sweet playful adorable girl who is ready for her new chance. Our adoption fee is $600 which helps offset some of the tremendous costs to get her here. She is spayed, microchipped, and vaccinated. If you are interested in adopting, please go to our website and fill out an online application form. https://form.jotform.com/oscarlucy/dog-adoption-app",

He currently lives in an apartment, but Sammy is used to and yearns to have a backyard again.  The apartment said it was ok to have Sammy there, but then the neighbors started complaining and they have ordered Sammy removed from the apartment.  \n\n*Sammy needs to be the only dog in the household.*  \n\nHe is well trained, and was raised as a \"serve and protect\" dog.  \n\nHe is up to date with shots, and has been neutered. \n\nSammy's current owner has until Feb 1st to find a new home for him.  \n\nWe are accepting applications for both fostering and adoption due to urgent nature of the situation. \n\nEmail: \n\nrescue@mayte.com\n\nmichael@maytesrescue.com",

The multicolored mommy is an  Australian Cattle dog mix.  She was eating out of trash cans and something tore up her stomach so she spent quite some time in the hospital. She had it bad in Mexico but that only made her more special.  She became appreciative of helping with her puppies and everything we do for .  She learned to find security from being in my lap. They only weigh approximately 35-40lb. She is happy now but not as happy as having their own home to give them what they really deserve ? Will be available in a week.",

            "description": "If you're searching for the most devoted and loving best friend ever.... Kai is the pup you want to have around! Kai, at just about 10 months to 1 year old and 45 lbs is just naturally a lover ....when he looks at you with those dark, expressive eyes and sweet smile, your heart just has to melt. Kai is a beautiful Red Heeler/Labrador Retriever mix with all the traits that make these very smart and personality-plus dogs super- popular and beloved breed mixes.\n   \nKai enjoys his time with his foster mom so much that he joins her just about everywhere she goes...it's so important to Kai to be a true best friend! Kai cuddles close on the couch (or snuggling close on the bed all night is perfect!) with his beautiful head draped over his favorite person's leg. An occasional kiss from Kai is inevitable. He's a sensitive and very sweet pup who derives so much joy from his time spent with his people and his doggy friends.\n \nKai is a young, healthy guy who will love his family with all his heart. He enjoys canine friends as well and would love nothing more than to play hard and then lie together with his doggy friend in the sunshine enjoying a beautiful day. Kai will have so much fun exploring and taking long walks along the Colorado trails. He is always open to new activities with a never-ending positive attitude...just say the word and up Kai jumps for a car ride, a fun hike or just a sociable walk around the neighborhood. \n\nKai'a foster mom had the following to brag about this sweet guy:  Meet Kai, the energetic, super-loving and fun as can be Herding Dog/Retriever mix. Kai was a personal surrender to the shelter from a woman that is taking a new and very demanding job that will require very long hours and trips away from home very often.\n\nKai is a very sweet and loving guy...he's really good with other dogs and loves to play hard with them. Kai is also great with people.. both adults and children alike! This guy is a strong and energetic pup so therefore most likely better with a family that has older children only or with retirees that love the outdoors..walking, hiking and playing hard with Kai. He would love nothing more than some serious fetch-playing or agility is a natural for this herding dog mix. \n\nKai is super-smart (just a natural part of being a Cattle Dog!). He knows sit and down on command and  is also good around food..no aggression or food guarding at all. You can take his food bowl, or ask him to sit while you place his food bowl down, and he will wait until told OK. Kai is also crate trained and house trained as well as very respectful of personal property. This active dog is definitely an exercise outside guy...a very active family that loves to run, hike, snowshoe or any activity that brings a family and dog together would be perfect for Kai!   \n\nKai is an extremely affectionate and loving dog! We would love to see him in a home with a family (older kids preferred so there's no tail-pulling or awkward handling) or active retirees who have the time and love for a very loyal and kind puppy. We'd hate to see Kai left alone all day while his family works full-time outside of the home...he seems to be too sensitive for that type of arrangement. Kai will thrive on spending the days near his people..getting loved up periodically throughout the day.\n\nFarfel's Rescue would like to see Kai in a home where he'll get consistent stimulation, exercise and tons of loving hugs. A positive reinforcement group training class promotes great behavior, bonding and confidence for a young guy whose self-esteem will fly high while he masters his skills. Training is so important in the future behavior of every dog..it's for this reason that we're unwilling to adopt Kai out to a family that doesn't make this loving choice.  Farfel's is happy to provide a list of positive reinforcement/force- free trainers in your area.\n \nKai has a stunning red merle coat that currently shelter-sad. This beautiful guy will require a lifelong commitment to periodic baths/brushing and excellent nutrition (5 star food and a daily salmon oil supplement are great lifelong protocols for coat care and general health) to keep Kai's coat cottony-soft and super-healthy.\n \nKai will be arriving on transport in Denver on Wednesday 2/10/2020. Applications are currently being accepted for this very sweet, loving and loyal best friend. An application can be found at http://farfels.com/farfels-rescue/adoption-form/. If interested, please fill out completely and submit.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE** If you're truly interested in adopting Kai please be sure to fill out our Farfel's Rescue adoption application found at the link above or at farfels.com. Adoption site applications such as Petfinder, Rescueme and Adoptapet don't provide enough information and therefore aren't useful. Our Farfel's application is the only initial tool that we have to determine a great match for this very deserving dog. We're sorry, but in most cases, we're unable to get back to those that don't submit our Farfel's Rescue adoption application. Thanks very much for choosing rescue.",

            "description": "Patsy is a 1 year old Jack Russell Terrier mix weighing 30 lbs. Patsy has a lot of puppy energy.  Patsy likes to give kisses, loves her belly rubbed, and likes to play with toys that are squeaky or tennis balls. Patsy is crate trained and house trained.\n\nPatsy is unsure of unfamiliar people and new environments so she needs some one to help her get over her fears and requires slow introduction to unfamiliar people.  \n\nPatsy is fostered with a smaller dog and plays well with the smaller dog in her foster home. Patsy is not fostered with small children or cats.  \n\nPatsy is very sweet and loving girl once she gets to know you. Patsy is just waiting to find her forever home. Patsy\u2019s adoption fee is $400.\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

She's a bulldog/pittie mix, plus maybe a little boxer and who knows what else. This girl hasn't had a great life, she's been bounced around to multiple homes and when she came to us she was underweight and her coat told us a tale of neglect. She's put on weight and her coat is looking so much better with good nutrition and veterinary care. She takes a few minutes to warm up to new people. Treats are the best way to win her heart, Daisy is verrrry food motivated. She loves toys and is perfectly content to amuse herself. Daisy is a strong girl and needs work on her leash manners. She's not a big fan of the great outdoors, so she's best suited to a home with a fenced yard where she can run outside, take care of business and get right back inside to her toys. We think she's best suited to a quieter home as an only dog. Daisy is fully housebroken and knows the \"sit\" command. If you'd like to meet Daisy, please fill out a foster-to-adopt application at\ndreamhouserescue.org.\n\nAll of our fully-vetted adoptable dogs go to prospective homes for a one-week trial foster-to-adopt period to make sure the dog and home are the right fit before an adoption is finalized. We only adopt dogs into homes where all current pets are spayed/neutered and current on vaccines and heartworm and flea and tick prevention. We do check veterinary references to make sure adopters are compliant with standard veterinary care.",

He has been vaccinated, dewormed and neutered. He has been started on slow kill heartworm treatment. He is exhibiting a bit of anxiety at the vet clinic but who can blame him. He was most likely dumped with his buddy, saw his buddy hit and killed and now is in an unknown place. And he is probably just about a year and a half old, not even a grown up. One of the vet techs is going to try taking him home to foster to see if that helps. So we should know more about him soon.\n\nIf you would like to give this boy the life he should have had from the beginning please complete our application,\nwww.scoutshonor.org",

            "description": "Maddie is a 4 month old energizer bunny. She has a lot of energy due to being a puppy. She will need a home that is ready to walk her, play with her and show her how to use her energy in an appropriate way. Maddie will need to be in a home that has no small children (preferably all kids over the age of 9). Maddie does have some behaviors that she will need some work on; however, they can be fixed with patience and training.\n\nAre you interested in rescuing Maddie - please email us at VegasRootsRescue@gmail.com",
