Hey, you don't have to spend tons of bucks on my wardrobe! Can you mend my broken heart since my owner never came to get me? I can't understand it since I always have a smile on my face and am a LOVER. You just can't stop me from dancing or jive talking; I just want to be staying alive with a loving family! So, let me show you how deep is my love and come get me!\nHere is what the crew has to say about me:This is Barry who is probably around 2 to 3.He is very nice and friendly. Mellow too. He was found on the lam so his history is a mystery! Handsome feller too.\nPlease call Faustina at 806-664-1615 since she can give you details about the animals! If you call the Pampa animal shelter please refer to the animals by their number listed after the names. Thank you for you cooperation!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Master Beckley (or 'Beck' as he is fondly called by his foster family) is a 4-yr old small Wire Terrier mix, possibly some Jack Russell.\nBeck is a sort of 'special needs' boy, as he was born with luxating patellas on both of his hind legs. What this means is that he walks like a 'crab' on his hind legs - so, he definitely has a \"unique\" gait. But, this does not slow him down at all. He runs and plays and does just fine. As he gets older, he will likely develop arthritis in his rear legs sooner than a dog without this condition.\nThis being said, Beck is a very sweet, happy and lovable boy. He particularly loves women. With men, it can take him some time to warm up to them, but it really depends. In his original foster home, he was fine with his foster dad (who is 69), but Beck seems to have a trust problem with younger males.\nAs noted, Beckley adores women, and, as you can see in some of his pictures, he loves his sweaters. He actually prefers to wear outfits as not!!! He sleeps with his foster Grandmother and gets along well with the other dogs in the house (a Cattle Dog and a very large English Bulldog/Am. Staff Terrier).\nBeck is about 90% house trained, as the cold weather/snow is hard on him to go outside. However, his foster Mom does make sure he goes out on a regular basis.\nBeck is a wonderful little man who needs a person who is willing to dote on him and love him for who the sweet, affectionate little guy that he is. We believe he would do best in a household with women only, or an older couple. Please consider making this sweet boy become a cherished member of your home.\nIf you have the time, willingness and ability to provide a loving, nurturing home to Beckley for his whole life, we'd love to hear from you. To pursue Beckley's adoption, you will need to register on www.safeatlast.net. (Click Register on the left-hand side of our homepage.) When you receive your password, please log back on to our website to complete the Safe at Last online adoption application. (Click Forms/Applications on the left-hand side of our home page.) Once we have your application, if we feel your home is a good match for Beckley, we will contact you by email to schedule the phone interview to commence the review process. Our process is very straightforward but does involve the phone interview, reference checks and a home assessment. An adoption fee of $425 also applies.\nPlease be advised that you cannot meet Beckley until you have been approved to adopt. We cannot consider you until you have submitted the completed Safe at Last online adoption application. Delay in submitting your application will put you at a disadvantage to other potentially qualified applicants.\nFinally, Beckley is being fostered in the Oneonta/Morris NY area. Approved adopters are required to go to the foster home to complete the adoption. Adopters are also required to adhere to all COVID-19 safety protocols (including mask) when at the foster home.\nThank you for your interest in this sweet boy!\nNY Rescue Registry No. RR 087.",

DOB tbd), male, 75 lbs (but thinks he is 10lbs)., vetted, is or will be neutered, and micro-chipped. Apollo was saved on New Years Eve from a very neglectful and isolating situation in Vermont. He was kept tied up in one room of a house after being abandoned by his owner in an apartment. He had sores on his legs we can only guess was a result of boredom. Apollo has missed out on so much since a puppy and a young dog! He is learning and is in process of catching up with our Trainer. Apollo is a big boy with a big bark but is a teddy bear at heart! His best home would be Intermediate Experience, active, no cats (loves to play and chase), would be strong (he is a strong boy) and he would be the only pet. Stay tuned for more information as Apollo is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in fostering or adopting Apollo please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out his Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

He does have an occasional accident when not on schedule. Good with kids and people. Archie needs a very active home where he won't be left unattended for the entire day.

I\u2019m a pretty big boy (70 pounds and growing) and I\u2019m still learning how to control my floppy puppy body. I fall over and run into things a lot, but my foster mom and dad think it\u2019s really cute and funny! Even though I\u2019m a big boy, I think I\u2019m the perfect size lap dog and love to lay on you, sit on you and snuggle and give you kisses non-stop.\n\nMy foster mom says I\u2019m really smart. I didn\u2019t have many rules before I came to her house, but I\u2019ve already learned sit, paw and down. I also sit and wait to eat my meals every day because I\u2019m a very polite boy!\n\nI\u2019m a PRO at potty training. I learned REALLY fast!!! I was a super nervous about my crate when I first came to live with my foster mom, but it\u2019s just because I prefer to be right next to humans instead! I\u2019m getting better with my crate every day and now sleep in my crate all through the night without crying.\n\nI live with two dogs in my foster home and I LOVE them, but I\u2019m still learning some manners, so you may need to be patient with me. I\u2019m perfectly fine being your only Buddy, but if I have a dog sibling, they need to be tolerant and willing to help me learn how to play without getting too excited.\n\nThanks for reading about me, I can\u2019t wait to meet you and see if I can be your best \u201cBuddy\u201d for life!\n\nYou must be over 21 and a home owner to adopt me.

Magnum has been taught to sit when asked and with some training and patience he will certainly learn more commands.  He is playful too and enjoys being loved up.  \nMagnum's ideal family will be willing to provide him a structured home, where he can continue to learn good manners and build a solid trusting relationship with his family.  Adopters with German Shepard experience are preferred. At this time, Magnum will need to be the only pet in his new home.  Due to his energy level, tendency to jump up looking for attention, and leash manners, we recommend any children in his forever home are teenagers.  \nBreed experience preferred.",

She has been mostly an outside dog, but since being in foster care she has done wonderfully in the house. Annie is using a doggie door to go potty and has yet to have an accident in the house. She has shown to be good with dogs of all sizes, people, and has been around children as young as 6 yrs old. We think she would do best with a doggie playmate. Annie is a little fearful of new situations but is overcoming her fears with good positive experiences. She is a very sweet and loving girl!\n\nIf you are interested in applying for Annie, please use the application link below. \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zGtCUUqOvBHxQtIy7j4-qA_W-b_PIitAaDXAf8MuKHg/edit\n\n",

The pet owner/rescue/shelter and new owner shall make all arrangements on transferring the pet, information on history, vaccines, etc.\n\nName: Buddy (also answers to Butters) Age: ~10 Weight: 90 pounds\n\nColor: Brown with a few white spots Gets along with: All adults and older children (10+)\n\nContact: 720-985-7018 or AdoptSweetBuddy@gmail.com\n\nBuddy couldn't be a sweeter dog! He's older but has a lot of life left in him. He loves going on walks, running like a goof around the yard, and naps! The perfect home for Buddy is where he can nap, relax, and get pets. He needs to be the only pet in the home and any children need to be over 10. He is very friendly with everyone he meets but doesn't like kids climbing on him so he would be best in a home with older or no children. He loves sleeping in the sun and will follow it around the house throughout the day or lay outside in it when it's warm out. He LOVES a nice comfy dog bed but is just as happy to lay on blankets or a pile of laundry. Buddy is crate trained and can hang in his crate when you're away during the day or be left out, he'll just take naps the whole time. He likes stuffed toys and soft rubber ones, he is missing some teeth so he doesn't chew through them very quickly. He also loves all treats and will gladly eat medicine if you put it in some American cheese. He will follow you around the house because he loves being near people. Buddy is scared of fireworks and loud noises, creating a place for him to hide when that's happening really helps him. It's best if he gets to go outside to potty before fireworks start. He is also scared of any size vacuum and will run away from them. He is food motivated and has puppy dog eyes down! He'll eat any kind of treat and will love you for it! He's a great dog and deserves a great home!",

He enjoys a little treat when he does. He also will lay down when asked. We know that if you make this a fun thing, he will learn so much more. We recently started to see if he knows how to shake paw, and is already showing eagerness to learn.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about him, contact his foster mom Liz at 214-616-6128. \n\nIf you would like to be considered to adopt him, fill out an application at www.shelter2rescue.org",

            "description": "DOB: November 2012\nWeight: 28 lbs\nDisposition: Smart, Friendly, Low energy\n\nAldrin is the canine embodiment of beauty and brains. This handsome fella is not only quite the looker, but he already has his basic commands down pat! We originally rescued Aldrin and his astronaut friends from San Bernardino in September 2013. He was adopted shortly after, but returned to us many years later. Aldrin is great with other dogs, and is currently in a very large play group with other small/medium dogs ranging from 6-46 pounds. He is housebroken and knows sit and shake on command. Aldrin has a tendency to nip at hands if he feels uncomfortable in a situation, so for this reason, he is not suited for a home with small children. Aldrin is an intelligent, stately, calm, easygoing, and sweet boy who enjoys human attention. Don't be surprised if he leans up against you asking for more petting and belly rubs! \n\nAldrin LOVES hanging out in the yard and while he needs to be an indoor pet, we will only entertain families with a yard for this reason. He will do best with an individual or couple of an assertive nature or with experience to correct any potential behavior related to nipping.\n\nIf you'd like to meet Aldrin, please visit www.thebarkinglot.net/adoptTo initiate the adoption process for this dog, please complete our online application by clicking below. Your adoption coordinator will respod to you via email once they receive your application: www.thebarkinglot.net/adopt",

I want a purpose! A job where I would be outside would be very nice! Picture this! You, me, doing something! I could carry your tools for you and happily assist you! Need to work on your truck? Cool, I have your back! Need to fix some fencing? Awesome, I'll help you! I love being outside and would LOVE to be in a home where we can hike, fish, camp, and explore. Being the only pet in the home would make me so incredibly happy. Actually, that's EXACTLY what I want. A home with me and you. I need to be the only baby in the home! I would thrive in a home with kids 14 and older.All cats and dogs adopted from the Chequamegon Humane Association are spayed or neutered, up-to-date on age appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, and microchipped. Dogs are tested for heartworm and cats are tested for FeLV/FIV (results negative unless otherwise noted). A tax-deductible adoption fee of $150 is required for adult dogs, puppies are $200, and dogs over the age of 10 are $85.

I am around two years old, border collie mix with possibly some cattle dog. I have seven babies, who are named after GS cookies. I am taking really good care of my babies, with the help of my foster mom. I am a very gentle girl who loves attention. I am leash trained and am housebroken ( if I get excited I may go potty a little in the house). I get along with my foster fur sisters and brother. I don't react to cats, unless they are running by, then I want to chase them, but mom keeps me on a leash. I will cuddle in your lap and give you love.\nThank you for your interest in a Sandi Paws Rescue, Inc.

            "description": "This gorgeous redhead is Mavery, she is around 2 yrs old. This sweet girl was abandoned and showed up on someone front porch and was looking for help. One of our fosters was asked to try to help her find a forever home from there. She is a sweet friendly girl who loves people the more attention the better for this sweetie. She does also get along with other dogs but does prefer smaller dogs vs bigger ones, she was playing with a tiny Yorkie at the home she had went up to. We think perhaps bigger dogs just intimidate her is all, and we do not know about cats. She is now been completely vetted and ready to come to WI and hopefully find a home of her own, a home to feel safe and wanted in.

She is a medium sized girl around 38# with gorgeous sky blue eyes and around 2.5-3 yrs old. She loves other dogs and loves to play and we believe she will need another friendly dog and a fenced in yard to help her fully acclimate to a new home.

            "description": "Poor Bolt found himself at the City Shelter after he'd been picked up as a stray with a broken leg. Shelter staff loved him and his exuberant nature and did their best to give him the time to find rescue placement. We are so glad we could help. \n\nDespite the splint being changed, Bolts leg didn't heal due to the severe nature of the fracture. The vet recommended an amputation and the staff at Marley's agreed that Bolt's quality of life would improve with that treatment. No longer in pain, Bolt has recovered from the amputation and adjusted to the absence of that leg.\n\nBolt is looking for a wonderful forever home. His ideal home will be an active family looking for a fun and active pup to join their ranks. He's compatible with other canine friends. We feel he'd likely case kitties. \n\nOnce healed Bolt will be looking for a wonderful forever home. His ideal home will be an active family looking for a fun and active pup to join their ranks. Once he's more healed we will dog test him to ensure he's compatible with other canine friends. We feel he'd likely case kitties. Stay tuned for updates as Bolt recovers.

He walks pretty well on a leash and is looking for his second chance with a lucky family or friend. He weighs in at 41 pounds, but isn't quite finished growing yet.\n\nHenry was surrendered to us for responsible rehoming when his person signed up to join the military. We are certainly committed to finding him a great home. He tested negative for heart worms and has begun his puppy vaccinations. He is also receiving monthly parasite preventatives and will be neutered prior to adoption. Please call us at 580-252-7387 or send us a Facebook message, if you would like to meet handsome Henry!For more information, please email Stephens County Humane Society at schs@att.net, or call us at 580-252-7387 (PETS). Our animals are spayed/neutered, UTD on shots, and treated for ticks, & fleas. Cats are tested for FeLV & FIV; and dogs are tested for heart worms.\n\nNormal adoption fee for cats is $75.00; and $100.00 for dogs, but we frequently have specials running and/or animals who have had their adoption fee sponsored, so ... call us!

Realizing this was ter and his feline foster sisters! He will be 12 months in December and is crated trained and house broken. Gunner is neutered and UTD on all shots. no life for a dog, she turned to us for help. We have had Gunner for over a three months now, and he is improving by the day. He did not have very manner house manners and he would do juuuuust about anything to get your attention! But we have been working on that, and with a little love and patience, he is responding well to training and becoming a great dog. He is a goofBALL, and loves belly rubs and playing fetch with balls, sticks, and his favorite new tire toy. He has shown zero signs of agression and gets long well with his canine foster sister and like to taunt the cats, but is not aggressive towards them.",

He was terribly stressed out and was becoming super overwhelmed with fear. \n \n\nHappy Feet Pet Rescue welcomed him and placed him in a wonderful foster home. He was so overwhelmed with his stint in the shelter that he needed 24-48 hours to fully decompress and start to trust his new humans. He stayed in his crate for quite a bit before feeling courageous enough. \n \n\nAfter his decompression time he became the sweetest, loving, and oh so cuddly companion. He is fully potty trained, loves walks, and enjoys hanging out on the couch. \n \n\nSince Charlie lacks being able to see people approach, he relys on verbal commands or alerts. If he is surprised or gets nervous with a fast approach he may nip out of fear. \n \n\nWe are recommending a home with no children, no other animals, and ideally a calm environment. \n \n\nIf you can provide Charlie Boy a wonderful home please visit Happy Feet Pet Rescue website for an adoption application.",

I was then taken to TBC with a threat of what they would do to me if they didn't say yes. This has been the most wonderful new beginning in my young life!! I love everything and everyone. I'm small beautiful and sweet. Luna has been with us long enough now that her skin issues have all been resolved!!

            "description": "Hello, my name is Greta and I'm a spunky little 10 week old hound puppy. I love to run and play and snuggle and sniff everything and everyone. I even met my new foster cat siblings and thought they were pretty neat!\nI would love another dog in my foster home to show me the ropes and to play with. I am a true hound and as I grow will show my true natures- chasing, and baying. I will need a family who can help me channel my natural instincts and expose me to all the great parts of being a loved family member- with positive reward. \n\nGreta is a Hound puppy. Hounds are adorable and also high-energy. Hounds are typically bred for hunting and will likely have a very high prey drive, be vocal, and will need to have access to resources that will satisfy their energy level. Potential adopters should have a good understanding of the needs that come with having an active puppy and those of a working/hunting breed as well. Positive exposure and reinforcement are a must in her adoptive home, along with a solid plan for training and further socializing with other pets of all ages and sizes. \n\nTo be considered, please start by applying online at caws.org. \nGreta's adoption fee is $300 and includes her fist year vaccines, spay and microchip. \n\nPlease note that we carefully select each adoptive home to meet the needs of the animals in our care and not on a first come, first serve basis.

Although I may be a little bit older, my foster family says that is an added benefit for many reasons including how much love I have left to give! In my spare time, I enjoy taking my naps and lounging around; I consider myself a professional napper! I am housebroken and I am well behaved aside from the occasional trash diving. (It is recommended you have a lid on that when I am around! ) I also do well when given a bath; I just sit there without complaints! Also, Im a pretty quiet fella and do not bark much unless I need to use the restroom, I will be sure to let you know! I do well on a leash and take my walks for restroom breaks; I also enjoy getting doted on by passersby who always compliment me on my fuzzy coat and my cute ears!\n\nSomething I really enjoy the most is getting all the attention from my humans with pets and snuggles! I also love getting brushed; it feels so good! Pretty much anything that involves me getting attention will give you all the gold stars in my book! I am good with confident and friendly dogs and cats. I also enjoy going on trails and camping is a newly added item to my repertoire that I truly enjoy!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting the adorable Odie, apply to adopt at www.causeforcanines.org Adoption fee:$195\nChildren must be 5 years old or older\nMust be an Ohio resident 25 years old or older",

Im Bonnie Blue, the sweetest snuggle girl around with piercing blue eyes that will melt your heart! I am a very loving girl with a playful demeanor who is eager to please my people! I am a bundle of energy and love who would do best in a home with an active family to keep me physically and mentally exercised. I walk very well on a leash and love hikes and long walks around the neighborhood. A fenced in yard would be best allowing me to get extra exercise in; however, it is not required so long as I have a committed family giving me the proper exercise to accommodate my energy. I absolutely love playing fetch and would play all day long if you would let me! I have been coexisting very well with my fur foster sister, but I will need slow introductions with new dogs since I am still working on building trust. I enjoy playing with my foster sister in the backyard, especially if mud is involved! I love to snuggle up on the couch with a blanket and my human. I am fully house trained and know basic obedience commands like sit, come, stay, but would love if someone would continue working with me on these skills! I am very food motivated and smart, so training should be super easy with me! I am working on my crate training and think it is going well; I am very motivated by treats!\nI am the whole package, beautiful, smart, sweet, loyal, obedient and so very loving! All I want for my birthday is to find my forever home!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting the sweet, Bonnie Blue, apply to adopt at www.causeforcanines.org Adoption fee $250.\n\nChildren must be 5 years old or older.\nMust be an Ohio Resident at least 25 years old or older.",

She has definitely rebounded! Mercy loves other dogs and FOOD. She loves peanut butter and treats! She also loves walks, but because of her limited vision, she becomes nervous and confused when there is a lot of commotion. She also pulls but has seen improvement with correction. We are working on desensitizing her to all that goes on in the neighborhood and heeling, but it's taking A LOT of time. She is mostly house trained. She knows sit, paw, and place. She uses a slow feeder bowl now, but she's almost to a place where she knows she'll have food each day and doesn't need to inhale it. I'm very excited with her progress and I'm so happy I could be a part of her physical and mental healing. ~ Foster mom, Debbie",

            "description": "If you are into doggie hugs and you like small dogs then put this girl on your list! Camera is a little Spaniel and Chihuahua mix around 2 years old. She is super soft and has a nice caramel colored coat. This special girl is only about 20lbs but managed to deliver 6 big puppies who have all since been adopted. Camera takes time to warm up to new people then bonds closely to her humans but is not a big fan of visitors coming over to the house. She loves to sit on your lap and she will put her leg around your neck and then kiss you. She will jump up for attention and hugs as she is very affectionate. She is great on her nightly walks and will not go too far ahead of you. Typical to her breed, she gets a little scared if outside of her comfort zone. She can be a bit uncomfortable with new people in her life so allow her time to get to know them before forcing her to meet them. She would do best in a home without small children. Camera loves treats but they need to be good ones...like chicken or chicken! She is house trained and is learning to be in a crate. She is alert and will bark if someone comes to the door. Her foster mom just thinks she's a doll. If you are interested in meeting Camera, your first step would be to submit an adoption application on our website. If you are already approved with an adoption coach or have adopted from us before, reach out to your coach for the next steps. This information is as up to date and accurate as possible for the dog in its current environment. All dogs and puppies will need time and training to adjust to their new surroundings and to learn the rules of their new home. If you are interested in meeting one of our dogs, the first step is to complete the Adoption Form on our website at www.labsandmore.org and take some time to review our adoption process. Your adoption includes the spay or neuter, current vaccinations, microchip, and other services provided while in our care. The safety and health of our puppies is priority one, so we only allow approved applicants to meet and handle puppies. Please understand everything we do is for the dogs and conducted by our kind and generous volunteers. We rely solely on donations, and we do not profit from a dog's adoption. Labs and More is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that operates on donations and time dedicated to this cause by volunteers. Your adoption will save the life of future dogs in need. Labs and More makes no guarantees regarding the behavior, breed, or age of the dogs in our care. Although we strive to provide necessary medical care to dogs in our care, we cannot predict future or current medical needs whether they were symptomatic or not at the time of adoption.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application. If you have any questions email us at doginfo@labsandmore.org or call us at 858-273-5386. Thank you for looking to a rescue group to fulfill your dream of adding a new dog to your life!

            "description": "Meet Gigi, a 34 pound, approximately 2 year old shepherd mix who is always excited to meet new people. This high energy girl is always ready for any adventure, whether a ride in the car, a hike in the woods, a walk around the block or a neighborhood jog, shes ready, willing and very able! Gigi is totally housebroken, does not appreciate the crate, prefers to sleep on your bed, does not like to be left alone, loves toys of all kinds, and would be happy to have at least 2 walks a day. She would be better with no children, as her mode of greeting is jumping, of which she is currently being worked with to break this habit. Proper training would be beneficial for her, as she has some habits which need to be changed and she is so smart that she would welcome the challenge. She would require a very secure yard as she is good at jumping over shorter barriers. A calm, assertive buddy would probably be a help to her, but another hyper dog may cause unwanted habits to appear. Gigi is a wonderful companion and has so much potential. She needs a family who will work with her to bring out more of her amazing self!\n\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm tested negative (age 7 months and older) and microchipped. We do not ship or transport. A dog's adoption donation is $200. There is a $5 fee for credit/debit cards.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please fill out an online application here: www.heartlandsmallanimalrescue.org/canine-application.html",

He loves playing fetch and wrestling with his foster brother, but also cuddles up on the couch. Loki came to his foster home with some stress-related hot spots which seem to be healing now that he is getting plenty of exercise and attention!.

He even does little spins to say hello to them. Austin is a playful boy who enjoys going on walks, is excited to see other dogs, and wants to say hello to them, too. Then back home, he's a calm, low-maintenance boy who loves to snore and relax on his dog bed. He enjoys playing with his favorite toys and snuggling with his people when they're close by, chilling out with them to watch Netflix. This gentle boy answers to 'lay down,' and is working on more commands, including his house-training. He does well when his people are away, and when he's left free to roam the house. He is heartworm positive and may have stomach and bladder issues, but is doing well on medication. With heartworm, he'll just need a couple of months of rest during treatment, at APA!'s expense. Austin is a very sweet, loving boy who would love a home with a yard, and he might get along nicely with a similarly behaved doggie companion. Come meet him, he'll be so delighted to see you.",

            "description": "MEET GROUCHO! Groucho is a male shepherd mix. He is tan with some black on his back, weighs approximately 54 lbs., and stands 16\" at the shoulder. Groucho came to the shelter in April 2019 with his two siblings and we estimated their ages at that time to be 1 year old. His siblings were both adopted, leaving him behind alone. He was passed up then because he is a little shy around new people, but opens up later. He has been living in a kennel with other dogs. He is good with other dogs, kids, and people. Groucho would love to have a forever family to love and play with especially after being at this Mississippi shelter for 1.5 years!!! Groucho is up to date on all his shots, neutered, and microchipped. He has pretty greenish hazel eyes. If you would like to adopt this beautiful boy, please be prepared to allow for decompression time. We are also looking for a family who is open to do some training when the time is right for that. To adopt please visit our website www.peace4paws.org and fill out an adoption application. Thanks!!\n\n\nDog Size Guidelines:\nSmall: 25 lbs and under (11 kg)\nMedium: 26\u201360 lbs (12 \u2013 27 kg)\nLarge: 61\u2013100 lbs (28 \u2013 45 kg)\nExtra Large: 101 lbs or more (46 kg)",

We just can't imagine why he wasn't reclaimed -- he is the sweetest guy ever and has quickly melted our hearts.\n\nPetey is a boxer-bulldog mix that we believe to be around 8 years old. He weights about 55 pounds. He is dog-friendly, kid-friendly, and just a big lover boy! He gives every indication of being housebroken.\n\nWith his age, he came with some health issues that we've addressed, and we continue to address some allergy problems he's having. Petey has experienced repeated ear infections that we recently learned is likely due to allergies. He is now on a special diet and time will tell if this is going to help. Petey is also hearing-impaired, although we don't know to what extent. \n\nIn the meantime, we want to post Petey as a foster-to-adopt situation. We believe that Petey would do much better in a home environment where he can be monitored more closely, but we plan to keep him in foster status (where we cover his medical expenses) until his allergies are managed well.\n\nMedical adventures aside, he's about the happiest guy we know! He's always smiling, loves getting loved on, and just wants to be part of a family. If you have a place in your heart and home for this sweet boy, please contact us.\n\n---\n\nPlease know that if you come to meet any of the dogs at our facility, they may be excited to see you and extra active. Many times, this is not a true picture of how they may act in a warm, safe home setting. We, as volunteers, often take our shelter dogs on home visits and they become calm and act like completely different animals. This pertains to bathroom habits and demeanor.

No one claimed her during her 7-day hold at animal control, so she came to us at PCHS, and boy are we happy to have her!\n\nAs you can see, she's adorable! The shelter environment is stressful, especially for timid dogs, and so we're getting to know her slowly.\n\nShe is very timid right now and it doesn't seem she's ever been on a leash. However, she's a very sweet dog and will likely be like a little lapdog once she warms up. She really wants attention, but keeps a little bit of a distance initially, and when you pick her up her whole body gets stiff like she's nervous. But once she warms up, she jumps and plays, barks, and howls. She even gave one of volunteers a kiss on the nose the other day!\n\nOnce she's comfortable with you, she'll raise her little right paw and reach out she like she wants you to pet her, but then acts a little nervous when you do.\n\nBecause of her timid nature, she needs a home with no small children. An adult-only home would probably be best, although older kids who know to go slowly with her would likely be fine.\n\nAt an overnight with a volunteer, Paisley did well with the volunteer's dogs. (Of course, we always encourage a slow introduction between dogs.) Cats are an unknown right now.\n\nWe're not sure is Paisley is housebroken, but we think she'd be a quick learner once she's comfortable with her surroundings. She has also shown herself to a bit of a fence climber and escape artist (although it's hard to tell if that's just due to the stress of being at the shelter).\n\nIf you have the patience and love that Paisley needs, we think you'll be rewarded with a snuggly lapdog who wants nothing more than to be with you!\n\n---\n\nPlease know that if you come to meet any of the dogs at our facility, they may be excited to see you and extra active.

I was found in a vacant home after my people decided to leave me there alone with my 6 puppies -- I tried the best I could to take care of everyone but it was really hard. Thank goodness someone found us! These nice people are helping me find a real home with real people who will love me -- I can't wait!\n\nI am a Boxer mix and I get along well with most other dogs, although I can be a bit picky and other girl dogs annoy me. I am housebroken, which I know is really important to most people. \n\nI weigh 61 pounds and I know I'm a little older than most dogs here, but I still have a lot of love to give and fun to experience. I'm a pretty energetic ol' gal! And I think it's my turn to be loved unconditionally like I have loved others my whole life.\n\n(We don't know how Sissy is with kids yet, since we've not seen her around any yet.)\n\n---\n\nPlease know that if you come to meet any of the dogs at our facility, they may be excited to see you and extra active. Many times, this is not a true picture of how they may act in a warm, safe home setting. We, as volunteers, often take our shelter dogs on home visits and they become calm and act like completely different animals. This pertains to bathroom habits and demeanor. Please realize that they need a chance to shine out of the shelter setting!\n\nPlease call us at 618-542-DOGS(3647) or if you have any specific questions about me, please email the shelter volunteer at pchsinfo@yahoo.com or go to www.perrycountyhumanesocietyil.com to apply.",

He is 1-2 years old, weighs 65 pounds, and is strong as an ox.\n\nHe's energetic, affectionate, and always ready for action! He also knows when to sit that butt down -- for treats, at the door, and before being given the okay to gobble his dinner. He's an eager learner who would love to be taught more.\n\nHarley also is great in the car, loves water, and knows the rules about pottying! He's a great dog! Always smiling! Harley also has an adorable overbite, but that's really just the icing on the cake. \n\nHarley can be dog selective and does NOT prefer the company of cats. He would most likely be fine with kids who are a little older due to his size. Harley just wants a second chance at love and companionship! Can you give him a chance?\n\n---\n\nPlease know that if you come to meet any of the dogs at our facility, they may be excited to see you and extra active.

He weighs 50 pounds and as friendly with dogs, but tends to be picky about which dogs he will actually be friends with. He does not get along well with cats, but he is kid-friendly!\n\nSmith would LOVE to be in a family that is active and likes to be outside. He has lots of energy and is always ready to play, but definitely has a soft side and would be a great movie-watching buddy. He was found running at large and was brought to PCHS to find his perfect family! \n\nSomething important to note about Smith is that he is quite the escape artist and has been known to climb fences, so he would needs somewhere extra safe to live! \n\n---\n\nPlease know that if you come to meet any of the dogs at our facility, they may be excited to see you and extra active. Many times, this is not a true picture of how they may act in a warm, safe home setting. We, as volunteers, often take our shelter dogs on home visits and they become calm and act like completely different animals. This pertains to bathroom habits and demeanor. Please realize that they need a chance to shine out of the shelter setting!\n\nPlease call us at 618-542-DOGS(3647) or if you have any specific questions about me, please email the shelter volunteer at pchsinfo@yahoo.com or go to www.perrycountyhumanesocietyil.com to apply.",

SHE IS CURRENTLY ON THYROID MEDICATION AND BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATION WHICH SHE MUST TAKE DAILY AS WELL AS A PRESCRIPTION DOG FOOD. HER NEW ADOPTER MUST BE WILLING TO CONTINUE WITH THIS REGIME.)\n\nHello, my name is Frannie, and I am a very lucky dachshund to have found Little Paws rescue when I did. My previous owner neglected my vet care and let me get so fat I couldn't breathe. I am now svelte (very sweet) 10 year old, and my health is as good as possible. I currently weigh 22 bs because I lost 10 whole lbs while in foster care.\n\nI'm now a spokesdog for \"The Green Bean Diet\" Too bad it's not a paying gig ;)\n\nWhat would make my heart soar\n\nis a new fur-ever home with a fenced yard to sniff around in and bask in the sunshine.\n\nI love being brushed, and I enjoy belly rubs.\n\nI came into rescue with a bonded partner, Freckles, but I lost him to something called Cancer; whatever that is, it makes me sad. I'm hoping to find my person and heal my heart..could you be the one?\n\nI am sociable with all people and other dogs.\n\nIf you have room in your home and heart for me and would like additional information about me, please contact my foster mom Lorrie at dachsielover@verizon.net\n\nYou can find the adoption application at: http://littlepawsdachshundrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms/form_humanverify?formid=2724\n\nThe adoption fee for me is $150. If I am adopted over a state line, there will be a $45.00 charge for a health certificate (required by law).\n\nThe Adoption Fee for Frannie is $150.00 + $45.00 for a health certificate if going over state lines (required by law). TRANSPORTATION HELP! If you see a furbaby that would be a match for your family, please don't let distance stand in the way of your adoption. LPDR can work with you to have a volunteer transport to assist with transportation or refer you to a paid transport.\n\n2/2/21 4:05 PM",

            "description": "Handsome old Klaus is looking for a new home. At age ~10 or 11, Klaus became homeless when his owner passed away. Some good Samaritans took him in as a favor to the man\u2019s son, but are unable to keep him long term. \n\nWe don\u2019t have a ton of history on Klaus. Prior to the home he\u2019s in now, he\u2019d been living in an apartment with his owner, a man with a substance abuse problem and anger issues. When Klaus got to the home where he is now he acted like he\u2019d never been on grass before. Thankfully he\u2019s fully house trained, but would only potty on cement/hard surfaces outside (the driveway and walkways). He could barely walk, with an open sore on his leg that he had licked raw, and had horrible skin issues. On a good quality food, regular meals, bathing, fish oil and glucosamine supplements, his skin and coat look great now, and an Elizabethan collar keeps him from licking the leg, and the sore is healing well. He is a good boy for his baths and nail trims too. He gets around great now and moves nicely \u2013 no limping or soreness noted and he's spry and agile for his age.\n\nKlaus is initially wary of people \u2013 he barks at new people entering the home \u2013 but within 5 minutes of me coming into the house he was fine with me. He allowed me to pet him all over and \u201ctalked\u201d his way through all of it. This guy is a talker!  He enjoyed the pets and neck rubs, and was my new best friend in minutes. He made a beeline for my treat pocket and I ended up having to put my coat outside! He is learning the rules in his new home and doing very well with staying out of the kitchen and no begging when they eat. He\u2019s very alert and responsive, food motivated, and loves any attention he gets.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no human aggression, Klaus does NOT like other dogs. A few weeks after he got to the home he got out of the fenced yard (gate not latched properly) and attacked a dog walking by the home. The dog had some bite wounds but was otherwise unharmed, and Klaus\u2019s caretakers are now very careful to not let him out in the front yard. Long term they are concerned about this, and also have guests/family members who visit with their dogs, so keeping Klaus isn\u2019t possible for them. \n\nWe know that as a senior Rottweiler Klaus probably only has a couple years left, but this sweet old fellow deserves a place of his own, where he can be loved for the good dog he is, and enjoy his golden years in comfort. \n\nGo to https://spdrdogs.org/rescue-referral/how-to-adopt/ to fill out an adoption application for Klaus.\n\nWashington State only - no interstate transports\n\nVisit us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/SPDRRottweilerRescue",

He was found as a stray and no one came to claim him, so he was transferred to us from a local shelter.  Jordy is a sweet boy who gets along with the other little dogs in his foster home and is doing well with potty training.  He is great at playing fetch and does well walking on a leash.  He loves running around the yard- even in the cold weather.   Jordy has experiences some food allergies in the past, although we haven't been able to identify exactly had causes him issues he is doing well with the food he is currently on.  Jordy has not gotten along with the 2 larger dogs in his foster home, so we think he would likely do best with dogs his size or smaller.  When he is afraid he will resort to barking and lunging- a form of fear aggression.  We are looking for a home that is willing to be patient with him, as well as work with him on building his confidence.  Jordy's adoption donation is $275 and helps cover his medical care. \n\nApplication, reference checks, and home visit required. Adopters must live 1.5 hours driving distance from Romeoville, IL. For more information on adopting, please email us at info@perfectpooches.org.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete an adoption application, which can be found on our website at www.perfectpooches.org under the Adoption Process tab.  All dogs are spayed/neutered, current on vaccines, heartworm tested (age appropriate), fecal tested and/or dewormed, and microchipped.",

He loves running around in our play yard, making new friends, and living life to its fullest. If you like adventure and exploration, Hamlin might just be your guy!\n\nHe's a big, strong dog, but he knows to sit for treats and to go in/out of his run, and we think he would love to learn more.\n\nHamlin needs a forever home without cats or other male dogs. He also does well with his potty habits, leading us to believe he's either housebroken or could easily be.\n\n---\n\nPlease know that if you come to meet any of the dogs at our facility, they may be excited to see you and extra active. Many times, this is not a true picture of how they may act in a warm, safe home setting. We, as volunteers, often take our shelter dogs on home visits and they become calm and act like completely different animals. This pertains to bathroom habits and demeanor. Please realize that they need a chance to shine out of the shelter setting!\n\nPlease call us at 618-542-DOGS(3647) or if you have any specific questions about me, please email the shelter volunteer at pchsinfo@yahoo.com or go to www.perrycountyhumanesocietyil.com to apply.",

            "description": "Harley is a whole lotta dog - a lotta fun, a lotta energy, a lotta friend! He needs an active family and a strong leader to help him become the best dog he can be. He is 1-2 years old, weighs 65 pounds, and is strong as an ox.\n\nHe's energetic, affectionate, and always ready for action! He also knows when to sit that butt down -- for treats, at the door, and before being given the okay to gobble his dinner. He's an eager learner who would love to be taught more.\n\nHarley also is great in the car, loves water, and knows the rules about pottying! He's a great dog! Always smiling! Harley also has an adorable overbite, but that's really just the icing on the cake. \n\nHarley can be dog selective and does NOT prefer the company of cats. He would most likely be fine with kids who are a little older due to his size. Harley just wants a second chance at love and companionship! Can you give him a chance?\n\n---\n\nPlease know that if you come to meet any of the dogs at our facility, they may be excited to see you and extra active. Many times, this is not a true picture of how they may act in a warm, safe home setting. We, as volunteers, often take our shelter dogs on home visits and they become calm and act like completely different animals. This pertains to bathroom habits and demeanor. Please realize that they need a chance to shine out of the shelter setting!\n\nPlease call us at 618-542-DOGS(3647) or if you have any specific questions about me, please email the shelter volunteer at pchsinfo@yahoo.com or go to www.perrycountyhumanesocietyil.com to apply.",

SHE IS CURRENTLY ON THYROID MEDICATION AND BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATION WHICH SHE MUST TAKE DAILY AS WELL AS A PRESCRIPTION DOG FOOD. HER NEW ADOPTER MUST BE WILLING TO CONTINUE WITH THIS REGIME.)\n\nHello, my name is Frannie, and I am a very lucky dachshund to have found Little Paws rescue when I did. My previous owner neglected my vet care and let me get so fat I couldn't breathe. I am now svelte (very sweet) 10 year old, and my health is as good as possible. I currently weigh 22 bs because I lost 10 whole lbs while in foster care.\n\nI'm now a spokesdog for \"The Green Bean Diet\" Too bad it's not a paying gig ;)\n\nWhat would make my heart soar\n\nis a new fur-ever home with a fenced yard to sniff around in and bask in the sunshine.\n\nI love being brushed, and I enjoy belly rubs.\n\nI came into rescue with a bonded partner, Freckles, but I lost him to something called Cancer; whatever that is, it makes me sad. I'm hoping to find my person and heal my heart..could you be the one?\n\nI am sociable with all people and other dogs.\n\nIf you have room in your home and heart for me and would like additional information about me, please contact my foster mom Lorrie at dachsielover@verizon.net\n\nYou can find the adoption application at: http://littlepawsdachshundrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms/form_humanverify?formid=2724\n\nThe adoption fee for me is $150. If I am adopted over a state line, there will be a $45.00 charge for a health certificate (required by law).\n\nThe Adoption Fee for Frannie is $150.00 + $45.00 for a health certificate if going over state lines (required by law). TRANSPORTATION HELP! If you see a furbaby that would be a match for your family, please don't let distance stand in the way of your adoption. LPDR can work with you to have a volunteer transport to assist with transportation or refer you to a paid transport.\n\n2/2/21 4:05 PM",

He seems to prefer the company of female dog friends, but with proper intros and a little extra time, we think he would do well with any dog. His former owner said he is kid friendly. He loves to play with his toys and chew his bones.",

            "description": "Handsome old Klaus is looking for a new home. At age ~10 or 11, Klaus became homeless when his owner passed away. Some good Samaritans took him in as a favor to the man\u2019s son, but are unable to keep him long term. \n\nWe don\u2019t have a ton of history on Klaus. Prior to the home he\u2019s in now, he\u2019d been living in an apartment with his owner, a man with a substance abuse problem and anger issues. When Klaus got to the home where he is now he acted like he\u2019d never been on grass before. Thankfully he\u2019s fully house trained, but would only potty on cement/hard surfaces outside (the driveway and walkways). He could barely walk, with an open sore on his leg that he had licked raw, and had horrible skin issues. On a good quality food, regular meals, bathing, fish oil and glucosamine supplements, his skin and coat look great now, and an Elizabethan collar keeps him from licking the leg, and the sore is healing well. He is a good boy for his baths and nail trims too. He gets around great now and moves nicely \u2013 no limping or soreness noted and he's spry and agile for his age.\n\nKlaus is initially wary of people \u2013 he barks at new people entering the home \u2013 but within 5 minutes of me coming into the house he was fine with me. He allowed me to pet him all over and \u201ctalked\u201d his way through all of it. This guy is a talker!  He enjoyed the pets and neck rubs, and was my new best friend in minutes. He made a beeline for my treat pocket and I ended up having to put my coat outside! He is learning the rules in his new home and doing very well with staying out of the kitchen and no begging when they eat. He\u2019s very alert and responsive, food motivated, and loves any attention he gets.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no human aggression, Klaus does NOT like other dogs. A few weeks after he got to the home he got out of the fenced yard (gate not latched properly) and attacked a dog walking by the home. The dog had some bite wounds but was otherwise unharmed, and Klaus\u2019s caretakers are now very careful to not let him out in the front yard. Long term they are concerned about this, and also have guests/family members who visit with their dogs, so keeping Klaus isn\u2019t possible for them. \n\nWe know that as a senior Rottweiler Klaus probably only has a couple years left, but this sweet old fellow deserves a place of his own, where he can be loved for the good dog he is, and enjoy his golden years in comfort. \n\nGo to https://spdrdogs.org/rescue-referral/how-to-adopt/ to fill out an adoption application for Klaus.\n\nWashington State only - no interstate transports\n\nVisit us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/SPDRRottweilerRescue",

He was found as a stray and no one came to claim him, so he was transferred to us from a local shelter.  Jordy is a sweet boy who gets along with the other little dogs in his foster home and is doing well with potty training.  He is great at playing fetch and does well walking on a leash.  He loves running around the yard- even in the cold weather.   Jordy has experiences some food allergies in the past, although we haven't been able to identify exactly had causes him issues he is doing well with the food he is currently on.  Jordy has not gotten along with the 2 larger dogs in his foster home, so we think he would likely do best with dogs his size or smaller.  When he is afraid he will resort to barking and lunging- a form of fear aggression.  We are looking for a home that is willing to be patient with him, as well as work with him on building his confidence.  Jordy's adoption donation is $275 and helps cover his medical care. \n\nApplication, reference checks, and home visit required. Adopters must live 1.5 hours driving distance from Romeoville, IL. For more information on adopting, please email us at info@perfectpooches.org.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete an adoption application, which can be found on our website at www.perfectpooches.org under the Adoption Process tab.  All dogs are spayed/neutered, current on vaccines, heartworm tested (age appropriate), fecal tested and/or dewormed, and microchipped.",

            "description": "Katniss is a true winner of the Hunger Games.\n\nHere she is having some fun with her buddy! https://youtu.be/kezLzIU6-MI\n\n\nFound severely malnourished and near death in the back yard of a woman who contacted All 4's Rescue in Memphis, Tennessee - she had found her a week or so earlier but didn't realize how sick she was. Thank goodness she called for help. All 4's immediately contacted Paws New England and we could not resist this girl.\n\nAt 18 lbs in mid-November, she was truly near death - her optimal weight is 40-45 lbs and she's well on her way\n\nKatniss is approximately one year old and is just gorgeous with her brindle coat. Her amazing foster family has nursed her back to health and she adores them and is loyal and seeks only to please and make them happy.\n\nThey are working on her resource guarding of food and treats meaning she is possessive of her food, treats etc. with the some of dogs in the home. Given her prior circumstances this is certainly understandable but she is getting better every day.With one dog she has no issues so honestly she is truly doing great in this regard.\n\nShe takes time to warm up to new people so a super busy home with kids/teenagers coming and going may not be ideal.\n\nShe is house trained, crate trained, walks on a leash, and knows how to sit and come. She loves her people; she's just not sure how to show it.\n\nWhat would be great for her? Anyone that will be loving, attentive, and patient. Preferably with dog experience, she is not ideal for a first time dog owner.\n\nAnother dog in the home for her to play with would be amazing - she so enjoys their company - see video!!!\n\n\nShe gets along well with her female canine friend in the foster home and they play constantly. She does well on leash.\n\nShe is house trained and crate trained which is fabulous.\n\n\nName: Katniss\nBreed: Plott Hound\nSex: Female\nAge: 1 year (estimated)\nWeight: 37 lbs\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\nVaccinations: Yes\nHeartworm:Negative \nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nBASED ON OUR OBSERVATIONS:\nGood with Children: Over 15 but a quiet home is most appropriate\nGood with Dogs: Yes\nGood with Cats: Unknown\n\nAdoption Fee: $475.00\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION:\nInterested in a specific dog, please fill out an application if you are interested in a dog. The number of individual inquiries is overwhelming and we are finding it difficult to respond to each one. We cannot guarantee you will receive a timely response.\n\n\nPaws New England is a rescue, not a shelter, and as such we do not have our dogs housed in one location - they are in foster homes both in New England and in our southern foster homes. If you're interested in a specific dog, please complete a short online application and you will receive a reply within 48 hours so you can ask questions.\n\n\nAt present, if a dog is listed on our website, the dog is considered still available HOWEVER, may have applications that have come in before yours but it's still too early to know if any are a good match; therefore we encourage you to apply.\n\nNOTICE WITH REGARD TO LOCATION OF DOGS: Please note: Paws New England is a foster-based rescue. We do not have a brick and mortar building to house the dogs we rescue. We have found that dogs in foster homes are much more adoptable because they have been observed in a home setting. Dogs listed with Paws New England typically reside in various locations throughout the south (primarily Tennessee, Texas, and Arkansas) and New England (not necessarily in the state of Rhode Island). You will be notified by the adoption coordinator of the location of the dog you are interested in so you have the ability to decide whether to pursue adoption or not.\n\nDogs transported to New England are done so at a fee of $150.00 paid directly to the transporting company by Paws New England; no additional transport costs are responsibility of adopter. This fee is included in the adoption donation.\n\nAdoption donations cover pre-adoption vet costs (including vaccinations, spay/neuter when age appropriate, and heartworm testing/treatment when necessary), a microchip, and transportation to New England if necessary.\n\nDonations for our young, healthy puppies and dogs support their fellow canines of advanced age or suffering from injuries and abuse whose donations are reduced but whose veterinary costs are typically much higher. We appreciate your understanding that your dog will help others in need.\n\nAll known information about the animal is listed above. We do our best to give accurate information, but most of our dogs are rescues and do not come with a known history.\n\nPaws New England abides by the dog importation regulations set forth in the states of MA, CT, NH and RI.",

            "description": "***UPDATE***\nBubbly's foster mom says that he is coming along well. She said he's happy to see his people when they get home. He will walk up to his people for kisses and doesn't mind being pet on the paws, legs and chest. He's still a little leary about being pet on the head and back. He loves to play with other dogs and is starting to play with people as well. He also sleeps all night in his kennel. He still has a long way to go, but these changes happened in just one week! Imagine what a wonderful, little dog he could be in a few months!\n\nThis little sweetie was rescued from an overcrowded Texas shelter and brought to Wisconsin for a better life. Bubbly is a 4 month old puppy and weighs about 20 lbs. Bubbly is a very shy and untrusting of people. He has been at the Texas shelter since he was 2 months, so the only interaction he's had with people is the shelter staff coming in and out to clean and feed him. He will need a family that understands that he will need a lot of time and patience to learn to trust people. He would do best in a home with another dog. Not only does he love playing with other dogs, but another dog would teach him that people are ok. He would also do best in a home that is somewhat quiet with children over the age of 12.  Bubbly is up to date on vaccines. He is not currently neutered due to backlog from COVID but when he is able to be neutered, it will be paid for by Wag N' Purr Animal Rescue.

            "description": "***UPDATE***\nCece has been with me for a week. She is very slowly feeling a little more comfortable around us. She allows pets, but is clearly uncomfortable with touch. She will let me lay by her and will lay her head on my leg or arm and seems very at ease and relaxed when she does it. She will jump on the couch and sit with me but will sit on the opposite end. She is still very nervous, but no longer runs away when I look at her or talk to her. She absolutely LOVES other dogs! She still has a long way to go, but she's taking baby steps and will get there eventually. \n\nThis little sweetie was rescued from an overcrowded Texas shelter and brought to Wisconsin for a better life. *Cece is a 4 month old puppy. She weighs about 20 lbs. Cece is very shy and afraid of people. She has been at the Texas shelter with her siblings since she was 2 months old. So the only contact she has had with people is the shelter staff coming in and out to clean and feed her. She will need to go to a family that understands she will need a lot of time and patience to learn to trust and feel comfortable with people. She would do best in a home with another dog as she loves to play with other dogs and having another dog will also help in teaching her to trust people. \nHer perfect home will also need to be a quiet home with children over the age of 12.. \nCece is up to date on vaccines. She is not currently spayed due to backlog from COVID but when she is able to be spayed, it will be paid for by Wag N' Purr Animal Rescue. If you are interested in little Cece, please complete the application below.\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/201553813946155",

            "description": "Meet Marvel!\nMarvel is an owner surrender due to not liking to be disturbed from sleep by toddlers. Which in turn this is really most dogs. Marvel is a super sweet boy and terribly distraught after losing his family who had him for 7 years. He is slowly settling in but still really trying to understand what happened. Marvel is one of the sweetest boys you will meet that you would not believe is 7 years old. He does not look or act like a senior and very much a puppy in his own mind. He would do well with an active family that will love him. We do not suggest he be in a home with kids under 10 but as long as they are respectful he would do just fine. He loves attention and to cuddle and just wants to be where his family is. Marvel isn't quiet ready for adoption since he still needs to be neutered and microchipped but once those are completed he will be ready for his forever home! \n\nAll animals adopted from us are fully vetted including spay/neuter, vaccines, microchip, heartworm test and deworming. Please email us at HookedOnDobies@gmail.com, visit our Facebook page www.facebook.com/savingdobermankind or webpage https://www.savingdobermankind.org to request an application, inquire about an adoption fee, or to learn more! \n\nWe do require a completed adoption application to be submitted before discussing details of a specific Doberman. \n\nWe DO NOT have a central location, out foster homes are located throughout our geographic region including CO, WY, NM and TX.\n\nWe strive to PROTECT the privacy of out fosters. ALL Doberman meet and greets are conducted in a neutral meeting location made by appointment only.",

            "description": "Finesse is a sweet girl that ended up abandoned in the middle of no where. We can't imagine why since she is doing so well in her foster home. She is good with other dogs and gets along with cats (although she's a bit fearful of them). She loves to be a lap dog and follows her foster mom around\u00a0the house. She is doing well with potty training, and will need a home to provide a structured schedule to ensure she keeps that up. She also does well in the crate, but will bark so she would not do well in an apartment\u00a0setting. If you are searching for a beautiful 30 lb lap dog and a fun girl to walk or run with, Finesse would love to meet you!\n\nPlease visit www.handsheartspaws.org for an adoption application\n\nAll of our dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed/neutered, microchipped, fecal tested, heartworm tested, and they are all on heartworm and flea/tick preventative.\n\nThe adoption process is an application, a vet reference, a home visit, and a lifetime contract. The requested adoption donation for this dog is $275___.\n\nWe do not REQUIRE a fenced in yard (some dogs DO REQUIRE a fence.  Decide what is best for each dog), we do REQUIRE a means of safe outside containment.  We do NOT adopt to homes that use invisible fencing.  Invisible fencing is NOT a safe means of outside containment.\n\nWe are willing to adopt out-of-state, contingent on our ability to complete a home visit, but you must travel to Omaha to complete the adoption. We do not transport or ship our dogs.",

            "description": "American Bulldog | Male | 1-2 years old | 90 lbs | Ontario Shelter Dog \n#emptyontarioshelters\n\nTemperament: Affectionate, good-natured.\nActivity Level: High. \nVetting: Core vaccines (dh2pp, rabies & bordetella ), neutered, microchipped, dewormed, fecal - negative, 4dx bloodwork - negative (which means he doesn\u2019t have Heartworm disease or tick borne diseases), on tick/heartworm and flea prevention. \nHousebroken? Yes.\nGood with Dogs? Dudley is still learning how to regulate himself around dogs, especially males. He has proven that he can, with time and proper guidance, interact positively and would benefit with continued socialization. However, safety measures are necessary and this must be done only with extremely balanced dogs. Reactive dogs must be avoided at all times because of the possibility that Dudley, due to his size and strength, may escalate dog fights. For the same reason, Dudley should avoid dog parks, and get his socialization in more controlled environments (play-dates with appropriate dogs).\nGood with Cats? No.\nGood with Children? Yes, but we would advise against this. Dudley\u2019s ideal home would be made up of people who can provide a calm environment with consistent boundaries and instructions.  \nAny noted prey drive? Yes. He will take intense interest and may attempt to chase after squirrels, racoons, birds, cats, etc.\nHow do they respond to the outdoors? He is extremely over-stimulated, mostly by dogs, when on the leash and is currently working to better handle these encounters and is developing his skills on the leash. His ideal adopter will be somebody who can continue this work with him (in-person instructions from his current trainer will be provided). He is a delight in a fenced-in yard. He loves to play and is thrilled to be engaged with obedience training and training games. His ideal adopter should have an adequate backyard and enjoy physically and mentally engaging with him. He is a young boy and has the energy level to match and because his walks will be predominantly training focused, a yard is an essential resource for ensuring his exercise and enrichments needs are being fully met.\nBusy Streets? Busy streets must be avoided, as they are not conducive to working through his issues on the leash. His ideal adopter, if in the city, will live on a reasonably quiet residential street with access to parks and pathways where distance can be maintained from dogs as he continues to develop his skills, focus and regulation.\nWhat type of exercise do they get and how much? He gets 3-4 training walks a day (approximately 2 hrs total) and another 2-4 hours of outdoor play and training games.\nHow active are they? Very high energy. He can run and play for hours. He is quite calm in the house. He will get hyper if encouraged but his ideal adopter will promote calmness with him. He has learned to go settle in his place or crate when asked to.\nCrate-Trained? Yes. Understands \u201cGo to your crate\u201d and can spend hours relaxing and/or enjoying a frozen KONG or appropriate chew. He sleeps beautifully in his crate throughout the night. He may bark slightly if he hears another dog barking, but will quickly respond to a clear \u2018No\u201d or \u201cEnough\u201d.\nHow do they respond to commands? Very well while indoors or focused in the backyard. He loves obedience training and the sky\u2019s the limit with an adopter who enjoys training games and exercises.\nHow do they handle transit or car transportation? He is good in the car for the most part. He will become over-stimulated when he sees a dog but not unmanageable and is improving. Public transit should be avoided.\n*We cannot guarantee breed mix nor age.\n*Comes with 6 weeks of pet insurance valued at $500.\n\nIn summary, the best case scenario for Dudley would be a young, energetic individual or individuals who enjoy mentally and physically engaging with their dog. They should have a fair-sized backyard, live in a quiet neighbourhood and have prior experience with powerful breeds. Dudley is a truly lovely, good-natured young dog who just needs the right home and proper guidance to reach his incredible potential.

She has been a wonderful mom, and the babies are weaned and getting ready for their forever homes. Cecelia is the perfect family dog, and she has incredible manners. She will walk up to any person, big or small, and sit to ask for a pet.  She would love to snuggle or lay at her owner's feet.  Her personality has blossomed as her puppies have weaned, and she is becoming more playful as well. \n\nCecelia just tested positive for heartworms and will have to go through treatment. She will soon be ready to find her forever home too. SOAR will cover costs of heartworm treatment and medication needed for this treatment.\n\nAdoption donation required. This covers altering, DAP series vaccinations to date of adoption, Bordetella Vaccination, Rabies vaccination if over four months, Microchip, Deworming, heartworm test (if over 8 months), monthly flea/heartworm prevention to date, grooming, full veterinary examination, and temperament evaluation. Please e-mail us for more information or go to our website https://soardogs.org/adoption-application for an application. Thank you very much!\u00a0\n\n\nAll SOAR dogs go through a ten-day quarantine period to ensure they are healthy, before being adopted. We do not operate on a first come first serve basis, but screen applicants in order to find the best fit for our adoptable dogs.",

Currently weighing in at 30 lbs, our little lady will grow to a good 90 lbs as an adult.\n\nA delicate flower, Rapunzel needs a calm home, recommended older, calmer children only. She\u2019s great with cats and other dogs if they too are calm.\n\nRapunzel will need a secure fenced in yard to get out and explore and someone home most of the day to keep her company and continue with her training.\n\nThe WAG team are already sprinkling their fairy dust and crate and potty training is coming along well. Although Rapunzel will soon sing out in that glorious Hound dawg way if she feels she\u2019s been in the crate too long.\n\nHappy, affectionate and lots of fun, Rapunzel just needs her happily ever after!\n\nAll of our animals are fully vetted which includes spay/neuter, up to date on vaccines, wormed, heartworm tested and treated if necessary, up to date on flea/tick/heartworm prevention and microchipped) prior to adoption.\n\nTo start the adoption process please copy the below link in your browser and complete the application.  NOTE:  please read our requirements located above the application.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeotmh7qepR0mRvxSqy42yViQnllmR0-FKTFmUo2ANK4AXPaQ/viewform\n\nThank you for reading and THANK you for choosing to adopt!\n",

Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet her.\n\nCypress is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~3 years \nWeight: ~53lbs\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate trained: Working on it! Takes some time to settle, but overall doing well with her crate-training. Has also done well with free roam while left solo.\nDog sociability: Friendly with dogs on walks\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Unknown, but she is very sensitive to loud noises/sudden movement so she would not be recommended for little kids. May do well with respectful teenagers that can read her body language and go slow.\nIdeal home: Cypress is a sweet southern gal from Texas that is looking for a patient home that will allow her time to ease into her new surroundings. She is pretty scared outside on walks and prefers very quiet/suburban spaces. A backyard would be her dream! Having a dog pal in her home may also help to boost her confidence. \n\nCypress is the sweetest, politest, little angel. Once she gets comfortable with you she's total snuggle bug. While her foster has been away, they have let her have access to the whole house and can see on cams that she mostly chills on the couch the entire time When it's time to go for a walk she puts her front paws on a seat and waits for you to put on her harness and coat. She is pretty sensitive to loud sounds and quick movements, so she would do best in a calm house in a quiet neighborhood. She'd probably benefit from living with another dog to show her that things aren't so scary. Car rides and string cheese are the way to this girl's heart!\n\nCypress tested positive for heartworm disease at her prior shelter and received treatment there in November. She will need to be on exercise restriction for the next 9 months until she can be retested for heartworm disease which should occur in August. If her 9 month retest comes back positive, OTAT will cover treatment at our Ellis Clinic. For information on heartworm disease, visit: onetail.org/heartworm\n\nCypress' adoption fee is 300. She is spayed, is up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm positive. She will require booster vaccines at the adopter's expense. She will likely need a dental cleaning in the next year, and may require radiographs for worn teeth to determine if extraction is needed - also adopter responsibility.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet him.\n\nDutch is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~1 years \nWeight: ~55lbs\nHousebroken: Working on it! He needs to be on a strict schedule \nCrate trained: Working on it! Takes time to settle and will benefit from continued training. He is mischievous if left with free roam, so crate-training recommended. \nDog sociability: Friendly! Lives with a dog in his foster home and has been doing well. He is excitable on leash when he sees another dog and will pull to say 'hi!'\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Unknown\nIdeal home: Dutch will do well in a variety of living situations, but would prefer to not live in a high-rise/elevator building. As a large-breed, adolescent dog he will do best with an adopter who can continue to work on training.\n\nDutch is the sweetest guy who came to us a stray in Arkansas. He's been adapting to city life well and has loved having a dog pal in his foster home. Dutch is a very loving and outgoing dog that wants to be everyone person and dog's friend. He just want to cuddle with and makes sure to give everyone (and dog) a turn to snuggle with him. Dutch will be your personal chaperone to all areas of your living space. He has a wiggly butt that never stops moving! \n\nDutch's adoption fee is 300. He is neutered, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

Due to the current regulations set forth by Governor Pritzker on group gatherings we will not be having adoption events until further notice. As an all foster based rescue this means that all meets will be by appointment only. Your whole family must be available to attend the meet as there will be no second meets scheduled to help limit contact between our team and the public. To help streamline the process please make sure your current pets are up to date, you have landlord/HOA approval, and that you are prepared to take the dog home with you immediately before submitting an application. Thank you & Please stay safe!***\n\nNetwork to us from a rescue partner in the south CeCe just arrived. Approximately 2 years old! She is a laid back dog who can be playful at times. She is housetrained, and is working on leash skills. CeCe is not a fan of the crate, but once she gets in she just lays down. She is friendly and curious with all the dogs that walk by on walks, and she loves nothing more than lounging in the sun in the yard. Good with kids, cats unknown. She loves to be loved on and enjoys belly rubs!\n\nSadly, CeCe\n\narrived Heartworm positive so Magnificent Mutts will be treating her. After treatment she will go on to lead a normal happy life. Her only restriction is her adopters will need to keep her activity to\n\na minimum as he goes through the 30 days rest after Heartworm treatment.\n\nCheck back for more information and possible restrictions once he fully settles into foster care.\n\nIf you are interested in adoption, please complete the Application to Adopt which you can find on our website (\nwww.magnificentmutts.org\n) No phone calls please. Emails only.\n\nAdoption Donation $300 (cash only)\n\nPlease visit www.magnificentmutts.org for the online dog or cat application.\n\nAdoption Fees*\n\nAdult cats starting at $125, Kittens starting at $165.\nDogs/Puppies starting at $225 minimum\nPrices subject to change, please contact for specific adoption donations.",

His favorite activity is playing in the backyard, running free with someone to play with. His dislikes are, being left alone for long periods of time. He loves closeness and prefers to be around family. Atlis lived with another male dog, so could possibly be good with others. \n\n85 lbs, up to date on vaccines and heartworm negative! We are scheduling his neuter next week. \n\nWould you like to meet this loveable hunk? \n\n https://www.jotform.com/luckymutts/adoption-application",

            "description": "AJ is a six-year-old boxer/American bulldog mix that weighs 70 pounds. The previous owner took him to the shelter for euthanasia because he was in such poor condition due to neglect and abuse. The shelter contacted us to see if we could save him and we immediately drove to Solano and picked him up. After several months of being in foster care his wounds have healed up, he has gained 10 pounds and he is one happy boy!\n\nAJ hops into the bathtub without any hesitation for his baths every week. He is crate trained and kennels up the minute you open the door.  He loves to go for car rides and if I go to work and don\u2019t take him he is completely confused! AJ is one of the most affectionate dogs I have ever met, he thinks he is 10 pounds and belongs in your lap! He loves going for walks and behaves beautifully on the leash.\n\nAJ does not bark or react to other dogs but we know that he is not good with other dogs. His new home must understand that he needs to be an only dog and he will never be able to go to a dog park.\n\nWe ran a full allergy panel on him to see what he might be allergic to and he is allergic to four types of grass. As his foster parents we are fortunate that we don\u2019t have any grass, we have artificial lawn As well as bark and lots of patio areas.\n\nIf he goes to a home that is interested in having the allergy shots made for him so that he builds up a tolerance to the grasses he is allergic to that is certainly an option.\n\nIf you are interested in additional information please call or text Linea at 510-579-5850. Please do not email Petfinder!",

He is a friendly guy and loves attention. Prince doesn't mind being around other dogs, but he has not yet met any cats. He came to us from a pound in Southern Ohio, but prior to that we are unsure of his history. Prince had some skin and tummy issues when he first arrived, so he will need to remain on a sensitive skin diet. Prince is about two years old. His adoption fee is $250.00. He is neutered, dewormed, microchipped, and up to date on flea/tick prevention and vaccinations.",

            "description": "Hi there I'm Durango and I want to be your new best friend! My favorite place to be is right by your side. I am a playful puppy that loves to be the center of attention. I love to run and play with my foster sister, but listen well when called for. I am working hard on my potty training, and I potty right away when taken outside which is great this time of year! I like to be a good boy and I already know to sit before getting my food. I think I would be a great sidekick for anyone looking for a full time friend! I will play hard as long as you want, and then will snuggle right up with you at the end of the day. My sweet lab face is irresistible don't you think!? The \"D Pups\" came into rescue when they were just a couple weeks old, along with their sweet & beautiful mom, Daisybelle Fluffbottoms, when they became a homeless family and needed our help. Durango is a growing male Black Lab mix pup born approximately 10-23-20. He is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, given flea/tick preventive, dewormed & started on heartworm preventive. Adoption fee is $575 to help offset the many expenses we have for vetting costs. We rely strictly on adoption fees and donations to continue to save the lives of orphaned & abandoned pets; 100% goes towards their care. If interested in adopting one of our available dogs or puppies, please complete an online adoption application at https://dollyslegacyanimalrescue.org/adopt/ You will be contacted by our adoption coordinator via email after your application has been reviewed & approved to schedule an appointment.",

Sophie was very underweight when Lost Paws of Texas rescued her so she gets very excited when it's feeding time or when you give her treats and she can nip your fingers. Once she realizes that her food will come on a regular basis and you give her a gentle correction this should be able to be resolved fairly quickly. She gets along well with other dogs so she could be a great canine sibling as well as an only family pet.",

She likes to jump in on any interesting game and loves her loving when she tires out.  She plays well with her siblings, other dogs and cats and is learning the house rules.  She would do well with a dog-buddy to show her the ropes.  She would love an attached secure fenced yard and someone to keep her entertained and challenged during the day as she is one smart curious girl.  Please contact 4lvdch@bullerinetworks.net for a pre-adopt ap that starts the process so you can meet her",

Her foster family is also crating her when she isn\u2019t supervised. Xena is going to make a great addition to someone\u2019s family. We do not cat test but her foster family reports no obvious prey drive when out in the yard so she may be willing to share her home with a cat. \nFOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS TO BE CONSIDERED: \n\nTo adopt, complete the application at tarnj.org/adopt\n\nIf you have any questions at all, please DO NOT use the PetFinder inquiry form as we do not respond to those. Questions should be sent to info@tarnj.org. \n\nAn application is required before any meets are scheduled so the best way to be considered is to apply ASAP at tarnj.org/adopt.\n\nWe are all volunteer-run and do our best to respond to every application.

Be sure to check back as we get to know Elgin more!\n\nIf you\u2019d like to meet Elgin, the first step is to complete and submit an adoption application on our okwestierescue.com website and we\u2019ll get the process started. \n\nPlease allow 1-2 weeks to finish processing your application, but please know our volunteers are working hard on it. \n\nElgin\u2019s adoption fee is $300 and is tax deductible. \n\nNOTE: You must complete and submit an application and be approved to adopt prior to being able to meet the dog.\u00a0\u00a0The requested tax-deductible adoption donation is $400 for our puppies, $300 for up to age 7 and $150 for ages 8 and older.\nWe do not ship our pets.\u00a0\u00a0Be prepared to travel to Tulsa, OK, or Oklahoma City, OK, or the location where this dog is fostered to pick up your dog in person if your application is approved.\u00a0\u00a0Once you are approved, you may adopt any of our dogs that is a good fit. \n\nWe are a non-profit organization that spends our adoption fees and donations on vaccinations, surgeries, various medical tests, medicines, food and supplies needed by our dogs. Our fees do not cover the overall expenses incurred by the care of our dogs, but they do help defray the costs involved.\u00a0\u00a0We thank you for your support. \n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always try to select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dog\u2019s needs and try to find the best match for both dog and human.\nWe leave a dog\u2019s profile online until either it has been adopted, has received several applications, or is not able to be adopted for some reason.",

            "description": "See Spot Run. See Spot Play. See Spot Give Kisses! Spot is a fun, friendly guy who is having a blast on the farm. He is enjoying making tons of new doggy friends and has quickly become best friends with several new playmates who he loves to wrestle with. Between matches, you can find Spot soaking up attention from volunteers. Spot is young about a year old and still has some of that playful puppy energy and loves playing with toys. He would be a great running buddy or hiking partner, supplemented with trips to the doggy park where he could make even more doggy friends! He walks well on a leash and knows to do his potty outside, but otherwise lacks much more in the ways of formal training. Spot has all the makings of a great, loyal companion with just a little structure and guidance to show him the way. While Spot is enjoying his time at Saving Grace, we would really love to See Spot find a furever home!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

When  we got Ham he had been dumped in the county and had been running stray for several months and during that time He had been repeatedly pepper sprayed by the mail man.  Eventually when he wouldn't go away one of the people in the area called us about him. When we picked him up he was very thin and he trusted no one. With a little time and effort he slowly started to trust us. He has been with us for a while and is such an amazing dog who will allow anything from the people he loves and trust. He enjoys cuddling and being held.  He can still be shy with new people but once you have gained his trust you have a friend for life. Mayham is  such a big baby in every way. He does great with other dogs and kids too. Ham is a  boy who needs a patent home that is willing to give him the time and love he deserves. Ham is a athletic boy who can clear a 4 ft fence. He enjoys going out on walks and then coming home and crashing in the blankets. Hammie is a smart boy too and has graduated form obedience class.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.German Shepherd dogs, as well as the other herding breeds that we have in rescue, are highly active, energetic, working breeds. They require considerable vetting, exercise, socialization, training, leadership and mental stimuli in order to be well-adjusted, well-balanced, and well-mannered dogs. Even if you exercise and play with your dog daily in your fenced yard, you MUST still take your dog out on daily walks and outings in order to work on his/her leash skills, manners, and social skills. These breeds make great additions to active families who will pamper them, but who will also work with them, as they are smart dogs who need leadership, structure, plenty of activity and mental stimulation. If you are new to German Shepherds (and other herding breeds), please research the breed to make sure this is the dog for you. We ask that you consider the time and financial commitment that your German Shepherd (or other herding breed) dog will require before applying for one. Please review the section on our website (www.heartlandgsrescue.org) 'Is a HUGS Dog Right for You?' for additional information. Emma is a sweet, goofy, playful young gal. She loves walks and playing with toys. She knows 'sit,' 'kennel up,' and is working on 'down' and 'drop.' Emma is very treat motivated and is a smart girl. She is working hard on her manners and greeting visitors without jumping up. She enjoys playing with the dogs in her foster home, as she is full of puppy energy. She loves being around the humans in her foster home as well, and likes getting lots of attention from them. She also really enjoys going for walks and playing outside with her foster parents. She is working on her leash manners as well. Since Emma is just a young pup, she will thrive in an active forever home.\nLike all German Shepherds, this sweet girl would make a great addition to an active home that will provide the love, structure, good leadership, activity and mental stimulation that she needs. Because of that, Emma's ideal owner will have prior GSD, or similar breed experience. Emma would do fine as an only dog, or with a patient/mellow dog her size. Even if you exercise and play with your dog daily in your fenced yard, please remember that you MUST still take your dog out on daily walks and outings, in order to provide sufficient stimulation, ward off boredom, and work on leash skills, and manners. Emma's adoption fee is $400, all of which goes back into offsetting our high-cost vetting expenses and rescuing more dogs. Adoption fees include spay/neuter, current on age-appropriate vaccinations, fecal, deworming, flea/tick and heartworm preventative, heartworm testing if old enough (treated if positive), and microchipped. Learn more about the adoption process and requirements, and apply at: http://heartlandgsrescue.rescuegroups.org/info/adoption. Please review the information in the 'About Us', 'Important Considerations' and 'Adopt' sections on our website menu, as it contains useful information about the breed, adoption fees, the adoption process and our requirements, and how meeting the dogs works.",

Imagine this: a young, handsome blonde with good manners and a fondness for chew toys meets an older, more experienced human who takes him in and mentors him. They do everything together and form a beautiful friendship. There are no planes, and the Maverick in this story is me, so wed have to call it Top Gums. (Because of the chew toys! Haha.) Or maybe Bark to the Future? Eh, or we could just skip the movie entirely and you could adopt this young, handsome blonde pup with good manners and a fondness for chew toys. I love happy endings and real ones are even better than the ones on the screen!",

They have been weaned and now she can find a home of her own.  Luckily, she\u2019ll be spayed soon and will be able to find a family that will love and dote on her, like she so desperately desires.  She still needs a few more weeks before she can be spayed so we are looking for a foster home until her surgery.  She will then be available for adoption. After all she\u2019s been through, she\u2019s not interested in having other animals in the home.  She is wonderful with people though, and would love to have a home that has plenty of time to share.  She does fine on a leash , although she\u2019s a very easy going girl that would be happy just relaxing with her people or hanging out in the fenced yard.  She is crate trained so can be left alone for a reasonable amount of hours.  She must have a 6ft securely fenced yard and kids must be over 10yrs old.  During foster, all supplies will be provided.",

It appears to be an old injury and nothing to be done to fix it at this point but he's a happy little guy not in pain and loves to be carried. He doesn't have control of his bladder and bowels and needs his bladder expressed several times daily (he is very easy and tolerant for it!) and needs someone experienced with caring for special needs pups like him. \n\nIf you are interested in opening your home to this sweetheart please submit an application from our website. He's in the process of getting a full medical work-up with our veterinary team- he has a heart murmur that will require more testing and desperately needs a dental as his teeth are rotting and falling out!

No rental or apartment living for Max. Kids over 15 please. No cats.\n\nMax is a very sweet boy. We got him off of Craigs list as a \"free dog\". He is 1-2 years old and his breed is anyone's guess. He could have some Chihuahua, Jack Russel Terrier and/or Rat Terrier in him. He is a great little guy. He is shy at first, even a bit scared but once he knows you he is good to go. Max is in foster care and good with the other male and female dog in his home. He loves to play chase and will fetch toys and bring them back to you. He is 90% housebroken and uses the doggie door to do his business outside almost all of the time. Max does not show well, he will be scared of you at first, keep his distance and bark.   His foster family is working on more socialization skills with Max. He is great on leash and loves his walks and is getting to know the people around the neighborhood. He will need kids 15 and older or an all adult home. No put of state. Local is best.\n\nMax is seen by appointment only with an approved application. If you are interested in Max please fill out an application of interest from our website at www.animalsrule.org",

            "description": "Friends for life, Bear and Pippin are two tiny precious Chihuahuas that need to be adopted as a pair.  They are rarely apart and provide each other immeasurable comfort and companionship.  Both would be wonderful pets for a senior or family with older children.  No small children or puppies, please.  They prefer a calm quiet household where they can take a nap in peace.  Preferably, with someone that is home most of the day.  They like to follow you around the house as you go about your day.  Bear is a feisty five year old boy with a chocolate and white colored coat.  He may only weigh six pounds, but he\u2019s definitely the boss and has a big personality.  His shy girlfriend Pippin is seven years old and a bit on the chunky side at eight pounds.  She\u2019s a tricolored beauty and very calm and sweet.  With daily walks, Pippin should be fit and trim in no time.  Both dogs walk well on leash and enjoy taking trips to the park.  Like most Chihuahuas, they can be selective when making friends with other dogs.  If own a dog currently, we would be happy to schedule a meet and greet to check compatibility.  They are not fond of cats.  The perfect house guests, Bear and Pippin are very well mannered and already housebroken.  A fenced in yard is a must for these two tiny pups to keep them safe when outside.  Bear and Pippin are easy to love and care for.  If you are looking for a package deal, please consider this sweet pair.  \n\nTo adopt this pet, Click \"More About Us\" and then \"Adoption Application\" to be directed to our online HSNWGA application form.  You will be contacted by our Adoption Coordinator once your application is reviewed and approved.  Due to high volume of applications, we are only able to contact those applicants that best meet the needs of that individual pet.",

The ears top off my cute fully posed sit while being on guard. I am busy working on my potty training, and not to brag but I can go all night in my kennel without an accident. I am a playful puppy that responds well to commands. I am gentle and don't jump up much, unless I'm very excited. I play nicely with other dogs and reads their signals well. If they want me to back off I do. I am also very content to play by myself with a basket of toys. I am a great mix of cute and playful and am independent enough to entertain myself. I would make the perfect companion for any family! Come meet me and fall in love! The \"D Pups\" came into rescue when they were just a couple weeks old, along with their sweet & beautiful mom, Daisybelle Fluffbottoms, when they became a homeless family and needed our help. Dexter is a growing male Black Lab mix pup born approximately 10-23-20. He is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, given flea/tick preventive, dewormed & started on heartworm preventive. Adoption fee is $575 to help offset the many expenses we have for vetting costs. We rely strictly on adoption fees and donations to continue to save the lives of orphaned & abandoned pets; 100% goes towards their care. If interested in adopting one of our available dogs or puppies, please complete an online adoption application at https://dollyslegacyanimalrescue.org/adopt/ You will be contacted by our adoption coordinator via email after your application has been reviewed & approved to schedule an appointment.",

They have been weaned and now she can find a home of her own.  Luckily, she\u2019ll be spayed soon and will be able to find a family that will love and dote on her, like she so desperately desires.  She still needs a few more weeks before she can be spayed so we are looking for a foster home until her surgery.  She will then be available for adoption. After all she\u2019s been through, she\u2019s not interested in having other animals in the home.  She is wonderful with people though, and would love to have a home that has plenty of time to share.  She does fine on a leash , although she\u2019s a very easy going girl that would be happy just relaxing with her people or hanging out in the fenced yard.  She is crate trained so can be left alone for a reasonable amount of hours.  She must have a 6ft securely fenced yard and kids must be over 10yrs old.  During foster, all supplies will be provided.",

It appears to be an old injury and nothing to be done to fix it at this point but he's a happy little guy not in pain and loves to be carried. He doesn't have control of his bladder and bowels and needs his bladder expressed several times daily (he is very easy and tolerant for it!) and needs someone experienced with caring for special needs pups like him. \n\nIf you are interested in opening your home to this sweetheart please submit an application from our website. He's in the process of getting a full medical work-up with our veterinary team- he has a heart murmur that will require more testing and desperately needs a dental as his teeth are rotting and falling out!

No rental or apartment living for Max. Kids over 15 please. No cats.\n\nMax is a very sweet boy. We got him off of Craigs list as a \"free dog\". He is 1-2 years old and his breed is anyone's guess. He could have some Chihuahua, Jack Russel Terrier and/or Rat Terrier in him. He is a great little guy. He is shy at first, even a bit scared but once he knows you he is good to go. Max is in foster care and good with the other male and female dog in his home. He loves to play chase and will fetch toys and bring them back to you. He is 90% housebroken and uses the doggie door to do his business outside almost all of the time. Max does not show well, he will be scared of you at first, keep his distance and bark.   His foster family is working on more socialization skills with Max. He is great on leash and loves his walks and is getting to know the people around the neighborhood. He will need kids 15 and older or an all adult home. No put of state. Local is best.\n\nMax is seen by appointment only with an approved application. If you are interested in Max please fill out an application of interest from our website at www.animalsrule.org",

            "description": "Friends for life, Bear and Pippin are two tiny precious Chihuahuas that need to be adopted as a pair.  They are rarely apart and provide each other immeasurable comfort and companionship.  Both would be wonderful pets for a senior or family with older children.  No small children or puppies, please.  They prefer a calm quiet household where they can take a nap in peace.  Preferably, with someone that is home most of the day.  They like to follow you around the house as you go about your day.  Bear is a feisty five year old boy with a chocolate and white colored coat.  He may only weigh six pounds, but he\u2019s definitely the boss and has a big personality.  His shy girlfriend Pippin is seven years old and a bit on the chunky side at eight pounds.  She\u2019s a tricolored beauty and very calm and sweet.  With daily walks, Pippin should be fit and trim in no time.  Both dogs walk well on leash and enjoy taking trips to the park.  Like most Chihuahuas, they can be selective when making friends with other dogs.  If own a dog currently, we would be happy to schedule a meet and greet to check compatibility.  They are not fond of cats.  The perfect house guests, Bear and Pippin are very well mannered and already housebroken.  A fenced in yard is a must for these two tiny pups to keep them safe when outside.  Bear and Pippin are easy to love and care for.  If you are looking for a package deal, please consider this sweet pair.  \n\nTo adopt this pet, Click \"More About Us\" and then \"Adoption Application\" to be directed to our online HSNWGA application form.  You will be contacted by our Adoption Coordinator once your application is reviewed and approved.  Due to high volume of applications, we are only able to contact those applicants that best meet the needs of that individual pet.",

The ears top off my cute fully posed sit while being on guard. I am busy working on my potty training, and not to brag but I can go all night in my kennel without an accident. I am a playful puppy that responds well to commands. I am gentle and don't jump up much, unless I'm very excited. I play nicely with other dogs and reads their signals well. If they want me to back off I do. I am also very content to play by myself with a basket of toys. I am a great mix of cute and playful and am independent enough to entertain myself. I would make the perfect companion for any family! Come meet me and fall in love! The \"D Pups\" came into rescue when they were just a couple weeks old, along with their sweet & beautiful mom, Daisybelle Fluffbottoms, when they became a homeless family and needed our help. Dexter is a growing male Black Lab mix pup born approximately 10-23-20. He is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, given flea/tick preventive, dewormed & started on heartworm preventive. Adoption fee is $575 to help offset the many expenses we have for vetting costs. We rely strictly on adoption fees and donations to continue to save the lives of orphaned & abandoned pets; 100% goes towards their care. If interested in adopting one of our available dogs or puppies, please complete an online adoption application at https://dollyslegacyanimalrescue.org/adopt/ You will be contacted by our adoption coordinator via email after your application has been reviewed & approved to schedule an appointment.",

I would love a quiet household that will give me a comfy and safe place to lay my head. \nI don't knit, cook or do laundry but I will make you smile. Are you my happy ever after? \nAll dog adoptions include the following:\n--Spay/neuter surgery\n--All current vaccinations\n--Microchip\n--Wellness exam through VCA Animal Hospitals\n--Access to our Behavior Helpline for the lifetime of the pet \nFor more information or to schedule an appointment to meet this pet, please complete a Dog Adoption Questionnaire online.

            "description": "It's clear by how emaciated Cedric was upon his arrival to Saving Grace and the scars on his face that he has not always known kindness, however, you would never know based on his happy go lucky personality. Cedric is the kind of dog that makes you wanna be a better person because Cedric only sees the best in others. He's a happy guy that greets you with a wagging tail and a big smile and is an absolute testament to the resilience of dogs. Cedric is enjoying his extra meals and the beefing up process to get him to a healthy weight. Once there he is sure to be a super fun boy that would love to join you on any fun plans you had in mind! Cedric would absolutely love to meet you, so won't you consider giving him the loving, caring home he so deserves?!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

            "description": "Abby Lynn is a beautiful and trendy doggy, who likes to wear her string of pearls and take the world head-on despite her disabilities; blindness and diabetes. She wasn\u2019t blind her entire life, so her memory is engrained with the beauty that surrounds her.\n \nAbby loves to be part of the family! If something is amiss outside, she will let you know! She\u2019s shy at first, but don\u2019t worry, there is a fun and friendly bark just waiting to come out! She will greet you at the door when you arrive home, and sniff the day\u2019s adventures on your clothes, she loves to be near her family.\n \nAbby loves going on walks, she also loves treats! Blindness doesn\u2019t stop Abby, and she learns your home layout very quickly. It\u2019s spectacular to see her walk through a room to a hallway, stop, pivot, and walk down the hall without bumping into anything! Obviously this will take some time, but she is very cautious and careful until she learns, and then she becomes carefree. Her day consists of a lot of beauty rest, binging Netflix, and just being sweet and gorgeous. She doesn\u2019t require, nor ask, for a lot of physical attention, but she does enjoy being (slowly)scooped up and loved on.\n \nAbby Lynn has diabetes, which just means she\u2019ll need a special diet of healthier food options, twice daily insulin, and the occasional blood sugar testing so the doctor can track her over the phone as opposed to office visits. Since she is diabetic, she does need to go #1 about once an hour during the day, unless she\u2019s in a deep beauty rest or overnight while she\u2019s deep asleep. She will let you know she needs to go outside by simply standing up! Standing up and walking around from a beauty rest can mean one of two things, she thirsty or she needs to go potty! If she begins to walk circles in front of you, you have time and can scoop her up. She will stop if you say no, let\u2019s go outside! \n \nAbby is a girl who knows what she wants. She can be persuaded by kindness and patience, just remember that she is blind and she needs time to understand her surroundings. How does she get when she feels pushed around? She simply sits down right in front of you and refuses to listen.\n \nAbby loves having fur friends, but she\u2019s also okay being the sole attention of her family! She doesn\u2019t like the sound of food thieves around her while she eats. She may give them a grimace and low growl, or sometimes an outlandish yelp but she won\u2019t bite or hurt them. She just wants to eat in peace and should be fed separately. \n\nGiving Abby her insulin is super easy and she doesn\u2019t even flinch. She had diabetes before she lost her eyes and is very used to this routine, plus she gets that treat after! Abby is not toy motivated, they just aren\u2019t of interest to her. She loves fluffy snow! If it\u2019s snowing, get her outside and watch the cuteness begin and she jumps and plays in and out of the snow.\n \nAbby Lynn does well with kids and loves to cuddle with them! Our children are over 7, but with her demeanor I would assume it would be just fine! Abby hasn\u2019t met anyone she doesn\u2019t like, and she\u2019s very interested in smelling their clothes and getting to know who they are and where they\u2019ve been that day!\n \nAbby Lynn really is a great girl. Yes, she\u2019s diabetic and recently blind, but the beautiful part is that hasn\u2019t stopped her from being truly kind and having a love for life and her family. She just wants to belong, and the perfect family for her would be a family that is just as loving and kind as her; a family who has the time to take her outside on walks, let her outside to go #1 throughout the day, and a family that knows that despite what she\u2019s been through, she is deserving of the love from them as she gives to her family.\n\nAbby\u2019s adoption fee is $125, and adopters must live within 175 miles of the Quad City Area.\n\nFor a chance to meet Abby, fill out the online application at www.k9kindnessrescue.org/adopt/application\n\nAbby and K9 Kindness Rescue thank you for considering adoption through rescue for your new family companion!\n",

He came from a rough life and will need a lot of training. He is not house or leash trained. He needs to go to a family with older kids and people who are willing to be patient and work with him. He is a great dog and he will be even better if you take the time to properly take care of him and train him.",

He\u2019s such a good boy!\n\nBirmingham still needs some good training. He gets along well with other dogs of all sizes and ages after a proper introduction. He doesn\u2019t seem interested in cats. His ideal home would be very active, have lots of room to run, with a doggy friend to play with. \n\nBirmingham knows basic commands, seems to be house broken, does well in his kennel, but needs some work on the leash. He is heartworm positive and has started his treatments. \n\n$200 donation helps cover spay/neuter, microchip with free registration, vaccines (at least 2 sets, may need more boosters at your vet), deworming, heartworm test if over 6 months, and current on flea/heartworm prevention.\n\nIf interested, please fill out an application at the link below and we will be in touch with you shortly. \nhttps://form.jotform.com/katvet2/adoption",

            "description": "Introducing the beautiful Lana, a 3 year old 46lb gal originally rescued in the aftermath of a hurricane in Louisiana. We met this sweetheart in a Texas shelter and brought her to NYC where she's currently living in a loving foster home. Lana is a very sweet dog in the home, but is very fearful outside and needs a patient adopter who will help her slowly build up her confidence. Lana is initially wary of new people, and is typically more fearful of men at first. But her fosters tell us that by giving her time to herself and going slowly with her, she warms up to her people and is very loving - she's taken to following her current foster around the house and loves snuggling up next to her! Lana is also timid around other dogs and likely wouldn't do well in a home with another very exuberant pup, but she could do well with the right canine match. She responds well to treats and love, and we know that with a little extra patience and time she'll open up to her true happy self! Approved adopters interested in Lana can email adopt@heartsandbonesrescue.com for more info. If you're not approved yet, apply today!",

She did great with other dogs here at the shelter, but is a little shy at first when she meets certain people, can be reactive to strangers. A cat free home is best for her. and we recommend children over 10 years old. Mally is young and will need to learn basic commands and leash manners. She is very strong and pulls when on a walk, ask staff for harness suggestions or other options to help with this. She doesn't like to be crated and will try to escape.

            "description": "Senior Hearts Rescue and Renewal is the only licensed senior dog rescue organization in Western Pennsylvania. We do not have a shelter or a public facility. ALL of our dogs reside in foster homes in the greater Pittsburgh, PA area. \n\nWe are a 100% volunteer organization. Please respect our volunteers' time. If a dog is listed on PetFinder, he/she IS available for adoption. We cannot reply to messages, phone calls, and emails about a dog until we have received, reviewed, and approved an adoption application. \n\nOur ADOPTION application is found at www.seniorhearts.org Completing this application is the first step in our adoption screening process. You MUST complete the application in entirety in order to be considered as a potential adopter.  Please select \"More About Us\" for further details on our adoption requirements.  You can meet a dog ONLY after we have completed our adoption approval process.\n\nIf you are looking at the dog below, it most certainly means the dog is available for adoption. We look forward to receiving your application in hopes that you are able to meet our adoption requirements and provide this dog a loving furever home.\n\nHello. Layla here. I\u2019m 10yrs tough and 29lbs. I\u2019m an independent girl who loves long walks and lots of play time. They call me a \u201ctoy destructer\u201d. \n\nI love to cuddle, snuggle, be held, and get belly rubs. I am very loyal to my person.\n  I am an exuberant walker and good for long distances.  I have been told I am very cute, spunky, with a bold personality.  \n\nApartment living would be a big no, I like to bark at the delivery people.  They love me. \n\n I would prefer to be an only child.  No other dogs cats or kids for me. I want and deserve all the attention I can handle. \n\nIf the best of best friends is what you are searching for, you have found your girl.  I promise all the unconditional love you can handle. I can be adopted within a two hour radius of Pittsburgh, PA. If you are interested in giving me a furever home, you must first complete the adoption application at www.seniorhearts.org\n\nxoxo\nLayla",

Have not cat tested ----- Suitable for: home with an above ground securely fenced yard. ----- Medical/Behavioral Needs: None noted ----- Additional Notes: Beautiful Nelly came to rescue because her family didnt have time for her. She is a higher energy mixed breed and is adoptable to a home with another dog because she likes to play! She is a sweet and beautiful girl but we have zero idea on her breeds!! She is a looker though! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If interested in meeting and potentially adopting please read the adoption requirements and complete the adoption application located at forbellessake.org. Once processed and approved a meet and greet can be scheduled and if a match an adoption is finalized at that time. FBS standard adoption fee is $175 and all dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, and treated for any known medical needs. Breeds are not guaranteed but often a best guess. Housetraining is not guaranteed but crate training is worked on with all residents. If a yard is present, a secure fence is mandatory.",

            "description": "One look at our handsome Catahoula mix, Romeo and you'll be reciting William Shakespeare. With his gorgeous blue merle coat and matching set of bright blue eyes he is one gorgeous fella, but just wait till we tell you he has a personality to match! Even though he's a big boy about 65 pounds you won't be convincing him that he's not a lapdog, and he will happily climb up and cuddle up at the first opportunity. He is still warming up to all the hustle and bustle of the farm, and seems to be uncertain and submissive regarding new experiences, but takes comfort in the kindness and encouragement of humans and more confident canines. Romeo would love to find a home with a female canine companion, his very own Juliet if you will. At just two years old, we are sure that once he is comfortable you'll be left with a happy energetic dog as Catahoulas are known for. Romeo would do great in an active family who can ensure he gets plenty of exercise and challenges his mind with training which will also help to continue to build his confidence. We know that you've already fallen head over heels so go ahead and put in your adoption request to come meet Romeo!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

Delta is a growing female Black Lab mix pup born approximately 10-23-20. She is spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, given flea/tick preventive, dewormed & started on heartworm preventive. Adoption fee is $575 to help offset the many expenses we have for vetting costs. We rely strictly on adoption fees and donations to continue to save the lives of orphaned & abandoned pets; 100% goes towards their care. If interested in adopting one of our available dogs or puppies, please complete an online adoption application at https://dollyslegacyanimalrescue.org/adopt/ You will be contacted by our adoption coordinator via email after your application has been reviewed & approved to schedule an appointment.",

She will also need a home with kids over 12 who will leave her alone when she is eating. Kiara was housetrained in the past and did well when left alone.

We\u2019ve all heard the phrase, \u201cYou can\u2019t teach an old dog new tricks,\u201d but that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Adult dogs have a great attention span and eagerness to please, allowing them to learn faster than more youthful members of their species. If you\u2019re looking for a steadfast companion who will be truly grateful for a second chance at a happy life, consider adopting a dog. \n\nViv needs more socialization with people and dogs. She would not be a good dog for a first time owner. Training with positive methods needs to start immediately so she can learn a way to communicate in a successful way. Impulse control exercises to help her calm down. Because some body sensitivity to handling was seen, young children are not recommended at this time. High rise buildings with elevators or congested areas would not help her develop good behaviors. They would cause her to get too excited and possibly make poor choices. Work on trade up's for things of higher value. Do not just take things from her. Do not rough house and get her too excited, this is when she will start to jump up and get mouthy. Not too much touchy/feely/kissy/huggy until you have time to develop a relationship and you can tell what she is comfortable with. Seek out a daycare/trainer for dog socialization if you would like to see how much she can improve. Do not just meet dogs on the street.

            "description": "Charles is just a hunk, a hunk of burning love! This big guy, approx. 5 years old and 75 lbs, has quickly stolen the hearts of his foster parents and everyone who meets him. Aside from being a real looker, Charles also knows how to turn on the charm. In fact, he sometimes gets to go to work with his foster mom and is a very well-behaved, happy office guest.\n\nCharles is well-behaved and snuggly but also enjoys being active as well, as he is a generally athletic, outgoing, fun guy! He loves going for walks and long hikes, but with his size, needs an able-bodied handler. In the yard, he enjoys romping and exploring along with a good game of fetch.\n\nCharles is housebroken however he can not be crated. His foster parents give him run of the house and he does just fine. Charles loves getting treats in his Kong, however he sometimes loves them a bit too much and will resource guard. The good news is that he is very food motivated and has picked up on commands quickly. Another fun fact: he\u2019s a very good boy at the vet!\n\nPlease note that the first step in our process is the adoption application found on our website www.midatlanticbullybuddies.org. Charles is neutered, microchipped and vaccinated.",

I love to play with other dogs and need a doggie playmate in my forever home. I am super well behaved and I listen really well! I know how to sit and come to you when you call me. I need an experienced dog owner who will provide the structured environment I need to help me continue to be a laid back, well behaved guy. I love to snuggle on the couch or in the bed and I'll do anything to earn your pets and food! I also love to take walks, although my foster mom says need to work a little bit on my leash skills. I'm house trained and crate trained. No kitties please!!",

Please note that the breed(s) and size the dogs are posted as is our best guess as we usually don't have any history on the dogs or background information.\n\n***BONDED WITH BUDDY***\n\nHi, my name is Scarlet! I arrived two weeks ago from Alabama where I had been dumped by not nice people with several other furry friends, including my brother Buddy who needs to be adopted with me. I am about a year old, a spayed female hybrid mix (some say Miniature Pinscher or Doberman Pinscher. Does it really matter?) I am only about 20 pounds! I am looking for my furever home and family. I am starting to come out of my shell and learning how to play with the other dogs in my foster home. I am house-trained and love to play in the yard (but I am a bonafide escape artist and need a secure fence!). I will need some help with being on a leash and getting trained with that as I am not too familiar with them. My foster mom says I am very sweet. I really like her and being snuggled and pet. If you are looking to add to your family please consider adopting me as I would really love a home and family of my own.",

Daphne is a growing female Black Lab mix pup born approximately 10-23-20. She is spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, given flea/tick preventive, dewormed & started on heartworm preventive. Adoption fee is $575 to help offset the many expenses we have for vetting costs. We rely strictly on adoption fees and donations to continue to save the lives of orphaned & abandoned pets; 100% goes towards their care. If interested in adopting one of our available dogs or puppies, please complete an online adoption application at https://dollyslegacyanimalrescue.org/adopt/ You will be contacted by our adoption coordinator via email after your application has been reviewed & approved to schedule an appointment.",

Please note that the breed(s) and size the dogs are posted as is our best guess as we usually don't have any history on the dogs or background information.\n\nI am shocked that this amazing girl has not received any applications as of yet. She is an amazing 2-3 year old Bully Blend ! She weighs about 50 pounds and is scheduled for her spay soon! She is full of love and is looking for a family to be her forever and call her own.\n\nShe loves to hang with everyone especially her foster mom and the kids who range from 12-22! Boys and girls alike. She loves to play, go for long walks (although she is working on her leash skills), meet new people - she loves everyone, although she likes to jump and give hugs which we are working on so she does not knock anyone down. She loves to watch TV, and chew her Kong and Nylabones. She is doing great in her foster home but needs to be in a home where she can be with her family all of the time. At this time we would not recommend a home with other animals. She is friendly toward them but does not have proper puppy social skills. This is something she needs to work on as she apparently had not had the opportunity as a young puppy to learn these skills. She is completely housebroken and rarely has accidents, if so it is because her foster family missed that she was waiting at the door with leash to go out. Did I forget she also loves car rides ! She does not have any separation anxiety and rarely barks ! She also has the best smooshy nose freckle face and loves to give kisses\nShe would benefit from a fenced-in yard as she loves to play ball and frisbee! And believe it or not she even brings it back.

I'm a pretty quiet girl who likes to keep to herself most of the time, but can be talkative at times when other pups are near, particularly while I'm eating. I am not overly social and usually don't like it when other dogs come near my space, so I would probably do best living in a home where I am the only dog around. I think that I could be happy in a home with children, preferably older children who would know to give me some space at times and how to respect my boundaries. I think I'd be an excellent pick for an experienced dog owner who can help me learn how to be more confident in myself and my abilities. I could really be happy in any type of home environment. I could benefit from continued training, including potty-training but I do keep my kennel very clean overnight. I love to go on nice long leashed walks here at the ranch and can't wait to continue doing that with you really soon.",

I am known for being super sweet and friendly with other dogs. I can be a snuggle bug as well! The staff here at the ranch have described me as the perfect family dog, so if you've got young children, I might just be what you're looking for. I do appear to have a prey drive, so I would be happiest living in a home without cats or other small animals. I would be a great pick for a first-time dog owner, as long as you've got a great big yard for me to run around in. I think a busy home would suit me best, particularly one that has lots of visitors who will want to give me love and attention. I may even be the type of pup that you can bring out and about with you on your daily activities, if you wanted to! I could benefit from some continued obedience training, but I am very smart - I know my name and how to sit on command! I also appear to be potty-trained and am great at walking on a leash!",

I am a very happy and sweet little girl who absolutely loves to play and get tons of attention from the people around me. I love to play with other dogs, regardless of their size and I think I'd be an excellent addition to a family with young children. I'd be a great fit for an experienced dog owner or a first-time adopter and I think I could really get used to living in any variety of home environments. Whether your home-life is busy or quiet, I will be able to easily adapt as long as I'm getting lots of snuggles! While I could use a little bit of training, I may even be the type of pup that you can bring out and about with you on your daily activities if you wanted to. I'm not completely potty-trained yet, but I do keep my kennel clean all night! I just LOVE to go for long leashed walks and would make an excellent exercise partner for my new owner!",

It will take some time to train him but he can learn and once he does he will be the best boy. You need to be patient and willing to work with him.

She loves to cuddle, is curious, and will follow her people all over the house to see what they're up to. She loves to sleep with her person at night. Because she is toothless, she needs soft food. She loves to walk and hike. She can easily walk several miles each day, but will need a lift with any tall steps. Bella has never been trained by crate, but knows to eliminate outside. She does occasionally have accidents inside when she's stressed. Because of her small size, she is afraid of shadows when outside at night, and may need some assurance that's its safe to go into the yard. Bella's parents believed her to be empathic in nature, and very aware of their health. Her elderly parents suffered from\n\ndiabetes and secondary ailments, for which Bella seemed to express an innate awareness if their sugars were off, or if they needed help.\n\nBella will do best in a home where she is the only pet, only because that's been her experience throughout her life. She is good with families, but will enjoy older kids and adults best.",

They will need time, energy, and patience to help them become the best family pets they can be, so if you\u2019re up for a challenge and a lot of fun, consider adopting one! \n\nSteel, although adorable is not for a first time dog owner. He will need someone experienced in crate training. He did not do well when adopted for a short time when left alone. He is a rough/pushy player with other dogs and barks a lot when playing with them. He will need a play partner that is comfortable with this. Start training class as soon as you get him home so he understands what to do to be successful. He would not do well in a congested building or elevator building. Because he may take a while to settle in a crate your neighbors must be tolerant of a barking/howling puppy.",

            "description": "If interested in adopting, fostering or meeting this pet, please fill out an adoption application at www.salfidrescue.org. Please note that the breed(s) and size the dogs are posted as is our best guess as we usually don't have any history on the dogs or background information.\n\nCallie is a 2-year-old Catahoula Leopard Mix, at least that's our best guess! She is so beautiful, it's quite a mystery.\nFun Fact: The Catahoula Leopard is the state dog of Louisiana.\n \nCallie is an incredibly loyal, intelligent, and playful pup. She loves to be by your side, and (unless absorbed in the chewing of her favorite bone) will respond very quickly and cheerily to your call.\nShe needs to be walked regularly, or else she will get restless and start scratching at furniture and rugs. This is because Catahoula Leopards are working dogs, and were trained to hunt wild pigs and herd farm animals. Due to her herding instinct, she will usually stay close to your side if you are out and about. Since EVERY dog should have daily exercise, this should be no problem!\nCallie doesn\u2019t trust strangers, whether they be adult humans that she doesn\u2019t know or other dogs. She\u2019s not violent towards them, unless she feels like the house is being threatened. She will bark at people who approach the property.\nShe loves to play and will often bark while wagging her tail and jumping around, which can seem confusing to some who think this seems aggressive. Be careful what you give her to play with though, because she loves to tear up her toys (although very rarely tears up anything not given to her). Bones are a favorite of Callie's and provide a perfect way for her to chew away safely.\nHer crate training has proven to be exceptional. She may bark or whine at first as she gets settled into your home, but she is very good once she feels comfortable in the space.\nCallie is awaiting her forever home and is enjoying her time and learning to be part of a family while she waits !",

ALL of our dogs reside in foster homes in the greater Pittsburgh, PA area. \n\nWe are a 100% volunteer organization. Please respect our volunteers' time. If a dog is listed on PetFinder, he/she IS available for adoption. We cannot reply to messages, phone calls, and emails about a dog until we have received, reviewed, and approved an adoption application. \n\nOur ADOPTION application is found at www.seniorhearts.org Completing this application is the first step in our adoption screening process. You MUST complete the application in entirety in order to be considered as a potential adopter.  Please select \"More About Us\" for further details on our adoption requirements.  You can meet a dog ONLY after we have completed our adoption approval process.\n\nIf you are looking at the dog below, it most certainly means the dog is available for adoption. We look forward to receiving your application in hopes that you are able to meet our adoption requirements and provide this dog a loving furever home.\n\nAnd a short message from Abby...\n\nHey, there big beautiful world!  My name is Abby and I am a 13 years young gal looking for her furever home.  I only weigh 7 pounds so you could take me everywhere with you.  I am blind but that doesn't stop me from doing anything a dog can do with vision.\n\nI love short walks. I love soft toys to play with when I am in the mood. I wouldn't mind a dog sibling but it is not a must.  I get a bit bossy with them.  I love all people and especially my person.  I will follow you where ever you go.  \n\nIf a best friend is what you are looking for then I am your girl.  I promise soooo much unconditional love that you can handle. I can be adopted within a two hour radius of Pittsburgh, PA. If you are interested in giving me a furever home, you must first complete the adoption application at www.seniorhearts.org\n\nxoxo\nAbby",

CANCELED\nFor an application, please email info@tailsfromtheheart.org\n\nWith everything going on currently with COVID-19, we have canceled our public meet and greets until further notice. If you are interested in meeting any of our pets, please email us or fill out our online application. We can then review and send to the foster family. We may cancel our home visits as well but if you could attach photos of your yard and one or two of your home that would be great. In lieu of the visit this would allow us to meet you and allow you to meet the pet and conduct a possible adoption either outside your home or at a public place where safe distancing can occur.\n",

Freckles is house trained and knows basic commands like sit, down, leave it, and come. She is learning to fetch. She needs some more training but learns quickly and is an overall great dog. I've never seen her be aggressive with anyone. Wonderful with kids. She gets along with other dogs. Don't know about cats. She loves and needs daily exercise. Walks well on a leash. Sleeps in her crate but doesn't really like it. She loves chew toys, treats, and her stuffed animal. \n\nShe is from Pinon, AZ but has lived with her foster family in Flagstaff, AZ for the past month. She is spayed and has her rabies shots, parvo shots, and boosters. She is a healthy, happy, energetic girl! She would do best with lots of attention and companionship- human and/or dog. She must have learned about couches in her past life because she LOVES hanging with her family on the couch. She sheds minimally. Good with bikes. Okay with water. Must have a fenced yard. Meet your adventure dog!  \n\nAdoption adoption applications can be done online at blackhathumanesociety.org",

If you are interested in meeting any of our pets, please email us or fill out our online application. We can then review and send to the foster family. We may cancel our home visits as well but if you could attach photos of your yard and one or two of your home that would be great. In lieu of the visit this would allow us to meet you and allow you to meet the pet and conduct a possible adoption either outside your home or at a public place where safe distancing can occur.\n",

Please note that the breed(s) and size the dogs are posted as is our best guess as we usually don't have any history on the dogs or background information.\n\nMcKinley's ideal home would be a single women, retired or works from home, who can give him round the clock attention and doesn't travel often. He loves to snuggle and play and his heavily attached to \"his person\". He loves squeaky toys and carries them around everywhere he goes. \n\nHe would do best in a home with no cats, no kids, no men, and not regular visitors. Also, no other dogs is preferred but he can coexist with submissive dogs similar in size or slightly larger. He must go to a home with experience handling aggressive dogs; applications who has not had first hand experience with aggressive dogs of their own will not be considered. \n\nMcKinley will never be a dog ho can happily visit with strangers or spend extended periods in a public setting. His life prior to coming to us set him up to file and was not the friendliest. Although he's come a long way he does have his issues and quite the attitude. McKinley will need weeks if not months to fully adjust to your lifestyle. We are asking that he stays within an hour of his foster to help his transition and to provide any support he may need. \n\nMcKinely's separation anxiety has made potty training very difficult. He also does not handle being crated very well and has destroyed numerous crates attempting to get out.",

He came to ODAAT as a VERY sick puppy infected with Parvo. We honestly didn't know if he would make it, but Vader had the fight in him to survive. Today he is one happy and healthy puppy! Vader is a good mix of playful and calm. He loves to snuggle up on the furniture or in bed at night. He also plays well with the other dogs in his foster home and takes cues from them when they don't want to play anymore. He would do best with another dog in the home that he can play with and continue to learn from. He has not been cat tested at this time. Vader is protective of his family and needs a moment to warm up to people. That big ole mastiff barks can be intimidating! Once he sees you mean him no harm he is a lover. He loves to carry a stick or rocks in his mouth on his walks. So you have to be careful. True to the mastiff breed, he has already started his slobbering skills so he will need his new family to be accepting of this because he owns it!

            "description": "Wrinkles was found as a stray in Virginia in bad shape. We don't know her history but we can see from her scars that she had it rough. She was in the shelter for several months. We pulled her once they were considering euthanasia\u00a0due to time.\u00a0 Wrinkles's eyes ruptured at some point in her past. They were full of infection when we got her. I cannot imagine the pain. She's currently on antibiotic eye drops till surgery. She is covered in scars from fighting\u00a0dogs, even her body. She's had multiple litters.\u00a0She is heartworm negative, spayed, and microchipped. She's had multiple negative fecals. Her skin infection is healed. She could definitely\u00a0benefit from medicated baths though. She's had numerous exams. She had good bloodwork. She's up to date on vaccinations, heartworm prevention, and flea prevention. She is scheduled to have what's left of her eyes removed on February 1st. The estimate is $1,200. She will be able to go home after this. We'd really like to have her pre adopted. She has started licking her forearms from stress. She is scared being around all the dogs. I cannot even imagine hearing all the noises and not being able to see anything. She will growl if the dogs come up to her kennel. But she really likes dogs while walking. She gets very excited over them. There was an incident where a small dog got in her kennel at the same time as her. He's bad about doing that and then growling if you try to get him out. She reacted by biting. We don't blame her. The injury was very small. If she wanted to hurt him she could have. There was a huge size difference. We'd like to have her as an only pet or with a calm\u00a0single dog. She's obviously had a lot of trauma in her past and she deserves a very quiet home.\u00a0\u00a0\nWrinkles has really come into a wonderful personality. I can't even imagine how amazing she will be once she has her own home with less animals. She loves to go on walks in the neighborhood. She loves all the smells. She's walked past other dogs that she didn't know and could care less. She's very affectionate. She will rarely jump on you all excited. She will give kisses and wants to be petted. She's very happy. She wags a lot. She wants to play with the dogs she meets outside in the yard. She randomly doesn't like the pigs.\u00a0\n\nWe believe she's mostly shar pei but has a little of something else in there. She's 50 lbs. The vet believes she's 4 years old. Her teeth are sparkling white. She is crate trained. The few times she's been free she's not pottied inside. She's been great in the car. She's not big on being outside in the cold. She wants right back inside. She's good with clothes.\u00a0\nShe is located in New Orleans, Louisiana but we adopt out of state.",

If you are interested in this Westie, please visit our website to fill out an adoption application. Inquiries without an application submitted will not be returned. Due to the high volume of emails we receive daily, please visit our website prior to sending an email as most answers can be found there, including information about adoption fees and how the adoption process works.

            "description": "Bonded Saluki pair from Quatar.  Must be adopted together. Sweet and gentle. Grew up in the streets of Quatar and a construction site.  40 lbs long legged beauties. Cannot go to a home with invisible fence.\n\nSugar, spice, and everything nice!\nHope and Angel are a two for one special, they\u2019re attached at the hip so it\u2019s like having just one dog with double the bark!  \nThey are both Saluki mixes. Hope is black/ brown and 11 months old. Angel is the blonde one and a year and four months old. \nHope and Angel are both potty trained, cat friendly, dog friendly, people friendly, and love to show affection.  Hope is more outgoing; she loves to snuggle and I mean, really loves to snuggle.  Angel also loves pets and dog piling; however, she enjoys lounging around by herself.  They have an extremely calm temperament and are slowly getting used to the colder weather so they don\u2019t like being outside for long. If you leave your shoes out, they\u2019re safe with them!  Only a few times they\u2019ve picked up a shoe but that habit has been broken.  Both are decent with the crate, will have no issues as this takes time and already on the right track.  \nLastly, Hope is more protective of the house, she will not attack anyone as she loves people so she WILL let you know when someone is at the front door.  Angel loves people so much that when out she\u2019ll howl and whimper instantly but will stop once she has calmed down; this is also a habit that is being reduced but it just takes some time and love! \nBoth of these girls will need slow introductions to any other pets in the home as they will be nervous in their new environment. Hope and Angel will have no issues bonding into any loving family!\n\nIf interested in adopting please fill out our no obligation online application at www.puppypawsrescue.org \n\nNote: Our rescue requires that all adopter's current and prior animals are up-to-date on vaccinations (DHLPP & Rabies)  and preventatives (heartworm and flea and tick), unless there is a medical reason not allowing it. All animals in your household should be spayed or neutered unless medically indicated that they should not be or are currently still too young.",

Please note that the breed(s) and size the dogs are posted as is our best guess as we usually don't have any history on the dogs or background information.\n\nMeet our wonder-mom, Atreyu! She is an amazing hound mix momma to not one, not two..but a dozen beautiful babies! Her sweet pups are not old enough to say goodbye so mom can find her forever home. Atreyu is ready to be loved and have all of the attention, and boy does she deserve it!\n\nHer foster family has learned a lot about her. We think she is between one and two years old, as she seems to still be a puppy herself. She is housebroken (only a few accidents, which is normal for any new mom-let alone a home of twelve!) and she is bell-trained. Atreyu is good with dogs ( but probably need slow introduction), ignores our cats, and loves people. She is crate-trained (although she prefers to sleep in a bed with her humans). We are working on her leash skills. she knows sit and appears to be very smart and picks up on things quickly. Atreyu is very playful and loves to snuggle and hug, too.\nShe loves her two human foster sisters and would do well with any size family.",

Someone had left her in a box at a shelter and that is where we got her from.\nShe looks to be an \" itty bitty pitty\", aka Terrier mix.\nShe is current on vaccinations, has been microchipped, current on heartworm and flea prevention and this little girl survived parvo! She will be spayed before adopted. \nWe estimate her adult weight to be that of a medium size dog: between 25-50 pounds. It is hard to know without the benefit of seeing her parents, but based on her size now, her build and paw size that would be a fair estimate.\nShe is crate trained, does well with children and other dogs. She needs a home with a fenced yard and another doggie playmate or two to romp, play and stay out of puppy trouble with!\nShe is in Memphis. \n\n",

As I'm sitting here writing Omegas ads I need you to know I love this dog so much I would assume keep him then to adopt to him to the wrong home.\n Omega is a big goofy love that doesn't know his own size. He has no idea that he can hurt you. He is very vocal and voices his opinions all day every day. Lol. I've literally seen this dog scare the crap out of people. Funny but not funny. \n Omega was a owner surrender to the shelter. They paid a high price for him as a puppy and truly cared for him. They taught him sit, shake and lay. What they didn't teach him was manners. They didn't raise a puppy to grow up and be a 90lb all muscle dog. Now let's hit the bullet points.\nOmega was raised with kids but is rough and doesn't know his own size. Sensative babies will not do well.\nOmega was raised with a Cane Corso but is a attention hog. Submissive females will do good with him.\nOmega has a high prey drive. No cats or small pets. Fenced in yard required. \nOmega thinks he belongs in your lap if you get hurt easily stop dont keep reading. \n Omega is housebroken and crate trained.  Hes beast on a leash. He is 2.5 yrs old, neutered, microchipped,  utd on shots, heartworm negative and on flea/heartworm prevention. 200 adoption fee located in Picayune Ms please pm For Bullies Sake Bully Breed rescue if your qualified and have read the ad.",

Please note that the breed(s) and size the dogs are posted as is our best guess as we usually don't have any history on the dogs or background information.\n\nArmani is a 70-pound cuddle bug couch potato. She loves walks, but does tend to pull. She will settle to a manageable walk is not stimulus is present, as she is extremely excitable by small animals (SQUIRREL!) and keenly alert to any other dogs. Armani has shown some undesirable behavior around some other dogs, so it would be best if she was the only pet in the home. She is however very friendly with people and openly welcomes visitors into the home-sometimes she is too friendly, so we are working on her jumping. Armani does well with children; she is currently in a. foster with tweens and a toddler and had had no issues.\n\nArmani has extreme anxiety when being boarded, likely due to spending time in a shelter. She also has some seasonal allergies, which are easily managed with OTC allergy meds. Armani is a loyal and very affectionate dog who sometimes does not know her own strength. She would be best in a relaxed home with no other animals, a large yard and a tall fence. Armani needs a family who is willing to work with her on learning her strength and being obedient. She knows sit, stay, come and up-but needs to learn how to focus. Armani is just a. big, beautiful potato who deserves a great home.",

She does well with children, dogs and cats. Lucy has a gentle touch and would love nothing more than to find that special family to reciprocate her love. She is full-grown at 79 lbs, spayed, current on her vaccines and microchipped. She is eagerly waiting for that forever home she can finally settle down in. If you are interested in meeting the charming Lady Lucy, please contact us today at adopt@carolinapaws.com\n\nAdoption fee includes current vaccines, microchip and spay/neuter.  Please review our adoption requirements on our website https://www.carolinapaws.com/adopt/adoption-process/ If interested in one of our rescued cats/dogs complete the online application.

She is up-to-date on all of her shots, is microchipped and spayed.\n\nShe likes going for long walks and runs. She is the type of dog you can work out with, but she also loves jumping on a good couch and taking relaxing naps in the sun. \n\nWhy is Bella looking for a new home?\nBella has been with the same loving family that adopted her around nine years ago. That family has children now, and Bella is best suited for a family without little kids.\n\nPlease contact 323-205-5833 or Anewhomeforbella@gmail.com with any questions. Thank you!\n",

So his leg was amputated....but that doesn't bother him one bit! He is between 5-7 years old, we are not quite sure, but he does have cataracts that are visible. Bubba also tested positve for heartworm, so he is undergoing treatment with medication and will receive his heartworm injections on 3/9/2021. He does not do well with cats!!!!! But he does well around aother dogs his size or smaller, especially female dogs. We are still looking for a foster for him, as he will not be avaiable for adoption until the middle of March. He is a lovebug, a champ, and a true trooper. If you are interested in adoption, you may go ahead and fill out our form: https://form.jotform.com/201794736419161\n\nIf you could open your home and your heart to him and foster him while he is recovering from heartworms, please fill out our foster form: https://form.jotform.com/201795240513147 (**Heartworms are not contagious!!! They are contracted from infected mosquitos and cannot be passed from dog to dog**)",

            "description": "Update from his foster as of Dec 27, 2020:\n\nHe is a very sweet boy. Prefers women but is skittish around men as well as strangers. Is good with kids as long as he is supervised. He gets puppy excited and plays too rough for kids under 10. But if youre present he stays in check. He like to give kisses to my 3 year old and belly rubs.\n\nFinally house broken, kennel trained, no longer jumps on you and finally loads and unload in and out of the vehicle. Knows sit and come. Walks great on a leash if you have him on a pinch collar. If you stop while walking due to people or cars, he complies with the well with the command until distraction has passed.\n\nStill working on his chewing and digging. He does have separation anxiety which is the cause of most of his chewing. Also working on not darting out the front door with the stay command.\n\nLow toy or ball drive. reactive to small creatures aka squirrels in the yard lol. No food or treat aggression. Does not like getting in the bath but once hes in hes good to go.\n\nWill be great for any woman handler! He has great potential. Also shows signs of potential in scent work.\n\nThunder, and his brother Lightening, were pulled from an animal shelter in Carrolton, TX. Thunder is a little more reserved than his brother; he prefers to get to know you before opening up, but once he does, he's a goof ball. He's very food motivated and tries hard to please his human, no matter what the circumstance. Although he's not terribly concerned with tennis balls (low-to-moderate drive), and seems indifferent to cats, he can be a little dog reactive at times. He also very much likes to eat-he can be a little piggy if allowed, so you'll want to make sure that portion control is a thing with him to prevent him from getting a little too large. Otherwise, he's a very sweet boy. He does have just a bit of separation anxiety-which manifests into some semi-negative behaviors, such as unwanted chewing. Fortunately, he is easily corrected and his foster mom is working hard on reinforcing things for this young man. He's got lots of love to give-perhaps he's the right fit for you and you'll be his new human?\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Captain, please complete an application at this link https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/24689/generic . \n\nWe are an official 501C3 organziation that does not have a physical location.

She's a big cuddle bug and will need someone to fulfill her lap dog dreams. Luna is a medium energy dog who will want structured walks with her new adopter. She can join a home with kids over 12 who have experience with big goofy dogs. Luna is currently enjoying the good life in her foster home and working on her manners. She'd love to continue working on her training with you! \n\nShe is up to date on vaccines according to her age, she has received proper deworming, and comes with additional dewormer. She is microchipped, spayed, comes with 1-6 months of preventatives, one month free trial of pet insurance, all of our animals receive a health certificate (this states a licensed veterinary saw the pet and deemed it healthy for travel, it is not a promise of perfect health.) Our transports are USDA certified and tfransport is included in adoption fee of $375!\n\nShe is currently being fostered in Houston, Tx but will be traveling to the PNW as soon as she finds her perfect home!\n\nPlease inquire by submitting an application to brianna@threelittlepittiesrescue.org\n\nPlease fill out an application to be considered :https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/29415/generic",

            "description": "Gypsy is a beautiful, shy, incredibly loveable 6-7-year-old German Shepherd. She needs a kind gentle person who will appreciate how sensitive and loving she is.\n\nHer owner used her for breeding then surrendered her to a shelter in Arkansas a few months ago when he could no longer care for her. Gypsy was terrified at the shelter and very skittish. It was obvious that she was not socialized or given much attention or affection in her previous home. She seems more comfortable around dogs than people and has a lot of confidence building to do. When she's scared she tries to hide, but in a short time she has come so far! She adores her person and is a constant shadow. She's on the smaller side, only about 55 pounds. Her ears are so expressive! You can always tell when she's happy, scared or alert. Her big sad eyes will melt your heart and the first time she gives you kisses you're basically a puddle on the floor.\n\nGypsy is spayed, vaccinated in microchipped. We are currently treating her for heartworms and her adopter would need to bring her for her final treatments in February and keep her activity low until her treatment is completed. Her adoption fee is $250 and you can apply for her on our website at: https://rescueofhope.com/adoption-application/",

Petey is outgoing and loves attention. He rides well in the car and would love to go for walks with you. He\u2019s small and easy to carry around. We don\u2019t yet know if he\u2019s housetrained as he in still in boarding.  Petey is heartworm positive so he needs to be adopted on the Tulsa or OKC area so we can continue his life-saving treatment. OWR will cover the cost of his treatment. \nIf you have a warm lap, Petey might just be the dog for you. He is looking for his life long cuddle buddy!\nIf you\u2019d like to meet Petey, the first step is to complete and submit an adoption application on our okwestierescue.com website and we\u2019ll get the process started. \nPlease allow 1-2 weeks to finish processing your application, but please know our volunteers are working hard on it. \nPetey\u2019s adoption fee is $300 and is tax deductible. \n\nNOTE: You must complete and submit an application and be approved to adopt prior to being able to meet the dog.\u00a0\u00a0The requested tax-deductible adoption donation is $400 for our puppies, $300 for up to age 7 and $150 for ages 8 and older.\nWe do not ship our pets.\u00a0\u00a0Be prepared to travel to Tulsa, OK, or Oklahoma City, OK, or the location where this dog is fostered to pick up your dog in person if your application is approved.\u00a0\u00a0Once you are approved, you may adopt any of our dogs that is a good fit. \nWe are a non-profit organization that spends our adoption fees and donations on vaccinations, surgeries, various medical tests, medicines, food and supplies needed by our dogs. Our fees do not cover the overall expenses incurred by the care of our dogs, but they do help defray the costs involved.\u00a0\u00a0We thank you for your support. \nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always try to select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dog\u2019s needs and try to find the best match for both dog and human.\nWe leave a dog\u2019s profile online until either it has been adopted, has received several applications, or is not able to be adopted for some reason.",

The rest of the puppies from their litter had already been given away to people living nearby but we were able to get the owners to surrender these two brothers. They still needed a few weeks to grow and mature but now they are ready to find their perfect forever homes! We don't know a whole lot about their background but guess they will probably be on the medium to large side. Interested in adopting? Email adrienne@rescuemega.org or fill out an adoption application on our website- www.rmgdogs.org\n\nPLEASE NOTE: RMG requires another adult dog in the home for ALL PUPPY ADOPTIONS. This is a strict requirement - applications without another dog in the home will not be considered",

She is up-to-date on all of her shots, is microchipped and spayed.\n\nShe likes going for long walks and runs. She is the type of dog you can work out with, but she also loves jumping on a good couch and taking relaxing naps in the sun. \n\nWhy is Bella looking for a new home?\nBella has been with the same loving family that adopted her around nine years ago. That family has children now, and Bella is best suited for a family without little kids.\n\nPlease contact 323-205-5833 or Anewhomeforbella@gmail.com with any questions. Thank you!\n",

So his leg was amputated....but that doesn't bother him one bit! He is between 5-7 years old, we are not quite sure, but he does have cataracts that are visible. Bubba also tested positve for heartworm, so he is undergoing treatment with medication and will receive his heartworm injections on 3/9/2021. He does not do well with cats!!!!! But he does well around aother dogs his size or smaller, especially female dogs. We are still looking for a foster for him, as he will not be avaiable for adoption until the middle of March. He is a lovebug, a champ, and a true trooper. If you are interested in adoption, you may go ahead and fill out our form: https://form.jotform.com/201794736419161\n\nIf you could open your home and your heart to him and foster him while he is recovering from heartworms, please fill out our foster form: https://form.jotform.com/201795240513147 (**Heartworms are not contagious!!! They are contracted from infected mosquitos and cannot be passed from dog to dog**)",

            "description": "Update from his foster as of Dec 27, 2020:\n\nHe is a very sweet boy. Prefers women but is skittish around men as well as strangers. Is good with kids as long as he is supervised. He gets puppy excited and plays too rough for kids under 10. But if youre present he stays in check. He like to give kisses to my 3 year old and belly rubs.\n\nFinally house broken, kennel trained, no longer jumps on you and finally loads and unload in and out of the vehicle. Knows sit and come. Walks great on a leash if you have him on a pinch collar. If you stop while walking due to people or cars, he complies with the well with the command until distraction has passed.\n\nStill working on his chewing and digging. He does have separation anxiety which is the cause of most of his chewing. Also working on not darting out the front door with the stay command.\n\nLow toy or ball drive. reactive to small creatures aka squirrels in the yard lol. No food or treat aggression. Does not like getting in the bath but once hes in hes good to go.\n\nWill be great for any woman handler! He has great potential. Also shows signs of potential in scent work.\n\nThunder, and his brother Lightening, were pulled from an animal shelter in Carrolton, TX. Thunder is a little more reserved than his brother; he prefers to get to know you before opening up, but once he does, he's a goof ball. He's very food motivated and tries hard to please his human, no matter what the circumstance. Although he's not terribly concerned with tennis balls (low-to-moderate drive), and seems indifferent to cats, he can be a little dog reactive at times. He also very much likes to eat-he can be a little piggy if allowed, so you'll want to make sure that portion control is a thing with him to prevent him from getting a little too large. Otherwise, he's a very sweet boy. He does have just a bit of separation anxiety-which manifests into some semi-negative behaviors, such as unwanted chewing. Fortunately, he is easily corrected and his foster mom is working hard on reinforcing things for this young man. He's got lots of love to give-perhaps he's the right fit for you and you'll be his new human?\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Captain, please complete an application at this link https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/24689/generic . \n\nWe are an official 501C3 organziation that does not have a physical location.

She's a big cuddle bug and will need someone to fulfill her lap dog dreams. Luna is a medium energy dog who will want structured walks with her new adopter. She can join a home with kids over 12 who have experience with big goofy dogs. Luna is currently enjoying the good life in her foster home and working on her manners. She'd love to continue working on her training with you! \n\nShe is up to date on vaccines according to her age, she has received proper deworming, and comes with additional dewormer. She is microchipped, spayed, comes with 1-6 months of preventatives, one month free trial of pet insurance, all of our animals receive a health certificate (this states a licensed veterinary saw the pet and deemed it healthy for travel, it is not a promise of perfect health.) Our transports are USDA certified and tfransport is included in adoption fee of $375!\n\nShe is currently being fostered in Houston, Tx but will be traveling to the PNW as soon as she finds her perfect home!\n\nPlease inquire by submitting an application to brianna@threelittlepittiesrescue.org\n\nPlease fill out an application to be considered :https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/29415/generic",

            "description": "Gypsy is a beautiful, shy, incredibly loveable 6-7-year-old German Shepherd. She needs a kind gentle person who will appreciate how sensitive and loving she is.\n\nHer owner used her for breeding then surrendered her to a shelter in Arkansas a few months ago when he could no longer care for her. Gypsy was terrified at the shelter and very skittish. It was obvious that she was not socialized or given much attention or affection in her previous home. She seems more comfortable around dogs than people and has a lot of confidence building to do. When she's scared she tries to hide, but in a short time she has come so far! She adores her person and is a constant shadow. She's on the smaller side, only about 55 pounds. Her ears are so expressive! You can always tell when she's happy, scared or alert. Her big sad eyes will melt your heart and the first time she gives you kisses you're basically a puddle on the floor.\n\nGypsy is spayed, vaccinated in microchipped. We are currently treating her for heartworms and her adopter would need to bring her for her final treatments in February and keep her activity low until her treatment is completed. Her adoption fee is $250 and you can apply for her on our website at: https://rescueofhope.com/adoption-application/",

Petey is outgoing and loves attention. He rides well in the car and would love to go for walks with you. He\u2019s small and easy to carry around. We don\u2019t yet know if he\u2019s housetrained as he in still in boarding.  Petey is heartworm positive so he needs to be adopted on the Tulsa or OKC area so we can continue his life-saving treatment. OWR will cover the cost of his treatment. \nIf you have a warm lap, Petey might just be the dog for you. He is looking for his life long cuddle buddy!\nIf you\u2019d like to meet Petey, the first step is to complete and submit an adoption application on our okwestierescue.com website and we\u2019ll get the process started. \nPlease allow 1-2 weeks to finish processing your application, but please know our volunteers are working hard on it. \nPetey\u2019s adoption fee is $300 and is tax deductible. \n\nNOTE: You must complete and submit an application and be approved to adopt prior to being able to meet the dog.\u00a0\u00a0The requested tax-deductible adoption donation is $400 for our puppies, $300 for up to age 7 and $150 for ages 8 and older.\nWe do not ship our pets.\u00a0\u00a0Be prepared to travel to Tulsa, OK, or Oklahoma City, OK, or the location where this dog is fostered to pick up your dog in person if your application is approved.\u00a0\u00a0Once you are approved, you may adopt any of our dogs that is a good fit. \nWe are a non-profit organization that spends our adoption fees and donations on vaccinations, surgeries, various medical tests, medicines, food and supplies needed by our dogs. Our fees do not cover the overall expenses incurred by the care of our dogs, but they do help defray the costs involved.\u00a0\u00a0We thank you for your support. \nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always try to select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dog\u2019s needs and try to find the best match for both dog and human.\nWe leave a dog\u2019s profile online until either it has been adopted, has received several applications, or is not able to be adopted for some reason.",

The rest of the puppies from their litter had already been given away to people living nearby but we were able to get the owners to surrender these two brothers. They still needed a few weeks to grow and mature but now they are ready to find their perfect forever homes! We don't know a whole lot about their background but guess they will probably be on the medium to large side. Interested in adopting? Email adrienne@rescuemega.org or fill out an adoption application on our website- www.rmgdogs.org\n\nPLEASE NOTE: RMG requires another adult dog in the home for ALL PUPPY ADOPTIONS. This is a strict requirement - applications without another dog in the home will not be considered",

            "description": "Hello handsome! Poncho is a 2 year old neutered male hound/boxer mix who weighs 55 lbs. Poncho was rescued from a high kill shelter after being found as a stray. We could not believe that no one came forward to claim this gorgeous guy as their own, but we were happy to give him the second chance he was in desperate need of. Poncho is a total showstopper - his sleek coat, floppy ears, and forehead wrinkles make us SWOON! He is a happy-go-lucky pup who has a zest for life - he is sure to bring a whole lot of fun and laughter to his future home! Poncho is great with other dogs and loves to pal around with his canine friends. Unfortunately, he needs a home without cats. Poncho loves putting his hound nose to work outside, exploring all the interesting smells the great outdoors has to offer. He needs to learn some leash walking skills and manners, but he seems smart and eager to please. We cannot wait for Poncho to find an amazing family that will love and commit to him forever! Could that be yours?\n\nInterested in adopting?

We are thrilled that so many people want to adopt right now, but we are not equipped to handle the large number of calls, applications, and email inquiries we are receiving. We are no longer answering phone calls and are doing all communications with adopters via email. If you have a dog you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application before sending us emails. When your application has been processed, you will receive an email from us with further instructions on how to adopt. You do not need a new application for every dog that you are interested in adopting. \n\nAt MAMCO we understand that in order to continue rescuing moms and babies, we must stretch our finances as far as we are able. For this reason we use variable adoption pricing. By assigning higher adoption fees to high demand moms and puppies, we are able to rescue more families in need.The money raised through these adoptions acts as a benefactor to moms and puppies in our care who require expensive veterinary treatments, have behavioral issues, or need more time to find a home. We often reduce the adoption fees on these harder-to-place moms and puppies to help them find forever families. Adoption fees vary, but all include spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccinations and deworming, rabies vaccine at the time of spay or neuter, and 30 days of pet insurance. We also cover hernia repair and cherry eye repair at the time of spay or neuter. Applications can be filled out at mamcorescue.org.",

We are thrilled that so many people want to adopt right now, but we are not equipped to handle the large number of calls, applications, and email inquiries we are receiving. We are no longer answering phone calls and are doing all communications with adopters via email. If you have a dog you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application before sending us emails. When your application has been processed, you will receive an email from us with further instructions on how to adopt. You do not need a new application for every dog that you are interested in adopting. \n\nAt MAMCO we understand that in order to continue rescuing moms and babies, we must stretch our finances as far as we are able. For this reason we use variable adoption pricing. By assigning higher adoption fees to high demand moms and puppies, we are able to rescue more families in need.The money raised through these adoptions acts as a benefactor to moms and puppies in our care who require expensive veterinary treatments, have behavioral issues, or need more time to find a home. We often reduce the adoption fees on these harder-to-place moms and puppies to help them find forever families. Adoption fees vary, but all include spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccinations and deworming, rabies vaccine at the time of spay or neuter, and 30 days of pet insurance. We also cover hernia repair and cherry eye repair at the time of spay or neuter. Applications can be filled out at mamcorescue.org.",

We are thrilled that so many people want to adopt right now, but we are not equipped to handle the large number of calls, applications, and email inquiries we are receiving. We are no longer answering phone calls and are doing all communications with adopters via email. If you have a dog you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application before sending us emails. When your application has been processed, you will receive an email from us with further instructions on how to adopt. You do not need a new application for every dog that you are interested in adopting. \n\nAt MAMCO we understand that in order to continue rescuing moms and babies, we must stretch our finances as far as we are able. For this reason we use variable adoption pricing. By assigning higher adoption fees to high demand moms and puppies, we are able to rescue more families in need.The money raised through these adoptions acts as a benefactor to moms and puppies in our care who require expensive veterinary treatments, have behavioral issues, or need more time to find a home. We often reduce the adoption fees on these harder-to-place moms and puppies to help them find forever families. Adoption fees vary, but all include spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccinations and deworming, rabies vaccine at the time of spay or neuter, and 30 days of pet insurance. We also cover hernia repair and cherry eye repair at the time of spay or neuter. Applications can be filled out at mamcorescue.org.",

            "description": "Mossimo is a spunky pittie mix who\u2019s estimated to be about 4 years old and was found as a stray. The suburban shelter that found him determined soon after that he is heart worm positive. On top of that, he has a series of other medical issues including a scar on his cornea, Lyme disease, and crusty patches of skin from having fleas prior to arriving at the shelter. \n\nDespite everything going on with him, he is still a very happy go lucky boy and loves affection. He will crawl up in your lap and try to get as close to you as possible, and when you stop petting him, he will lick your hand to let you know that you weren\u2019t allowed to stop yet. While he loves all of the attention, he\u2019s also surprisingly good at knowing when to just lay down and enjoy the company.\n\nNo matter what\u2019s happening, he always has a smile on his face and gives the best hugs and kisses! He absolutely loves all dogs and people! He was also cat-tested initially at the shelter and was curious but not threatening. He hasn\u2019t been tested with children yet but based on how much he loves EVERYONE he meets, we think he\u2019d be fine with older children, but are happy to test him if you\u2019re interested. \n\nMossimo will make a great road trip companion! He sits happily in the back seat like a good boy and may occasionally ask for pets, but he\u2019s pretty polite about it. He loves climbing the snow piles outside, so he would also make a good hiking buddy! When he\u2019s not going places, he enjoys chomping on some bones and being the best meatball he can be. \n\nHis foster mom says he\u2019s the easiest dog! He already knows sit, come, settle, and stay commands! He is fully potty trained and attaches to his humans quickly. He is still working on his crate training but is improving. He\u2019s also learning that as much as he wants to be close to his people, jumping on them is a no-no, which is why we suggest only older kids for him until he learns that 60lbs of jumping meathead is not always a good thing no matter how cute you are!\n\nWe have multiple applications for Mossimo. Apps are now closed.",

He is a beefy dude but surprisingly gentle when walking on a leash. He's very curious and wants to stop and sniff all the things. He will happily turn his body around and ask for butt scratches. He's a nice dude looking for a comfy place to sleep and some cool people to hang out with........as long as they are not cats! \n\n\n\tApproved Applicants may make the adoption fee payment by clicking donate above.

He noticed I was crying and began to give me kisses to show me love and make me feel better. He is so enthusiastic with his love and he has so much energy. \n\nHe is definitely going to need someone who understands his strength and is willing to be patient as he learns his manners. Even with his obvious past, he loves all dogs. My chihuahua mixed was so scared and barked at him for 5 minutes straight, yet Tarzan ran by him and ignored him to go play with my other dog. When we went to Petco, a small dog growled at him and he just wanted to lick it while wagging his tail. \n\nCats are an absolute no. I believe that in his previous life, he was given positive reinforcement to attack cats. He gets hyperfocused on cats that even after attempts of being redirected with food, treats, and toys, he will have to be physically restrained. After releasing my hug around his chest, he still wanted to push against the fence to find the cat. \n\nHe would be wonderful in a home that understands and can physically handle his strength. He is currently underweight due to his previous life and is already so strong (I do crossfit and he is definitely a workout). When he relaxes at home, he loves to cuddle and he is just the sweetest. He may be taught to be ok around little children, but due to his size and energy, he may knock down little ones unintentionally. \n\n\n\tApproved Applicants may make the adoption fee payment by clicking donate above.

            "description": "Lilo is the perfect puppy. She is house broken except for a few accidents in the house. She loves other dogs but a furry sibling is not a must, but if you don't have one, please make sure to socialize her with other dogs since she really loves playing. Lilo is a smart little girl who learned sit in one day and down in two (although still needs a treat for her to lay down). LOVES people and loves to cuddle and to make sure she is next to her humans, so a person who allows her on the furnitures is a must! She does not know how strong she is so little children might not be the best fit (she is an aggressive kisser). She wants to make sure you know how much she loves you.\n\nWe think she might have happy dog syndrome - she gets so excited that she wiggles her body! And she's excited about 90% of the time. Lilo's adoption fee is $300. If you'd like to meet her, reach out to your rescue coordinator or apply at rescuedohio.org to become an approved adopter!",

            "description": "Coco T. is a perky and affectionate 12-year-old female German Shepherd Dog (GSD) who was surrendered to Thulani by the owner. Her previous owner described her as being very friendly to dogs, adults and children.\n\nCoco is delicately affectionate and is not a resource hoarder- she will leave food behind if she's had enough and doesnt seem interested in toys.\n\nCoco has amazing stamina and is in great health. This is a girl who will trot with you as far as you want to go, as many times as you want to go. She would especially thrive in a home where she can be walked/jogged a few times a day.\n\nCoco spent her time outside in a kennel with a companion dog but is housebroken. The foster reports that she has had no accidents indoors where she prefers to be with her humans. She is not a barker or a runner- she likes to lie near the front door but will back away to wait for it to open and makes no effort to leave until the leashes come out. She also likes to hang out in her crate when not going out.\n\nIt is obvious that Coco was loved, trained and taken care of by her previous owner and she is looking forward to having a new owner to love and take walks with. \n\nThulani Senior German Shepherd Rescue has taken over care for Coco. She is a beautiful girl who will now receive the medical care she needs. Although she has a stiff gait, she is quite mobile and very much loves human interaction. TSGSR will look for a new family with time to love to this wonderful dog. \n\nCoco T. Summary:\n- Female, 12 yrs old, weighs 63 lbs, current on shots\n- Good with Adults, dogs, and travels well in the car\n- Good with children\n- TBD with cats \n \n\nCoco passed a set of evaluation tests before being accepted into the TSGSR. The tests are not intended to assess how smart the dog is but are important for TSGSR to determine if the dog is expected to be safe in a family home. The tested behaviors check to see if the dog will guard or protect food or toys from people, will tolerate handling all over its body (including ears, nose, lips to check teeth, lifting paws, belly, back, and gently pulling the tail) and the ability to get along with other well behaved dogs. Coco remained calm during all of these tests and showed no aggressive tendencies. As a result, she was accepted into the TSGSR program. \n\nPlease join us in welcoming Coco to TSGSR! Check back often. We will be updating her bio as we learn more about her!\n\nWhat's Next for Coco T.:\nThulani Senior German Shepherd Rescue (TSGSR) will continue to see that Coco is well cared for and receives all medical care needed for her well being while in our care. In addition, TSGSR is beginning a search for an adoptive home that will care for her for the rest of her life. Coco will come to her new home with a supply of food, a cushy pad if wanted, and other goodies such as toys. \n\nCocos medical expenses will be covered for the rest of her life by Thulani Senior German Shepherd Rescue (TSGSR)!\n\nIf you want to learn more about Coco, or are interested in possibly providing an adoptive or foster home, please send us a message by clicking on the \"Ask About Me\" button. We will often get feedback or \"updates\" from a dog's foster home and as any updates become available they will be included here.\n\nIf you are reading about her on Petfinder.com sometimes an available YouTube video is not listed. If this occurs you can still view the video by pasting its URL into a new browser window or tab.\nAvailable Video URL(s): https://youtu.be/rswhDNZMcGU\n\nSaving one dog wont change the world. It will change the world for that one dog.",

One look at her and you know she's just been though hell. She has scars all over, her hair loss is legit but one look in her sky blue eyes and you see the stunning girl she truly is. She is so sassy and such a fantastic personality she is impossible not to love once you meet her. She also gives the best facial expressions, she keeps a smile on my face all day. Mia was found by a young girl after having been dumped on the TX/Mexico border. The girl thought that proper animal ownership was just keeping them outside with food and water, she said she didn't even know they needed vaccines . She ended up pregnant suffering from horrible flea allergies, she's Heartworm positive, has significant hair loss and likely cancerous lumps and bumps. Some of her hair is slowly growing back but she's very much a work in progress. She will be spayed, have her lumps and bumps removed and likely a skin biopsy. We will assess her teeth at that time. Unfortunately after we got her to safety she became ill with a REALLY dangerous strain of URI and ended up giving it to her puppies who one by one all passed away. This was completely devastating, however Mia surviving was the silver lining of the situation. We transported her up to Nebraska and after a few weeks with our president we feel ok looking for another foster for her. Mia really deserves a foster where she gets more individual attention while she continues to recover. She is a SWEET girl but she won't put up with anyone's nonsense, so while she's extremely dog friendly, she will tell a dog what's up when she feels it's needed. She a wonderful cuddle bug, enjoys wearing her doggie clothes and soaks up every bit of attention possible. She loves to nap in her kennel and is a perfect Netflix marathon companion! She's not a big barker and truly doesn't have any horrible habits that we have found. \n\nIf you think that you could be the special foster home for miss Mia please contact us! \n\nTo Contact Us\n\nMessage us through our website http://www.highplainspaw.org\n\nMessage the Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/HighPlainsPAW\n\nFill out our Foster Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/foster-application\n\nEmail us at highplainspaw@gmail.com\n\nCall our VOICEMAIL at (402)957-1578\n\nWE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY ALL OUR DOGS ARE LOCATED IN FOSTER HOMES.

She is shy and wary of new people at first, but with some time and treats, she will soon become your best friend.\n\nRemmy was an owner surrender, so we know a few things about her, such as: she is house broken, knows sit, has lived with another dog as well as a cat, and does not seem to be too fond of the mailman. She can also be a bit vocal when she is excited and when she sees strangers. \n\nWe think she would do best with older children, and in a home without rabbits and/ or chickens. \n\nWhen brought into the office for some quiet time, Remmy did very well and enjoyed laying at our feet and chewing on her chew toy. \n\nShe also walks great on leash! \n\nRemmy is available for adoption at the Fort Bragg Shelter. Please email Adriana at vegaa@mendocinocounty.org or call 707-961-2491 for more information.\n\nAn adoption application must be filled out before scheduling an appointment.

            "description": "Ready for the baste life!\n\nHey guys! My name is Mama Stuffin' and I am a 1 year old, female Terrier mix. I am a lap-sized, cuddly turkey at about 21 lbs. Like my name suggests, I am a mama! I was rescued by TAP from TJ, around Thanksgiving time, plump with puppies in my belly. I gave birth in a warm-as-oven home and my babies are all weaned and finding furever homes of their own! This mama is ready for her own feast and life. I am all bathroom and leash trained, and will be spayed soon!\n\nWhen I was rescued, I left behind a bad situation of abuse. It left a bitter taste in my mouth, but I am ready to move along and get that sugary life. I am wary of people and get scared by quick movements by my foster family is helping me recover. They are also helping me realize that I don't need to resource guard as well, and will always have food in my life(and treats in my crate!) I am coming around and lovin' the attention being showered on me! I am learning to play and training is turning out to be good for me. Car rides make me sick, but medication helps. I am good with my foster siblings, a yorkie and a pittie mix, but can be selective specially if other dogs' get into arguments. I am not fond of horse-play, loud sounds and it makes me nervous when people or dogs fight. I just want the world to love! I am fiercely loyal and want to protect the fam. I would need a family who can show some patience to teach me that the world indeed is better than even a feasty spread!\n\nI would love to be a part of a family who can love me unconditionally and patiently train me. I am eager to learn that I dont have to guarded or scared anymore! I will prefer to be a single dog and belong to an all-adults family. So let's bring on the drum(sticks) roll and meet up! My adoption fee is $350 and that includes spaying/neutering, shots, and microchip. If you want to take me home, please fill out the form on the website here: https://theanimalpad.org/adoption-application/",

            "description": "Hes a Matzo, Matzo man!\n\nHi there! My name is Matzo and Im bound to warm you up faster than a homecooked bowl of matzo soup! Im spunky, sweet, and a super snuggler. Im a 9-month-old, 46-pound, lab mix. Im already neutered and in pawfect health. I was recently rescued from the streets of Tijuana right around the holidays during Hanukkah to be exact. Life with my foster has been a whole latke fun, but what I really want is a furever home!\n\nIm an active pooch who loves to play. Im the king of fetch, going on walks, and just running around outside. I adore my hoomans and get along with everyone I meet. I like kids too, but since I tend to jump, Id probably do best with the older ones. Even though I love people, I need to be socialized with other dogs. My ruff past has made me a bit defensive, so I need to learn that other pups can be my friend. I havent met any cats, so Im not sure what I think about them.\n\nEven though Im an energetic guy, Im equally mellow at home. I never destroy things in the house when you leave, but when youre home Ill gladly nap by your side. Once youre done working, Im an all-star snuggler and will take cuddle and pets at any chance I get!\n\nIm one smart cookie, so my training is going very well. Im already completely crate trained, house trained, and Im getting better on the leash with my gentle leader. I never get separation anxiety either. Like I said, I still need some work in the socialization department, but with some TLC & patience, Im sure Ill get there!\n\nIf youre looking for a playful pup who will go on all of lifes adventures with you, Im your guy! After the fun is done, Ill gladly be your cuddle buddy too. I think Id do best in a home without young children or other dogs as Im still learning the ropes. I hope we can continue my training together! I would love a yard, but as long as I get my exercise, Im a happy boy. So what do you say? Adopt this Mazto man today! My adoption fee is $450 and that includes spaying/neutering, shots, and microchip. If you want to take me home, please fill out the form on the website here: https://theanimalpad.org/adoption-application/",

I was rescued from TJ with a broken leg(and a heart), but thanks to the TLC at my foster home, I have mended completely! I am fully bathroom and leash trained and a total good boy. I can point to the door when I need to go! No poop emoji to be found at home with me. I will be neutered soon.\n\nI am a young pup, and boy do I define that! I am energetic, playful and love to chew! I can get a bit naughty, but re-direct me to toys and I can be good. I am very friendly and get along great with all people and dogs, big or small. I do like kiddos but need to take care of my nipping first. Like the heart emoji, I am full of love and affection. I do like cuddling, but I am amore of an outside-yard player. No mountain is too high for me to scale, snow or shine! I really enjoy socialization at dog parks, long walks and play dates through the week.\n\nI am a growing boy and would love a family who can accommodate a biggie older me. I love to be outdoorsy and energetic and will make a great companion for those long hikes. You can have a happy, energetic, loving cuddly emoji all in one with me! If you wanna take me home, give me a wave! My adoption fee is $500 and that includes spaying/neutering, shots, and microchip.

            "description": "Sarge is a year and half old male Great Dane. He is about 33 inches at the shoulder and came to MAGDRL a bit under his ideal weight. He lived with another male Great Dane and a 4 month old female pit bull pup. He and the other unaltered male were having disagreements from time to time so it would be best that he is placed with a laid-back female which we would routinely recommend anyway. He has not had any direct interaction with cats so he would be an unknown with them. He has lived with children between the ages of 9 and 18 and maybe a few days with a newborn. He has met women, men, and children with no issues. He did need some work on his manners as he tends to jump up when he gets excited, but his foster home is doing great work with him concerning this. He has had run of the house in the past, but he is being create trained at the present and he is taking to it well.\n\nSarge walks pretty well on the leash, but he does have some what of a prey drive so the foster is working on this as well. He is very food motivated which helps to redirect his focus. He is very active and loves to play and learn new things. Sarge is getting along well with his foster brother who is a senior and not quite as playful as he is. He is quite athletic and has jumped over fences in the past to go exploring so he will need a minimum of a 5 ft fence to be places.\n\nSarge has been given more structure that he had before he came to us and he is doing quite well with it so we would love for him to have an experienced leader to be able to give him the structure that he needs to be the best that he can be. Again, he is extremely food motivated so that will be very helpful to correct this behavior. Sarge is a super nice boy with a ton of potential to be a shining start in the lives of the perfect family.\n\nSarge came to MAGDRL in December 2020 (2)\n<p><br /><br />For more info on this dog and our adoption policies, visit <a href=\"http://www.padanerescue.com\">PA MAGDRL at http://www.padanerescue.com</a>.

I may be an older gal, but I\u2019ve got a lot of love left to give! Are you interested?\n\nMy owner was recently placed in assisted living, so now I need a new family. I\u2019m a friendly, affectionate girl, and I love to meet new people and follow my humans around. I especially enjoy napping at my foster mom\u2019s feet as she works! I consider myself a bit of a foodie and will bark with joy when it looks like I\u2019m going to get a treat or a meal. \n\nI do have a couple of minor problems that come along with my senior status. My teeth aren\u2019t as strong as they used to be, so the rescue has me scheduled for dental surgery soon. I might need soft food afterward. I also need frequent potty breaks to prevent accidents in the house. I\u2019m great about keeping my crate clean though, and I don\u2019t mind hanging out in it if you need to leave me for a while.\n\nYou\u2019ll love my beautiful long coat and my sweet disposition! If you\u2019re looking for a low-energy, easygoing girl like me, I\u2019d love to become your new shadow! \n\nMaggie\u2019s adoption fee is $250. If you are interested in adopting Maggie, please DO NOT SEND A MESSAGE TO OUR RESCUE GROUP.  We are too busy placing dogs in great homes to answer messages and inquiries through the listing site. \n\nPLEASE GO TO THE LINK BELOW TO COMPLETE AN ADOPTION APPLICATION.\n \nwww.chihuahua-rescue.com/adoption-application\n \nCRT requires an approved adoption application and a home visit for all adoption applicants.  CRT transports to OH, KY, IL, MI, MN, WI. \n\n",

Foster mommy thinks I am pretty perfect but I am still learning some manners, I just get so excited about things but I work hard to please my humans, I don't want to disappoint them. I LOVE all my toys, walks, treats, belly rubs, car rides, naps in the sun and most of all being close to my humans. I haven't destroyed anything I am not supposed to and no accidents in the house. I get along great with my foster brother (dog) and love playing with him but I haven't been around kids at all with my foster mommy. Could you be my forever home?

Legend is a 1-year-old lab mix currently weighing about 65 lbs but in need of gaining some weight. It would appear Legend may have not always know the kindness the world has to offer, but that doesn't stop him from seeing the best in people and taking every opportunity he can to be adored. He is a sweet boy who likes to be close to you. Legend has been settling in fine and the farm and gets along with his doggy friends, but he really is looking for that special person he gets to call his very own. He sleeps well in a crate overnight and knows to go potty outside. He may not know a lot in the ways of fancy tricks, but he promises to be a quick study and hang on to your every word. So get in your adoption request so you can come on down to the farm and meet this sweet boy!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website.

Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only.

Well, that's sort of what our Jitterbug resembles! She's full-grown at just 30 lbs and about 2 years old. Jitterbug came into the farm and immediately caught everyone's attention with her outgoing personality in an adorably petite package. She is an energetic girl who loves wrestling with the big dogs!

Please read his bio below and contact his dad, Hasan, directly at hasansimba@yahoo.com or 630.730.4492 if you'd like to get more information about Rafiki and possibly adopt this beautiful boy! \n\nRafiki is an amazing dog!  He is sweet, energetic, and has a big personality!  He loves to take walks and play fetch, but his favorite thing to do is cuddle up with his family.  He is a healthy, confident & friendly dog. We just had a baby and he is great around the baby.  He is not good with small dogs and is sometimes nervous when meeting new people so he's looking for a home with no small animals and a person/family that recognizes he needs slow introductions with humans.  He is housebroken, crate trained, neutered, up to date on his shots, and microchipped.",

She's a bully with dogs of all sizes (she lives with 2 in her foster home but it started as a challenge). Maxine will chase cats if they run but is fine if they don't run from her. Maxine was very frightened when she first came to her foster home. She would growl and snap if startled. She was found as a stray in a rural county. Over a few months she has relaxed and loves to snuggle behind her foster mom's knees on the couch. A loving little girl at 12 pounds, Maxine needs a patient and quiet home. JRT/chihuahua mix\n\nI am in a foster home so if you are interested in adopting me, please fill out an online adoption application at https://colonycats.org/adoption_app.html to expedite the process.

The vets guessed Petey is 2 years old, but he appears to be around 1 years old. He is very energetic and acts like a big puppy. He is a sweet dog. Petey likes kids. Petey loves to play with other dogs.  Because of his energy level the best home for him will be with a young dog with the same energy or a home with active people. Petey weighs 65lbs.\nPetey is potty trained but sometimes has an accident. Petty is crate trained. \n\n\n****PLEASE READ******** \nDogs in our program are fostered in a private home, we ask that you fill out an application prior to requesting to set up a meeting or you can meet them at an upcoming adoption clinic. \n\nVisit our website or FB page for dates/times. If they are still listed on Petfinder, they are still available. Due to the volume of emails we receive daily, We can not respond to \"Is he/she still available\" or \"how can I meet them\".  \n\nApplications can be filled out here  http://rottieempirerescue.com/adopt-2/dog-adoption-application/\n",

            "description": "Izzy is a 1 year old Anatolian Shepherd mix. She weighs 66 pounds. Unfortunately, her owners were no longer able to keep her and surrendered her to the shelter. This beautiful girl is looking for an active home where she will get plenty of exercise and attention. She is super playful and loves running around and playing with her toys. She is super outgoing with people and loves everyone she meets but she is still working on her manners. Because of her activity level, she would do best in a home without small children. She had previously lived with kids. She is dog friendly, in fact the shelter used her to test other dogs to see how they were with dogs.  Izzy walks well on a leash.  Izzy loves to go for car rides and is crate trained.  She absolutely loves the snow and the cold doesn't seem to phase her.  \n\nIf you are interested in this dog please fill out an online application on our website:                          https://.barkdogfarm.rescuegroups.org/forms/ \n\nBefore applying be sure you have thoroughly researched Anatolians.  They are a live stock guardian dog that can become overly protective and cannot be off leash much like great pyrs. They are not a breed for inexperienced owners.  You WILL NOT train them to boundaries.  \nPlease be sure all family members are in agreement to adopting and your family is ready to bring dog home now. \nApplicants must be at least 21 years old. \nA volunteer will be in touch to discuss your application and the dog to determine if it is a good match. Your vet and two references will be called.  A virtual home visit done. Once approved a meet and greet at the farm will take place.  If all are in agreement and the animal has received its NH health certificate an adoption contract will be signed and adoption fee paid.  \nAdoption fees for dogs are $450. for adults over 12 months, $500 for puppies 12 months and younger.  Fees for seniors, special needs or harder to place dogs will be determined by our Board of Directors.\n All dogs will be altered when adoption is finalized, up to date on age appropriate core vaccines, negative for parasites, heart worm and lyme tested if 6 months or older, microchipped and have a current health certificate.  \nProof of a basic obedience course completed is part of our adoption contract within six months. \nOur descriptions are based on shelter evaluations, input from foster homes and interactions with our volunteers therefore are in no way a guarantee of temperment. \n\n! Please know we practice Covid-19 guidelines for mask wearing and social distancing.  Only approved applicants are allowed to meet our dogs outdoors at this time.

Adoptions are conducted on a best-match basis. If we feel you are a great match for an animal you have applied for, we will reach out to you regarding the next steps to adoption.\n\n-- There are no animals at the shelter and the shelter itself is closed. --\n\n If you're interested in a pet:\nVisit our website and fill out an application. We will send a response email with what to expect and be in touch if we will be moving forward in the process with you. Please be patient and understand response times are currently a bit lengthy. We cannot expedite the process if you call and email to follow up.\n\n* Please note that our adoptable pets are all in foster right now, so if we move forward with scheduling a meet-and-greet appointment (dogs only), the foster will bring the pet to us for you to meet. Due to this, you will be limited to meeting one pet during your appointment. Thank you for your understanding!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Check out adoptable dogs and cats on our website: spcasc.org\n\n Complete the Adoption Profile\nOnce you've found a well-matched furry friend, please complete our Adoption Profile form on our website. You must be at least 21 years old to adopt.\n\n Housing\nIf you rent, please provide a copy of your lease or a letter from your landlord that states you can have a pet(s). Landlord letters can be presented in person or by email and must be accompanied by a copy or photo of the homeowner's ID. If you own, we will verify ownership through our database, you do not need to bring any documentation.\n\nIt's important that any current canine companions enjoy your new friend as much as you do. We facilitate dog-to-dog introductions outside our main shelter, on leash. For your own dog's safety, we ask that you do not bring him or her into the shelter. If we move forward with your application and you apply for a dog and already have one, you will be asked to bring your current dog to meet your new potential dog to do a meet-and-greet, then take the dog home for a 7-day \"trial.\"\n\nAge: ~2yr / Weight: ~60lbs\n\nI'm TROOPER!\n\nI was transferred from another shelter and am still settling in here, but here's what the SCSPCA knows about me so far:\n\n I am very friendly with everyone I've met so far\n\n I'm a very boisterous, happy, active boy\n\n People are great!\n\n I've been doing great with dog pals here at the shelter\n\n I love to entertain myself when no one's watching, so I would love lots of tough toys I can chew on!\n\n Cats and small dogs are unknown to me\n\nIf you're interested in adopting me, fill out an application on the website!",

            "description": "Bonnie is a  Border Collie mix that was rescued this Spring from a hoarding situation. She has healed and learned so much since being in care! She is now crate trained, and loves going on walks with her foster mom and confident big brother canine. She is a shy girl and understandably so, considering the situation she grew up in. She continues work with her foster mom daily and was recently seen by our dog trainer, as we want to continue to build her confidence while ensuring her safety. She is fearful in new situations so patience and leadership by her human is needed. She loves playing with her canine foster family and also is fine with the kitties in the home. She will need a home with a secure fence and another social dog to help guide her. She would do best with only older children in the home, who will be patient and give her time to get to know them. We are committed to her transition and want her to find a wonderful forever family . Would you like to foster to adopt? We would like to help guide her transition to a new home with some help from her foster mom and our trainer.\n\n* Another confident dog in the home\n* No children under 15\n* A house with a secure yard. (Due to her shy nature she will not be available for adoption into an apartment.)\n* Bonnie would do best in a calm smaller household.\n",

He had been time stamped due to cage stress and reactivity in the shelter environment. We decided to take a chance on Chase and bring him into rescue.  It was immediately evident that Chase had been abused. He was terrified of a slip leash, head shy, fearful of loud noises, and generally speaking, a complete bag of canine nerves. It is believed that his tail was intentionally broken as well.\n\nChase has made tremendous progress with the help of a professional trainer and dedicated fosters. He is extremely intelligent and now knows multiple commands. Being highly food motivated as well as a super smart pup has helped make training go well for Chase. \n\nChase is engaging, handsome and as mentioned, SO smart! He would thrive in an environment where someone is most often home. Chase has excellent house manners and expects to be crated at bedtime...this helps with the structure that Chase needs. Chase would do best in a home without children. Canine siblings are fine, but he would also be happy as an only pup as well. Chase gravitates to men, but mainly just needs a loving, but firm and dog savvy family that is active and will include him on hikes and walks as part of his daily routine. Chase has been through a great deal in his life; he has proven that with love and time, any obstacle is surmountable. Chase has made such amazing progress in the few months he has been with us and now needs a committed and loving family to bring him full circle. \n\nIf you think you could be that person to give Chase the love he deserves, please contact Summer at summer.doubledogrescue@gmail.com.",

            "description": "Cassie is a sweet, fun spitfire in the making. When Cassie arrived at the kennel, she was very fearful, and it seemed like she had not had a lot of socialization in her young life. But she has slowly been opening up with people, and has been revealing the bright, curious, feisty young lady within! Once she gets to know a person, she will happily treat herself to some lap time or snuggles in between exploring on walks and play time. It seems like she will be a real whiz with fetch with a little more practice! Cassie would benefit from a patient, experienced home to help her to continue building her confidence and learning about the world. She is currently still very anxious and fearful (and so somewhat spastic) around other dogs and may benefit from being able to be the only dog in the house - or at least having very gradual intros. Cassie is estimated to be under a year old, still very much an older puppy, and weighs 36 lbs.\nDue to COVID-19, CITY DOGS is currently doing adoptions by APPOINTMENT ONLY. Please visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog to request a meet and greet! \n\nQuestions? Email: citydogs@city.cleveland.oh.us | Call: (216) 664-3476\nVisit: 9203 Detroit Avenue Cleveland, OH 44102\n\nHours:\n10 AM - 3 PM Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday\n10 AM - 6 pm Tuesday & Thursday\n\nFee: $61 | Includes spay/neuter, shots, microchip, license, 30 days free pet insurance (when registered upon adoption)\n\nThe CITY DOGS mission is to increase adoptions from the City Kennel by changing the image of the pit bulls who make up the majority of the kennel population, by preparing all adoptable dogs in the kennel for lives in loving homes and by creating as many opportunities as possible for the public to meet and get to know our dogs for the terrific pets they are meant to be.\n\nOur Adoption Process...\nHere's a little about how things work:\nAll of the CITY DOGS posted for adoption are available for direct adoption from the kennel, unless noted otherwise. You must schedule a meet with a dog in advance - we are not currently accepting walk-ins. Please look online first to see if there are any dogs you think would be a good fit for your home before scheduling a meet. To get the process started, visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog and fill out the form. One of our adoption counselors will get in touch to schedule and confirm your meet! At the kennel, an adoption counselor will introduce you and your family to the adoptable dogs, share information we know about them, and discuss our suggested ways for successfully integrating a new dog into your home. You are welcome to meet multiple dogs. If the dog you adopt is already fixed, he or she may leave with you that day - otherwise, the dog can go home after receiving the spay or neuter surgery.)\n\nAbout Our Dogs: All available dogs have gone through a behavioral and medical assessment. This assessment is a snapshot of who the dog is at that given time. We cannot make any guarantees with regard to behavior, temperament or health of any City Dog once they are in the home. Most of our dogs are picked up as strays, so we do not know what kind of home environment they were living in (i.e. with kids, other dogs or other cats), nor do we know if most of them are house trained. Everything we know about them is based on volunteer and staff observations. We do have some dogs in foster homes, where they will have more information about how the dog is in a home environment. It is very hard to tell with certainty whether or not a dog will be good with kids, cats or another dog. If you have kids in the home or another dog, we do require that they be present for a meet and greet with the dog you are considering for adoption.\n\nHeath/Vaccinations: Dogs that are adopted directly from the kennel need to go to your personal vet within two weeks of leaving the kennel. All dogs receive their DAPPL, Rabies, and Bordatella vaccines, though you may be required to get follow up boosters. All dogs come microchipped and with a Cuyahoga County license.?  \n\n\n\n \n",

            "description": "Given how Tina first came to our notice, it is truly a wonder when you see the dog she is today. Our rescue partner in West Virginia reached out to us in April of 2019 about a feral, heavily pregnant dog that had came in as a stray. Terrified out of her mind, the staff there knew that they needed help with this dog who was ready to give birth soon. We came, and along with a few other dogs, brought Tina back to our shelter. The next few months were spent helping this new mom take care of her puppies (although she did not need much help!) and then once all of her puppies were in foster and then adopted we turned our focus to Tina. \n\nIn the last year and a half, we have been constantly amazed by the progress Tina has made. She had never experienced what we assume all dogs have done; walking on a leash, eating from a food bowl, being around people, all were foreign to her. What has aided Tina tremendously is the fact that she is so dog-friendly and tolerant. Tina thrives off the companionship and camaraderie of other dogs and by being around them she slowly started mimicking and picking up on things that they do. Her first friend at our shelter was Legend and as roommates, he helped show her a thing or two about the best parts of being a dog and what to enjoy in life. Now she is roomies with Raven, who has shown Tina that snacks and toys are the ultimate and that you have to make sure if you are not playing you are snacking!\n\nBy no means has Tina completely transformed into what we would consider a normal dog but she has certainly made strides towards something like it. The first time she rolled over and gave belly to our Shelter and Behavior Assistant Leslie we all collectively smiled and gasped a bit! An ideal home for Tina would be one with a lot of patience and determination that has at least one other dog if not more. She would definitely need a fenced-in yard as she is not the type to just go out the back and come right back inside (baby steps!). We cannot wait to see what strides Tina continues to make and we cannot wait to see what her future has in store.",

Something about this boy I just had to fight for. We had him moved to a Vet were he was in boarding for 8 weeks because of covid. Heartworm positive so we started the fight right away. This boy would be a great family member.  Heartworm negative, neutered, chipped, and utd on all shots, we think he is 4 years old. No cats, birds small dogs, other male dogs or small kiddos. He does great with altered large females. He has to have a very secure 6ft privacy fence. No dog parks for him. No apartments.\nIf you feel like this sweet boy would fit your family please apply at Someone2love.org.\nBecause of his past we will be reviewing adopters very carefully. This boy should be treated as a gift. He is just so special.\nHe does know sit and shake. A dog door would be great he just needs to be taught.",

She lived on the Navajo Reservation in Crownpoint, NM and her family was unable to provide basic veterinary care for her, so they surrendered her because they knew she could have a better life somewhere else.  \nDaisy weighs just over 15 lbs. and her mother was a purebred chihuahua who died during the birth of Daisy's litter.  We're not sure who her dad was.  \nWe are looking for a home for Daisy that is quiet and patient and can give her a safe place to settle in to once she is adopted.  She takes a little while to warm up to new people and environments, but once she does she is very sweet.  She is shy and skittish until she settles in to a new environment.  We think she would love to have one or two adults in her home, and that she would get used to other dogs once she was comfortable.  She lived with other dogs on the reservation.  Daisy bonds really well with \"her person\" and is sweet and loving and happy around them, but needs time and patience to be comfortable around others.  \nDaisy is spayed and current on her vaccinations.  Her adoption fee is $200.  Please call us at 970-749-1968 for more information on Daisy.",

            "description": "#711373Age: 3 years Weight: 53lbs How this pet arrived: This pet was brought in by a Good Samaritan on December 29, 2020. At SDHS:Abby has been microchipped, spayed, and is up to date on vaccinations. Now she's ready for her new home! Why this pet is the one for you:This adorable little wiggle-butt is Abby! She gets a little bashful meeting new people, so it might take a moment before she shows you her goofy side. By going slow, letting her approach, and offering lots of yummy treats, she's sure to warm up faster. Once she's comfortable, Abby can have trouble managing her excitement, which means she doesn't always remember her manners. She will need a home with older, respectful children that will provide lots of mental and physical enrichment, as well as continuing her positive reinforcement training. Cats are a little too much for her, so she needs a feline-free home, however she might do okay with a similar-sized (or larger) dog buddy. Does Abby seem like the missing piece in your life?

He is good with people and a household with older kids is preferred due to his large size and accompanied strength. Butch is sweet, cuddly, and goofy... just a big ol' couch potato. He needs to be the only dog in the house and has not been tested with cats.\n\nPlease contact Jyl at jylmoore@icloud.com for more information.",

This somewhat older boy has been with his owner since he was two, but sadly she recently passed away, and now he needs a new home in which to spend his golden years.\n\nBo enjoys spending time in his fenced yard (he likes his time outdoors, but if there's a thunderstorm he'd like to be inside!).  He'd do best in a home without cats as he will likely go after them.  He got along with the female Lab that shared his home, but he seems a little nervous around other dogs.  He is really good with children.   When he's had enough of their attention, he will just walk away.  Bo loves walks.  This laid back affectionate boy will appreciate your loving attention and can't wait to meet your loving family.\n\nAdoption Fee: $50 which includes vaccinations, rabies, and neuter.\n\nA healthy pet is a happy pet!

Some were dumped, abandoned in an empty house, left tied to a tree, picked up by animal control as strays, or simply unwanted by their owners. We ask that only serious and committed adopters apply as these dogs have suffered enough.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet please apply to adopt at\nhttp://www.wagsandwhiskerspetrescue.com/adopt.html\nif the pet is still available for adoption and you are approved to adopt we will contact you to set up a meet and greet appointment.",

She came into the shelter extremely emaciated and was there for a couple months. The shelter reached out to us, because they couldn't believe such a sweet girl hadn't been rescued yet. That is when Lulu became a Cause dog!Lulu is very sweet and friendly. She's a big goofy girl who loves her belly rubs and will roll onto her back for anyone. She's also very smart, knows how to sit, and is completely house trained. She has never had an accident in her foster home. Her teeth are in rough shape, due to possibly chewing on electrical cords at some point and possible neglect. Despite this, she's as happy as can be and doesn't have any trouble eating kibble. She has a surprising amount of energy for an older dog, but also prefers to relax for most of the day. She gets along with non confrontational dogs. We haven't had the chance to observe her with children, but think she would be just fine. We also haven't been able to observe her with cats yet, but will be testing her soon.At the time Lulu was spayed, she also had a mammary tumor removed. It was biopsied and found to be low grade cancerous. However, the vet was very happy with how clean the removal was and is hopeful that no more growths will form. Lulu was also x-rayed to check for other growths and there were none. Still, any adopter would have to be vigilant of any lumps that form and the vet recommended an x-ray every 6-8 months, just to be extra cautious.\nLulu would love a warm bed and lots of love to spend her senior years. If that could be you, please apply to adopt our girl Lulu!",

The quickest way to Bella's heart is by grabbing a toy and playing with her until she's tuckered out. She is a gregarious girl who loves to run around and then cuddle up on the couch to snuggle. She is still adjusting to life at the shelter and will take patience and plenty of love while she's adjusting to her new forever home. With the right dog, she shows potential to live with another resident dog, but she wouldn't mind being the only dog in the home either! Bella can be a bit sensitive to new situations and can become overwhelmed without the reassurance of her favorite people. Due to her initial sensitivity, if Bella's forever home have children in it they would need to need to be age 16 and older. Bella has a heart of gold and can't wait to find her new best friend. \n\nIf Bella looks like the pup for you, give us a call at 234-212-9843 to learn more about her and schedule an appointment to meet her!",

            "description": "Say hello to Eileen! \n\nShe is a 4 year old Pitbull/Bulldog mix who weighs about 65 pounds. This sweet girl can be a little shy when first meeting new people, but with the help of some tasty treats she warms up well! She can be sensitive to new situations, but does well with the help of her favorite people by her side! She has been in a foster home for over a month now and has been doing great adjusting to a new place. Her foster family has a young child and multiple dogs that Eileen has done great with. If it's the right fit, she shows potential to live with children under 10 as well as another resident dog. When she's not napping, Eileen is a playful girl who loves to play ball. When she's feeling playful she'll even pick up the ball and throw it to you when she wants to fetch! Eileen is a super sweet and loving girl who can't wait to find her forever home.\n\nIf Eileen sounds like the pup for you, give us a call at 234-212-9843 to learn more about her and schedule an appointment to meet her!",

As a result, there is often an adjustment period when learning about life as a family pet. We typically do not adopt dogs to homes with young children. Homes with older children will be considered on an individual basis. Common skills such as house training and leash walking will often take a little extra time. Patience, understanding and a gentle hand are a must. The great news is, most of these dogs come around rather quickly and being a part of their rehabilitation is an extremely rewarding experience.

Luna who is about 8 months old, loves fetching, playing, and running and frisbees! Nova, who is about a year old,  is very mellow and loves to cuddle. They compliment each other! Luna looks like she smiles for the camera!\nCheck out Nova's page too!\n\n Adoption fee is $150 each or $250 for both if adopted together.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nRowdy is a Basset Hound/Spaniel mix with an approximate birthday of October 1st, 2009. He's a sweet old man that loves two things: sleeping and food.\n\nRowdy, an 11 year old deaf pup, spends about 75% of his time napping. (Check the pictures to see some interesting napping spots he has.) It is pretty hard to wake him up so we love to watch movies with him on the couch while he sleeps. The hound in him will wake up whenever we are cooking, however. He may watch you eat, but he will never steal off your plate (especially since he is 1 1/2 feet tall)! His hound side can also come with a loud bark used when he is hungry or needs to potty, so a lack of kids with little ears may be ideal. He really reserves his bark for communication so it's easy to tell when he needs something!\n\nHe's got quite a few quirks that make him special. He shakes his head and his ears make a whopping sound whenever he wakes up, his eyebrows give him an extra level of sass, and one of his ears is longer than the other. Rowdy is friendly with other dogs and has not met another cat yet. He doesn't react to barking dogs or loud people (obviously!) and usually just likes to sniff when he interacts with dogs. He goes where he wants and is just enjoying his life.\n\nOne of our favorite things to do is take a walk with him after dinner time. When we get out, he is usually out for the rest of the night. He has a bad hip, so walking helps strengthen his legs and gets the afternoon energy boost out. The home he goes to needs to have NO stairs. He has fallen a few times and it is too hard on him. Despite this, Rowdy thinks he is as agile as a young dog and will jump of couches and beds with little hesitation. He is so sweet and ready for a loving home!\n\n**He is up to date on all core vaccinations (rabies/distemper), is microchipped and neutered. He has, however, tested positive for Ehrlichia, a tick illness. Nothing needs to be done with this unless he shows symptoms of the disease. Treatment is antibiotics for a month each time he has a flare up. Some dogs go their whole life with no issues and some need meds. It just depends on the dog.Interested in adopting this lovable animal? Please go to our website www.wagsmn.org and fill out an Adoption Application. Once the application is processed, a Wags representative will contact you, answer any questions you may have, and set up a time/location for a meet and greet! A home visit is required prior to adoption.\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt!\n\nBreed and temperament determination: Wags & Whiskers Animal Rescue attempts to determine breed and temperament using a combination of looks, information provided to us at intake, and our experience with the animal while in our Rescue. We do not guarantee this determination.",

            "description": "Mirror mirror on the wall, who is the very best girl of them all?\n\nHi I'm Kora! Some of you might remember my babies known as Kora's Kids. My foster mom picked me up when I was very pregnant from a shelter in Texas last year. I gave birth to 11 beautiful babies on Mother's Day 2020.\nThey have all grown up and left me but I stayed behind because I had those nasty heartworms. I am happy to report I am now heartworm free. \n\nI have been in foster care for so long and have payed the ultimate price for having a crappy owner. Not spayed or on heartworm preventative! To top it off we found out that I had a had torn ACL needing surgery. That was another setback but now I am completely healed now and can run like the wind. Now I am ready to find my family.\n\nI am a Border Collie mix about 3-4 yrs. old and weigh 45 lbs. I love to play so another playful dog would be great.\nI am completely housebroken and crate trained and walk well on a leash.\n\nI love to lay my head on your lap and be told how beautiful I am.\n\nI love kids but absolutely hate cats.\nI am a very aware of strange noises and will alert you but I am not an obsessive barker. I am the perfect package.\nThank you for taking time to read my story!\n\nKora Jean (my foster Mom calls me that)\n\nIf you are interested in any of our dogs, please complete our online adoption application:\n\nhttp://www.lifesaverssp.dreamhosters.com/adoption-applicat/\n\nWe will conduct a phone interview, check references and then a home check. This helps us to match a dog with their potential adopter. The adoption fee is $350.00 for adults and $450.00 for puppies under one year which includes spay/neutering, up-to-date age appropriate vaccinations, flea/tick & heartworm preventative and a health certificate. We foster our dogs in homes, not in shelters. This allows us to get to know the dogs temperaments in order to match them to a home. This also allows us to get the dogs ready to live in their forever homes! All dogs coming from the south have been quarantined for two weeks and fully vetted before traveling to New England!\n\nFor more info please email Lifesaversapps@outlook.com OR visit our website:\n\nhttp://www.lifesaverssp.org/",

            "description": "Yakko is a very sweet and goofy boy. He\u2019s about 1-2 years old, but still acts like a puppy. He loves balls, squeaky toys and bones. Yakko is happy to see everyone and tries to give hugs. Yakko thinks he\u2019s a lap dog and has no concept of personal space. If you chill on the couch, he is chilling out on you. If you are petting him and stop, he paws you to keep going. Yakko is working on learning commands such as; come, sit stay and no. He is crate trained and will voluntarily go into the crate when he\u2019s not getting attention. Yakko is not quite housebroken, but he\u2019s learning quickly and doing well. He is very treat motivated. He does pull on the leash when walking, but is working on that also. Yakko does well with cats, mostly ignores them. He does well with other dogs his size and smaller, but avoids dogs bigger than him. Yakko has been on a few walks and is cautious about his surroundings. Yakko does gobble his food and needs a slow feeder. Because of his size and jumping up, no children under the age of 13.   If you would like to meet this dog please call Heather at 630-615-1745.  The adoption fee is $225.\n\nAdoption fee includes:\n- microchip\n- spay/neuter\n- age appropriate vaccinations:  Bordetella, DH(L)PP, rabies\n- heartworm preventive & flea/tick preventive \n- deworming",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Riley! I'm a 6 year old beagle mix and weigh about 40lbs. My foster mom says I'm very inquisitive and a busy body. Whatever that means. All I know is there so much to explore and so many things to move around inside a house. I came in as a stray so I need to check everything out! There are so many toys that need to be taken out of the toy bins, and dog beds that need to be moved to different rooms. Because I was a stray, the world was my potty, but I'm learning quickly that I actually need to go outside for that stuff. I like my walks, but enjoy snuggling up on the couch too. I also love love love head scratches.! I'd do great with almost any family, I'd just prefer not to have cat siblings. I don't like them much!   If you would like to meet this dog please call Alyssa at 815-791-2297.  The adoption fee is $225.\n\nAdoption fee includes:\n- microchip\n- spay/neuter\n- age appropriate vaccinations:  Bordetella, DH(L)PP, rabies\n- heartworm preventive & flea/tick preventive \n- deworming",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nStella is a 30-35 lb. hound mix with an estimated date of birth of 3/3/2015. She is a medium-sized, strong and slender type dog who loves to run outdoors and chill indoors in a cozy spot nearby her people.\n\nStella is a sweet, smart, sensitive, loving, and low-maintenance dog. House-trained with great and predictable potty habits. Sleeps in as late as you want to sleep in. She is shy with strangers and will bark fearfully at new people sometimes, but once she warms up to someone with a little time and space, she is mellow and trusting. She's very well-behaved and aware of when things are off limits-she's careful to make sure it's okay to jump up on furniture, won't touch the trash even if food is sticking out of it, and when she needs something, whether going potty or for a walk, she lets you know--sometimes by putting a paw or two on you and staring at you (as in one of the pics here), or by doing a little march with her front paws.\n\nShe knows some basic commands. She likes her kennel, but she'll definitely take snuggling in a bed or on a sofa with a person over that. She loves sitting next to a heater. She's fine left alone in the house un-kenneled. She isn't very interested in toys or fetch and doesn't chew on anything.\n\nStella has lived her whole life with another dog, but in her later years she started fighting more frequently with the other dog, possibly for dominance, so she would be better as an only dog. She will bark at noises, so probably best for her to live without shared walls. She is mellow and happy when things are predictable but has anxiety with storms and fireworks, and she doesn't like car rides.\n\nOn walks, she pulls on her leash sometimes and barks/lunges at other dogs and passing cars, but even in a short time she's gotten better at not pulling, so she might just need getting more comfortable with her person and her neighborhood. She is medium energy, and with me, was fine with a short 15-30 minute walk daily and a couple of potty breaks. Given the chance, she loves to sprint at breakneck speed across a frozen lake!\n\nShe's fine with children although she seems aware of the pack hierarchy. She ignored my younger child for a few days and then was as loving with him as everyone else.\n\nIf you think Stella would be a good fit for your home, please apply!\nInterested in adopting this lovable animal? Please go to our website www.wagsmn.org and fill out an Adoption Application.

            "description": "**PLEASE READ GIA'S BIO THOROUGHLY BEFORE INQUIRING. ALL REQUIREMENTS MUST BE MET IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED.**\n\n\n\nGia is our gorgeous 4 year old female Terrier mix who is approximately 18lbs of adorableness! Gia came to us as an owner surrender who never spayed/neutered his pets and she ended up having a couple litters. He contacted us when he was overwhelmed with dogs and surrendered all 5 dogs to us. We have found them all amazing homes, but Gia is still looking for her happy ever after. This little lady LOVES to talk, boy does she love to talk. In rescue we call it \"bark talking.\" She's a good listener though and minds well. We do not want Gia to go into a home that does not have another dog. She seems to only connect and do well with male dogs that are sweet like her. She is not great with bigger dogs, so a dog her size or smaller would be perfect! Although she is amazing with everyone she meets including children, we want her in a home with kids that are 12 years old or older. Gia can be a flight risk and she's fast so for her safety we are requiring a 3ft doggy gate at the front door inside the home as a preventative measure when the door is opened/closed. This is contractual regardless if you have a secure screen door or a fenced in front yard....a 3ft dog gate is required. Gia doesn't necessarily need a home with a yard, but please note that she is in a home now with a yard and outdoor access all day and she still goes potty in the house occasionally. It's not that she isn't potty trained, but she just needs constant work in that department. This sweet girl really needs a dog savvy home that is patient, kind, and loving and will give her all the time she needs to acclimate. She has been in foster for almost 2 years, so an adjustment to a new home is going to be very hard on her. Once she opens up to you and feels safe, you will see her true personality come out! She is a very loving girl who thrives for attention and LOVES to be next to you! You must be ok with allowing your pets on the furniture including the couch and your bed. We can't allow her to be crated. Gia had a very sad young life and we want to make sure that the rest of it is absolutely THE BEST! \n\nFor Gia, we are requiring at least 2 meet/greets before we even decide to go the next step. A meet/greet will be held in the Torrance area where everyone in the home including your dog will come down and spend some time with her to see if this could be a match.\n\n\nWE ONLY ADOPT IN LOS ANGELES AND SURROUNDING AREAS AS AN IN PERSON HOME CHECK AND TRIAL PERIOD ARE REQUIRED.\n\nGia's adoption fee is $500\n\n\n\nGia is spayed, vaccinated, and microchipped.\n\nIf you meet all the requirements and would like an application, please contact us at 310-990-2020 or at Gina@theforgottendog.org",

            "description": "Hello my name is Lucille. I am a 1 year old Hound mix that weighs approx. 50-55lbs. I am a sweet girl that loves to go for walks and spend time with my people. I have some doggy friend but a meet and greet is suggested if you have other dogs in the home. I am not suggested with cats or small mammals. I do not like to be left alone in the yard for extended periods of time as I will seek out people. I am leash trained and crate trained. My adoption fee is $125. I am spayed, microchipped, and up to date on my yearly vaccines. I did test positive for heartworms but thanks to Rockwall PAWS, once I am adopted I will be able to receive treatment with little or no cost to the adopter. RAC staff is happy to answer any questions you have about heartworms and the treatment.All animals unless otherwise noted in their descriptions are at 1825 Airport Road, Rockwall, TX. Hours of operation are Monday through Friday 9 AM - 6 PM and Saturday 9 AM - 5 PM.

Kaiser is a goofy sweetheart who loves having his hips rubbed and is eager to be out and about sniffing and running around. He's strong, athletic and very energetic. Kaiser could do with a bit of training as well as an active and engaged owner or family. He knows sit, but needed some encouragement to comply. There's a lot of good potential in this boy. He's very smart. Kaiser's adoption fee is $150 and helps cover the cost of his neuter, vaccinations, worming, monthly heart worm, flea and tick preventive, microchip and care while at CCHS.",

He was found as a stray. He loves people and enjoys attention, and will happily greet other dogs. He has some vision and mobility issues, and is a little wobbly on his feet, but he's very sweet and we're hoping we can help him put some weight on, add strength, and have him feel much more comfortable. Despite his rickety, weak state and soft eyes, he is a happy boy that wants to be able to live his life, be with people, and explore his surroundings.",

Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet him.\n\nTodd is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~1.5 years\nWeight: ~69lbs\nHousebroken: Working on it! He needs to be on a strict schedule\nCrate trained: Hasn't been left alone for very long due to COVID and will benefit from an adopter willing to continue to work on this. \nDog sociability: Leash reactive/frustrated in our care meaning he barks/lunges/pulls at other dogs. He is very strong and requires a confident handler. \nCat sociability: Not a match\nKids: Lives with kids under 10 and has been doing great!\nIdeal home: Todd will do best in a quieter neighborhood where he can work on his leash skills! A backyard would be his dream. \n\nTodd is a big, super-friendly guy that loves all people! He enjoys giving kisses and snuggling with you all day long. He absolutely loves to be pet and will let you know when he's not ready for his massage to be over yet by gently nudging your hand for more. His favorite pastimes are chasing squirrels, playing with tennis balls and fluffy toys. At the end of the day he likes to curl up with a good bone and watch The Great British Baking Show. Todd will do best with a handler in a more low-key area that is committed to working on training!\n\nTodd's adoption fee is 300. He is neutered, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

That\u2019s me!  Being in my current foster home I have learned that I can be at peace and move at my own pace.  I am on low-activity at the moment since I am going through heartworm treatments but I am not letting that get me down.  I am the curious kind, observant, and love to have some quick spurts around the yard.  I know I must get my rest and without having to be told I come right in and lay down.  I like snuggling up to the humans, adult or child (9 and 14), and with the other fur friends (dogs, not cat tested within current foster home).  I have been doing very well with relieving myself outside and have not had any accidents within my foster home.  I am great in the crate.  I have shown no signs of resource guarding when it comes to food and will share whatever I have.  I have not shown an interest in toys just yet nor have I made a peep vocally.  I do pretty well on the leash but will get even better over time.  I am just an easy going gal that just wants love and comfort.\n\nMedical Note:  I am heartworm positive.  I had my first injection treatment on 1/19 and I will need another in about a month.  You can adopt me but you will need to be able to transport me to the vet for my treatment in February.  \n\nYou can still come adopt me or even join our foster program to help the humans learn all the awesome things about new dogs like me! Learn more on our website! \n\nHope to see you soon! \n\nWhat breed am I? Mixed mutt! ODHS does not breed label (unless there\u2019s official paperwork), as studies show it is nearly impossible to tell the exact breed of each dog based off of their appearance.\n\nEducational articles:\n3/3/3 Rule;\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturdays. \nOur adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience.  Currently, the average timeframe for a response to your application is 1 week.\n\nLike us on Facebook \"Old Dominion Humane Society\"\nand be a part of promoting forever homes for dogs in need.\n#Adopt #Donate #Foster #Volunteer \n\nNote: ODHS only adopts to Virginia and surrounding states (including D.C.). A $50 out of state fee applies.",

Coco will be up to date on all vaccinations before she goes to her new family.  She is microchipped and spayed.  Please apply at www.makrescue.org unless you are already approved.

Spayed\nAge/Birthdate: 9 years - 10/5/2011\nReason for surrendering: Moving out of state/health concerns\nWhat is her energy level (low, medium, high)? Very High!\nTypical exercise she receives? Short walks only to potty.\nKind of fencing she requires? Has never jumped any fence.\nTraining? (house, crate, leash, potty, hunting, obedience - commands she knows) house trained, crate.

He came to SFAS when his guardian could no longer care for him and he is now ready for a new family. Here at the shelter, Rokko has been excited to go on his daily afternoon walks. His puppy personality is so sweet to experiance.He also does participate in playgroup but we do ask you to bring your dog in to meet Rokko. Rokko's adoption fee is $130. He is neutered and microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. To meet Rokko or to be added to his waitlist, call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the DOG'S NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org. A scheduler will call you back within 48 hours to confirm your request. If you have other dogs at home, tell the scheduler you would like to bring them along for a Meet n' Greet. SFAS offers a variety of excellent training classes, seminars and Trainer Talks led by animal behavior professionals. These are $50 off for animals adopted from any shelter or rescue group!

She loves to play with toys and loves being with people.  She is desperate to find her own person to attach herself too.  She is in a foster home and follows her foster mom everywhere around the house.  Although she enjoys playing, if you are busy, she will go lay down or chew on a Nylabone to entertain herself.\n\nHer foster home has a female dog and Jazzy has been dominant with her and tries to guard her toys from her.  Jazzy would like all of the dog attention on her.  For these reasons, a home with not other dogs (or maybe a submissive male) is needed and no children under 12 years old please.  Jazzy has not been cat tested.\n\nA secure fenced yard (no invisible fences please) is preferred.\n\nJazzy is housebroken, spayed and current on vaccinations.  She has not been crated at her foster home and is not destructive when left alone.\n\nPlease email is you have any questions about sweet Jazzy!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Lottie was found as a stray and, after a lengthy search for owners proved unsuccessful, she found her way to Paw Placement. This sweet girl is currently in a loving foster home where we are getting to know her. Lottie is about 2 years old and has had a few litters of puppies in her previous life.\n\nLottie LOVES humans; she prefers to be cuddled up with her people, basking in the attention and affection. She likes the company of other dogs and has become inseparable with her doggie foster brother. She doesn't yet understand squeak toys, leading us to believe she didn't have them in her previous life. She loves bones and antlers, and spends hours chewing them. She'll occasionally show interest in chasing a tennis ball. She's quite green on a leash - when she encountered leash pressure initially, she would lie down and refuse to move, though this improves every day - and will need continued walking lessons in her forever home. Lottie is looking for a home with a yard. She is crate and house trained in her foster home. She has not been tested with children or cats, though her foster believes she'd do very well with children old enough to have impulse control.\n\nLottie is very submissive when put into new situations, or when spooked. For example, a sudden loud noise will send her running to the bedroom to hide on the closet, and she won't be coaxed out, and she may submissive pee. As she gets more comfortable in the home, and her humans refrain from coddling her and instead teach her how to be brave, she improves and gains confidence. But it's important to note that she'll require patience and time to overcome this quirk.\n\nA note from foster mom: Lottie is a cuddle bug who wants to simply love her human. She smiles and wiggles her butt when happy so maybe her name should have been Ms Wigglebutt. She gets along well other dogs but wants human interaction. She will need a few days to feel confident and comfortable in her new home so don't rush it. She's a little skinny right now but we are working on it and expect that she will fill out in her furever home. She will need leash training as she doesn't really like it. She will walk on a loose leash once she feels comfortable with her human. She sleeps through the night and is house broken in her foster home. Lottie spills her food out of her food dish, something she came into foster doing. Lottie will make someone very happy as she's a gem.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete an adoption application. Because we are still understaffed due to COVID19, we will only be able to email those applicants that are approved to schedule a meet and greet. Thank you in advance for your understanding if you don't hear back from us regarding your application.",

She was brought to the shelter with an older male dog, and in foster with us, she opened up to our dog first before learning from him that we are trustworthy humans. Now, she plays with our dog daily, so I'd highly recommend her as a second dog! After two weeks with her, we know that she...\n... is crate trained, potty trained, walks like a dream on leash, is fine to stay home alone if you leave the TV on (ie. some human voices)\n... does not know how to play with dog toys, chew bully sticks, sleep in a dog bed, walk up stairs\n... tolerates just fine a bath, nail dremel, grooming / brushing / general handling - she's been great letting me wipe her paws after walks\n... is somewhat food motivated - for bedtime routine, we toss treats in her crate and she goes in no problems\nWhen you get to know her, Mina is such an easy going, low maintenance girl. My heart swells every time she comes over and asks for pets by pawing at me. She will definitely be a blessing to her forever family.\n\nPlease contact us for further information and visit our website to complete an adoption application:\nwww.twodogfarms.com/adopt\n\nAdoption fees are $300.\nShe is located in Los Anegels currently.\n\ninfo@twodogfarms.com",

She was found on someone's doorstep with an infection in both her ears. Dr Scholl at Chickasaw Animal Hospital did surgery on her ears. As a result of the infections, Bonnie is deaf, but looks you in the eye for direction. This gentle dog is the sweetest animal who loves to love you! She is great with kittens, cats, puppies, and adult dogs. She lies on her beds and goes outside to potty. Bonnie would be best in a home with older/mature children since she cannot hear and little kids playing or running may startle her since she cannot not hear them coming. If given the chance, Bonnie could jump a 4 foot fence, so a 6' fence is required and owners should be obervservant of her while outside as she cannot hear you to call her back home.",
