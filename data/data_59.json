I arrived there on 01/26/20 as a stray. I was originally Heartworm positive, but I was treated at MCAS. So, I am a Heartworm Survivor. I have been at the Humane Society since 09/02/20. I love to play in the water and play with toys. I need to be the only animal in the home. No kids for me, either, please; they make me feel uncomfortable. If you think I would be a good fit for you come and see me soon!\n\nKind regards,\nMidnight",

Being as young and large as I am I would greatly benefit from an obedience class plus I think it would be so fun! I am goofy, playful, and full of spunk yet I can also be strong minded, strong willed, and very stubborn (Because I know I can get away with it ;) ) I am looking for an active and loving family to spend the rest of my life with, I hope that's you!\n\nPlacement Recommendations:\nOwner Experience Level: Some Experience\nCats: No Thank You \nDogs: Yes\nKids: High School +Want to know more? Please call us! We've found that back and forth via email regarding a specific animal is not always effective and quick because our email is not monitored on a regular basis. So, for specific information regarding this wonderful pet, please contact one of our adoption counselors at (715) 232-9790. They are available between the hours of 8 am and 7 pm (7 days a week, excluding holidays). Thanks for your interest!",

She loves humans and other dogs and is constantly wanting to play. She also loves being outdoors and even enjoys the little agility course at the dog park. She is very high energy and loving but she definitely needs some training to desensitize her to everything going on around her that excites her. She is okay with kids (recommend 10 and older)but also overly exhuberant about giving sugars and getting loving. We aren't sure how she is with cats.

Chevy is a very confident, energetic puppy who likes to play with other dogs, so he will need a buddy and a fenced yard in his forever home! He loves his people and is friendly with new people he meets. Chevy will be a great companion for walking and hiking. He would like us to mention that he's heard about camping and he is totally up for that. ? He would make a good family dog with gentle children over 7, because of his puppy exuberance. Is Chevy your guy?\n\nFor more information about this animal and our adoption process, please visit our website to fill out an adoption application: https://www.homecomingsrescue.org/adoption-process.",

            "description": "Girly is a beautiful, sweet, cuddly and sensitive Pup. Do you want someone to go on a quick sprint with? Perhaps a detective to go hunting for a treat? Or maybe even a snuggle buddy for Netflix binge watching sessions? Then Girly is your gal! Girly is estimated to be a 5 year old mildly energetic lady who enjoys the thrill of the hunt and outdoors, just as much as she loves curling up on a couch or sunbathing on a patio. Her favorite things to do are car rides and quiet, long walks outdoors. She also seems to be up for a challenge as long as she can explore in a quiet place. This gal has no time for noisy environments! While at home, Girly is one of the calmest and sweetest pups ever. She is house trained and will hide in embarrassment if she has an accident (which is RARE!). She loves being next to her human whether hanging on the couch, belly up sometimes for non-stop rubs before falling asleep with snores that can get quite loud; or, in the kitchen with puppy-dog eyes begging for treats (peanut butter, cheddar cheese and vanilla ice-cream are her favorites!). Girly seemed to have had significant emotional trauma in her past life which makes her very anxious, fearful and a little unsure of herself sometimes. It takes her a long time to warm up to people and other dogs, and she will often have some reactions stemming from her fears, and she would love a patient human who can give her the time and patience to warm up. With continued patient training and a gentle and calming owner, she will blossom into a pleasant doggie who can be around a lot of people and other dogs. This lady is a quiet and mature doggie who is quite content receiving attention from her human rather than chasing after a ball or frisbee. However, she does love a nice run, and doing a good zoomie. She will also hunt for her treats in grass or other toys, and will chew her rope to settle down when she's anxious. Girly's ideal home will be a low-traffic and quiet environment with access to a sizable fenced-yard where she can run around safely at her leisure. Ideally, she would have two humans in the home who can provide her with double the attention she craves. She would also prefer an adult-only home because sometimes kids can be too rambunctious for her. She also would do best as the sole pet in the home. However, she could learn to thrive with another more confident and calmer dog who could give her little peer-to-peer therapy in self-confidence. Come meet this beautiful and cuddly young lady!",

            "description": "Are you looking for a silly man to watch those squirrels like a hawk? Then come meet Hawk! Hawk is a chill boy inside, but he would love someone who can help him to understand that his humans will come home eventually. Hawk is someone who bonds very closely with his person and he enjoys affection, but is not too invasive and likes his own space. He is also very smart, and likes to be outside exploring all the things nature has to offer. Hawk is such a polite boy when it comes to going potty. He always waits to go outside and has not had any accidents in the house. Hawk is initially a shy guy, and will take time to get comfortable with you. It's worth the wait though because once he trusts you, he'll enjoy some good belly rubs and pats. He prefers pups who are not overly aggressive and can chill with him, and would need a well-matched dog buddy. Hawk is super easy to walk on leash, but he is still learning not to pull. He loves to sniff and explore a lot, but is also responsive to any command to move along. What he really absolutely adores is watching those action filled squirrels. If you even say the word squirrel, he'll get super attentive and look around to find those silly squirrels. He loves being outside and exploring and sniffing everything. If you have a yard where he can chase squirrels, he would be over the moon. Nothing drives him crazier than a squirrel in sight! He will chase them like crazy. Hawk never jumps on the bed or sofa and knows that's not his space. He would thrive in a low-traffic and calm home with a yard where he can run and chase those squirrels he loves. He would also be okay in an apartment without stairs or hallways. Come meet this sweet boy!",

            "description": "Beryl is a boy who can do it all! Not only is he full of spunk and personality, but he'll also make you laugh, shower you with love and impress you with all his skills. Although Beryl can be shy with new friends, he'll shamelessly beg for belly rubs and butt scritches when he's had time to warm up. Despite his 'senior' status, he has plenty of energy for long walks, outdoor adventures and two-toy fetch. And did we mention that Beryl's an excellent houseguest? He's house-trained, crate-trained and happy to snooze when you're gone! Because he loves to soak up all the spotlight, Beryl would prefer to be the only pet in the home (though he'd be willing to make an exception for the perfect furry friend!). He's not up for house parties, so he does best in a chill, adult-only environment. Beryl comes with a ton of skills and is a highly trained dog. He's an APA! TOP (Total Obedience Program) Ready dog who receives one-on-one sessions with a volunteer trainer each week. Beryl is a master at both basic and advanced obedience, and even knows to go to his special 'place' when someone knocks on the door. As part of APA!'s TOP Dog program, you can work with our staff to continue Beryl's training post-adoption, helping you master all of his tricks together! Learn more about TOP here: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Follow along with Beryl's adventures on Instagram @goodestboyberyl!",

And his sweet puppy eyes and puppy ears, one up and one floppy, are adorable. This polite, gentle boy has been on home visits, and loves to hang out with his host friends, spooning, playing pawsies, cuddling up next to them, and following them for petting. He can be a couch potato, but also likes exploring yards and is excited when going for walks, pulling on his leash. He also really loves car rides, sitting in back and staring out the window - and is excited to stick his head out. He's a smart, very motivated boy who already understands 'sit' and 'down.' And he's fully potty trained. Louis is an obedient, easygoing dude who should fit well with most families who want a companion for adventures and those road trips he loves. Come meet him, he'll follow you home!",

            "description": "JJ Watt is a gorgeous young pup who is just as smart and fun as he is good-looking! He takes a little time to warm up to new friends, but once you earn his trust, he is a sweet and goofy boy. He'll keep you smiling with his cute little hops when he's excited to see you and when he is about to go for a walk. He also has a great enthusiasm for snacks! While JJ enjoys attention from his best human friends, he isn't overly-clingy. He does like his space at times (but don't we all), and he'll let you know you're his person with some gentle head nuzzles on your arm. He will also hang out near you while you're relaxing or getting some work done. He's a big fan of going on easy-paced strolls to get his exercise, and will take plenty of opportunities to stop and smell all the things. He also loves to plop down on a good patch of grass and roll around to scratch his back! JJ Watt has been enjoying learning new things, and is in APA!'s Total Obedience Program (TOP), which is modeled after the AKC's Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, JJ Watt has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! As a part of APA's Total Obedience Program, you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with JJ Watt after adoption, and master all of the TOP dog skills together! Check out a video on APA's CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 JJ Watt would love a low-traffic home with one or two adults to call his own. If you're looking for a handsome, sweet and easy-to-please dog to add to your life, come meet JJ Watt - he's truly a special soul!",

While he may be shy at first, Scoopy quickly warms up to anyone, and he'll only leave your side to snag the comfy spot on the couch. This good boy has had a tough time in the world but you wouldn't know it by his gentle, sweet demeanor! He is working on being more confident, so he is looking for a loving and patient family to help guide him through the scary sounds of the outside world ('Sirens! Beeping! Engines! Oh my!). Once he is comfortable in new situations, he is the happiest, energetic pup. He'll even show you his athletic side if you have a ball to throw! Scoopy could qualify for the Olympic High Jump team, so he would do best in a (high!) fenced backyard where he can run around safely. Inside the house, Scoopy loves to cuddle up and binge a good show. He will snuggle up into ANY space you allow him to, even your lap! Don't let his size fool you! He is the perfect work-from-home officemate, and will even remind you to take frequent yoga breaks with his downward dog stretches. He is a quick learner and has got 'sit down pretty well if there's a yummy treat involved. Scoopy is house-trained, and will let you know when he needs to go outside by hanging out by the door. If you let him, Scoopy will gladly hop on to any bed you give him, but he is also used to being in his crate at night for sleeping. Scoopy loves playdates with furry friends, and could do well in a home with other dogs. Scoopy is Heartworm positive, but all that means is that he will need a few months rest after treatment at APA!'s expense, and then he will be better than ever. He will need a home that will make sure he makes it to his appointments at APA!, and will give him extra love as he goes through the treatment process. Scoopy's most favorite thing is cuddling and nestling his face and big floppy ears on your lap. Do you have a spot for him at your home? Don't let this good boy get passed up, come meet him today!",

Piper has so much energy that she will need a home with a fenced back yard with plenty of room to work off that energy. Because of her larger than life personality, she is not aware of her own size and could knock over small children so we suggest a home with older kiddos. Piper is also good with other dogs! She is potty trained and kenneled trained as well. Her adoption fee is $150.00 and includes spaying, rabies, vaccinations, and microchipping. If you are interested in meeting her, apply at www.ootwrescue.org.\n\nTo make the best possible match for you and the pet, please click below to complete the Adoption Application. \n\nOnce your application has been processed, we'll be in contact. \n\nWe cannot schedule a meet and greet without a completed application. \n\nIf you are viewing this page through PetFinder, Adopt-a-Pet, etc., please go to http://ootwrescue.org/adoption.html to fill out an application or review our Adoption Process.",

Our wish for Apollo is to find a kind, loving adopter who will patiently teach him that he can trust again. Apollo will do best as the only pet in an adult-only household. \nApollo's DOB is 3/15/2018, he is a Chihuahua and weighs 14 pounds. Apollo is neutered, microchipped, current on all vaccinations, and takes preventative flea/tick/heartworm medicine. \nAs with all our dogs, Apollo must be an indoor dog.\nIf you are interested in adopting Apollo, please email bahshelter@yahoo.com. If there are other dogs in your home, we require a meet and greet, which you can schedule via email at bahshelter@yahoo.com. \nIf you cannot attend your scheduled visit, kindly text or call the volunteer you are meeting before your scheduled visit. They are taking time out of their day to meet with you. Thank you!\n",

            "description": "Meet Bert!\n\nBert was surrendered to the San Diego Humane Society-Oceanside\n\nhis family who could no longer care for him.\n\nHe is 8 years old and weighs 17 lbs. On January 6th, Bert became a Frosted Face!\n\nHe has a heart murmur, a collapsing trachea, and some arthritis in his right elbow, but Bert doesn't let any of that slow him down! We use a harness to walk him to relieve pressure on his neck. Bert is a fun guy who asks for belly rubs and pets!\n\nBert was only at Frosted Faces a few days before he got to go to a Foster home to wait for his Forever Family. His Foster Family shared this update:\n\n\"Bert is a super fun dog who loves scratches, cuddling, and his blanket! He's potty trained, great on a leash, loves to cuddle, and pretty much ignores other dogs that he has met although he and our dog are starting to have some playful interactions. We have had him in a crate at night but may let him have more freedom since he's doing so well. He has a very healthy appetite and is always ready to pounce on any food left unattended. His favorite place seems to be next to my teenager!\"\n\nBe sure to watch the adorable videos of Bert with his favorite blankie and his tail wagging a mile a minute! There's also a video of Bert on a walk with this Foster Family.\n\nIf you'd like to meet Bert, apply here: https://frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees, and we help with medical costs!\n\nApply to become a family: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated 1/31/21 KG",

            "description": "Dasher was adopted but returned a week later due to adopter's dog being to excited to play with a new dog buddy. Dasher was perfect at their home and very welll behaved. They decided they are not ready for 2 dogs.\nDasher's time was up at the shelter since he was nervous of the shelter food test with fake hand on pole. We evaluated him with treats/chews and had no issues by hand and took him in. He did great with our transporter and well behaved during his car ride. Very nice dog. Dasher needs basic training. Fine on leash. He is very friendly happy listens and is cooperative. He is very treat motivated and smart. Dasher loves playing with other dogs. He is doing great at his hero foster home and their GSD dog. They are already playing on day one. Dasher needs to time to heal from his neuter surgery. Dasher is a sweetie. He will need an experienced guardian and home with attached backyard. Due to his size he will need dog experienced kids and 14 yrs and up. Dasher would be happiest with another dog at home if possible. More info. to come from his foster home.\nUpdate 1/30/21: Dasher is super sweet and loving. He has gotten along with all humans and dogs he has met. He loves to run around and play with other dogs. He loves getting his belly rubbed and will cuddle up with you on the couch. He also loves being outside playing in the yard with toys or sunbathing on our deck. He is treat motivated. Has learned sit down and paw. He can still get a little bit mouthy when he is excited but responds well when you tell him 'no'. He does not like being crated but sleeps through the night on his dog bed in our room with us. He knows his voice and can be vocal. He will bark when trying to engage a dog to play with him at the park or when inside and someone is walking past on the sidewalk but doesn't bark while walking on a leash. No signs of aggression always backs down if a dog snaps at him. Takes treats easily and will let you take things out of his mouth. Will let you brush his teeth and clip his toe nails.YouTube: https://youtu.be/pz3hGnTq6_Y",

More information to follow,\n\nBarney is a big boy but still quite a sweetheart.  He gets along with dogs but will need a home without cats.  He is very smart and learned the steps on his own on the first day in his foster home.  He is crated while his foster family is at work.  He does not destroy or have accidents in his crate but he is very vocal that he does not enjoy being in there while the other family dogs are free to roam.  He is very curious and will get into everything but is easily corrected away from things he is not supposed to be near.  He is a good eater.  He loves his  people and follows his foster mom around and just wants to be nearby and get some love and attention.\n\nHe is a really nice boy that will make a wonderful pet for some lucky family.",

ADOPTION IS $150.00.\n\nDarcie is a doll! This puppy is all fun and games! She was born about 11/2/20, is current on all vaccinations, has been wormed, is current on heartworm and flea prevention, and has been microchipped. She is great with other dogs, wonderful with children and seems fine with cats. Our best guess is she is a small lab mix. She weighed in at ten pounds Jan 3. of this year.  She absolutely needs a home with a fenced yard and another dog. She loves running and playing so much outside with her doggie friends. She is smart, has a sweet disposition and would make a great family addition.  Darcie is in Memphis.\nShe will be  spayed at approx. 14 weeks of age. She is located in Memphis. We do permit local approved applicants to enter into our foster-to-adopt program with puppies waiting to be spayed/neutered as they cannot be adopted until such time.",

He came to us in October and has been undergoing treatment for HeartWorm and on cage rest. Since he's finished that up, his reserve is evaporating, and he has begun seeking out attention and learning to enjoy life again! Champ is very easy going and laid back. He loves food and was easily house trained here after a little bit of work. Champ enjoys napping on couches, chairs, dog begs, people beds, or anything comfy. Napping is his hobby! He walks pretty well on a leash. We use an easy walk harness for extra control and guidance. Champ is a big boy and a bit clumsy at times, but he's a super sweet guy who will steal your heart along with your snack if you're not looking! He gets along well with our teenage kids and our other large dogs. We don't have young children, small dogs, or cats, but he would probably be okay with them as long as they are respectful of him. He's a live and let live kind of dog. He is blind\nBDRA has voted against the use of electrical fencing effective immediately.",

The members of the church were Daniel was abandoned helped this cutie and are now wanting to find him a loving home. Daniel is a neutered male Pitbull terrier mix (he has been DNA tested \u2013 American PBT 61%, AmStaff 19.2%, Australian Cattle Dog 10.1%, Chinese Shar-Pei 9.7%)\n\nThis cutie is about 67 pounds and pretty healthy. Daniel does have seasonal allergies but can easily be treated. This cutie loves humans and he does well with dogs his size or even larger than him. Daniel has not been around cats so we have no idea how he will do in a home with a cat. Daniel is pretty energetic so he will do best with an active family since he loves playing outside. This boy is also potty trained and crate trained so he is a pretty good boy. \n\nYou can view video of Daniel at https://fb.watch/35Mfe07FvC/\n\n\nIf interested in Daniel please visit our website www.bravebullyrescue.org and fill out our adoption application. \n\n\nIf you will like to get more information on Daniel please email Abby at abby.bassett@sanofi.com",

Both silly and sweet, Nora is a social gal who would love a family to call her own and another playful pup.  She is housebroken, crate trained, and walks on leash like a dream \u2013 she knows how to keep your pace and encounters other dogs with a wagging tail and a smile.  This lovely lady looks forward to her playgroup each day, where she romps with the other pups like a champ (and we were told she did great at dog parks). When playtime is over, Nora is quick to duck in for some human affection \u2013 give this girl some head pats, and you\u2019ll win her heart!  Nora is currently reviewing her applications, she needs people who are home more and a playful dog  \u2013 if you\u2019re in the market for a fun, sweet pup with a social personality, she would love to meet you!\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website and Facebook page!

Paloma is no longer itchy and is growing hair. She is working on a beautiful coat and will soon be ready for her spay surgery. Paloma gets along with all the other dogs in her foster home. We do not know if she has ever been around small children but she does fine with kids 10 and up.\n\nPaloma is around 3-4 years old, has been fully vaccinated and microchipped and will be spayed before adoption. Her adoption donation is $350 which includes 6 months heartworm preventative meds, free microchip registration, and a safety harness.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Paloma, please review the adoption process and fill out the application on our website: http://wsrh.com\n\nAll dogs are available until \u201cAdoption Pending\u201d is noted next to their names. WSRH DOES NOT HAVE A PUBLIC SHELTER. ALL OF OUR DOGS ARE FOSTERED IN PRIVATE HOMES. Approved adopters only will be invited to meet the dogs.",

Like most terriers, he can be a bit obstinate which can result in nipping so we are looking for a home without small children.\n\nGordon has been fully vaccinated, neutered, and microchipped. His adoption donation is $300 which includes 6 months heartworm preventative meds, free microchip registration, and a safety harness.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Gordon, please review the adoption process and fill out the application on our website: http://wsrh.com\n\nAll dogs are available until \u201cAdoption Pending\u201d is noted next to their names. WSRH DOES NOT HAVE A PUBLIC SHELTER. ALL OF OUR DOGS ARE FOSTERED IN PRIVATE HOMES. Approved adopters only will be invited to meet the dogs.",

This hunky young man is looking for a compassionate leader to guide him down the path of success. Trevor bounces with happiness when one of his favorite people appears at his kennel door to take him out for a walk. His tendency to pull ahead with excitement is quickly checked with a minor correction. One would think that a dog of Trevor's size and stature would be brave and bold, but this fledgling to the urban environment needs an experienced handler who can show him how to feel safe and comfortable. Once he feels at ease, this sweet and affectionate boy will melt with pleasure, especially if a head rub is involved! In playgroups, Trevor is still too shy to engage with the other dogs and will object to pushy dogs approaching him. This strapping head-turner will thrive in a loving home where he will be given the time to reach his potential and blossom.\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website! So, check in and log on often! \n\nWestside thanks you for looking at our amazing dogs and for choosing to save an animal's life through rescue. \n\nDon't forget to visit your local animal shelter...the source of many of our dogs.\n \nwww.sheprescue.org\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WGSRescue\n\n",

Even though he\u2019s still a babe, this smart boy had learned his basic commands and how to use a doggy door so that he can proceed outside to do his business.  Walks in the park with his canine sister are a favorite pastime and, like most puppies, Rocket will play enthusiastically and then fall asleep in your arms.  If you are looking for a dog who likes to accompany you wherever possible and whose antics will evoke smiles and laughs from you and your friends, make plans to meet Rocket soon!  (Our youngster is puppy-mouthy right now, so no small children -- and no cats.)\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website! So, check in and log on often! \n\nWestside thanks you for looking at our amazing dogs and for choosing to save an animal's life through rescue. \n\nDon't forget to visit your local animal shelter...the source of many of our dogs.\n \nwww.sheprescue.org\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WGSRescue\n\n",

            "description": "WILLOW came to us from a backyard breeding situation. A former volunteer of ours saw her posted on craigslist for free. She was originally owned by someone and given to her neighbor after her previous owner moved out and left her behind. Not knowing she wasnt spayed, the new owners housed her with an unaltered male and she became pregnant. After selling her puppies, the new owners now decided to rehome her due to some skin issues that they could not afford to take care of. ((was all told to us, we do not know WILLOWs true story)) but from the looks of her when she came to us she was definitely a backyard dog and not very well taken care of. Her body has several scars, she came to us with a massive bacterial skin infection. One of her ears looks like they attempted to crop her and failed. Her personality is a little goofy and and she can be a bit ditsy. But Willow is a sweetheart. She would absolutely love a home where she can spend the rest of her days snuggling. She loves humans. Shes a leaner. She can be a little shy but again an expert cuddler.",

He is looking for a family or individual who will bring him along on hikes or put him through his agility paces in the back yard. He was one of the lucky puppies rescued from the streets of Puerto Rico and transported to Furkids. His estimated birth date is 9/15/2020 and his adoption fee is $300. If you want to know more about Teodoro P, please complete a survey at https://furkids.org/dog-adoptions/application. Puppies require a lot of time and commitment; please make sure your schedule can accommodate a puppy as it will be a member of your family for the next 10 to 15 years. At this time, meeting our dogs is by appointment only. After submitting a survey, an adoption counselor will contact you to give you more information about the dog you are interested in adopting and to arrange for you to meet the dog. Must be at least 21 years of age to adopt.",

She can get nervous and is a little afraid of strangers and strange environments, but she'll quickly warm up to you and, if it's OK with you, probably end up on your lap. We're told Princess is housebroken and good with children and adults, but that she might bark at strangers, cats and dogs she's not familiar with. She's become very good on walks. She has slept both inside in a kennel and outside on warm summer nights.\n\nPrincess is currently located at Westside Animals for Adoption at 2631 Olive Ave. Patterson, CA 95363.",

            "description": "Hi my name is Sarge, I am a 2 year old Anatolian shepherd and great Pyrenees mix. I am the BEST boy! That is, of course, assuming there aren't any scary things out there... I am potty trained and I'm a good boy at night out of the crate. That crate scares me! I am extra sure to be good so I don't have to go in there. I LOVE other dogs and even cats. I like to play with stuffed toys, and ropes are my absolute favorite!!! Foster mom says I just tear apart the stuffed ones but I think that's what they are for. Why else would they be so fun to destroy??\n\nFoster mom says I would do best in a home with kids over 10... the little ones move really quick, and can be really scary... I don't really like men either, they have been pretty scary in the past too. I listen very well! If you call for me I will come, just not too loud, please... I still get a little scared with loud yells. I just flatten out like a pancake on the ground and wait for foster mom to tell me what to do.\n\nI am great on a leash with my harness and I can even go outside without a leash to go to the fence and back inside the house because foster mom gives me a treat and I really like that! My favorite treat is ice cubes, they come right out of foster moms fridge.\n\nI have had a rough year and I am looking for a special family to enjoy my snuggles. I am protective of my house and really don't like strangers. They are something else I'm afraid of... I am scared of what they will do, so I keep my distance and sometimes growl to tell them I am scared if they get to be too much for me. Foster mom tells people this when they come to the house and she always hugs them to help me understand they are good people, this helps me smell them a little.\n\nI love my foster moms kids, they are very aware that I get nervous with fast movement and loud noises. Foster mom says I will find my people that will help me be less afraid, and I will keep feeling more secure as time passes.\n\nAll SAAP animals are vet checked, UTD on vaccines, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, and given flea and heartworm preventative as age appropriate.\n\nOur website is: http://www.adoptastray.com/\n\nTo check if this animal is still available visit our master pet list on our website at:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/adoptable-animals/\n\nHave questions:\nPlease email us at saap@adoptastray.com for more information about this animal or to answer any questions you may have.

            "description": "Meet Merry. \nMerry is a sweet 2 ish year old pittie mix girl. Found as a stray and very pregnant this girl was welcomed to the placing paws family to be given a safe haven to have and raise her pups but also to ensure her a better \u201chappy ending\u201d. We know she has had a home because she knows sit and shake, is good in the crate and car and appears potty trained. She Love love loves toys!! She loves to fetch. And she loves to just lay by her person. She takes about 2 minutes And 2 treats to warm up to men but has been great around kids  8 and up ( we just haven\u2019t seen her around little kids yet)  She prefers to be the only dog. Merry is as deserving as they come. Could you give her the happy ever after she so deserves!!! \n\nADOPTION FEE: $350.00 The adoption fee includes all age appropriate vaccinations including rabies, HW test if age appropriate, de-worming, microchip, fecal, spay or neuter, Heartworm and flea and tick preventative.  ADOPTION PROCESS: PLEASE READ CAREFULLY The first step in the adoption process is to fill out an application online at www.placingpawsrescue.org. Once we review the applications, those applicants that are thought to be a good match will be contacted as quickly as possible. We ask that you please be patient with us as we are all volunteers. Then a telephone interview will take place, references checked and a home visit will be conducted. We will then arrange for you to meet the dog. We require that all family members, including current dogs meet the dog prior to adoption.  We put all of the known information in the animals description. If the animal is listed on the website, we are still accepting applications for that animal. We only remove the animal when the final adoption paperwork is signed. The best way to contact us is by email at placingpaws@yahoo.com. It is very difficult for the limited numbers of volunteers to return all calls. Thank you.",

He does not react to you touching his ears, feet, toys or food. He does not like loud noises and tends to cower if he thinks he is in trouble.

Bennett is around 1 1/2 years young, housebroken, good with kids, dogs, people. He loves everyone? He will sit on command, enjoys going on walks, but prefers to just chill in the house and maybe watch a good movie?? Although he is a big boy, weighing in around 55 lbs, he is a very gentle soul, he loves to hold hands. Bennett is neutered, UTD on vaccines, HW neg. If you would like to meet this wonderful guy, please submit an application at www.pupsinperil.org/adoption/   As with all of our dogs, he will require a securely fenced yard to play and potty time.",

Foster was surrendered to a county shelter because his owners said he was too active for them. He is active, but the real problem is that he wasn\u2019t properly trained when he was little and now he\u2019s being blamed for being a big puppy with no manners. We\u2019ve found that while Foster does need to learn manners, he is also smart and willing to learn if given a chance and some time. Foster truly is a big, happy puppy who thinks everything is a game. He has a lot of energy and will need a person or family that is active and busy and will include him in their activities. We believe he\u2019s housebroken because he rarely has accidents in his kennel area. Foster loves to play with other dogs, but with his size and energy level, he can be a bit much for some dogs. He does best with active dogs that like rough play. Foster also loves kids, but would probably knock over little ones, so a home with older kids or teens would be a great fit. He would also be great with a runner \u2013 he can definitely keep up. Our sweet boy is nothing but love and is looking for someone to give all his love to. He wants someone to love and care for him and, in return, he will provide years of loyal commitment and unconditional love \u2013 who could ask for anything more. To get the chance to meet our silly boy, Foster, please fill out an application to start the process.\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/91891552799173\n",

            "description": "Hi everyone! Meet Alvin (aka Taysom by his current foster family who are huge Saints fans) He is a fun- loving black mouth cur/ lab mix. He was born around October 21st and weighs about 13 pounds. He will be medium to large when full grown. He is working on potty and kennel training, but much rathers being cuddled in the bed. Alvin loves to play, especially with toys that make noise and is great with kids. He also loves playing along with other dogs! Although he hasnt spent too much time with cats, we believe he would be just fine with a feline friend. Overall, he is such a sweet pup that deserves a great forever home! He is UTD on shots.\n\nPlease note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee their breed or size potential. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

            "description": "Hello Friends, I'm KEENA. I am a 5/6 year old shepherd mix. I do need to lose some weight to be healthy, but I'm working on it! I do love to go on walks, and everyone says I have good manners on walks. Thinks like noisy trucks and people on bicycles do not seem to bother me. My coat is full of many shades of white, tan, gray, brown and black, and I have no tail! I promise to take treats gently and let you pet me as long as you want; belly rubs are my favorite! I never bark and as much as I love walks, I also love to relax by your feet. I am housebroken and know basic commands. I am gentle with the household cat and children. Ask to meet me today! 27-0089 You can also watch for stories, pictures, and videos about me on JR's Pups-N-Stuff's Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/groups/40103261297/. \n \nAdoption fee: $350\n \nAdoption fees for all dogs/puppies include a $50 refundable training deposit.

Mary is Momma to the Elf litter, and all of her babies were adopted at the end of last year.....now it's Mary's turn!??\n\nMary is a (approximately) 50 pound, 4 year old \"mixed breed\" -- which just means she is a true mutt. Mary had a rough beginning to life from what we can tell, but she is SO forgiving and truly focused on her humans. \n\nMary is a mouthy dog, she nips and nibbles when she wants to be pet or wants attention -- she has never shown an aggressiveness in doing this, but due to this, Mary needs to be in a home with no children. \n\nMary is also a high energy dog, while many of the photos I have of her are of her sleeping, she has recently found entertainment in toys! Frequently, in the mornings (or really after any nap), Mary will run and toss toys to herself -- she does create a little bit of a ruckus, but she is SO cute!",

It has healed with some extra calcification that makes him limp a little (especially first thing in the morning or after he\u2019s been in his crate) but otherwise doesn\u2019t seem to bother him.\n Dylan is a cuddly, easy-going, loveable guy who thinks snow is his personal reward for being such a good boy. He may get a little nervous meeting new people, but gets attached quickly and loves to play and snuggle. \n His old leg injury doesn\u2019t slow him down at all in his quest to get out, explore, and smell the big exciting world. \n\nInterested in this sweet dog? Apply today at http://www.underdogpetrescue.org/dog-application\n\n**Please note: Our animals live in foster homes throughout the Madison area. We do not have a shelter where animals are available for daily viewing. Applying is the first step in our process.**\n\nDogs from Underdog Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\nSpay/Neuter\nRabies, Distemper, and Bordetella Vaccinations (as age appropriate-puppy adopters may need to cover some vaccine boosters)\nHeartworm Test (for dogs over 6mo)\nMicrochip\nDeworming\nHeartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\nAny other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\nOur adult dog adoption fee is $300. Our puppy (under 5 mo) is $375. Our senior dog (over 8 yrs) is $250.\n\n*Please note that all breeds noted are estimates or best guesses. We very rarely have information on our animals' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays*",

He's a chihuahua but might have a little Jack Russell terrier in him, which makes him a little more tenacious than a typical chihuahua.\n\nFinch is best with dogs his size or maybe just slightly larger, and better with Females.  He is a bit competitive with other male dogs.  He is not fond of large dogs so please don't make him live with one. \n\nHe does get along with the resident cats but sometimes he aggressively chases them. \n\nFinch does not like to kiss on the first or second dates so please don't stick your face in his face, unless you want a free nose piercing. \n\nFinch would not be suitable for a home with children or frequent visiting children. \n\nHe has bilateral luxating patellas that occasionally pop in and out.  But he walks just fine 90% of the time \n\nIf you have high furniture or a high bed you must have dog stairs for him to get off without jumping and potentially injuring himself. \n\nFinch is very scared of cars and should absolutely not live in high traffic areas.  This would be an accident waiting to happen if he were to get spooked and get away from his human.  \n\nFinch is not a candidate for off leash dog parks or off leash walking.  \n\nHe is very affectionate and loving.  He absolutely loves his human and is a good listener.  He would prefer to have his own yard that is fenced, even if it is a small yard.  He loves to sleep under the covers.  And he walks well on leash in quiet areas. He's on a special diet that is Royal Canin Hypoallergenic because he does have some food allergies but it's nothing serious. \n\nFinch is a sweetheart and just loves to cuddle with his person, sit on the sofa and watch TV and cuddle in bed at night. \n\nHis adoption fee is 495$\nHe is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, flea treated, dewormed and has an upcoming dental in February. \n\nAn adoption application and home visit is required. \n\nPlease go to our website and submit the online adoption application by copying and pasting this link into your browser\n\nwww.lowermainlandhumanesociety.org/adoption-application/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Once we got the call, we couldn\u2019t say no and our amazing \u201cPuppy Nanny\u201d foster took her in without a second thought!\n\nNow, after successfully raising her puppies and finding all their forever homes, she is ready for her new home herself. This medium-sized love bug is approximately 2 years old and full of love! I mean, check out those ears! Hope LOVES playing fetch and is totally focused on you for training! This smart cookie knows some basic commands and will do anything for a treat! \n\nShe does great with other dogs, but because of her prey drive, she does not do well with chickens. Hope would adapt well to any home, otherwise!\n\nIf you are interested in giving this beautiful girl a forever home, please fill out the application above!",

I am a skittish boy who will need a home ready to show me love! My forever family will need lots of patience. I will need a fence in my new home too! I have made several doggie friends in my foster home but am looking for a feline free space. I have mastered house and crate training. I have been investigating my forever for a while now and I think it begins with you! \n\n\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

This cute boy traveled all the way from the streets of Thailand to find his forever home in the PNW. After years navigating tropical rainy seasons, he is particular about his walks and prefers to stay inside when the weather is bad. Because he\u2019s so used to fending for himself, he can be protective of his things and his people, but he\u2019s very sweet once he knows you. He would do best with a solo adult adopter with no other pets, and an environment where he won\u2019t have to meet a lot of other people. He prefers stuffed animals to real ones and isn\u2019t the best at sharing, but he is very good on leash. If you\u2019re a homebody looking for a small and snuggly dog to join you, consider adopting Lincoln!\n\nLincoln is current on vaccines, neutered and microchipped.",

She would do well in a home as an only dog or with other dogs, and is kid-friendly. We have not tested her with cats yet. Jovie will be spayed soon and will be ready for her forever home once her medical hold is lifted! Crate & house trained.\n\n**Jovie is heartworm positive and will be starting the treatment process shortly. We allow pre-adoption of our heartworm positive dogs while they complete their treatment & crate rest at their foster home 30 days after the heartworm injections**\n\nInterested in adding Jovie to your family? Start the process by filling out an application through the 'More About Us' link to the right or asking us a question about Jovie!",

They are both what we would consider \"flight risks\", so we highly recommend they never be taken off lead outside, or left in a yard unattended. Both girls need time and help in building their confidence, and would be best suited in homes with owners who are patient and experienced with shy dogs. We recommend that they go to an adult only home due to their nervousness, and their ability to dart towards open doors. With patience, love, and time, these girls will no doubt turn into wonderful canine companions.

Sarge originally came to CCR from a rural animal control facility in southern Illinois where he had been found stray. He was adopted but sadly returned several months later when his adopter found that the highrise-apartment-lifestyle was not what was best for Sarge. It's clear from Sarge's behavior that he is used to be an outside dog - he's independent, smart, confident, and friendly. He acts just like a dog who was used to making his own decisions about how he'd spend his days. Moving into the confines and structure of a super urban downtown lifestyle caused Sarge too much stress - he needs a home with some space to stretch his legs, smell the flowers, and enjoy his time outdoors before coming inside for a good snooze and snuggle sesh! Sarge would do well with a home that has a fenced yard and a family that lives a more suburban or rural lifestyle - Sarge is a country boy at heart! He'll do best as an only dog, but he'll bring so much joy that you won't miss having a second pet! Because Sarge does have a strong personality, he's best suited for homes that have previous dog experience. He's a bit too much dog for first-time pet owners.\n\nTo meet Sarge, please submit an application at chicagocaninerescue.org!",

I\u2019m a sweetie who came to Mostly Mutts from animal control in need of cherry eye surgery, and with infected ears making me quite uncomfortable.  Mostly Mutts has treated my ears and I\u2019ve had my cherry eye surgery, so I\u2019m feeling much better and looking great too!\n\n\u2022 OTHER DOGS/CATS/KIDS:  No dogs please as I react negatively to other dogs in an aggressive way / Cat\u2019s unknown / I met a 10-year-old boy and his younger sister at Mostly Mutts and did well with them, so a home with kid friends around that age (10 or slightly younger) could be fun, let\u2019s meet!  But please don\u2019t let kids walk me due to my dislike of other dogs.  \n\n\u2022 PERSONALITY/ENERGY LEVEL:  I am a happy girl who is a shelter favorite \u2013 friendly with all the people I have met.  My sweet, affectionate nature has me resting my head on you and giving you loving kisses. My former foster mom says I was an excellent house guest and companion. I was very calm in the house, and I followed her around and laid by her side while she worked. / My energy level is 3-5.\n\n\u2022 SKILLS/CRATE/POTTY:  I am a student in the Mostly Mutts University training program, where I have already mastered the \u2018sit\u2019, \u2018stay\u2019, \u2018come\u2019, \u2018down\u2019, and \u2018leave it\u2019 commands as well as proper door etiquette and accepting nice strangers without jumping. I walk well on the leash without a lot of distractions. I bet you can teach me even more / My crate manners are good at Mostly Mutts and in my former foster home (I barked a bit if I could hear my foster family in the house). / I\u2019ve had very good potty habits on the shelter schedule and in my former foster home.  \n\n\u2022 LIKES/DISLIKES:  I like spending time with the volunteers who care for me.  I load nicely into the car, so maybe I can accompany you to some fun places where we can spend time together / I don\u2019t like other dogs (see above), and the horses at my former foster home scared me. I also would not be happy if I did not get the love, training and attention all doggies deserve! \n\n\u2022 MEDICAL:  I'm current on vaccinations, micro-chipped and spayed. I had surgery in early January to correct cherry eye in both eyes, and I will need an additional surgery. Mostly Mutts will cover the cost. \n\nI am looking for a loving home where I will be a cherished family member!  My adoption fee is $299.00, and I\u2019m located in Kennesaw, Ga.",

            "description": "Let me introduce myself, my name is Bear. I weigh in at about 20lbs, not too big, not too small... and I'm about 7 years old. The folks here at Green Dog Rescue Project took me out of the local shelter in June of 2015, and I eventually found a great home with a wonderful older gentleman. I lived happily with my guy for the past 4.5 years, then my world turned upside down again. My guy became ill... and eventually he passed away. It was hard losing him, and I felt so lost and uncertain as to my future. His adult children arrived at the home, everyone was so upset. They didn't seem to understand what my routine and schedule was, and I didn't understand why they were packing up all of the things that belonged to my guy. Things that made me feel comfortable and safe. Eventually, the people looked at me and asked \"What are we going to do with you?\" Apparently no one was willing or able to take me in, and because I was feeling more and more nervous and uncertain, I began to act out. I understood they were as upset about losing their dad as I was, but I don't think they understood that \"I\" was upset and confused too. Well, it didn't take long for things to go south... I felt their distress and confusion, and at some point I lost my patience and snapped at one of the ladies trying to grab me. She just moved a little too fast and scared me, I know it was wrong, but I didn't know what else to do. I just reacted. I didn't really hurt her, I was just trying to warn her to slow down and take some time to let me adjust to all these changes. Well, that was the day they returned me to Green Dog Rescue Project. The folks here have given me some time to adjust back into a life I'm familiar with. And I'm ready now to find another home to share with a human. I like other dogs, prefer older men, am not overly anxious to meet new people, and find that I like a simple routine in my life. Perhaps a retired man like the one I had before, with a quiet household and daily walks would be best suited for me. I'm not very comfortable with a lot of company and excitement going on in my home, so an easygoing lifestyle would be most appealing to me. Once we get to know each other, I absolutely LOVE to be with you... your little shadow. Initially, I'm a pain in the behind (just being honest here)... and I don't interview very well... but that is mostly because I'm a bit of an introvert and don't know if I should trust people. If you can give me a few minutes to explore who YOU are before you reach out to grab or pet me, then after that I can be very affectionate, loyal, and a cuddler once I settle in and understand the routine. We just need a little time to get to know one another. If you would like to get to know me, perhaps you could come by for a visit, maybe take me out for a couple of walks, and then take me home for a week long trial.... I'd love to get to know you better too.",

Deacon is very good with going potty outside and is fully crate trained. He loves playing in the snow and running around outside! Deacon loves to cuddle and thinks he is a lap dog, so we are working on boundaries since he still has a lot of growing to do\u2026 But it\u2019s hard to resist his sweet puppy snuggles! Deacon can\u2019t wait to meet his forever family!\"\n\nPlease email us directly for a faster response and we will send you our questionnaire.   info@petsandpeople.com   We get many each day so please watch your spam/trash folders for our replies.\n\nAdoption fee for all dogs and puppies is $130.00 each, which includes spay/neuter, vaccinations (including all puppy boosters for puppies under 4 months), worming, flea/tick treatment if needed, microchip and collar/leash/tags.",

Why this pet is the one for you:Looking for your good Karma for 2021? Look no further! Karma is an affectionate, silly dog who is always down for a snuggle and a treat! She is mellow and doesn't require a ton of physical activity to make her happy (which is great, because she gets nervous around other dogs), so a couple of quiet walks each day or a romp around in the yard will suffice for this gal! Her family will need to provide life-long special care for her skin and ears, which is commonly seen with her breed. In return she will provide snuggles and affection to your heart's content! If you think this lovebug could be your new best friend, click \"Adopt me\" now to start the process!\n\n\n\n Primary Color: Cream Secondary Color: White Weight: 80.5lbs Age: 6yrs 9mths 4wks Animal has been Spayed",

Lacey has a story that is best shared by her foster mom.\n\nMeet Lacey.\n\nWeight: About 70 lbs. (\n\nShe could stand to lose a few pounds but who's counting? )\n\nHealth: HW negative & on preventative. Spayed. Up to date on shots. Some scars.\n\nAge: About 4 or 5 years old.\n\nHousebroken.\n\nCrate trained.\n\nLeash trained but hasn't had much exposure to other humans or animals while on leash.\n\nKnows sit, wait, off, & \"Go to your room [crate].\"\n\nNo cats.\n\nShe hasn't been around small children.\n\nTakes treats gently from your hand.\n\nPersonality: She's a princess and could be an only dog, but plays well with boy dogs.\n\nHappy but easily overexcited & sometimes jealous of other dogs when they receive attention.\n\nShe will guard her food or treats from other dogs but shares toys well.\n\nShe loves shredding stuffed animals!\n\nShe's a very content girl. She's definitely an indoor girl, especially if there's even a hint of rain.\n\nLoves to snuggle on the couch but looks forward to her nightly romp around the backyard chasing a semi-deflated basketball.\n\nPrefers sleeping in the bed with humans but does just fine in the crate.\n\nShe was literally dumped at our house last January - thin, hungry, terrified and had lots of wounds. She's smart. She figured out how to survive and then how to trust. It took some time & a lot of work, but she has turned into a sweet, loving dog.\n\nShe has been around lots of teenagers but rowdiness upsets her.\n\nShe needs someone who will continue to work with her to overcome stranger anxiety.\n\nMore than anything she needs to find her Person. More than anything she wants to belong to someone.\n\nAmazing Grace Bully Rescue is a foster based rescue in the Pensacola, Florida area. We do not have a physical building. If you would like to meet any of our pups, the first step is to fill out our online application so we can contact you.\n\nOur adoption fee for Lacey is $200 and includes her spay, current shots,, rabies vaccine, and a registered microchip.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this Amazing dog, please fill out our online adoption application at www.amazinggracebullyrescue.org\n\nIf you have any questions, please text your question to 723-2037. You may also send a message to our Amazing Grace Bully Rescue Page on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or send an email directly to amazinggracebullyrescue@gmail.com\n\nDisclaimer: We are located in the Pensacola, Florida area and will consider local applicants first, especially with puppies since we use a vet in the local area.",

WATCH MY VIDEO: https://youtu.be/63DzjXB6vaQ\n\nI was hit by a car and left for dead until a Good Samaritan picked me up out of the street and saved my life.  Then, my life got a WHOLE lot better when a rescue took me in and had the surgery done on my leg that I needed so I could walk again.  I am ALL healed up and ready to go to my new home with YOU!  Yes, I have a scar.  Yes, I walk a little funny, but not too much.  Yes, I have to be somewhat careful but, basically, I am ready to rock n' roll. Maybe you have a little something wrong, too, but I promise I will still love you!\n\nThe rescue wants me to have a fenced in yard and they tell me that you need to have an excellent vet history for a current or previous dog.  OK?\n\nI am a Staffy/Black Mouth Cur mix.  (Did you know that Pit/Staffys were used as babysitters during World War II?  If the lady of the house was outside hanging laundry, for instance,  and the children needed her, we would notify the mom that the kids needed her.  Pretty cool, huh?)  I am 1 and 1/2 years old and I weigh 50 pounds. I have been neutered and am up to date on vaccines so I'm ready to go to my new home with YOU!!  Those funny-looking 2-legged creatures said I\u2019m also microchipped \u2013 whatever THAT is.  At any rate, I am fully vetted.  Is that anything close to petted?  I love to be petted!  They say I'm precious.  Hmmm, Is my name Wally or Precious?\n\nWanna hear some more good stuff about me?  OK, here goes.  I like ALL people and ALL dogs.  I am especially good with dogs smaller than I am.  They love me and I love them.  I need to have a smaller DOGGIE SIBLING so we can romp together and burn up lots of energy!   I know basic commands.  I respond very well to consistent, positive reinforcement training and I'm a good learner!  Smart, huh?\n\nI am attentive, affectionate, silly, playful and loyal.  I LOVE cuddles, car rides, and tummy rubs.  I'm an amazing companion!  I still have lots to learn.  I DO know how to use a doggie door. YAY ME!!!  Will you teach me all the things a young rescue dog needs to know to be safe and happy? I LOVE to give kisses so get ready!  \n\nIf you have children, then need to be older children - 12 and up because the rescue doesn't want little kids pulling my tail or squeezing me too tightly or, accidentally, letting me out of a door or gate. \n\nI like to take naps when I'm tired from playing.  I need  love, exercise and couch-sitting when we get tired!  Let's be a team, OK?\n\nIf you would like to take me home (and you know you do), please email rescuedogsgalore@gmail.com and they can get me on my way to a new and loving home!  Once you adopt me, I will be flown to Seattle from Houston, TX.  (Seattle is the only place we can fly to right now.)  My adoption fee is $450 and includes my vetting, neutering, flight cost, travel crate, Health Certificate and a microchip.\n\n",

WATCH MY VIDEO: https://youtu.be/63DzjXB6vaQ\n\nI was hit by a car and left for dead until a Good Samaritan picked me up out of the street and saved my life.  Then, my life got a WHOLE lot better when a rescue took me in and had the surgery done on my leg that I needed so I could walk again.  I am ALL healed up and ready to go to my new home with YOU!  Yes, I have a scar.  Yes, I walk a little funny, but not too much.  Yes, I have to be somewhat careful but, basically, I am ready to rock n' roll. Maybe you have a little something wrong, too, but I promise I will still love you!\n\nThe rescue wants me to have a fenced in yard and they tell me that you need to have an excellent vet history for a current or previous dog.  OK?\n\nI am a Staffy/Black Mouth Cur mix.  (Did you know that Pit/Staffys were used as babysitters during World War II?  If the lady of the house was outside hanging laundry, for instance,  and the children needed her, we would notify the mom that the kids needed her.  Pretty cool, huh?)  I am 1 and 1/2 years old and I weigh 50 pounds. I have been neutered and am up to date on vaccines so I'm ready to go to my new home with YOU!!  Those funny-looking 2-legged creatures said I\u2019m also microchipped \u2013 whatever THAT is.  At any rate, I am fully vetted.  Is that anything close to petted?  I love to be petted!  They say I'm precious.  Hmmm, Is my name Wally or Precious?\n\nWanna hear some more good stuff about me?  OK, here goes.  I like ALL people and ALL dogs.  I am especially good with dogs smaller than I am.  They love me and I love them.  I need to have a smaller DOGGIE SIBLING so we can romp together and burn up lots of energy!   I know basic commands.  I respond very well to consistent, positive reinforcement training and I'm a good learner!  Smart, huh?\n\nI am attentive, affectionate, silly, playful and loyal.  I LOVE cuddles, car rides, and tummy rubs.  I'm an amazing companion!  I still have lots to learn.  I DO know how to use a doggie door. YAY ME!!!  Will you teach me all the things a young rescue dog needs to know to be safe and happy? I LOVE to give kisses so get ready!  \n\nIf you have children, then need to be older children - 12 and up because the rescue doesn't want little kids pulling my tail or squeezing me too tightly or, accidentally, letting me out of a door or gate. \n\nI like to take naps when I'm tired from playing.  I need  love, exercise and couch-sitting when we get tired!  Let's be a team, OK?\n\nIf you would like to take me home (and you know you do), please email rescuedogsgalore@gmail.com and they can get me on my way to a new and loving home!  Once you adopt me, I will be flown to Seattle from Houston, TX.  (Seattle is the only place we can fly to right now.)  My adoption fee is $450 and includes my vetting, neutering, flight cost, travel crate, Health Certificate and a microchip.\n\n",

            "description": "Franklin is a senior dog (the vet estimated between 10-11 years) that has not had an easy life up until now\u2014but he is currently learning about the little joys in life, including zoomies, full/regular meals, in-between snacks, and soft beds and blankets (where he spends most of his day sleeping). \n\nFranklin is mostly blind and deaf so the way to communicate with him is touch, however, he is not fond of being touched or picked up by strangers. He needs a patient and kind adopter that is willing to give him the time that he needs to feel comfortable. Franklin generally is not used to human affection and will not seek it out on his own. He is slowly learning that he does like certain things like ear rubs though (once he is comfortable with you). \n\nFranklin needs a home where no children live or frequently visit. He would do best in a quiet home with other calm, good-natured pets and where someone is home most of the time. He needs frequent potty breaks and will use the bathroom outside every time he is taken out. He will have accidents if he does not get outside frequently enough. It is also important that any stairs in the home can be blocked off so that Franklin does not accidently fall.\n\nWe are on the hunt for the perfect retirement home for Franklin where he can continue to thrive and grow.\n\n**Please note we only do adoptions within 2 hours of Atlanta, GA**\nApproximate age: 10-11 years\nApproximate weight: 9 pounds (currently gaining, should be at least 12)\n\n",

Icarus and Sky lived with the same family their whole lives, but the pandemic took its toll and they were forced to surrender their beloved dogs. Icarus has lived with kids as young as five and his family told us that he's very loving and likes to go for walks. In play group, Icarus greeted other dogs with a waggy tail and had a blast playing in the water and laying down in the pools. He was social and tolerant with other dogs, but we still recommend a meet and greet with any resident dogs. Volunteers say Icarus is a gentle and sweet dog and we just know he'd love to get out of the shelter and into a home. If you want to meet Icarus, make an appointment today.",

The shelter is no place for an older dog and Rosebud deserves to spend her time in a comfy home surrounded by love and affection. She'd love to get out of the shelter and find a family of her own.

            "description": "\"My name is June (June Bug). I have been with my current family for almost a year. In that time, I have learned basic manners, where it's appropriate to potty, and to love my crate. I am about 3 years old and 30lbs. I'm learning to be more independent, but sometimes get anxious when I'm alone. I am incredibly active - I love walks, playing tug, and chasing the ball. I need to be the ONLY DOG in the house as I can be temperamental. Cats are okay - they make me curious, but also can be a bit scary. New humans can also make me nervous but, with time, I will cuddle up with anyone. I'm looking for a patient, caring, and active individual to share my days with, take me on adventures, and love me for forever.\" She has not spent time around children, so older or no children at this time.\n**\nThank you for your interest in our rescues ! Events most every weekend to meet some. All may be met by appointment w/ approved application. Facebook posts who will attend (currant week).\u00a0 Available dogs, donation button(we are non-profit) & links to adopt/volunteer  www.lovemuttsrescue.org . We will email you our process & fees.

            "description": "CHLOE \u2013 7 Year Old Black Female Lab   70 lbs     Spayed\n \nBackground:\nChloe was surrendered to the Ukiah shelter as her current owners did not have time for her with their third child on the way and she was currently not doing well with the small dogs in the home. Her story over the last 5 years goes like this: She was purchased from a breeder in the Gridley area and they had her two years, but they felt like they could not keep up with a young active Lab. They took her to the Gridley shelter, and she was rescued for the current owner\u2019s grandson. They had the dog for 2 years and they ended up getting a divorce. (When Chloe was in the home, they had no issues with Chloe.) Chloe then went to the Ex-Daughter in law who kept her for 1 year but had to give her up as Chloe kept getting out of the yard; she had low fences. (She did not have any issues with Chloe other than getting out of the yard.) She then went to the daughter who had her for 2 years. Chloe did great in the home and would sit by her feet while she worked from home. She was a big part of the family but the last 6 months she started to have some issues. They had two small dogs in the home and Chloe would pick them up and shake them. She also ended up catching one of the chickens and killing the chicken. She was around other larger dogs with this family and did not have any issues. Chloe was not getting regular exercise with this family as they did not have time. They then took her to the Ukiah shelter who reached out to GGLRR to see if we could pull her and find her a GREAT home.\n \nWhat Chloe\u2019s foster says: \nChloe is the best dog. She is a total love who loves belly rubs, cuddles and being around her people. She is fantastic in doors and will settle in any room you are in. She even knows \u201cout\u201d for out of the kitchen and will lay down in our family room while we eat, though she would love to sit under us waiting for a morsel to drop.  She knows sit, stay, shake for commands and sits at the back door when she needs to use the bathroom which is not very often. When we leave for short periods of time she goes in her crate and at night she sleeps in our room on her bed. On walks she pulls a little on the leash but corrects quickly. We are working on heel which she is getting good at. She can walk by other dogs but needs to be heeling next to you. She doesn\u2019t like other dogs in her space and she will let them know but she won\u2019t go after another dog aggressively. She would really like to chase squirrels or cats on walks but as long as you are attentive and she knows you are in control as soon as her ears perk up and you say no and put her in check she leaves it. I don\u2019t feel like she would like the dog park. We go out for a walk about 1.5 to 2 miles and a bit of fetch in the morning and we usually play in our backyard in the afternoon or if we feel like she needs a bit more exercise or to release some energy we go on a short late afternoon walk. \n\nChloe is fine around kids but would most likely do better around older kids. She rides great in the car and is a mellow and sweet girl.\n \n \nWhat Chloe\u2019s Rescue Rep says: \nChloe is a great dog and deserves to find her last home! Chloe needs exercise and a home that will be her leader and not let her lead. She loves people and they said she was very sweet to older people. \n\nShe is housetrained, loves the water, enjoys running and playing fetch. She may dig if left alone in the backyard; most dogs will if they are bored. The previous owners describe her as friendly, playful, loves people and picks up things quickly. She may jump up to greet you and she could use better leash manners. She should not be in a home with another dog and a home with cats. \n\nExercise is key for Chloe! The shelter tested her with a variety of dogs, and she did not have any issues and they felt she is a dog that will not go out of her way to create any issues.\n \nMedical: \nChloe has no health issues. She is spayed, up to date on her shots, heartworm negative and is microchipped. I spoke to the previous owners and they did not have any health issues with her.\n \nChloe is currently located in: \nBrentwood\n \nIf you are interested in adopting Chloe, please contact Rescue Rep Liz at liz@jobshopsf.com\n \n",

The sweetest, saddest, most shy girl was surrendered to an area animal control because they had too many animals. Her world was rocked. She would pancake or bolt if there were any quick movements near her, new people made her back away, and no amount of treats would make her change her mind. With time and lots of patience she did warm up to a few staff members. When one of our experienced foster families fell for her preciousness and went to meet her the unbelievable happened...she warmed up to him almost instantly and took treats he was offering! ? She literally picked the people that would help her shine! \nPlease help us welcome the newest member of the CTP family...Zelda! \nMore info as she settles in.",

I'm Chopper, a handsome, 4 year old, male American Bulldog. I was adopted from Animal Ark 3 years ago and everything was just great. But then a new family member moved in and is allergic to dogs, so I'm looking for a new place to take up residence. I walk well on leash and really enjoy those walks, too. It takes me some time to warm up to men, as I prefer the company of females. I was good with other dogs, but if you already have a dog, a meet and greet would be in order. I have no experience with cats and lived with older children. I know commands like \"sit\" and \"lay down\" and I'm housebroken, too! I sure would like to find my new people soon.",

She is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A3977607.\n\nHaylee has been at the shelter for over 60 days now and it's time for her to go home! She wants to go home too! When volunteers take Haylee for a walk and she sees the parking lot of the shelter, she pulls towards it because she's ready to get in the car. Haylee is a sweet girl that loves her treats and knows how to \"sit\" and \"shake\". She pulls on the leash when she first gets out of her kennel to go for a walk but calms down once she gets into her walk. She hasn't reacted to any other dogs in the kennels when she's being taken out or when she sees another dog on the walking trail. She watches and wags her tail and continues her walk.\n\nHaylee was in a home for over a year and she is potty trained. The owner did tell us that she doesn't like children, loud noises like rain and going to the vet. She has to have a dog introduction if a potential adopter already has dogs at home. She cannot go to a home with children or if children visit the home. Haylee is such a great dog! If you think she would be a good fit in your home, please come and meet her today!\n\nIf you are interested in saving this pet, please reach out via this link: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/BPAZ/Dog\n\nTo actually visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show, and we have seen that you can generally show up and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog and the shelter will squeeze you in, except from 12-3PM or closer to the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

He is so full of love and life and wants all the attention.  He loves squeaky toys and dog beds and anything that will entertain him! He was in a loving home most of his life but his previous owners gave him away once they were placed in a nursing home and could not keep him anymore.  Poor Tucker.  He was not surrendered for any fault of his or his previous owners.  They then gave him to a young girl who promise to keep and love him forever but this ended up not happening.  She had Tucker for 6 months and did nothing with him at all.  Then when she had to move she needed to rehome him which is how he ended up with us.  He was severely matted and needed a dental badly.  We were able to get him all cleaned up and groomed, dental done on him, he tested heartworm negative but new adopters will need to keep him on heartworm preventative and retest again in 6 months, and now we are trying to find his forever home.  We definitely want a family that will love him unconditionally until his last day.  If you think you might be the best fit for him, email us at LongJ1003@aol.com and Katybug6067@gmail.com.",

I would definitely need a home with older kids. I would be just too much for the youngsters. I am very smart too! I know some basic commands like \"sit\". I am food motivated so I'm sure with some training I could learn so much more. I will also need to learn better leash manners. I am a hyper boy by nature, so please just be patient with me while I learn. I would not do well in a home with cats. If you have any other dogs at home then I will need to meet them first. If you are looking for an active companion, a hiking buddy, or a walking/running partner, come in and meet me! I'll be here waiting for you!",

            "description": "Hi, I'm Ollie. I am a 6 year old, 13 lbs Terrier/Pomeranian mix. Everyone says I am the cutest little guy with my scruffy face. I am looking for a quiet home where I will be your one and only.  Most of the time, I am fine with other dogs, but I will growl if another dog wants attention from my person. So I will need a home where I can be the center of your love and affection without needing to share. I also need a home without children. Young children can be loud and move quickly and that makes me feel uncomfortable.\n\nI will  need a home in a quiet neighborhood. A fenced in yard would be wonderful as I love to run and play. I am not a city dog and would not do well in an apartment/busy complex/neighborhood.\n I can feel nervous meeting new people, so I will need time and patience when meeting unknown people and when in new situations. I am neutered and up to date on vaccinations and grooming. I walk well on a leash and currently use a 10 ft lead when using the bathroom.\n\nI am not big on traveling. I prefer to stay home except when riding to and from the groomer and/or veterinarian. When traveling on long trips, I get very nervous and will need to be snuggled. Finding  a house sitter or flexibly boarding would be the best option for me when my owner plans a long trip. I do not like to be crated but luckily I do not need to be. I have free roam of the house and do well when I am alone. \n\nI am fostered in Mechanicsville, MD. If you are looking for a loyal and devoted best friend, please go to puppypawsrescue.org\n and fill out an application for Ollie. I'll be here waiting for you!\n\nNote: Our rescue requires that all adopter's current and prior animals are up-to-date on vaccinations (DHLPP & Rabies)  and preventatives (heartworm and flea and tick), unless there is a medical reason not allowing it. All animals in your household should be spayed or neutered unless medically indicated that they should not be or are currently still too young.",

I was found by a nice family who kept me for a while trying to find my owners. Well after much \"trying\" to locate my family they even thought about keeping me. It just became too much so they brought me to the shelter so I could find a great new home.  I have all of my vaccinations, I am heartworm negative, I have a microchip, and I have been neutered. I am a really nice boy that would love to have a home and family again! Could you help me find that perfect home?",

            "description": "Zion is an 8 month old AKC Siberian Husky pup with lots of love for a forever family.  Those of you who still love the outdoors even in our cold MN winter months, this guy is for you!  He loves being outside, sniffing around in the snow, and playing with other dogs, and getting affection and love from his people.\n\nZion has tons of potential and is learning a lot in foster care.  Unfortunately he was not trained & always given his way the first 8 months of his life so we are working on reversing some of those bad habits and establishing boundaries.  He is currently working on his recall, leave it, drop, stay, and place among many other things!  Due to his size and the training that needs to continue for him he would likely be best in a home without small children.  \n\nWe are looking for a home for Zion that is a strong leader and motivated to continue his training which will create an unbreakable bond with a new dog. \n\n\n_______________\nBold Animal Advocates is a holistic animal rescue who utilizes natural alternatives to traditional dog preventatives, medications, and vaccination when available & also feeds an optimal raw food diet. While not required to continue, preference will go to those willing to continue care holistically.\n\nWe value training and our dogs being well behaved members of our community so continued training for all of our dogs for the remainder of their lives is required.  \n\nWe have recommendations on our website  for companies that we love and trust if you would like suggestions.\nboldanimaladvocates.com\n\n***Please apply here***\nhttps://forms.gle/g5EKPNw8steM2roo7\n\nWe will review applications for and reach out to those who we think may be a perfect fit to discuss next steps.  Please note that during this time we may be unable to respond to email & phone inquiries so the best way to reach us will be by applying.  We are required to charge sales tax on this adoption fee of 7.125% and accept cash, check, or Paypal at the time of adoption.  Thank you!",

            "description": "\"You Ain't Nuthin' But a Hound Dog.\" WRONG! Sheldon is so much more than a hound dog! He's an amazing guard dog when he doesn't know someone. Never any worry of home intrusion with this big guy's bark. And yet he's as gentle as a lamb with barky 10 lb chihuahuas that want to boss him around. Sheldon loves 'his people' and would love to have a forever home of his very own! Complete an application to meet Sheldon -- we'll bring him to your home for a visit.\n\nDogs in our foster care program are:\n\nspayed/neutered\n\nmicrochipped\n\nup to date on all vaccinations\n\nnegative for heartworms and on regular heartworm preventative OR recently treated for heartworms and on regular heartworm preventative (It can take up to 6 months for a dog to test negative for heartworm after treatments. We will provide you all the medical documentation regarding the pet's treatment.)\n\nNOT IN A SHELTER FACILITY. They are in loving foster care homes where they have received training and socialization to help them fit into your home more quickly. Therefore we schedule appointments in advance and do not have a general facility where you can view multiple dogs at one time.\n\nNote about Breeds:\n\nWe do NOT do DNA tests on the dogs in our program. Many are found as puppies or young adults and we do not have any information about their parents. We select dog breed mixes based on recommendation from shelter staff and/or veterinarians and our experience in working with thousands of dogs. We consider the physical and behavioral traits of the dog as well as their size. If you are looking for a purebred dog and want to argue with us about breed standards, we encourage you to work with breed specific rescue organizations. If you are looking for a dog who have great personalities despite a mixed background (like most of us humans!), we'd love to work with you!\n\nThere are a few steps to set up the adoption.\n\nComplete the\nAdoption Application\nonline. Many dogs receive multiple applications and we review applications in the order they are received.\n\nFoster will review your application and reach out to you to schedule a \"virtual meet and greet\".\n\nParticipate in a \"virtual meet and greet\".\nThis is a great way for you to get to see the dog in a setting where it is already comfortable and get lots of questions answered to determine if the dog's personality and energy level are a good fit.\nThis is also a great time to have a virtual \"home visit\" to show the fence, home, etc to minimize the amount of time the foster would need to come into your home later.\n\nThe foster and adoption coordinator will review the applications and notes from the virtual meet and greets and set up in person home visits with the applicants we feel are the best match for the dog's personality and energy level.\n\nTrial Adoption -dogs are eligible for a trial adoption with the adopter that we feel is the best match. Trial adoptions last up to 3 nights and the foster will provide 3 days worth of food, information about the dog's schedule, and other tips and tricks to make it a successful transition. The adopt fee can be paid online as a deposit to start the trial adoption. If the dog is not the right fit, we refund the adoption fee.\n\nAs a 100% volunteer-powered organization, we appreciate your patience as we review the applications.",

He has made a ton of progress but needs a forever family to keep it going. Donavon will not be placed with small children and he must have at least one other confident playful dog. His new family needs to realize he is a work in progress and he may never be a dog who wants to be pet or snuggle on the couch with you. Donavon will allow us to bath him, clip his nails and put a harness on him. He doesn't love it but he lets us do it. He is currently working with a trainer and is doing great. He will approach you for food. He is really enjoying his walks as long as they are not on a busy street or where people want to approach him to touch him. applications can be found at www.perfectimperfections.wiki.  Please do not apply if you are not serious about putting hard work into setting up Donavon for success. He is a beautiful boy who really wants to be a part of a family he just isnt there yet and his progress can take a long time.",

Our application process includes landlord approval and vet checks. Please make sure all of your information is current and accurate, including a valid email address and phone numbers. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and/or cancel your application.  We strive to process all applications in a timely manner, but with the high volume of applications we are receiving, it is taking anywhere from 1-3 weeks.  You may be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions.  Once all of your information is reviewed and if your application is approved, you will be notified via email.  Submitting an application and receiving an approval does not guarantee you will be adopting the dog you applied for.  Once you move to the meet and greet process, you will be contacted by the foster family to further discuss the dog, and answer questions you may have, and if applicable, a meet and greet will be set up at our adoption center.   Meet and greets are only set up with approved applicants, and we require all members in the household to be present, as well as any current dogs in the home. \n\nCurrent Adoption Fees Are:\n$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nBonded pairs vary\n\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test, (if over 6  months) and a certified veterinary inspection. Please be aware, listed dog breeds are based on information provided and cannot be guaranteed.  Submitting an application for a particular dog does not guarantee that you will be the applicant chosen, we receive several applications for each dog. Our adopters are picked based on the needs of the dog, and the home we feel with best fit based on your responses to our application, vet information and landlord requirements.   Approved applicants not chosen for the dog you applied for, will be in active status for a period of six months.  We encourage you to watch Petfinder, Facebook and our website for upcoming dogs.  Should you see a dog that interests you, please send us a Facebook message or an email with your approval number.  Please be patient with us, as Lucky Mutts Rescue is run strictly by volunteers and many of us work full time jobs, have families and also foster dogs. Thank you for considering Lucky Mutts Rescue for your next furry family member!",

Be prepared to listen to his adorable snoring when he falls asleep next to you! Vito adores being with people and has a big smile to prove it. He enjoys playing and fetching toys. In secured fenced-in areas, he does great off-leash and has a wonderful recall.  Vito had lived with other dogs previously; he seems to prefer mellower dogs that won\u2019t jump all over him. \nVito is roughly 5 years young, and weighs 63 pounds. He is a strong dog, but is learning to walk politely on leash and exhibit manners with people. Overall he is a big mush! Vito will be undergoing ear surgery on Feb 12th; afterwards he will have limited hearing but he\u2019ll feel so much better! Recovery care is minimal and he should be fully recovered 2-3 weeks post-surgery. \nFor dogs undergoing medical treatments, we offer foster-to-adopt to families interested in a dog. Vito will receive the surgery at Gigi\u2019s by one of our veterinarians and the cost is covered by Gigi's. If you are interested in Vito, please email us at adopt@gigis.org\n",

We think Titus is a Husky/Lab mix but we aren't 100% sure what he's mixed with. He appears to be a pretty happy boy, he wags his tail and greets us whenever we see him. Titus did just come in yesterday, so we are still working to get to know him and will update as we can! From what we can tell so far, he does well with cats and other dogs, but we will investigate this farther as we are able. Titus likes to be loved on and likes our treats so far too! We really recommend bringing your other dogs to meet him if you are able; it is important to see how they get along before taking him home. Titus' previous owners did tell us that he was potty trained as well as crate trained and so far that seems to be true. Titus is neutered and is current on his vaccines. If you would like to be Titus' forever home please contact us at 308-352-2630 or pcanimalshelter@live.com.",

            "description": "Let us show you Scotch - a sweet and curious guy who loves treats, going for walks, car rides, and chasing frisbees! \n\nScotch was transferred to us from another shelter, and they stated that he was always excited and super friendly when meeting new people! He loves attention, belly rubs, and snuggling! He even is a great co-pilot in the car, and has good manners when in a home. He does pull on his leash when excited, it's only because he wants to do his own thing and explore the world as much as possible! He would benefit from a harness while walking, and some additional leash training in his new home! \n\nHis previous shelter stated that he loves female dogs and is selective with male dogs, so Scotch would like to meet any potential adopters and their canine companions before heading home! Scotch seems to have high prey drive and is a bit too interested in cats/small animals - he will need a home without small pets. Scotch has also seemed uncomfortable around children he has met at the shelter, and would prefer to meet any new family members to ensure he will be compatible for the home. \n\nScotch has been treated for heartworm disease. THS requires all adopters of heartworm positive dogs to purchase a 1 year supply of heartworm preventative at the time of adoption.\n\nPlease follow this link to learn more about our current adoption process: https://toledohumane.org/covid-19-update",

            "description": "Meet Louis Vitton! \n\nHow on earth is this sweet beautiful puppy still available? Louis vitton has been in Wisconsin for 3 weeks and has had very little interest for furever homes. He just can\u2019t understand why. Yes he is a black pup and yes he is probably part pit-but those aren\u2019t his fault. He is sweet and spunky and has endless love and kisses to give! He is mostly potty trained. He does great in a crate while his humans are gone for work and keeps his cage dry. His favorite place to sleep is in bed with humans-but how can you tell that sweet little face no?! Louie hasn\u2019t met a soul he doesn\u2019t love-cats, dogs, big and little humans. He really is the whole package! If interested in adopting this sweet boy apply through mapawsmepetrescue.com.\n\nInterested in meeting Louis Vitton? \n\nAll Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue dogs are in homes with foster families; we do not have a shelter where dogs are available for daily viewing.\n\nOur process is as follows:\n1.  Review our policies and adoption radius  on our website: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n2.  Submit an application for review and approval;\n3.  MPM Rescue reviews application and checks vet records and references;\n4.  MPM foster contacts approved applicant(s) to arrange a home check and meeting with available dog(s);\n5.   If there is a good fit, adoption is completed with a contract and fees (payable via check or cash).\n\nThe adoption fee is listed here: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n\nDogs from Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Age appropriate vaccinations\n- Heartworm test (for dogs over 6mo) and treatment if positive\n- Microchip\n- Deworming\n- Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\n- Any other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\n*Please note that the identified breed(s) are best guesses. We very rarely have information on our dogs' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays.*",

I don\u2019t know exactly how it happened, but I was injured and a Good Samaritan picked me up by the road!  I guess I had been hit by a car. Anyway my new friend took me to the vet! They fixed me up by repairing my hip! Yep I am good as new!  They tried to find me a new home, but didn\u2019t have any luck. They knew at the shelter lots more people would be able to see me and I would have a much better chance of getting adopted. So here I am! Ready to find a new family and have a fresh start in life!  I have all of my vaccinations, I am heartworm negative, I have a microchip, and I have been neutered. I would like to thank my kind rescuer who picked me up from the side of the road and took me to the vet. Thanks to the doctors at Carriage Hills who made my hip \u201call better!\u201d I am a one-year-old terrier mix. Now all I need is a new family to love for the rest of my life!",

            "description": "Maizy is a four year old female bloodhound. This tan, droopy-eared girl weighs around 85 lbs. Maizy was used as a breeder before being abandoned last year. She has been in a foster home learning what it means to be a member of a family. Maizy\u2019s fosters have multiple other large dogs and she has also been around a small dog. She has done well with kids during meet and greets too. Maizy would love to find an owner committed to keeping her healthy and happy. Her fosters say \u201cshe loves to run in the yard and then come inside to be a couch potato.\u201d To adopt Maizy, complete an application at ITVrescue.org.\n\nAll of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heartworm tested and treated if necessary.\n\nPlease realize that many of our animals are kept in foster homes. Please complete an adoption application at http://itvrescue.org/adoption-application/ in order to meet with one of our animals. There is no obligation in completing the application, but it helps us find an animal that is most appropriate for your family.  The ITV Rescue Center is open Tuesdays 12-5; Wednesdays 12-7; Thursdays 12-5; Fridays 12-5 and Saturdays 10-5.  The Rescue Center is located at 1417 N. Stockwell Road.  You are welcome to come to our rescue center during open hours to see all of our great adoptable animals. Thank you for your interest in our animals!\n\nNOTE: Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

She is spayed and microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. To meet Nala or to be added to her waitlist, call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the DOG'S NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A GOOD PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org.

Maisie is still trying to put the past behind her but she is over the moon being around so many kind humans now. She is super cute when she carries her stuffed animals down the hall. She will brighten your day with all her sunshine. One thing she quickly embraced when she was rescued was Pupperoni! Will work for treats! Maisie requires a single dog home, but she can be walked out and about without issue. She will need a bit of time to decompress from the shelter and to learn that being inside a home means only good things. We have information to share to help you navigate her adjustment. It will be a rewarding adventure if you are up to the challenge. Come and meet Maisie! No dogs.",

IF YOU MEET OUR CRITERIA FOR ADOPTION OF THIS DOG, PLEASE FOLLOW THE LINK TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE PROFILE TO COMPLETE OUR APPLICATION. THANK YOU!\n\nThis sweet little one is estimated to be about 3 years old. She weighs 7.5lbs. \n\nWe don\u2019t know what happened to Jemma, but she came in to the county shelter with visible scars on her head and some damage to one eye. Luckily, the injuries did not affect her vision, but the trauma has made her a bit sensitive. She is scared when meeting any new person, but once she loves and trusts, Jemma loves her person intensely. \n\nJemma should not go to a home with cats or kids because she is afraid of them, but she absolutely must have a small dog companion who is under 8 years old in the home. This is what gives her confidence. Jemma can't live in an apartment or condo because the way she greets her person is with a very high pitched shrieking sound. Something neighbors will not likely appreciate. She's a sensitive little girl and would do best with a quiet home. Low stress is her ideal life (ours too!)\n\n\nAdoption Process: We are not first come first served. Indigo Rescue focuses on finding good matches between dogs and families to ensure life long adoptions. We deliver all dogs to their new homes. All of our dogs are in foster homes. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in meeting one of our dogs, please use the following link and complete our Adoption Application. You can either scan your completed application and email it to us at: info@indigorescue.org, or you can fax it to us at: 888-502-7660.\nThe link is not live, so you will need to copy and paste it into your browser: https://storage.googleapis.com/gator-users/user-680788/documents/d1742bff02e44c2ea25649cb45df5103/Pet%20Application%20Form%20December%202020.pdf\nIf the dog you're interested in seems compatible with your lifestyle we'll set up a time for you to meet the dog privately.\nPLEASE NOTE: Indigo Rescue only adopts to homes within 30 miles of Beaverton because our volunteers deliver all of our dogs to their adoptive homes. We work very hard to create a family of our Indigo Rescue adopters because we want to be close enough to help in case there are any problems. We want everyone to be happy and successful!\n\n**ALL of our dogs and puppies come vaccined to their age, spayed/neutered and microchipped.\n\nThank you for your interest in adopting and saving a life.",

Our application process includes landlord approval and vet checks. Please make sure all of your information is current and accurate, including a valid email address and phone numbers. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and/or cancel your application.  We strive to process all applications in a timely manner, but with the high volume of applications we are receiving, it is taking anywhere from 1-3 weeks.  You may be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions.  Once all of your information is reviewed and if your application is approved, you will be notified via email.  Submitting an application and receiving an approval does not guarantee you will be adopting the dog you applied for.  Once you move to the meet and greet process, you will be contacted by the foster family to further discuss the dog, and answer questions you may have, and if applicable, a meet and greet will be set up at our adoption center.   Meet and greets are only set up with approved applicants, and we require all members in the household to be present, as well as any current dogs in the home. \n\nCurrent Adoption Fees Are:\n$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nBonded pairs vary\n\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test, (if over 6  months) and a certified veterinary inspection. Please be aware, listed dog breeds are based on information provided and cannot be guaranteed.  Submitting an application for a particular dog does not guarantee that you will be the applicant chosen, we receive several applications for each dog. Our adopters are picked based on the needs of the dog, and the home we feel with best fit based on your responses to our application, vet information and landlord requirements.   Approved applicants not chosen for the dog you applied for, will be in active status for a period of six months.  We encourage you to watch Petfinder, Facebook and our website for upcoming dogs.  Should you see a dog that interests you, please send us a Facebook message or an email with your approval number.  Please be patient with us, as Lucky Mutts Rescue is run strictly by volunteers and many of us work full time jobs, have families and also foster dogs. Thank you for considering Lucky Mutts Rescue for your next furry family member!",

I like to play in the yard with people and other dogs, and I like to go on walks (though I might need a bit more leash training). I like playing with enrichment toys, like puzzle feeders, treat dispensing toys, and kongs, and I love learning new things! I'm very friendly, and I love people! I hope to find a fun and energetic family who will play with me I also like to play with other dogs, but they have to be super nice to me, otherwise my feelings get hurt and I run away. \n\nTo find out more about me you can fill out a pre-adoption survey on our website, then email it to us. Then, call (816) 325-7207 (ext.2) and ask to make an appointment for a digital meeting! I can't wait to meet you!\n\nhttps://www.ci.independence.mo.us/AnimalServices/AdoptableAnimals",

We aren't sure what happened to her before landing in a safe place but we can tell that someone has been mean to her in the past- she is very shy meeting new people and will need a home with a confident dog who can teach her the ropes and an adult only home that has experience with scared and shut down dogs to give her the time and the patience to come out of her shell! She is SUPER playful and loves having dog friends to play and cuddle with! She will do best in a home with kids 8 and up. Her adoption fee is $295 and that includes she is spayed, microchipped, and up to date on all vaccines, flea/tick treatments, and heartworm preventative.

He would do best with older children as he likes to steal little kids' food thinking it is his. His previous owner said that he did fine with smaller dogs but didn't like bigger dogs, though we have not been able temperament test him so we are unsure if this is accurate. He would do best in a home without cats. He keeps a clean kennel too! Get your application in for this handsome boy!\n\nAsher is up to date on his vaccinations and is neutered. His adoption fee is $400. For any other questions or to request an adoption application please email Donna at djerickson1@hotmail.com.",

I have finished my heart worm treatment and am now ready to go to my forever home! I'm from the south but have adjusted to the cold and snow nicely. My favorite things to do are sniffing you and have you hold my paw. I'm a really good dog and just want to please my people. I'm a very good listener and am really smart so I pick up things very quickly. I'm quiet and don't bark much at all. Though I will sometimes bark when I see dogs on our walks, but we are working on that. I love to walk so I can sniff, sniff, sniff. I also have been running with my foster mom which I'm getting better at. I'm just a real chill dog.\n\nOne thing I'm working extra hard on is my separation anxiety while you are away, I don't like being left alone and will bark. So I need a family that is patient with me as I settle in and will continue to work with me on this. I will not be able to live in a home where there are shared wells, such as an apartment or town home. I would also need a home where I wasn't left alone too often and in the instances where I am left, I need a nice sturdy crate, such as a no break kennel or an Alkatraz kennel, as I've been known to escape. I do like my crate when I can see you and that is where I keep my toys and where I get all my special bones and treats. I can't wait to sniff/meet you.\nInterested in adopting this lovable animal? Please go to our website www.wagsmn.org and fill out an Adoption Application. Once the application is processed, a Wags representative will contact you, answer any questions you may have, and set up a time/location for a meet and greet! A home visit is required prior to adoption.\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt!\n\nBreed and temperament determination: Wags & Whiskers Animal Rescue attempts to determine breed and temperament using a combination of looks, information provided to us at intake, and our experience with the animal while in our Rescue. We do not guarantee this determination.",

I also have a micro chip.  I am in a foster home and my foster family thinks I am great and would make a great addition to your family. If you are looking for a golden girl that is a one-of-a-kind senior  I am yours! Please go to www.mobilespca.org and complete an online adoption application and someone from the office will give you a call and set up an appointment for you to meet me.\n\nADOPTION FEE: $150\n7 Years Old\nHeart Worm Negative \n10 Pounds\n\n\n\nABOUT OUR PETS: All of our pets available for adoption have been spayed/neutered, tested for heartworms, given age-appropriate vaccinations, microchipped and are on flea and heartworm preventative medication.\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS: To give each dog the best possible home we require a completed Adoption Application.  Screening and approval by our Adoption Coordinators and a home visit  may be required to make sure  this pet fits into your home and the home fits our pet.\n\nCONTACT US:If you would like  to give this dog a good home please call the Mobile SPCA office at 251-633-3531 or drop by our Adoption Center located at 620 Zeigler Circle W, Mobile, AL 36608 - Tuesday through Friday from 9 a.m.  to 5:30 p.m. and Thursday and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.\n\nCAN'T ADOPT?  SPONSOR OR DONATE!</strong> </strong>This wonderful animal is just one of many in our care right now. Your sponsorship helps us provide shelter, food, and tender loving care for the animals until they find new loving homes. Adoption fees do not cover our expenses, so your sponsorship will make a positive impact on our organization and especially on our animals\u2019 well being. Please note: we are not a chapter or affiliate of any national animal organization. We are, moreover, very grateful for your generosity.\n\nThank you!",

She was surrendered when she was too much for the family to care for, and will certainly need an active home to finish up her basic obedience training and give her LOTS and LOTS of playtime! She is super active and playful and will need a family with a personality to match! She is still jumpy and puppylike, and would be best in a home with children 12 and older. Unfortunately she will need a home without small dogs or cats. She can be picky with her dog friends but we think she hasn't had a lot of dog to dog socialization and with time she will learn to make friends in a calmer manner- she's just a ball of energy! Her adoption fee is $295 and that includes she is spayed, microchipped, and up to date on all vaccines, flea/tick treatments, and heartworm preventative.

They are about 9 months old and weigh about 45 pounds.  They are neutered, up to date on their shots, healthy and happy.  They are bonded and need to be adopted together.  They are calm and polite and well behaved dogs.  They are fully house trained and love to run around the foster's yard.  They enjoy their walks and don't pull on the leash unless they spot a squirrel.  They hang out on the sofa or dog beds and enjoy being part of a family.  Preference will be to folks with sighthound experience and a fenced in yard.  Any children in the home need to be over age 8.  Salukis make wonderful companions and are just so expressive and happy and loyal.

I am very interested in what you have to say, I tilt my head and try to understand what you are saying, I'm very eager to learn new things. I'd do better in a home with kids that are around 7 or older, the little ones make me a bit nervous. I like other dogs and I'd need to meet any other dogs that are in the home before I can leave. I walk well on a leash and I do know sit. I do not do well with cats or livestock. I'm just an all around happy go lucky guy. If you are looking for a guy like me come on in and meet me so we can get going!",

Then they decided to give him another chance, well that didn't work and they gave up on him and brought him back.\nHe is super confused and is looking for a committed FUREVER home!  Bubbie is an Australian shepherd blue heeler mix, and is birthday is 12/01/19.\nIf you are interested in meeting him please call the shelter (520) 458-4151 to schedule an appointment. \n",

Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nGracie is a very active and energetic 1 year-old Lab/Border Collie mix who loves nothing more than tennis balls and playing fetch! You'd be hard-pressed to find a dog who's more into that than this friendly girl. She was an owner surrender at an overcrowded county dog shelter because her family was moving and couldn't take her along. Gracie certainly isn't letting the fact that she's looking for a new home get her down. She made the trip to Canine Lifeline so she could enjoy life in a foster home while searching for that new home and continues to have fun wherever she goes. Gracie gets along well with other dogs but doesn't necessarily need to have a canine buddy in her new home as long as she has tennis balls and someone to throw them for her. She would love having a yard with an aboveground fence so she could safely chase the ball to her heart's content. Gracie is quite strong on a leash so is going to need work on her leash manners. She does better with a harness so that's recommended as she works on her leash skills. Gracie has done well with crate-training in her foster home and may be housetrained too although we can't guarantee it. She is very food-motivated and can catch treats on the fly like a pro. She will also sit on command and eager to learn lots more with her new family. If you've got a great throwing arm and are looking for an active young dog who loves to have fun, Gracie just might be your girl! Gracie weighs about 50 pounds and her adoption fee is $350. She's spayed, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Gracie. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Gracie and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

            "description": "Penny is a short and stout Terrier x Hound mix that weighs about 40 pounds. She is an active, outgoing, playful, and overall peppy little pup that is looking for a fur-ever home! She is good with other dogs but definitely likes dogs that are her level of energy to play with! Due to her activeness, a home with children 12 and up would be ideal (as she may knock some children over in her excitement!). She needs a home with the time and ability to give her lots of physical and mental stimulation- she loves adventures, new places, and new sights! Her adoption fee is $295 and that includes she is spayed, microchipped, and up to date on all vaccines, flea/tick treatments, and heartworm preventative. If you are interested in adopting any of our animals please fill out an application on our website www.lastchanceranch.org Primary Color: Tan Secondary Color: White Age: 2yrs 0mths 3wks",

He was originally brought to PACC by an animal protection officer and was pretty intimidated at first- the shelter can be a scary place, and no one reminded him that he's a big old beefball that doesn't need to be afraid. Theo has realized that things aren't so bad here and his personality has started to shine (but he still isn't interested in staying here for too long). Theo is young and energetic, and would do great with an active family who will give him plenty of attention and play time. He may do best as an only pet, but he promises he'll be enough!

I am a lowkey dog who does enjoy a mixture of playing and lounging. It will take me a little to bond to you at first because I have been here so long, but once I do, I can not get enough of my human friends! I AM A VOLUNTEER FAVORITE! I am currently accepting scheduled adoption visits. If you're interested in meeting me to see if we are a match, then please email my friends @ sjadopt@sanjoseca.gov ; I am accepting appointments on a first available, first serve basis. When you email please include my ID # A1194315 your name, phone number, and date(s) and time(s) you're available to visit me. Love, goose 11/16/20 19:04 Reason animal needs rescue: Surrendered by owner due to not getting along with other dogs and cats. At shelter able to take out of kennel on leash, dog is focused on environment. Able to pet, with more invasive handling, body stiffens and dog lip licks. When meeting subbmissive female dog approaches wagging and sniffs without problem. When meeting pushy male dog, air snapps to give warning when approached frontal then walks away. Needs further evaluation for handling and affiliation. Type: Behavior> Date animal needs rescue by: date removed * AVega Impound type: OS m.kameda 11/19/20 09:32 Passing behavior. Takes time to warm up but able to complete invasive handling. With male handler does approach with time. When seeing another dog at a distance avoids and stays close to handler. When helper dog attempts to engage does a growl then avoids. AVega 01/04/21 13:39 Need rescue for having discharge from both eyes. KVuong 01/06/21 09:33 Eye discharge resolved. KTyson",

            "description": "Dottie is an absolute gem with the world\u2019s best pittie smile. She is such a sweet girl and loves to give kisses and being around her people and fur friends. Her foster mom works from home and loves when Dottie wanders over every so often for pets and snuggle time. Dottie will often lay nearby and doze off during the day to keep a close eye on things. She makes sure she knows if her people start moving around. She is very curious about what everyone is doing, but just watches with interest instead of wanting to help too much. \n\nDottie is currently kenneled at night and any other time she is going to be alone for an extended period of time. She had quite the adjustment to kennel time when first brought into rescue, but it only took a few days for her to get settled in and know that was a safe and comfy place to be. She wasn\u2019t an escape artist. She didn\u2019t bark for hours on end. Instead, she had such a long, woeful howl for 20 minutes or so after being kenneled up. From the other room, she sounded like Dory from \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d talking to the whale. Her foster family is actually kind of sad that she quit doing that because it was really funny to listen to. The human kids would try to guess what she was saying. \n\nDottie has a nylabone in her kennel with her at night that she will occasionally chew on, but her favorite thing is her red, spiky ball. She carries it around with her all day long. She is even nice enough to let her foster siblings play with it. Her foster mom has kept a close eye on toy interactions, and Dottie doesn\u2019t appear to resource guard her toy- which is amazing because it is her absolute favorite thing ever! She is also pleasant with food and doesn\u2019t show any guarding of that either. Her foster family feeds everyone separately to avoid any issues, but her foster mom can take her bowl away halfway through and take toys away without problems.\n\nDottie has 5 foster fur siblings, and she has done very well adapting to her foster home life with very slow introductions. She does like to play, and at first, was a little too rowdy in the house with her fur friends. Now that she has been in her foster home a little while, she understands the rules a bit better and keeps the playing under control. \n\nAs with all rescues, training is going to be an important piece of Dottie\u2019s future. Her foster mom has been working on leash manners and basic obedience. Dottie is a smart cookie and has figured out not to pull her foster mom around the yard during potty breaks and is working really, really hard on her stay. She is eager to please and will often go back and forth from sit to lay down when in a stay waiting for her breakfast and dinner. She hasn\u2019t quite figured out that it\u2019s the stay that gets her the food, not her up and down shenanigans, but she\u2019ll get there. \n\nDottie is such a gentle and kind soul and loves to give little humans kisses without trampling them over in excitement. She would make an excellent family dog and would be happy with anyone that showed her lots of love. Her amazing personality and smile hopefully means she will find a family to adopt her very soon. Anyone would be lucky to have her!\n\nTo apply for adoption, please visit: www.4pitssakerescue.com",

            "description": "If you are looking for a real \"\"ham\"\" look no farther than adorable Eleanor Honey Ham! \n\nWhat can we say about Ms. Eleanor Honey Ham... She is incredibly affectionate and will certainly bond with her family pretty quickly. She is working on general manners such as gentle with treats and play, off (specifically the counter even though she's pretty low to the ground), getting into her crate on command and she can be a bit excitable. She gets nippy when she is excited and we are working hard on her with that. She showed some signs of possible food/possession aggression the first couple of days she was here but has been working very hard with \"\"sit, stay, ok.\"\" \n\nShe will need a family that is committed to continuing to work with her daily on this skill and basic obedience skills.She needs some work on leash training as well! You definitely need to keep your eye on her because if she isn't trying to cuddle you or following you around at your heels she's probably getting into trouble. She's really just a big puppy that doesn't know her own strength. \n\nWe believe that an ideal home for her would be one that had either grown children or a single couple/person and most likely not someone that isn't stable with balance. She is goofy and super strong so she could easily bowl someone over and she's a \"\"coming in hot!\"\" kinda girl for the spot on the couch. She seems like she will take a bit of time to really settle so she'll need patience and love. We believe she would do best as an only dog and needs a family that fully understands and has experience with bully breeds like Eleanor. \n\n\nName: Eleanor Honey Ham\nBreed: American Staffordshire Terrier mix\nSex: Female\nAge: 4 years old\nWeight: 51 pounds\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\nVaccinations: Up to date\nHeartworm: Positive \nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nBASED ON OUR OBSERVATIONS: \nGood with Children: Older children only.\nGood with Dogs: Has fostered with other dogs with very slow introductions. We are recommending that she is an only dog. \nGood with Cats: Unknown\n\nAdoption Fee: $475.00\n\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION:\nInterested in a specific dog, please fill out an application if you are interested in a dog. The number of individual inquiries is overwhelming and we are finding it difficult to respond to each one. We cannot guarantee you will receive a timely response.\n\nPaws New England is a rescue, not a shelter, and as such we do not have our dogs housed in one location - they are in foster homes both in New England and in our southern foster homes. If you're interested in a specific dog, please complete a short online application and you will receive a reply within 48 hours so you can ask questions.\n\nAt present, if a dog is listed on our website, the dog is considered still available HOWEVER, may have applications that have come in before yours but it's still too early to know if any are a good match; therefore we encourage you to apply.\n\n\nNOTICE WITH REGARD TO LOCATION OF DOGS: Please note: Paws New England is a foster-based rescue. We do not have a brick and mortar building to house the dogs we rescue. We have found that dogs in foster homes are much more adoptable because they have been observed in a home setting. Dogs listed with Paws New England typically reside in various locations throughout the south (primarily Tennessee, Texas, and Arkansas) and New England (not necessarily in the state of Rhode Island). You will be notified by the adoption coordinator of the location of the dog you are interested in so you have the ability to decide whether to pursue adoption or not.\n\nDogs transported to New England are done so at a fee of $150.00 paid directly to the transporting company by Paws New England; no additional transport costs are responsibility of adopter. This fee is included in the adoption donation.\n\nAdoption donations cover pre-adoption vet costs (including vaccinations, spay/neuter when age appropriate, and heartworm testing/treatment when necessary), a microchip, and transportation to New England if necessary.\n\nDonations for our young, healthy puppies and dogs support their fellow canines of advanced age or suffering from injuries and abuse whose donations are reduced but whose veterinary costs are typically much higher. We appreciate your understanding that your dog will help others in need.\n\nAll known information about the animal is listed above. We do our best to give accurate information, but most of our dogs are rescues and do not come with a known history.\n\nPaws New England abides by the dog importation regulations set forth in the states of MA, CT, NH and RI.",

He is good with other dogs BUT he just doesn't know how to approach them.... he comes in HOT and some dogs don't understand his body language. He would do best with a passive female. Cats unknown...

He still needs to be muzzled when meeting new people, but he does not have issues meeeting and playing with well-behaved dogs. Kobe is very comfortable with his muzzle and will allow you to put it on and will keep it on without any problem. He is comfortable in a crate. Kobe is a very smart boy and is working on new commands every day. He definitely as 'sit' and 'stay' and 'come' mastered. Kobe would do best in a home with no young children, a home that can give him a calm setting, and a household without a lot of people/strangers comeing in and out. We are hoping Kobe will mature and outgrow this one issue of being so nervous and fearful around new people but that remains to be seen._______________________________________________________Kobe came into rescue with reactivity towards both people and dogs He has been in specialized care and training at a facility to help him overcome his fear that is causing him anxiety and reactivity in certain environments. Kobe has made a lot of progress but will need continue support and training in his adoptive home. He will need someone experienced with the boxer breed and behaviors, as well as patience in introducing him to new people, dogs, and overall life experiences. He is a gorgeous boy that deserves the best life has to offer him at whatever level that may be. Kobe is a work in progress and each week he learns something new. Kobe was never socialized properly as a puppy and is working hard to overcome his issues. If you are interested in finding out more about Kobe and think you could offer him a safe and happy home, please contact us. We will be very picky about the home he goes to so he can grow into a well-socialized and happy adult.",

            "description": "My name is Luna I am about a year old and I am a Pit Bull Terrier mix. I can be a tad wary of strangers at first but I warm up to people pretty quickly! I am a medium energy girl who enjoys playing fetch but I am really just a big lap dog! I love to get some good scratches and I give great kisses! I seem to do well with other large dogs that are clearly submissive to me but I will need a home with no cats, chickens, or any other small animals. I would love a home with a secure yard for me to hangout in!\n\n*Please Note, If you have other dogs or children living in the home, you will need to bring them down to meet at the shelter before the adoption process continues.\n\nFor more information please call the Humane Society of Cowlitz County at 360-577-0151 and ask to speak with a staff member.

And those little snappy dogs just don\u2019t appeal to me much.  I have made a couple of good dog friends at the Shelter, although I prefer humans.   I really didn\u2019t want to come here but now I\u2019ve met all kinds of cool folks and I just know one of them is going to take me to my forever home.  I sure hope the one who picks me has a great big comfy sofa as I seem to be what some call a \u201ccouch potato\u201d.  Take me home with you and let me curl up with you while you read a good book and I just enjoy your warmth and love.",

I am terrified of new people, but once I know that you won't hurt me, I will be your best friend, bonus points if you give me hotdogs! Victoria says that I am really good at learning new tricks. If you are willing to be patient with me, I know that I can be a good boy. I love other dogs and trust them before I will trust a new human. I am unsure about the creatures that Victoria calls cats. They are too mysterious and I don't know if they can be trusted.\n\nhttps://www.baileyshumanrescue.org/buddy",

            "description": "Gumby is an adorable 12 year old/ 5lb yorkie boy looking for his forever home. This little nugget gets along great with everyone and is housetrained. Mr Gumby loves to be held and will make the perfect little lap dog! He does have cataracts but he can still see fine despite them and because he has no teeth you will never have to worry about getting his teeth cleaned and polished ( yorkies are notorious for having bad teeth). Because Gumby is so small we prefer a home without small children and for his adoptive parents to walk him in a stroller - his little feet will not take him far but he does like outings and taking in the fresh Florida breeze ?. If interested in adopting Gumby please fill out an application at www.floridacockerrescue.org   ADOPTION FEE: $265.00\n",

Our application process includes landlord approval and vet checks. Please make sure all of your information is current and accurate, including a valid email address and phone numbers. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and/or cancel your application.  We strive to process all applications in a timely manner, but with the high volume of applications we are receiving, it is taking anywhere from 1-3 weeks.  You may be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions.  Once all of your information is reviewed and if your application is approved, you will be notified via email.  Submitting an application and receiving an approval does not guarantee you will be adopting the dog you applied for.  Once you move to the meet and greet process, you will be contacted by the foster family to further discuss the dog, and answer questions you may have, and if applicable, a meet and greet will be set up at our adoption center.   Meet and greets are only set up with approved applicants, and we require all members in the household to be present, as well as any current dogs in the home. \n\nCurrent Adoption Fees Are:\n$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nBonded pairs vary\n\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test, (if over 6  months) and a certified veterinary inspection. Please be aware, listed dog breeds are based on information provided and cannot be guaranteed.  Submitting an application for a particular dog does not guarantee that you will be the applicant chosen, we receive several applications for each dog. Our adopters are picked based on the needs of the dog, and the home we feel with best fit based on your responses to our application, vet information and landlord requirements.   Approved applicants not chosen for the dog you applied for, will be in active status for a period of six months.  We encourage you to watch Petfinder, Facebook and our website for upcoming dogs.  Should you see a dog that interests you, please send us a Facebook message or an email with your approval number.  Please be patient with us, as Lucky Mutts Rescue is run strictly by volunteers and many of us work full time jobs, have families and also foster dogs. Thank you for considering Lucky Mutts Rescue for your next furry family member!",

            "description": "Hello everybody!  My name is Hooch! My foster family calls me Hutch.  I joined my foster family on January 18th.  I am a hound mix who is 3 years old and 54 pounds.  I am a quiet, milder dog who needs an extra moment to get used to new people.  Being from Oklahoma, I am learning about what city life is like with all of the loud and scary sounds.  At night, I sleep quietly in my crate.\n\nEach day I warm up more and more to my foster family - trust is important.  I love to play with their smaller dog Rocky; I am careful and don\u2019t get mad when Rocky tries to steal my food or bone.  I am improving on my dog walking skills.  As for potty training, I follow whatever Rocky does - Rocky goes outside, so will I. Overall, with love and patience, I will be a great dog for families.  (Even ones with kids, a dog, and a cat!)\n\nAfter I trust you, I love to cuddle and get attention. I am very sweet and I am looking for someone to love me! \n\nIf you would like to be considered as a potential adopter for one of our great dogs, please go to our website- www.luckymuttsrescue.org and submit an application. Our application process includes landlord approval and vet checks. Please make sure all of your information is current and accurate, including a valid email address and phone numbers. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and/or cancel your application.  We strive to process all applications in a timely manner, but with the high volume of applications we are receiving, it is taking anywhere from 1-3 weeks.  You may be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions.  Once all of your information is reviewed and if your application is approved, you will be notified via email.  Submitting an application and receiving an approval does not guarantee you will be adopting the dog you applied for.  Once you move to the meet and greet process, you will be contacted by the foster family to further discuss the dog, and answer questions you may have, and if applicable, a meet and greet will be set up at our adoption center.   Meet and greets are only set up with approved applicants, and we require all members in the household to be present, as well as any current dogs in the home. \n\nCurrent Adoption Fees Are:\n$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nBonded pairs vary\n\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test, (if over 6  months) and a certified veterinary inspection. Please be aware, listed dog breeds are based on information provided and cannot be guaranteed.  Submitting an application for a particular dog does not guarantee that you will be the applicant chosen, we receive several applications for each dog. Our adopters are picked based on the needs of the dog, and the home we feel with best fit based on your responses to our application, vet information and landlord requirements.   Approved applicants not chosen for the dog you applied for, will be in active status for a period of six months.  We encourage you to watch Petfinder, Facebook and our website for upcoming dogs.  Should you see a dog that interests you, please send us a Facebook message or an email with your approval number.  Please be patient with us, as Lucky Mutts Rescue is run strictly by volunteers and many of us work full time jobs, have families and also foster dogs. Thank you for considering Lucky Mutts Rescue for your next furry family member!",

This boy weighs 33 lbs and gets along great with other dogs ( although he is protective of his toys around other dogs)- we do not know how he is with cats. Sammie loves to go on long walks enjoys car rides too, and he is super playful so frequent trips to a dog park would be a treat for him. If interested in adopting Sammie please fill out an application at www.floridacockerrescue.org   ADOPTION FEE: $325.00",

Now that Babe's mama duties are behind her, she is ready to be spoiled. She is so friendly and loving that it should not be too long before she becomes a beloved family member. She is super playful, loves her toys, swims gleefully in her bug pool, and adores the humans who think she is awesome.

I still act like a puppy so it would be great if I had a family that too the time to teach me tricks and manners. Some of the volunteers have spent only a fraction of the time with me that a family gets to and they\u2019ve taught me how to sit and lay down. I\u2019m a really good boy when you have my attention, but sometimes I get distracted by every thing going on around me and forget to focus, but I\u2019m working on it. Anyways, I would love to have an active family. Imagine being an active person and then you\u2019re locked in your room all day except for short breaks every 3 hours. It can be frustrating. But, I\u2019m a happy boy! I need to be the only dog in the home. I just want all of your attention. When it comes to kids I\u2019d prefer that they are 12+ because I am working on those manners. Every one here thinks I\u2019m just so cute. They love my ears ans they think I have the sweetest face. Give me a chance to join your family. Teach me what no one has taken the time to teach me before and I promise I won\u2019t disappoint you!\n\nLove, Chief",

They were taken to the local pound, but their physical conditions and medical needs would have overwhelmed the pound's resources. Napoleon, Cesar, and Shazam had only 24 hours for someone to intervene or they would die. Emaciated, loaded with worms, and with a host of other problems, these puppies were extremely timid and afraid of humans when they arrived at HUA. Months of rehabilitation work by dedicated volunteers and caregivers have paid off. Cesar had big shoes to fill when he moved in with hurricane survivor Nola, whose previous roommate worshipped the ground she walked on. Nola doesn't tolerate fools, but she absolutely tolerates - and even likes - her new buddy Cesar. That is really saying something for this little boy who was so terrified at first. Cesar has bloomed into a happy go lucky fellow who has nothing but wonderful things in store for him.\n\nVisit Cesar at www.hua.org!",

I am such a sweet pup and am excited to find a new furever home that will be able to love me for who I am. \n\nWhen I arrived at SVASC, I was terrified of absolutely everything and am still getting used to my new home, but I am certainly coming around. I did arrive with a pretty nasty, but healed break to my front leg that is still causing me some issues, so SVASC is working on getting that checked out and deciding the best course of action for me. I am in a lot of pain right now, which may be affecting my behavior, but if you give me some time to get to know you, I really do come around and am a total doll baby once I do. \n\nI have always been an only pet and I do love to be the center of attention. I am open to meeting other dogs to see if we could be a good match though! I also previously lived with kids, but since I am quite nervous, I think that I would do best in an adult only home or a home without young children. I am already house-trained and walk pretty okay on leash. \n\nMy adoption fee is $125 to an approved adopter. If you would like more information on me, please give SVASC a call at (540) 943-5142 or stop by the shelter during open hours. SVASC is located at 1001 Mt. Torrey Rd. Lyndhurst, VA.\"",

            "description": "Age: Approx. 6 - 7 years (as of 12/09/20)\nWeight: 71 lbs (as of 01/28/21)\n\nLocation: RI\n\nThis dog has been spayed/neutered, is up to date on shots, on heartworm preventative and is microchipped.\n\nShadow Bear is a laid-back, happy boy!\n\nAnd handsome and affectionate and smart! We are thinking handsome Shadow Bear is a Black Lab and Chow Chow mix about 6-7 years old. He has the softest, most velvety thick coat, and loves to get pets from his people.\nOnce he gets to know you, he is affectionate and likes to be in your company. He also likes being brushed which is good as he is bit of a shedder.\n\nHe is house trained and is calm in his crate where he sleeps quietly at night. He walks well on the leash in an Easy Walk harness and he is quiet and calm for the most part unless he sees a stranger or hears a strange noise.\nTrue to his Chow Chow roots (a guess only), Shadow Bear will alert bark at strange noises, and when he sees strangers from afar (either from his house window, yard, or on walks). There is no lunging or jumping associated with this response - it is just a vocal alert - and if the stranger or Shadow moves along, he stops his barking. His adopter needs to be comfortable with this, and we will provide a mini-training on how to appropriately handle this behavior.\n\nShadow is enjoying his time in foster care with another friendly dog and a single woman. He seems to accept men and women equally well, though we haven't observed him living with men. He enjoys the company of his foster sister, who is a sweet, playful dog. He has not taken her up on her polite offers to play, but he also has not be rude or reactive to her and her attempts. We think\nh\ne would do equally well as a spoiled only dog, or with another dog(s) who can accept that he is more of a co-exister than a player.\nShadow is looking for a cat- and small animal-free home.\n\nShadow would do best in a low traffic home without many new people coming and going, and in a more quiet than more busy neighborhood. Visitors will need to be managed for their first few visits, but after a few correct introductions/visits, Shadow seems to easily accepts the same visitors. We have not seen Shadow living with children, but for the above reason, we think he would be best suited to an adult-only household. When Shadow has seen children from a distance, he has not seemed phased or too interested.\n\nShadow Bear is a bit of a couch potato, though he does enjoy his twice daily mile walks. He has been doing great with his New Year's Resolution diet and already lost a few pounds, but he still has about 10lbs to lose. He might become more peppy after shedding those extra pounds and would likely enjoy mild hiking adventures. His nose is ALWAYS working, and would likely love some long-leash time in woods, just smelling all the smells. He also loves care rides, and probably knows the word \"RIDE\" better than his own name!\n\nShadow Bear is a sweet and smart boy looking for a chill home, and will make a fabulous companion. Can you make his dream come true? Fill out an application today and let him know that you'd love to have him join your family!\n\nShadow Bear's Backstory: Shadow was a stray, likely abandoned, and was taken into animal control in spring 2019 in hopes of finding a forever home. He recently was placed with a loving foster family and has settled in so nicely to home life!\n\nAdoption Fee: $585\n\nTo apply for this dog, fill out an adoption application on our website: www.sosarl.org/aa/\n\n**Additional info you should know - For most of our dogs, we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each of our dogs as an individual and do our best to describe and place them based on personality not breed label. Some dogs may not yet be in New England, nor ready for immediate adoption. There may be additional vetting, quarantine, waiting periods and/or fees depending upon your state of residence. If you have questions or concerns on any of this, you can discuss this with your Adoption Counselor.",

            "description": "Longtime followers of Home Fur Good may remember Lyla, previously known as Coco.  She was a resident at HFG back in the summer of 2018.  Initially, Lyla had an owner who had passed away and she was left living in a closet where people would intermittently toss her some food.  Lyla was adopted by a woman who deeply cared for this shy and loving girl who had a rough start.  An excellent way to help a shy dog is with training.  Training gives them confidence and builds an amazing bond between dog and owner.  When I say that Lyla went to training, I mean she excelled at training.  Just to name a few, she knows sit, stay, come, down, off, paw, kennel up, drop it, and heel.  Lyla\u2019s mom even had her DNA tested to see what made up her 47 pounds.  Lyla\u2019s top three are 25% German Shepherd, 24 % American Pit Bull Terrier, and 15% Boxer.  Lyla\u2019s mom\u2019s living situation changed, and their new home came with a dog.  There was plenty of effort, time, money, and training that went into making a home where they could all coexist, but Lyla was living her life in a muzzle and a crate.  This is not the life meant for such a gentle and intelligent girl.  It was with great sadness and many tears that Lyla has come back to HFG.  It is ok; Lyla will receive her happily ever after.  She turned four years old in July; she is young and has many years left to find a home where she can be the only dog and can be the pampered princess.  Lyla will form a deep bond with an owner that takes the time to practice her training and show Lyla consistency and patience.  She can be wary of strangers; she is very alert and feeds off surrounding energy.  When Lyla sees that everyone is getting along and the mojo is safe and calm, then she becomes the ultimate lapdog, spreading kisses. The adoption fee is $225 and includes spaying/neutering, age-appropriate vaccinations, microchipping, and a free wellness visit at Phoenix Mountain Animal Hospital. Our adoption hours are Thursday-Saturday from 11:00 am-4:00 pm by appointment only.",

Laurel was understandably shy and timid when she arrived at the shelter but it did not take long for caregivers and volunteers to see her sassy Chihuahua personality emerge. She does need to take medicine for a heart murmur but she is good about that. Laurel is tiny but mighty, and she lets her opinions be known--something everyone finds quite entertaining. Her very best friend is Ebony. These two Chis are so bonded that we must insist that they remain together.\n\nVisit Laurel at www.hua.org!",

I'm Hercules!\n\n***SPECIAL NEEDS***\n\nIntake date: 1/2/2021\nIntake type- Surrender- Transfer from Rochester Animal Services\nPup Partners Color: Orange\n\nDOB: 12/15/2010\nWeight: 85lbs\nGender: Male\n\nI am: Up to date on vaccines, Neutered and Microchipped\n\nMy friends describe me as: Loyal, Affectionate, Goofy, Eager-to- please, Smart\n\nMy energy level: Low- I'm a laid back boy who enjoys snuggling. Netflix and a movie sounds nice!\n\nHome with other dogs: It would be best for me to be the only doggo in the home. Plus I would really enjoy all the love and attention\n\nHome with children: Over the age of 12\nHome with kitties: No\n\nHercules found himself at a nearby Animal Control facility after his owner moved and couldn't take him along. Despite him being with that owner since he was 8 weeks old, he's taken the recent changes in his life like a champ! This senior guy may look intimidating, but he's as sweet as a glass of summertime tea. We're looking for a cushy home for him to spend the rest of his life surrounded by comfort, love, and stability. Along with providing a lifetime of love to you, he does come with some special needs:\nHercules was diagnosed with a condition known as KCS, or \"dry eye\". This condition will require eye medications to be administered to him for the rest of his life because he is no longer able to produce normal tears and his eyes will need to be cleaned out multiple times a day. If his eyes are not kept lubricated/medicated, it leads to painful ulcers.  Luckily, he is a very good boy for his twice a day treatments! Sadly, we suspect he had this condition for some time before entering the shelter, as his eyes look a bit scarred from past ulcers due to non-treatment, and he likely has some vision impairment. His other condition is ataxia in the hind end from an unknown cause. This means his hind end is a bit wobbly/weak due to nerve damage or pressure on his nerves, possibly from a bone spur or some sort of trauma. He doesn't seem to mind at all, but may have trouble with stairs, and of course can't go for major adventures, as that may exacerbate the issue. \n\nHercules is a one of a kind boy with the most sweetest soul and disposition. He just wants to be loved and cuddled with at all times. He is a very smart boy and as well as responding to English commands, he responds greatly to Spanish. \n\nIf you may have the right home for this deserving big hunk of a dude, please let us know! If you have further questions or would like to chat about his needs, give us a call @ 607-324-1270 ext 0",

As a Dogo Argentino, he is a loveable gentle giant. He loves to play, cherishes his treats and going for long walks. Prince is DEAF. He has been working on his hand signals, a vibration collar and a Herm Sprenger prong collar. He is leash trained and is grasping the hand signals with enthusiasm. Prince needs a strong caregiver that is not intimidated by his size but can give gentle direction and further work with him on his hand signals. Prince is still in the puppy stage and due to his size he would need to meet any potential fur siblings prior to going to his new home. He is currently working on making eye contact with his caregiver for instructions. He knows \u201cSit\u201d, \u201cNo bark\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d with hand signals currently. Prince's needs a person who has experience training larger dogs, and can train in a firm, confident, consistent and loving manner. He is a wonderful, fascinating, loyal, affectionate boy.\n\nVisit Prince at www.hua.org!",

He thrives off of \"good boy\" and treats! He LOVES to spend time with his people. It takes him some time to get comfortable around anyone, but once he has adjusted, he becomes the most affectionate dog ever! He is looking for someone that will look at him as the only dog in world, as you to him are his whole world. He makes it known that you are his and his only! If another dog around, he will cry a bit to show his jealousy. \n\nHe LOVES to play! However, he would prefer playing somewhere where he can't hear heavy traffic. He becomes nervous and distracted because of the loud noises.\nHe will need to continue training on his food aggression. If another dog in the home, it is best to feed him separately. He will need someone who is willing to help him deter from this behavior. \nHe is also a bit fearful of men. He is receptive when men speak to him in a loving way, but still is quite nervous. Because of this we suggest a woman becoming his furever. He is the PAWFECT companion and ready to fill your heart with lots of love. \n\nPONCHO will shine best with:\n-Someone looking for a companion\n-Women\n-Retired but still active\n-Somewhere where there is room to play\n-Someone willing to train \n\nIf you believe PONCHO could be your forever buddy please fill out an adoption application: https://form.jotform.com/93263081961156\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE EMAIL INFO@MERCYFULLPROJECTS.ORG",

She came to SAAP as a pregnant momma. She gave birth to 11 puppies but sadly they were all stillborn. At times she still seems a bit depressed over it so she will definitely need lots of love and patience! She is a low to medium energy dog who is potty trained, spayed and up to date on all vaccines. She ignores the cat in the house and she gets along with the other dogs - with slow and proper introductions.\nAll SAAP animals are vet checked, UTD on vaccines, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, and given flea and heartworm preventative as age appropriate.\n\nOur website is: http://www.adoptastray.com/\n\nTo check if this animal is still available visit our master pet list on our website at:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/adoptable-animals/\n\nHave questions:\nPlease email us at saap@adoptastray.com for more information about this animal or to answer any questions you may have. You may also contact us at (859)391-1234.\n\nCompleting the online application when you find an animal you are interested in speeds up the adoption process. We can hold your application on file for a period of time if you are still looking for that perfect new family member.\n\nTHE APPLICATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS LINK:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/dog-adoption-application/\n\nINTERESTED IN FOSTERING:\nWe welcome your interest and ask that you complete our on-line foster application:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/foster-application/",

He gets along great with other dogs, and even LOVES gentle kids! He does fantastic on a leash and is just a great dog all around.\n\nHe came to us from a shelter with AWFUL matted fur and nasty skin, but thanks to lots of TLC and quality vet care, he's on the mend.\n\nHave you ever had a blind or deaf dog? They will love you with their WHOLE hearts! Let's find Buckley a home! To have your home considered for adoption, read about our adoption process or fees, and find out about interstate transport, please visit our website, www.LongWayHomeAdoptables.org and click the adopt tab!\n\nOur adoption fee is $200 for dogs, $100 for cats, and it includes spay/neuter, all vaccines, heartworm testing, fecal testing, deworming, flea/heartworm prevention, and a microchip. \n\nNATIONWIDE TRANSPORT available for an additional $200 fee. See our website for more info!\n\nPlease note: breed listings are based on educated guesses. Shelter animals and abused pets do not come with DNA profiles, so breeds listed on the profile are based on size, coat, markings, and body shape, but are in no way guaranteed. \n\n_______\n\nLong Way Home is a volunteer organization, comprised of a network of foster homes. Please keep this in mind, as we only have so much time to volunteer around full time jobs, family obligations, etc. It may take us several days to respond.",

His tail is always wagging and he cannot wait to jump in your lap for some hugs.\n\nHe is working on a full recovery. He would still need to partake in some psychical therapy which would include; swimming, leashed steps and multiple leashed slow walks per day.\n\nBentley's ideal home is with someone who has the time to commit in helping him gain a full recovery. All he wants to do is jump in your arms and show you affection. He would benefit being an only fur child since he needs a lot of attention. However, he would love to have some human kids in the household. He has such a go with the flow attitude that he should have no problem regaining his strength.",

He, Ashley, Cleopatra, Liz Taylor, Lucille Ball and Mary Kate were all surrendered to ATDR because of the death of their precious person. Frightened, not understanding what's going on in their world, they are now in a safe, loving foster home being cared for and receiving any needed veterinary care. This good-looking group was obviously well loved but a bit overfed! While bringing their health needs up to speed, their foster mom is working on gaining their trust, making them feel at home and has put them on a nutritious diet to hopefully slim them down some. Stay tuned as we learn more about these beautiful orphaned babies to share here.Each of these pups will need to go to a home with a companion dog to share life with. In the meantime, if you have it in your heart to adopt one or more of these precious pups and give them the love and security they need again, please submit an adoption application for any or all of them! They just need another person and home to call their own",

            "description": "Howie has been in a long-term foster home, but due to a change of circumstances, we are looking for a new adoptive or foster home for him.  Howie has EPI - Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.\n\nExocrine pancreatic insufficiency occurs when the pancreas does not release enough digestive enzymes.  As a result, food is not digested properly, and the body doesn\u2019t receive the nutrition it needs. \n\nHowie's EPI is under control and not difficult at all to manage.\n\nFrom his current foster mom:\n\nHowie is really an awesome dog. He is very intelligent and happy. He is content to sit on the sofa most days but does enjoy playtime in the yard. Howie is also a huge fan of his toys! He will usually pick one and play with that toy most of the day. While he enjoys playing with his current housemates, Howie would do best in a home with no small animals or young children. \n\nHowie's EPI has become extremely easy to manage. We currently feed him Pure Balance Grain Free Salmon from Walmart, which he loves. The Enzyme powder simply needs to be mixed with the food with tepid water and allowed to soak for 20-30 minutes. He has been doing amazingly well with this easy process.\n\nThis handsome boy is about 4 years old. If you think Howie would be a good fit in your home, please fill out an application here:\n\nhttp://www.savingpawsrescueaz.org/dogs/\n\nIf you can give Howie  an indoor forever \nhome, please fill out our online application on our website at http://www.savingpawsrescueaz.com/adoption-form/  \n\n We will only schedule meet and greets with an approved application. We are an all-volunteer organization.  It may take a couple of days to process an application and complete reference checks.\n\nThank you for your interest in saving the life of a dog.",

I came to SVASC when my previous owner was no longer able to care for me, so now I'm looking for a brand new family to call my own. What do you think about taking a handsome stud muffin like me home with ya? \n\nAfter speaking with my previous owner, SVASC got a pretty good story about my past, before my previous caretaker ever had him. Unfortunately, my past is pretty grim and I'm still working through that, but I'm happy to be out of that situation and excited to move on to bigger and better things! While my personality is back to 100%, my body is still healing and I actually do have a fractured pelvis. Yikes! I know, I know, but lucking SVASC and their pawtners over at Friends of SVASC are getting that taken care of. Soon, I'll be feeling like a million bucks! \n\nAt a year old, I still have loads of energy and I'm not letting that injury slow me down any. I love to play and can be quite a rough player, so I would do best in a home without young kids, as I get very excited and do still play bite and jump sometimes. I can be a little picky about my doggy friends and would do best in a home with only other calmer pups or as an only pooch. This may change as my pelvis heals up, though. Anyways, I'm ready to go home, what about you? \n\nMy adoption fee is $125 to an approved adopter. If you would like more information on me, please give SVASC a call at (540) 943-5142 or stop by the shelter during open hours. SVASC is located at 1001 Mt. Torrey Rd. Lyndhurst, VA.\"",

She is a very active and playful young lady that loves to run around chasing her dog friends playing tag.  She loves to play with toys both with other dogs and with people.  She will chase a tennis ball like it's the end of the world.  She is a very sweet dog that loves to both give and receive affection.  After she's been worn out from playing, she will curl up in your lap and fall fast asleep.  After her power nap, she will shower you with kisses then back to playing she will go.  We feel that Lylah will need either a very active family, a large fenced in area, or other dogs for her to let out her energy.  If you feel like Lylah would be the perfect addition to your family, or if you have any questions about her, please call us at the shelter at (828) 488-0418.  \n",

I\u2019d love my mew family to spoil me with toys, let me run around the yard and give me lots of love and attention.  I like to keep all 4 paws on the ground, am happy to be by your side getting affection and prefer to go potty outside rather than in.   I\u2019d be happy to share my space with other dogs, cats or kids.\n\nI\u2019m a big boy with a big heart that I hope to share with you.   Come on out to meet me!  You can set up an appointment by contacting the shelter at 972-382-3647 ext 4 or adoptionsmoh@gmail.com\n\nPS: the lady that found me wanted to share this with you :\n\nI can give a positive word for this guy- he is an absolute sweetheart and whoever gets to be his forever home is so lucky. He for real left a mark on my heart! He has the sweetest personality and I know he just wants to make a bond with a forever family.",

Due to this he has had no training in the housebreaking and leash department. He is sweet but shy and ready to learn. Since he came from a house with many other dogs he would do best in a house with other dogs. Musketeer needs a special owner with patience who is willing to give him the time to come out of his shell. Due to him being shy he would do best in a house with no kids. Due to his poor nutrition and him being small breed with a pushed in nose he will need dental care in the future. If you are interested in adopting him please email us at animalshelter@islipny.gov",

Looking for well informed adopters, preferably with previous experience owning a bulldog or similar breed. ***\n\nAlthough he appears manly, 4 year old Olde English Bulldog Duke is a spoiled princess at heart. He enjoys being the center of attention, craves affection from his people and does not like to be left alone. Weighing in at 84 pounds, he is strong and playful! He:\n\u2022\tIs house trained\n\u2022\tWalks nicely on a slip lead\n\u2022\tNeeds to be the only dog - but with training and continued socialization may accept another in the future\n\u2022\tIs not appropriate for a home with children\n\u2022\tRides well in a vehicle\n\u2022\tIs medium to high energy\nHappy and upbeat, Duke needs a home that has a lot of time to devote to play, training and cuddles. Structure and a firm handler are a must for this gorgeous dog as he does at times demonstrate hard-headedness common to bulldogs. Very much a house dog, he is content spending time indoors if given outlets for exercise. He will make a knowledgeable family a truly loving companion.\n\nDuke is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, and heartworm negative. \n\nFor more information about Duke or our shelter please call us at (830) 693-0569 or visit our website at highlandlakescaninerescue.org \n\nIf you would like to schedule a meet and greet with Duke or any of our dogs, please fill out an application at highlandlakescaninerescue.org/application-for-adoption\n",

I am very shy but my foster mom says I am very sweet too. I am an 8 month old Pit Bull Terrier mix puppy. I found my way to Puppy Paws after my owner passed away. My foster family has been taking such good care of me. They are teaching me how to be an inside dog and turns out I really love it- especially the cozy dog beds and snuggles. My foster mom says I am very smart! I have learned my potty training and will even scratch the door to tell her I want to go out! I will need a family that is patient and understands that I need time to feel safe and comfortable in my new home- I've been through a lot of changes lately. I will need a fenced in yard to run and play- I love to run zoomies! I would love a quieter neighborhood- I'm not sure if I am ready for the hustle and bustle of city life. I will also need a  home with another friendly dog  - I absolutely adore my doggie foster sister.  I am gaining so much confidence with her help and I love to snuggle with her. My foster mom says I have blossomed so much since I met her. Now I am looking for a forever family with the patience and understanding to help me continue my journey and help me grow in confidence. If you think that could be you, please go to puppypawsrescue.org and apply!\n\n\nIf interested in adopting please fill out our no obligation online application at www.puppypawsrescue.org \n\nNote: Our rescue requires that all adopter's current and prior animals are up-to-date on vaccinations (DHLPP & Rabies)  and preventatives (heartworm and flea and tick), unless there is a medical reason not allowing it. All animals in your household should be spayed or neutered unless medically indicated that they should not be or are currently still too young.",

Due to this he has had no training in the housebreaking and leash department. He is sweet but shy and ready to learn. Since he came from a house with many other dogs he would do best in a house with other dogs. Due to him being shy he would do best in a house with older kids. Due to his poor nutrition and him being small breed with a pushed in nose plus older he will need a dental shortly after adoption. Due to his breed mixture Barry will need continued grooming. If you are interested in adopting him please email us at animalshelter@islipny.gov",

            "description": "Lulu Belle is a female, 26 lb., chocolate and white Border Collie mix. Lulu Belle's estimated date of birth is December, 2019. She came to ARF as an owner surrender. She is the perfect combination of playful and cuddly. She likes going on walks, playing fetch, zooming around the yard, and cuddling up next to her human on the couch or in bed.  She is housetrained and knows how to sit on command.  When she\u2019s excited, she gives the silliest, toothiest smile a dog can give. \n\nLulu Belle was owner surrendered by a woman who said that she barked too much in her apartment.  Lulu Belle is very sensitive to noises and meeting new people (especially men) or being in new situations is scary at first.  Her former owner said that she lived with three children and did well with them; she seems to want to be friends with children that she meets on walks but is also anxious about them, so she may have been mistreated by them in the past.  She has the Border Collie intelligence and learns new things quickly.  She needs a calm, stable home that can help her learn that people are good and can be trusted.  Does that home sound like yours?  Lulu Belle would love nothing more than to have a home and people to call her own. Lulu Belle has a $150.00 adoption fee plus the cost of 6 months of heartworm prevention.  \n\nNote: ARF reserves the right to deny any application that is deemed unsuitable for the animal. Please be aware that our animal adoptions are NOT on a first come- first serve basis. Our sole purpose is to find the best possible home for the animals that fall under our care. We do not ship our animals. All adopters are expected to come to Tulsa if approved.\n\nFor details on how to adopt please visit http://www.arftulsa.org/adopt.",

Due to this they had no training in the housebreaking and leash department. They are sweet and ready to learn. Rocky is on the shy side and would do best in a home with older children. Since they came from a house with many other dogs they would do best in a house with other dogs. Due to their poor nutrition and them being small breed they will need dentals either upon adoption or shortly after.",

Juniper would do best in a very active home that can keep her mind and body moving in a positive direction. She is a diamond in the rough who will thrive with diligent and consistent training. She is currently best suited to a home without small children as she can easily forget her size and manners. Juniper is good with other dogs outside of her home but would do best as an only dog in her forever home.\nWe are a foster based rescue located in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota. We do require adoptions to physically take place at our adoption center and do not provide transport of any of our animals. If you are not local to us we encourage you to look at rescues and shelters in your area as many animals are in need across the United States.\nIf you have previously applied with us please email adoptionatmars@gmail.com to reactivate your application with new interest.\n\nor\n\nPETFINDER VIEWERS: Find our applications at www.midwestanimalrescue.org\n\n*The pet you are viewing is a rescued pet which is most often from an animal control facility and does not come with a pedigree. The breed(s) listed are our best guess and are in no way guaranteed. Sometimes the pets appear to be a particular breed(s) in the pictures we receive from our rescue partners and when they arrive we are surprised to see an entirely different breed(s) in person! If you choose to DNA test your adopted pet, test results may vary from company to company and our breed guess may not be reflected in those results as it is just that, our best guess. It is with deep longing that we wish there was a breed called \"cute\" as we believe all of our dogs would fall under this new breed classification!\n\n//",

Click on 'adopt' and complete application.\nEmber was surrendered due to health issues of her owner. Her breed was stated as English Bulldog but she does not have papers and appears to have traits of the American Bulldog. Regardless of the specific breed, Ember will need an owner that is familiar with the health issues of Bulldogs. Ember is a lover, very affectionate. She has 2 speeds, full on and resting. She tires easily after high energy play, watch her video below. Ember loves to have whole body massages, she tolerates baths, she thinks she is small and wants to get into your lap. Walks well on leash but can pull if she sees another animal. Will need heavy duty toys and beds.At only 7 months, she is solid-heavy. As for children, she loves them but she was not corrected about jumping up on people. Her owner was knocked down on several occations by Ember's excited activity and was a primary part of the reason for her surrender. We believe that Ember will do best in a home as an ONLY PET. She does play hard with other similar sized dogs, but with brachycephalic syndrome (smushed nose) her breathing is impaired and can over heat quickly. She snores loudly and can be heard over 30 feet away. Previously, Ember was left all day in a crate (over 10 hours) and she now has some separation anxiety. So her forever home will need to have only short periods of her being crated or left alone. She does BARK and CRY when she is left, so not a good fit for apartment living unless owner is mostly stay at home or takes her when they leave. She will dig if left alone in yard.

She was rescued from a hoarding situation where she was housed with over 80 dogs.  Her front feet are a bit splayed out because of cruel kenneling at the hoarding but she can get around just fine and really loves being able to have the space to play. Lozen is super sweet and loves to be snuggled under a blanket.  She is not cat tested but has lived with all sorts of dogs and done well.  She now loves people and kids.\n\nLozen is currently being fostered in Ft. Worth, TC.  She can be adopted there or for serious inquiries we will being her to MD.\n\nhttps://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/DBAB/Dog\n",

He lived in the same home his entire life, then was dumped at a county shelter when his owner got pregnant. They said since they had not ever had him around babies, they didn\u2019t want to take a chance. Unbelievable! Poor Wilson never even got the chance to show them that he could be good with babies... and he was their first baby! It\u2019s absolutely heartbreaking. At the county shelter he completely shut down and just sat on his bed and shook \u2013 we needed to get him out of there. Now, he\u2019s with us and doing MUCH better! We treat Wilson with the respect he should get being that he\u2019s a senior boy \u2013 he gets to be our lobby dog, aka kennel assistant. Which means he has his own room in the lobby area and gets to be out and about when our staff are there. Wilson likes everyone and wags his tail with such enthusiasm that it becomes a weapon. And though he may have some gray on his face, you would never guess his age by his actions \u2013 he\u2019s active, friendly, and loves to go for long walks. He is completely housebroken and very good inside. Because he was never around kids, we believe that his best home would be either no children or teens and up. This boy is sweet, affectionate, and funny \u2013 he\u2019s just happy to be close. If our sweet boy seems like a good match for your life, please fill out an application to get the honor of meeting him. \n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/91891552799173\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n\nThis is Mabel. She's a good girl. Mabel is a retiree boxer/pit mix with a big heart, sweet/loyal disposition that is looking for her forever retirement home. Mabel's estimated DOB is 6/1/2010.\n\nMabel will need a forever home that has humans at home nearly every day. Either a family with someone retired or working from home would be a great fit for her. This is only because of her anxiety with being crated or kenneled.\n\nWhen she arrived to Minnesota\nshe was heart-worm positive. It's a very rough treatment, but thanks to Wags & Whiskers, she successfully finished it and has been deemed safe to be a normal dog again! With that said, she is like any other dog and will need monthly heart worm preventatives, and now she knows how important that is for every dog to begin with!\n\nMabel had a long, hard road before being rescued by Wags & Whiskers. It's safe to assume she's been a mom to many puppies over her years. Her body is showing the typical signs of a hard-working mom who needs a vacation! Upon arrival she had multiple mammary masses that needed removed. It was also apparent that she had not received any good dental care like she should. Being heartworm positive, this made it quite the fiasco to treat! But soon after her heartworms were taken care of, we gave Mabel all of the medical attention she so badly needed. She now has a clean bill of health for her teeth and masses. She had 5 teeth removed completely and does just fine. The areas from her mass removals look great and healed well! Of course she still is a senior lady, so she can be hard of hearing and is somewhat blind in both eyes. She also has some urinary incontinence. Being a retired puppy mom is hard! She takes a daily pill for this, and as her foster mom I can tell you this is no big deal and easily taken care of. She does very well despite all of this and has the best personality to boot, but it should be noted so her forever home knows how special she is!\n\nNow on to non-medical things....like her shining star personality! If you ever wanted a dog that will look you in the eyes and melt your heart because you KNOW that she is saying thank you...Mabel is your girl.\n\nShe has two favorite things: naps and being with you, her human. Somehow, through all that Mabel has endured, she truly has never lost her love for all things human. This is especially impressive, as she does have apparent signs of mistreatment in her previous life. She flinches at touch (just initially until she immediately starts wagging her tail) and is terrified of cages. Despite all this, a smiling face and a wagging tail is given to everyone she meets, no exceptions.\n\nShe does great with children (which can be hard to find for senior dogs sometimes!) and wants to be in whatever room you're in. Her main goal in life is a warm, comfortable place to sleep that is close enough to you so she can stare into your soul. She does typically sleep most of the day, with random spurts of energy based on your schedule and desire. You want to go for a walk? She's game! You want to watch netflix and have a lazy day? She's game!\n\nShe will tell you when she needs to use the bathroom, by staring at you with a whimper. You likely won't ever hear her bark unless another dog is in her sights. She rarely has house accidents, even with her incontinence from age, if she is kept on a regular schedule. That being said, she is like any other dog...she can only keep it in so long if you forget! She currently lives in an unfenced yard and does just fine on a tie-out when going potty.\n\nMabel does have one piece of trauma she brought with her from her life before rescue. She does not get along with other dogs. We aren't sure what happened to her before rescue, but it caused quite the fear and mistrust of other dogs. She is what we call \"dog reactive\" to an extreme measure, so she should not be around other dogs nor ever introduced to an area with other dogs free roaming such as a dog park. If she does have interaction with another dog, she becomes aggressive towards said dog and with her limited hearing and sight, it can be difficult to redirect her. She should be on leash or in a fenced in yard at all times for this reason and cannot live with any other dogs, no exceptions.\n\nCats, however, she does fine with. She currently lives with two sassy cats and coexists with them great. They call the shots and Mabel just plays by their rules. Her only caviat is making sure there is no food/treat in the reach of both Mabel and the cats, otherwise she will nip or bark at them in defense of her precious morsels!\n\nMabel has separation anxiety. Along with whatever made her scared of dogs in her past life, also made her very scared of losing you. You will have yourself a Mabel shaped shadow if you go too far. She wants to be by your side! We give Mabel some medication to relax her if we know she will be left at home alone. She will bark (the only time you'll ever hear her bark) when she is kenneled, no shared walls of apartments for this gal. She can only be left at home in what we call \"the Alcatraz kennel.\" A kennel that is heavy duty and unable for her to sneak out of. These kennels are a must have for any dog with separation anxiety and she will destroy a regular kennel if tried.\n\nShe loves car rides! If you need a road trip companion, she is down to clown. She loves being in the car for errands, long trips, anything. We find it hilarious that she willingly jumps into any vehicle, despite what her mother probably told her about taking rides from strangers! Silly Mabel.\n\nShe loves a good walk and a good sniff if you can remember not to let her have any other dog within her reach. She will gladly say hello to every kid and human on the other hand. She is still working on her walking manners. She's always a bit excited to be out on the town so we are still working on the not pulling part! This \"going for a walk\" thing is so cool to her, she is trying hard to be a good girl during all of it!\n\nShe knows how to shake paw, sit, go lay down, come, and more. An old dog can learn new tricks! She would love the chance to prove it to you! She does not chew on or play with toys at all. This is probably because of her lack of past dental care. She does, however, enjoy a good kong of peanut butter and gumming/chewing a good bully stick. She currently eats only wet food, or dry dog food that has been softened a bit with some water. We are pretty sure that dry food is just too painful for her to eat, as she will completely ignore it.\n\nAt night, Mabel sleeps with us at the foot of our bed. Her fear of crates and separation do make it difficult for her to sleep outside of your room. She prefers to at least be on a comfy bed on the floor, as long as it's in the room you sleep in too.\n\nMabel still has lots of love to give. We know she has quite the story, but she is hoping someone is willing to hear this story and check her out. She would make a great addition to a home that is busy or not busy, as long as there is a human at home generally most of time. No other dogs around or access to dogs is also important to her, along with the understanding that she is a senior and may just need your couch spot for a good nap. Mabel will need a kind and patient home that is willing to learn the joys and caviats of senior doggy care.\n\nIf you have a home that sounds like a good fit and a heart that is open and ready for some loving, I promise Mabel will tell you every day, that you are her favorite human that ever did walk this earth.\n\nInterested in adopting this lovable animal? Please go to our website www.wagsmn.org and fill out an Adoption Application. Once the application is processed, a Wags representative will contact you, answer any questions you may have, and set up a time/location for a meet and greet! A home visit is required prior to adoption.\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt!\n\nBreed and temperament determination: Wags & Whiskers Animal Rescue attempts to determine breed and temperament using a combination of looks, information provided to us at intake, and our experience with the animal while in our Rescue.

Cooper would do best in a home that has experience with Huskies and their ways. He can be very mouthy and needs someone who can give him consistency and training. Cooper is a beautiful all white pup with medium length hair. He has gorgeous ice blue eyes that look into your soul! \nCooper came to BARK after being found as a stray dog. He has since been neutered and all of his vaccinations have been updated. He has also been microchipped. Cooper tends to give tiny nips while playing and over stimulated so a home without children is requested. He is alright with other dogs, but a slow introduction is a MUST. He can be very nervous at first meeting and will tend to shake when nervous. \nCoopers ideal home would be with an adult who has time and patience to train this sweet boy to become the perfect dog he is meant to be.",

She is was initially very skittish, but this has gotten better as she's felt more comfortable. She is good with older kids. She is good with other dogs, but might be too much for any that don't want to play quite a bit as she's still very puppyish :) She is very sweet and will make a great pet for someone with the time and energy to continue her training.\n\nUPDATE: while Rye was initially ok with the cat, she has started to overwhelm/chase and corner the resident dog assertive cat. Would recommend she go to home without cats\n\nIf you are an approved adopter and are interested in this dog, please let your case worker know. If you are not yet an approved adopter but are interested, please complete an adoption application!\nYou can review our adoption process, www.shenandoahrescue.org/adoption-process if interested. Donations can be made at shenandoahrescue.org/donate or on PayPal to info@shenandoahrescue.org",

Learn more about Churro below!\n\nAbout Churro:\n\nMy name is Churro! I came from South Dakota in early December. The clinic told my foster mom that I am 3 months old and am a lab mix. I do enjoy playing hard, my litter mate and I love to wrestle!\n\nI have not had any exposure to dogs outside my litter since I arrived here in the Cities. I think I would do alright if I was introduced slowly. I have not met any cats or small children but would expect that we would get along just fine as long as they respect my boundaries!\n\nI like my crate but I am still learning to sleep through the night. I am doing well on the leash, but most of our outings have been short trips around the block. I was just neutered, so my family wants to make sure that I am fully recovered before we venture too far from home. I am a quick-learner and am very treat-motivated. I have learned my basic commands (sit, come, and crate) and I am working on stay. House-training is going well! As long as we stick to the schedule, I expect to have this mastered in no time. At the end of the day, I do like to sit on the couch with my people and chew on a bone or one of my toys to wind down.\n\nAdoption Fee: $550\n\nTraining Requirement: Obedience Training 1\n\n*Foster to Adopt: I am looking for a forever home now, but I still need all my puppy shots! So I'm looking for a family that will be able to commit to bringing me to all of my appointments with TCPR until I'm ready to be fully adopted by you!\n\nMEET ME/ADOPT ME: If you'd like to arrange a meeting or begin the adoption process, please fill out an adoption application by visiting www.twincitiespetrescue.org/adopt/adopt-a-dog/ . A volunteer from Twin Cities Pet Rescue will contact you once your application is reviewed.\n\nFOSTER HOMES NEEDED!!! Twin Cities Pet Rescue is a volunteer-run, foster home-based organization. We can only rescue as many animals as available foster homes. Please consider saving the life of an animal in need and become a volunteer foster home today. To become a foster, fill out a dog or cat foster application on the Twin Cities Pet Rescue website: www.twincitiespetrescue.org . There is little to no cost to foster an animal. Twin Cities Pet Rescue provides its foster families with food, supplies, and veterinary care for its animals. All you need to do is supply the love!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Twin Cities Pet Rescue does not adopt to homes further than 60 miles from the Minneapolis/St. Paul Metro Area.",

This young Great Pyrenees girl didn\u2019t have a great start in life but she isn\u2019t looking back\u2014the sky is the limit! Alaska has a way about her that one can\u2019t help but love...especially after seeing her face with that inviting smile and contagious, positive attitude. She is very respectful of everything asked of her\u2014grooming, keeping her kennel clean, riding in the car, going in her kennel when asked. She had never been on a leash, so will need a person(s) willing to take her for consistent walks to continue her training. If we had to give Alaska a theme song it would be \u201cgirls just want to have fun\u201d :) She loves, loves, loves to play and will do everything in her power to entice even the grumpiest dogs to play while somehow managing to respect their space. No worries, because she loves to play with people equally. She greets her human every morning by running up, bowing down and giving her a look inviting play. Cats are a no for this girl but older children are a yes! Alaska needs a home with a family who will appreciate her zest for life, the time and desire to play and continue her training, a large fenced yard, a playful dog would be a bonus but not required for the right family\u2014are you the active, fun family Alaska is waiting for?\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nNGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY. View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

Jessas favorite things include cuddles from her foster humans or keeping to herself and chewing on her toys. Jessa has decompressed in her foster home in the city and has greatly improved her leash walking skills! She ignores most dogs on her walks, and occasionally wags over to sniff them hello. She hasnt lived with other dogs, so would do best in the home as the only pet. She is super gentle, takes treats so nicely and is excellent with children. Jessa is about 2 years old and a perfect 50 pounds full grown! Shes super smart at learning her commands, loves belly rubs and is even crate and potty trained WHAT A GEM. Jessa does take some time to adjust in a new environment, and her ideal home would be with a household experienced with large breeds. Jessa cant wait to find a home to give her all the love and affection shes been missing out on. Is Jessa the one you need in your life?",

The staff has been hard at work learning about this guy and getting some weight on him. Although this guy is super sweet and playful, we have also learned he is food aggressive. Although this is something that can be corrected and we are working on, we are prioritizing homes with no other animals or children to keep everyone safe! Chance is smart, treat motivated, and eager to start an adventure filled life with a new family. The Humane Society of Warren County is running by appointment only with approved applications.

She loves to go on walks multiple times a day, and with her big stride and hound voice, she needs to be in the countryside. She had lived with one family her whole life, and then through no fault of her own, she was passed around to a couple new homes before making her way to us. It was discovered that she chases cats, and doesn't seem to like other dogs. She seeks a home that she can reside in by herself, and has a nice couch to sleep on. She loves a good car ride, and is crate trained. When outside she loves to keep her nose to the ground but does react to big loud noises.\n\nA Good Manners training class is included in her $350.00 adoption fee. Please call the Adoption Center at 802-476-3811 to schedule a time to talk to an adoption counselor about Mayberry, and to determine if you should meet her.",

            "description": "Meet Choppa who is a very special boy! Choppa came to us with severe allergies. His paws were swollen to twice their normal size and he was red with irritation over his entire body, to the point, he had lost fur in some of the locations. Allergies can be difficult to diagnose on any dog, but with Choppa being as young as he is, we wanted to make sure he had a chance! We switched his food over to a different protein and we ordered him a dose of Cytopoint. Choppa no longer looks like the same dog! The Cytopoint runs around $154.97 for a dose and a dose lasts 8-12 weeks. Choppa had the injection on 12/2 and he still looks great! So his adopter will need to be able to provide for his allergies as needed. Choppa formerly lived with a Poodle and his previous owner says he loves people and other dogs but has never been around cats. (NOTE: We do require dog-to-dog meet and greets if you already own a canine and are interested in adopting Choppa!) His previous owner also related that he is housetrained, but new adopters should always expect an accident or two as Choppa falls into his new schedule! He loves squeaky toys and will play with them by himself. He also knows Sit and Paw. As a young, strong dog who is still learning his manners, older children are recommended. He is strong on leash, but luckily, the HSWC has just partnered with GoodPup! and Choppa can receive a free week of training and the adopter will get 20% off training for life (your life!). Choppa is enjoying quiet time in the back of the shelter, so you will not see him on our Adoption floor but please ask to meet him! We think you will fall in love!",

He is already a volunteer favorite and we would love to tell you more about him! Ask us how to meet this diamond in the rough today.\nBentley is now enjoying the foster good life and learning all of the good things!\nFor more information, please contact Louann (a volunteer with Jxn Friends of the Animal Shelter) via phone email (lrobertson07@hotmail.com).

He will need someone to take him on walks, he's excellent on the leash, and play ball with. He does jump when excited so it would be best for him to be in a house with school aged children or older. Willie has been great with other dogs but would do best in a home without an alpha dog. He loves car rides and loves water, he will even try to jump in the shower with you\nHit us up on PM or head to our web site and fill out an application:\nhttps://thefarmdogrescue.com/farm/adopt-application/\nThe Farm Dog Rescue\nPalm City, FL\n772-224-3323\nthefarmdogrescue@gmail.com",

He is a big boy who is looking to share his home with big kids that enjoy his exuberant personality. Zoosk is looking for an active family that is willing to put the time into some training, as he can be jumpy and mouthy when looking for treats and toys. He can be a little unsure around dogs, and will likely want to be the only dog in the home. Please bring in your dogs to meet with Zoosk before adoption. With the right home, and an experienced owner, Zoosk will certainly make an excellent companion dog! Zoosk is currently available for adoption in his foster home. Please call ahead before coming in to meet with him.",

One volunteer summed him up when she said he was a little Rascal. Yep, that's Smurf. We have videos that show him running around with a squeaky beer bottle toy and jumping on and off of a bench. Even better if he can sit on a lap with his toy squeaking away while getting lots of pets. With Smurf you get a fun dog with a big personality that will leave you laughing at his silly antics. You will never be bored with a Smurf in the house! Smurf is 1 year and 10 months old. Smurf is quite a character who looking for his perfect home. He has lots of love to give away (very enthusiastically). Wanna have fun? CHECK OUT HIS VIDEO ON YOUTUBE https://youtu.be/hiDSq0tzXF4",

I get along with dogs and kids, but have no experience with cats. I am up to date on all of my shots and housetrained as well!\n\nFee $100\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit petsaversshreveport.org and find our adoption application under the 'Dogs' tab.

He gets along great with other dogs, cats and children. He has some mild skin issues due to seasonal allergies, which is common. He is an easy going, mild, strong boy but is well mannered. He loves going on walks, but does pull so will require some leash manners. He has basic commands and is a wonderful watch/house dog. He melts with belly rubs and ear rubs! Saint loves the snow but won't stay out long in the cold. Absolute snuggle/cuddle bug!

He is an expert in yard zoomies and shows off his skills in the play yard! He is at his best when with his people and would do best in a home where his humans are present most of the time and/or there are other canine or feline friends for him to pal around with--he does well with cats! This boy is ready for a permanent place to land!  If your home checks off his boxes, we'd love to schedule a meet and greet with you and your pets!",

That is a Shitzu Poodle mix.  He is house trained, neutered, microchipped, current on all vaccinations, heart worm negative and on a preventative.\nCharlie only has two teeth but it does not stop him from enjoying his kibble.  He is very treat motivated.  Charlie is a true cuddle bug.\n\nAdoption fee $400\n** The Texas Comptroller now requires sales tax on adoption fees.\n\n** Temporarily Suspended due to COVID ** Monthly Meet & Greets  (12:00 - 2:00)\nPetco (in Leander) every 1st Saturday of the month\nPet Supplies Plus (Parmer & Mopac) every third Saturday of the month\n\n\n** Please note: Due to their size, our dogs are not suitable for homes with children under 5..\n\nWe do not have a facility, all dogs are fostered in the homes of our volunteers. If you are interested in adopting a dog from Lil' Paws Maltese Rescue and other Petite Paws, please visit our website at www.lilpaws-malteserescue.org and fill out an adoption application. This is the first step in our adoption process. Our goal is to place our dogs in safe, stable and loving homes in the Austin Metropolitan area. Thanks for looking!\n\nLil' Paws Maltese Rescue and other Petite Paws depends on donations to keep the dogs in our program healthy. Many health issues are taken care of before a dog leaves a rescue: spaying, neutering, immunizations, dental care, and in some cases major surgery. Because of the cost of this care, donations are essential to enable us to continue our work. If you would like to show appreciation for what we do and help us continue to do it please go to our website homepage and click the donate button. We thank you in advance for your support.",

            "description": "Noelle is a 2-3 year old, 56 lb, Coonhound/Retriever mix (best guess!). She was found as a stray in South Carolina so not much is known about her past, but she has been in a foster home in NH since 1/17, where her fosters are learning all about her personality.  \n  \nNot only is she stunning with a rich black and mahogany coat, Noelle is SO happy and a total sweetheart. ALL the time! Haven't seen a mean bone in her body. She absolutely loves people and bonds quickly. She would love to be in a home where she could be included in many activities with her humans! Noelle walks well with her Freedom harness on and with her medium-high energy, she would make a great walking, running, or hiking companion. Off-leash adventures might not be the best option for her without further training, due to the risks of her following her hound nose after smells and critters. She would love a fenced in yard where she is happy to run and she will entertain herself with some fun toys. \n  \nNoelle is friendly and playful with other dogs, but she does play very hard and fast and may be a bit overly rambunctious for some dogs, and may accidentally scratch or knock over small children. Noelle did do well with a 3 year old child and cats in the home when she was first picked up as a stray. She does not always pick up on other dog's cues/warnings to be left alone, she is learning. Noelle is comfortable being handled for baths, looking in ears, lifting up paws, wearing sweaters, wearing harnesses, etc. - in fact, she prefers that you be touching her at all times. She loves attention!  \n \nNoelle does have some puppy-like tendencies and needs continued training and guidance. But she is crate trained, potty trained, receptive to coming when called, has learned sit, is getting better about jumping by the day. With consistency she will pick up things quickly and is very eager to please! She accompanies her foster mom to work in a boarding facility and is very calm and quiet in her kennel suite. She's also very quiet when in her crate in the house. She whines sometimes, but very rarely barks at anything.  \n  \nNoelle tested positive for heartworm when she arrived at the shelter in December 2020 and is currently going through treatment plan. \n  \nApply to adopt here: http://longtraildogs.org/adoption-application/ e-mail lisa@longtraildogs.org for more info. \n",

Miska does great on her leash and is a super car rider despite her size. One of our favorite things about this lovely Malamute is her communication skills. She is quite the talker, and we always know how she's feeling. When she wants attention she makes the sweetest little mewing sounds, making it impossible not to respond to her with hugs and kisses. Miska loves soft squeaky toys and zooms with delight all around the big yards with them in her mouth. A good game of chase is high on her priority list but we must make certain that there is lots of affection when she tires out. Miska has never lived with another pup so we are not sure whether she would like that or not. We think she would probably be happiest as the \"only child.\"\n\nVisit Miska at www.hua.org!",

The family who owned her, only had her a short 2 days before they came to the decision that she was just not the right fit for their family. They were looking for more of a hunter, and Collette is just too skittish of a personality for that. \nAs stated above Collette is a skittish dog, and she really lacks in her confidence when dealing with new people and situations. When she was a young puppy she may not have been socialized and coming to a shelter setting as she was maturing was not ideal, since she basically grew up here, during a pandemic, and that limited her exposure to new people, events, and better socialization.\nCollette is one of the shelters special personalities, and it is going to take time, patience, and understanding from her new home to help her to develop the bond that she needs to build that confidence. She would benefit most from living with a single person as she does develop strong bonds to some people, but she may do ok with some couples. But that couple will have to make sure they both share in her care equally, or she will develop a stronger bond with one and she may feel the need to guard them. \nIf Collette can find someone with experience, and patience, in return they will be rewarded with a wonderful companion.",

Simba is looking for no worries for the rest of his days.This playful and sweet 6 month old American Stafford Terrier/ Hound mix is in puppy school 101 with a wonderful foster mom that volunteered to train Simba and socialize him with her dog. His training includes potty training, leaning basic commands, walking well on a leash and dog socialization. Simba would do great with a family that has time to continue his training and in a home with a well-behaved older dog that can gently help build his confidence and show him the ropes. We expect Simba to grow to a medium-large sized dog. To meet Simba, please fill out an application at www.abandonedpetrescue.org To meet this adoptable pet, please fill out an adoption application at www.abandonedpetrescue.org and a team member will contact you to schedule an appointment.",

She was so grateful to be saved, and gave birth to a whole bunch of fat, bouncing babies days after coming to HUA. She was an attentive and protective mother, even making sure that the runt of the litter got every chance she needed to survive and thrive. Now that Athena's babies have all found their new homes, Athena is ready to become somebody's baby. Besides being the prettiest thing, she is the sweetest thing. She loves treats, walks, toys, tennis balls, car rides and playing outdoors. She has gotten along quite nicely with the other dogs, even those who play a bit rough. She was a master of her obedience and agility classes. Athena has been a brave and tolerant dog -- she deserves a life of pampering and happiness, and she would prefer no small children that may be too rambunctious for her.. Her family will be rewarded with constant grins and epic butt wiggles.\n\nVisit Athena at www.hua.org!",

However, that hasn't dampened his love of the world and people, and he's ready to love his new forever family just as much!\n\nDega is a very active and loving boy who will keep you on your toes! Fetch is his absolute favorite pasttime, especially if you have tennis balls. If you don't, we recommend that you stock up quickly! Dega's previous family ranted and raved about how intelligent this sweet boy was - he is a super fast learner when it comes to tricks, and walks great on a leash. His person favorite trick is \"shake\" because it always got him the most treats, but he also knows sit, stay, and come! He is food-motivated and ready to learn and impress his new forever family with his pawesome skills, but at the end of the day, Dega is very affectionate and just loves to be around his people as much as he can.\n\nIn Dega's previous home, he lived with many adults and another dog and got along swimmingly with everyone! Dega would like to meet any resident dogs before going home to make sure they are a good match. He is not friendly with cats. Dega has been able to jump/climb shorter fences and should have a secure fence or regular leash-walking in his new home. He loves to spend time with his people so he won't mind being supervised when outside! \n\nDega had an incident in a previous home where he had been suddenly uncomfortable with a male visitor. Although he's generally a social butterfly, he would like to meet all members of his household before going home to ensure he will be a good fit. \n\nPlease follow this link to learn more about our current adoption process: https://toledohumane.org/covid-19-update",

Although she has already had a litter, the vet thinks she is only about 18-20 months old. She is still very much a playful puppy in many ways. She is housebroken, will \"sit\" on command and knows what \"no\" means. She is an inside dog and loves to cuddle with you on your favorite chair and if she has her way, sleep with you at night. :-). She would love to be your buddy and companion, doing what you do and going where you go. She also has a little fetish about \"chilling out\" on various tables tops. :) She is very funny. Her energy level would be great with another energetic and tolerant dog or somebody that wants to take long walks or jog with her daily. She loves to fetch and play tug-of-war. Her sweet and energetic disposition displays \"play aggression\" but no animosity. Because of her size, strength and playfulness she would probably do best in a home with another energetic, playful and tolerant dog and/or older children.",

            "description": "YOU MUST HAVE AN APPROVED APPLICATION IN ORDER TO MEET OUR PETS.\n\nLeo is a 65 pound blue nose Pit Bull and Boxer mix youngster. Leo just turned one year old on October 28th 2020.\n\nHe was adopted by his foster moms former roommate in June from a mutual friend of ours. Last month, she moved into an apartment closer to the city expecting to take Leo with her. Unfortunately she was unable to continue caring for him in her new home and requested I care for him until he could find a new home. Foster mom has grown very fond of Leo but cannot keep him since she works full time and already has a dog of her own, his brother Aries. \n\nLeo is one of the kindest and most loving dogs foster mom has ever had the pleasure of homing. He is very expressive, very empathetic and gentle, even though he can be quite clumsy. \n\nThat being said, Leo did not get the attention he deserved in his early months. He was adopted and rehomed once or twice before coming to live in his foster home in June of 2020 and because of that, his training was inconsistent. \n\nLeo knows his name, the commands sit and paw, but does not always feel motivated to respond to these commands and has been slow to pick up others. While he does not yet respond to stay, Leo will sit and wait patiently for his food to be placed on the floor before he eats. \n\nLeo loves to chew and has been known to snack on furniture, pillows and other household items within his reach however is less likely to do so the more toys and chew bones of his own he has. All he needs is redirection and consistency. Remember, he is still really just a big puppy!\n\nLeo is not food aggressive in the slightest! He is open to sharing snacks and toys and although he can be playfully possessive, it is only ever in hopes that he can start a friendly game of tug of war. \n\nLeo can sometimes be shy in front of other dogs (especially male dogs) and sometimes relies on his brother Aries to break the ice, however once he is made comfortable, you will never see a truer friendship than that which he offers, so while I remain cautious upon introductions, I do not consider Leo to be dog aggressive. \n\nLeo is partially house trained. He does not have a specific way of notifying you he needs to be let out and sometimes he will start pacing very quickly but not always. I normally keep track of the time between his last walk and last meal to know when he might have to go next, however I do rely on pee pads for him, which if provided he will use as opposed to going directly on the floor. \n\nLeo will be neutered and vaccinated before adoption.\n\nLeo needs a permanent home where he will be seen as a priority, and given the individualized attention he very much deserves. \n\nAdoptiin donation $125.\n\nPlease note that we do not ship animals. We also require a home visit before finalizing any adoptions so preference is given to applicants within a 90 mile range. You will be required to come to High Point, NC to meet/pick up your new pet.\n\nHOW TO APPLY:\n1. Go to www.lovingpetinnadoptions.org\n2. Click on the \"Adoption Application\" link on the left side of the page.\n3. The application will open as a PDF and you should have the ability to fill it in from that page. Be sure to complete all fields.\n4. Save the application to your computer, then attach in an email and send to petprojectnc@gmail.com\n5. Someone will review your application as soon as possible, usually within 24 hours, and will be in touch with next steps.\n",

            "description": "Benny is an almost 5-year-old foxhound/beagle mix. He was adopted through P&C around 4 months old after he was hit by a car. Benny still has a \"flat tire\" front foot, and doesn't like to go long walks (2+ miles) because of this. He is allergic to eggs, and has had skin issues with many dog foods and most treats. We have been purchasing Kirklands premium dog food for him (Very reasonable, from Costco) and giving him baby carrots as treats and have had NO skin allergy issues since. Benny is an indoor dog, he will bark if left outside. He is crate trained, but prefers to sleep on his doggie bed at night. He is completely housebroken and never has accidents. He is able to wait long periods of time before needing to go out. He likes going on walks and can fetch. He is most content to lay in the sun (inside) like a huge cat and nuzzle you. He doesn't bark unless someone comes in the the yard, to the front door, or if he sees other animals. He is not cat friendly, but does fine with most dogs. He knows the following commands: sit, shake, no, and \"go to bed\", he will go in the house if you say \"go to bed\" while outside. If inside, he'll actually go to his bed. We are looking for a foster/adopter for Benny. Older children only please. Benny does have some possessive quirks to him that we will need to talk to each possible adopter about. Please fill out an application to foster/adopt at https://www.pupandcatco.com/We do not have a shelter facility and our pets are housed in foster homes, vet clinics and local boarding facilities.\n\nMany of our adoptable pets attend adoption events each Saturday at Mall of Georgia Petsmart in Buford, Georgia from 11:30-3:00 pm\n\nPlease check with us to find out if a particular pet will be available. Dogs going to adoption event are typically posted on our Facebook page the day prior.\n\nDetails about our adoption procedures can be seen at www.pupandcatco.com.",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 8/18/2019\nReason for being in rescue: Rafiki was found as a stray and taken to a local NC shelter. CPR pulled him from the shelter.\nFoster location: Foster Home in Raleigh, NC\nSpecial Needs? Rafiki walks with an interesting gait for unknown reasons. This could be from an extended period of neglect. Rafiki is sensitive about his feet and muzzle but is getting better every day. He recently went to the vet for a nail trim and the tech said he did very well. We do believe that he still requires sedation grooming as the sound of clippers near his head and feet makes him nervous and can cause him to lash out. We will explore this more when he grows out from his last groom.\nWeight: 59 lbs - Rafiki is working on weight loss in his foster home\nHeight: 24 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $499\n\nFence needed? Yes\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Rafiki is not a dog for a first-time owner. He is a 6-year-old who has clearly faced challenges. He is used to playing by his rules and can be stubborn but does want to please his people. Rafiki's ideal owner is an experienced and patient standard poodle owner. Rafiki gets along well with other dogs both large and small but does not require a playmate. He would be happy as an only dog or with another mature dog that will respect his boundaries. He is indifferent to cats.\n\nGiven his sensitivities Rafiki is not a dog for a home with small children. Our perfect home for Rafiki will be an adult only home. He does well with adults and once you earn his trust and he knows you are a reliable source of attention; he is a love bug. Rafiki is not high energy, preferring to walk around the yard with you, go for a quiet walk or laze around the house.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Rafiki is named after the character in the Lion King. Like the Disney character, Rafiki has an outward personality that is eccentric and somewhat goofy. His bark is deep and somewhat hoarse. But a look deeper into this boy's eyes will show you a dog with a huge heart, a caring soul, and a strong desire to make deep connections.\n\nRafiki arrived at Dreamweaver Farms a mess. He was at least 15 pounds underweight, deeply matted, and the chaos of all the new experiences of being at a rescue was daunting. It took 3 days before he could hold down food. And almost 2 weeks before the light returned to his eyes. Through this all, Rafiki watched. He watched his caregivers. He watched the dogs around him. And he learned the routine.\n\nRafiki was found wandering the streets and had likely been there for a while. Food and grooming were far removed. But it is clear he was once someone's pet. This beautiful boy walks great on a leash, is crate trained, and gets along well with other dogs. In his foster home he is impeccably house trained. Rafiki has not had much experience riding in cars and his behavior in a car needs work. He becomes overly excited reacting to traffic and strangers.\n\nRafiki's time on the streets has left its mark on him. He will growl to warn you if he does not want to do something. He will snarl and bite if you push him. Rafiki needs time and patience when he first meets someone new. Give him time to come to you and he will nudge you for attention. Calm pets and a quiet voice will win his heart.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Cautious but friendly. Rafiki is not a dog that is comfortable with anyone forcing their attention on him. If he is approached without warning he may growl in fear.\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Rafiki is estimated at 6 years old.\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

Great dogs like me end up in animal shelters every day- I know, it\u2019s so hard to believe but it\u2019s true!\n\nMy name is Pretzel, and I just joined the adoptable doggy crew at Providence Animal Center after traveling here from Florida. I've been told that my sweet-looking face matches my personality. I'm around 12 years old, about 24 pounds, and I'm all set to move right into your heart & home today - already spayed, microchipped & up to date on vaccinations. \n\nI only have one request. I must go home with my best friend, Clifford. We are a bonded pair and can't imagine life without each other.  What's the gum commercial slogan... double the fun, double the pleasure.  Yup, that's us! You will get the best of both worlds. He's the outdoor type and I'm more a fan of the indoors. He's a slow and sloppy eater, so I quickly gobble up his mess. He's relaxed and I'm always in a hurry to be somewhere. I snuggle and he doesn't. I could go on and on. I think you just need to schedule your appointment to meet us!\n\nThe staff would love to match you with your new best friend forever - and hopefully that's me! Please schedule your appointment to meet us by going to providenceac.org/adoptadog/. We can't wait to see you! XOXO Pretzel\n\nBIG NEWS: Someone is so excited for me to find my fur-ever home, that they have sponsored my adoption fee! That means I can join your family today for FREE! Woohoo!!\"\n\n-------\nDuring your appointment, you will be able to meet a selection of pets in the Kennels or Cattery that day. New pets are arriving daily!\n-------\n\nProvidence Animal Center relies on adoption fees and donations to save pets! Adoption fees vary per pet. To find out this pet\u2019s adoption fee or for more information, please call the Adoption Center with this pet\u2019s ID number.\n\nCan\u2019t adopt? Consider fostering or donating!

I recently joined the adoptable doggy crew at Providence Animal Center's lifesaving facility after making the trip up from Florida, and I am hoping you will stop by soon to meet me in person!  \n\nMy name is Clifford, and I'm around 13 years old and about 45 pounds.  I'm all set to join my new family - already neutered, microchipped and up to date on vaccinations.  \n\nThe staff & volunteers are still learning about me, but Providence's Adoption Center has scenic and serene grounds where you can walk me around and get to know me in person. I've been described as a super sweet guy who loves loves loves to get scratchies! Just looking for a loving family to spend my golden years with - some comfy napping spots wouldn't be so bad either! I would love to go home with my best gal, Pretzel. We are a bonded pair and I can't imagine my life without her! \n\nA little about our quirky selves. I love the great outdoors, Pretzel would prefer to stay indoors. I like to slowly enjoy my food and, yes, I'm a sloppy eater, but don't worry Pretzel is a quick eater and will even clean up after me. She is the snuggler and I like my space. I'm not interest in toys, but that's Pretzel's happy place. What's that saying? ... Opposites attract. \n\nBONUS: A generous donor is eager to help me find my forever home, so they have sponsored my adoption fee! That means I can join your family today for FREE! YAY!\n\nI am lucky enough to be staying in a fabulous foster home while I wait for my forever family to find me. If you are interested in more information about me and/or would like to set up a meeting with me, please send a completed adoption profile (found here - https://providenceac.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Adoption-Profile.pdf)to foster@providenceac.org today!   My paws are crossed I will see you very soon! XOXO Clifford\"\n\n-------\nDuring your appointment, you will be able to meet a selection of pets in the Kennels or Cattery that day.

Luckily for her, after several days of surviving on the streets, she found her way to us. We think she is around 2 years old and looks to be a Chihuahua and Terrier mix. This little girl is just as adorable as can be. If she can sit on your lap while you have a blanket and a book she is as happy as can be. When you greet her in the morning, her tail wags so hard it almost spins off. She just loves her people and affection and will be so loyal to her person. She is a little timid with new people and in new situations. She would do best in home with only older children or no children. She is fostered with two Chihuahuas and a couple of kitties and gets along well with all of them. Sparrow is housetrained in her current foster home and fine being left uncrated for several hours. She is still learning her leash manners and can be hesitant on leash in new places but enjoys short walks with her foster mom. Sparrow is just a darling girl and her heart will make yours bigger! If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting Sparrow, then fill out an adoption application on our website today!

            "description": "Tinks is a ball of chocolate-y fun! If you are looking for your next adventure buddy, Tinks is the pup for the job. He is around 10 months old and we think he's a Terrier and Kelpie mix. He will likely be a medium dog when he gets done filling out. Tinks loves to play! He's bouncy and pouncy and still learning not to use his puppy teeth when playing so would do best in a home without small children at this time. Despite his small size, this boy has hops! He is very athletic and nimble, would love to be a running buddy and has a very herding dog personality. He likes to stay busy! He loves food and know show to sit for treats. Tinks is still figuring out his dog social cues and manners around other dogs so does best around tolerant dogs that don't mind an adolescent puppy that doesn't always know his boundaries. Tinks loves people, both men and women, and loves to crawl up in your lap. He is house trained in his current foster home but still getting used to the crate and can be a little vocal about his displeasure being in there. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting Tinks, then fill out an adoption application on our website today!

He is likely a Chihuahua Dachshund mix. Cooper is kennel-trained and potty-trained. Whenever I go out during the day, I do kennel him. He can sleep in a kennel at night; however, he does sleep with me on the bed. I live a slower, quieter life, so Im almost always home. Which means that were always together. Hes not used to the hustle and bustle of a busy household and hes never lived with kids or cats (or any other animals).\n\nCooper still has some puppy playfulness in him, but because of my lifestyle, he does sleep a lot as well. He loves curling up next to me in the chair or on the couch. And he loves pillows and blankets. He also loves toys, especially squeaky toys and stuffed animals. Cooper doesnt like being cold or being outside in the cold very long. He loves laying in the sun, whether hes outside or inside. He loves going places like to other peoples houses and to parks for walks, but he does shake and pant while in the car.\n\nCooper can be a nervous/anxious dog sometimes. Because were together so much, I do think he has some separation anxiety. He can sometimes (not always) resource guard food and toys with other dogs. Cooper is slow to warm up to men and prefers the company of women.\n\n \n\nApplications are at https://bit.ly/codys_adoption_application.",

            "description": "Meet Norah! Norah is one of about 50 dogs rescued from a neglectful hoarding situation in South Georgia back in early July. Some of the dogs on the property had been living inside and were more socialized, able to be adopted quickly. But sadly, there was another group that had lived their whole lives outside with little human interaction. It has taken a couple of months of living in a foster home for them to start realizing that there are good people in this world who will love and cherish them. These dogs have come amazingly far since being rescued but do still carry the weight of their previous life with them. As such, they have very specific adoption requirements listed below. Please understand, we have taken 3 months to get to know these dogs and what they need to succeed. The adoption requirements are not arbitrary but are what is needed for them to lead happy, healthy lives and as such no exceptions to these requirements will be allowed. \n\n \n\nNorah is about 3 years old and under 25 lbs. Shes a sweet, playful girl but still a bit on the shy side and is most fearful of men. She needs a patient adopter who is going to give her the time and space she needs to adjust and get comfortable in a new home. Sadly, Norah is terrified of men and will do best in a female only home. Given that the best teachers for dogs lacking confidence are other dogs, Norah also must have other dogs in the home with at least one of them being under 30 lbs and playful. She is learning to walk on a leash but has yet to gain enough confidence to go to the bathroom on leash and does require a SECURELY fenced yard - solid wood privacy fence only (minimum 6 ft); chain link, wrought iron, or other types of fencing are not sufficient. Lastly, given that Norah is still learning to trust people, she will not do well with the unpredictable nature of children. Homes with teenagers may be considered on a case by case basis, depending on the experience level of the family. \n\n \n\nWe do understand that the above requirements greatly narrows the pool of potential adopters and may even scare some people away. Norah is most definitely a work in progress but we cannot even begin to explain how rewarding it is to watch the transformation of a dog like this who has never known love before. Once they learn to love and trust, they are so very very grateful and the amount of love they have to give and their loyalty knows no bounds. If you are interested in becoming part of Norahs continuing story, email adrienne@rescuemega.org or fill out an adoption application on our website- www.rmgdogs.org",

            "description": "This is the second time our friend Doodle has been with us. Originally, he landed here when he arrived from Mexico. His owner there gave him away because they no longer wanted him. He was most recently relinquished because he was a bit too protective of his human which was strange behavior for him as he showed no aggression at all here. He seemed sad the first few days he was here, but once he started to remember staff, he perked up. Due to an atrophied left eye (where the eyeball sits further back into the socket), Doodle has limited sight. However, we feel one less eye makes him doubly handsome! It's like he's winking at you at all times. \"\"Doodie\"\", aka \"\"The Dude\"\", is lively and active, despite arthritis of the spine and hips. He gets along with his canine buddies, but doesn't hesitate to go off and do his own thing when he needs space. If he really wants to escape, he'll bury himself under a blanket or a bed! Doodle has that deep bark - that kind we imagine Barry White would have had if he were a canine. The kind of voice that calls your attention to all he has to say. Like all Pugs with humans, Doodle is never disappointed to see you. He'll quickly make his way to the gate of his suite, bringing with him the happiest tail you've ever seen! He is extremely loving and loyal. For this reason, he'd do best in an only dog home with no cats. As we mentioned, Doodle can be protective of his favorite human. We don't have any history of his life in Mexico, so the behavior could just be a matter of him not wanting to be abandoned; or that he didn't receive much attention in the home. Some patience and reassurance should help him along. If your life is void of a friend with pizzazz, spunk and one-and-a-half eyes, please mark Doodle as your number one choice!",

Upon pulling her from the county shelter, she was evaluated by an orthopedic specialist and found to have a complete cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) tear and meniscus damage in her left knee. She underwent surgery in September and is completing a lengthy rehabilitation and doing great! She also has a partial CCL tear in her other leg, meaning she may need another surgery in the future. She's a sweet, smart girl who does well with other dogs, is housetrained and crate trained. She has not been around cats in her foster home. Her adoptive family needs to be committed to caring for her orthopedic needs, particularly understanding the possibility that another knee surgery may be needed in the future. Would you consider making this 'star' a member of your family? Adoption applications can be submitted on our website www.heartsnhomesrescue.org.",

The family came and reclaimed the scruffy but left this sweet puppy to die. Situations like this are always heartbreaking and very hard for any of us with a decent moral compass to understand but we are thrilled to play a key role in his journey. He really needs a fantastic and loving foster or adopter to remind him that some humans are amazing and he is very loved. It is epically sad that at only 5 months he has to be reminded of that but we are sure his ppl are out there just waiting to welcome him home! \n\n \n\nIf interested in fostering or adopting please contact us ASAP! \n\nPlease remember that this is a puppy, this means he has typical puppy behavior. He will jump, nip, play bite, chew, have accidents etc. Remember he is a BABY!\n\nTo Contact Us\n\nMessage us through our website http://www.highplainspaw.org\n\nMessage the Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/HighPlainsPAW\n\nFill out our Adoption Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/adoption-application\n\nFill out our Foster Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/foster-application\n\nEmail us at highplainspaw@gmail.com\n\nCall our voicemail at (402)957-1578 \n\n \n\n $300.00 Adoption Fee + $50.00 Refundable Spay/Neuter Deposit \n\n(The $300.00 is considered a nonrefundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible. The fee itself is not negotiable, our vets don't negotiate and thus neither do we).\n\n \n\nWE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY ALL OUR DOGS ARE LOCATED IN FOSTER HOMES. This means there is no place for you to go in person to view our dogs. We ask that an application be filled out and we will go from there!",

Sybil inquired and found out she came in with a boyfriend, aka Halsten, so now here we are. She's a shy but very friendly girl, she can be a tad unsure at first but warms up quickly. She is dog friendly and has had roomies since being at the shelter. She was nervous so the vet couldn't palpitate her belly but we do NOT think she's pregnant, just kinda chunky, and let's be honest no ones Covid body is on point hahaha. This sweet girl still needs spayed and to have entropian surgery on her eyes but she is available for a foster or foster to adopt home! If you feel you could help her please contact us!!\n\n $300.00 Adoption Fee + $50.00 Refundable Spay/Neuter Deposit \n\n(The $300.00 is considered a nonrefundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible. The fee itself is not negotiable, our vets don't negotiate and thus neither do we).\n\nTo Contact Us\n\nMessage us through our website http://www.highplainspaw.org\n\nMessage the Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/HighPlainsPAW\n\nFill out our Adoption Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/adoption-application\n\nFill out our Foster Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/foster-application\n\nEmail us at highplainspaw@gmail.com\n\nCall our voicemail at (402)957-1578\n\nWE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY ALL OUR DOGS ARE LOCATED IN FOSTER HOMES. This means there is no place for you to go in person to view our dogs. We ask that an application be filled out and we will go from there!",

WE are a high intake No Kill Shelter ran by a staff of 4 and do not always have time to answer every question asked by so many. If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced. It is never our intention to ignore a request about an adoptable animal in our facility.\n\nSandy Brown, Director, PAW Animal Shelter\n\n319-372-2274",

She absolutely loves to be with people and to be where all the action is. She loves to play outside and run as fast as she can doing zoomies when she is first let outside. Sticks from the yard, Kongs and bones will keep her occupied and happy all day!\n\nCharlotte gets along well with all dogs, but does not like a barrier in between them and will growl if there is one. She also prefers to eat alone. She does very well with kids but doesn't realize how big she is, so would probably do best in a home with older children. She has a very sweet and loving demeanor, is full of life and listens well! She absolutely loves people and being included as part of the family!\n\nHer ideal home would be with someone with time and patience to continue with her crate and house training. She will go in her crate easily for a treat but will bark if she hears activity going on in the house without her. She is doing well with house and leash training, but needs a little more practice.\n\n\nPlease Note: All dogs currently available for adoption are posted on our website. If you cannot find a particular dog on our website, he/she may be on a temporary foster hold. All dogs are otherwise posted until they are officially adopted. This dog may have other interested adopters in line. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application.",

            "description": "It's not just her name that is sweet! Candy Apple is a lovable pup that is so sweet she will actually hug you while resting her head on your shoulder. Who couldn't use more hugs in their life? While cuddling and snuggling are some of her favorite activities, Candy also has an energetic, playful side. Her favorite games are tug of war and fetch, and she would love to be your new hiking or running buddy. Also, she will always protect you from those mean old stuffed animals laying around, especially any that have squeakers in them. When it's time to quiet down and relax in her crate, she settles down after a few barks and is able to keep herself entertained with Kongs or chew toys. Did we mention that Candy Apple loves to play? This outgoing pup loves to initiate play and will be such a fun companion. Sometimes she gets a little too excited to play, and shows her enthusiasm with a nip. She is eager to learn how to contain her excitement better and would love some continued training. She is also ready to learn some new tricks! She has mastered 'sit, and can't wait to see what else you will teach her. Candy Apple will also need some help with house training. With some support and structure, she'll have it down in no time. Candy loves walks and does well on a leash, but sometimes pulls strongly when she's anxious to show you something cool. Hold tight and let her know gently that you're the boss. Candy Apple has so much love to give that she would do best in a house where she's the only pet. She is a very good guard dog, and will do a great job making you feel safe. You'll sleep tight with Candy Apple by your side. Come meet this sweet treat today!",

He knows basic commands and does well with a routine.  He also loves  just hanging out with his person or people snuggling up on a bed or watching TV. He takes frequent trips to Big Bear with his foster and loves the adventure. Great on the long car ride. He will truly be your best friend. He is an escape artist meaning if door or gate is open he will dart out so a high secure fence or wall  is required as well as a yard. He thrives best in  a quiet household with an attentive and doting owner. A bustling home might be too much for him. \nPlease contact us for more info on Wyatt if you feel your a match",

He is super smart and eager to please, plus he is super treat motivated so he learns quickly. Bull is good with other dogs, but not good with cats (from what we know so far). He is very friendly and LOVES people!\n\nHe has not yet been intro'd with kids, but given his size suggest he may do better with older kids (teens+).\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this dog, please visit our website for our online application www.underdogaz.com\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This dog is courtesy posted for another individual or Rescue.

            "description": "This is Jules!\n\n11-year-old Jules came to us from Downey Shelter on January 5th. She\n\nwas literally just being surrendered by her owner as our volunteer was there to pick up six other soo-to-be Frosted Faces.\n\nShelter s\n\ntaff took her straight back to medical, and Jules could not catch her breath, coughing and coughing. They asked if we would take her. When\n\nJules arrived at FFF her gums were pink and her temperature was normal. She ate a hearty meal and fell fast asleep where her breathing normalized.\n\nWe took Jules to College Animal Hospital right away where she was diagnosed with severe bronchitis. Additionally, the skin on her entire back end was leathery and bald, like we're used to seeing in many flea infested outdoor dogs.\n\nWe started her on antibiotics, steroids, and pain medication.\n\nJules takes those tiny grammy steps that melt your heart.\n\nShe walks super quickly and boops her nose under your hand for pets.\n\nWe are so grateful that Jules was able to go immediately on a two week Frosted Fling, so she can have the comforts of home and receive extra attention as her health issues are addressed. Things are looking up for our sweet girl!\n\nCheck back soon for an update on how Jules is doing!\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees, and we help with medical costs!\n\nApply to become a family: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 1/19/21 KG",

Ideal home is one that knows the breed or corsos. She would do well with basic training and someone that sets rules and boundries with her.

            "description": "Meet Atlas!\n\nAtlas was found as a stray and brought to Downey Shelter. We're not sure what happened to his eye, but it was already missing when he arrived. He is 8 years old and weighs 10 lbs. We vetted Atlas the day after he arrived and found his x-rays and blood work were overall normal.\n\nThe Foster Family of our Frosted Faces Carlton and Mikey decided to take another pup on a two week Frosted Fling, and they chose Atlas!\n\nHere's an update:\n\n\"As we are nearing the end of our fling with Atlas, we have certainly learned some valuable things about him. After we discovered he was able to jump out of an x-pen, we put him in a crate when we left for a short time. The first day he shredded his potty pad, and the second day he shredded the blanket that we put over the crate to make him more comfortable and secure, silly us! So, safe to say he would definitely prefer to be in a home where someone is home a lot of the time to follow around, or someone that will take him wherever they go. We also learned that he loves to snuggle in bed under the covers with or without us.\n\nAtlas gets along great with our dog Butch and fling brothers Mikey and Carlton. And he has never even acknowledged our cat, which I know she is grateful for! Atlas is working on his potty manners and the belly band is helping. He has started going to the door when he needs to go out. He walks very well on a leash and would be a great walking/hiking partner. Atlas jumps on the couch for some cuddle time and sleeps in his crate all night without any accidents. He is a expert sleeper and has also slept the whole night through at the foot of our bed, and we had to wake him up to go outside in the morning. Atlas also walks well on a leash. We hope that he finds his family soon!\"\n\nAtlas is ready for a Forever Family!

No adoption fees, and we help with medical costs!\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated 1/23/21 KG",

            "description": "Up for adoption in Texas: Duke.\n\nDuke is a six-year-old, 72 lb. black lab mix. \n\nDuke was rescued from a shelter where he was surrendered by his owner who was in the predicted path of Hurricane Laura. \n\nAs it turns out, Duke was one of about 70 total pets in a hoarding situation. He came to Lucky Lab 15-20 lbs. underweight. \n\nWe are pleased to report that Duke has made it through his heartworm treatment and is also now a healthy weight.\n\nDuke is a medium-energy dog who loves to go on brisk walks and smell ALL the smells! He is very strong on a leash and is known to take his walkers for their walks. \n\nHe will require leash training if leash walking is a desired skill. He loves to greet fellow canine walkers with enthusiastic barking. He is not aggressive but is expressing his desire to go say hello.\n\nDuke is also a big fan of sunning in the backyard and rolling in the grass.\n\nDuke loves to be near his humans. He is perfectly content to lay on the kitchen floor while you are making dinner or watch TV with you in the evenings. He is very flexible about hanging out with you. \n\nIn his current foster home, he knows to stay off the furniture. However, he has shown interest in getting on the couch and would be happy to snuggle up once invited. \n\nHe is fully crate trained, and sometimes enjoys going in his crate just for a nap on his orthopedic bed. Duke is crated when no one is home and overnight. He is very curious and LOVES stuffed animals and socks, especially if they belong to his current human siblings.\n\nDuke will do best in a home with other Labs or larger dogs. He has done well in another foster home with Labs and does well meeting new friends his size. Duke is currently in a home with two kids - 11 and 8 years old. While he does well with them, he can get over-excited and want to continue to play even when they are done. He may do best in a home with older children.\n\nDuke is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, and housebroken. He is ready for his furever home. Could that be yours? If so, please apply on our website now: www.luckylabrescue.com",
