            "description": "Marty is an adorable and shy 6 month old.  He weighs about 25 lbs and is very sweet.  He likes to play and do all puppy things, but may need a few minutes to get past his initial shyness with new people. Marty feels most comfortable in the company of other welcoming and playful dog(s). Marty needs a family that will love him, teach him new things (like the stairs), socialize him with other friendly pups, give cuddles when it's time for bed, and help him grow into a confident dog. \n\nHere at NMAR, we don't just find good homes for our dogs, we find the the specific good home for each specific dog. While we work toward those matches, our dogs are safe and happy in foster homes, or in our home-like shelter, where they have the chance to learn some life skills and show us what they need to be happy and healthy.\n\nREQUIREMENTS:  Marty needs a home with a fenced yard and another playful, confident dog that will show him the ropes.  Kids should be older than 10 years due to his shyness.\n\nAdoption fee is $225 and includes: spay/neuter, parvo/distemper series of shots, rabies (if dog is old enough), bordetella, heartworm preventative while here, worming, and microchip. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting Marty, please visit our website and fill out an adoption application: www.northmeckanimalrescue.org",

            "description": "FOSTER UPDATE:\n\nPETIE! Its safe to say that Petie takes two things very seriously in life, relaxing and babysiting. Petie has been in foster for a little over a week now and has truly shown us how wonderful he is. He is great in the home and will be a wonderful family addition. He needs to be the only dog and he does suffer from chronic allergies that his new family will need to work with their vet to manage. Dont let this sweet senior slip through your fingers!\n\nPETIE - 9 1/2 years old, 70 pounds, house trained, good with kids and cats, no other dogs, friendly, happy, excited on the leash, loves to walk, loves to play, sits on command, loves treats, pulls on the leash.\n\nPETIE is that dog. You know, the one who makes you smile from the start. He's happy and he himself has a perpetual smile on his face. Nothing gets him down. He's excited to meet you and excited to go outside. He pulls on the leash... in that excitement... consider yourself forewarned! He was raised with small children but this doesn't mean he should be left unsupervised with new children in the beginning. Letting new dogs get settled in a new home is important as the dog gets used to everything and you get used to him. PETIE is good with cats but remember, your cat is new to him so slow introductions will be so beneficial for all. PETIE is already house trained and very experienced in a home. He has always been left free roaming in the home when the owners went out without issue. Petie is accepting appointments now! Call the Virginia Beach Animal Care and Adoption Center at 385-4444 or go to our Facebook page and make an appointment to meet him. We're open daily except for Tuesday's. Thank you for choosing adoption!",

            "description": "Sparkle was adopted through K9O as a puppy and was recently returned to us. As she matured it turned out that she was not a good fit for her adoptive family. She is now 1.5 years old and doing very well in her foster home. She is athletic and loves walks, but also enjoys a good nap and snuggle session.\n\nSparkle can be picky about her people and is sometimes nervous around new friends. She prefers a calm energy and would do best in a quiet home without small children. She gets along with other dogs but takes time to warm up and does not like to share, so she should be the only dog in the home or under the care of humans who understand how to manage resource guarding behaviors. She has not been cat tested at this time.\n\nSparkle would love a fenced yard to run in! She is 100% potty trained and is very well-behaved. She had a chance to prove herself recently, spending the whole day with free run of the house and she did not get into any trouble! She is a very good girl and deserves a very good home.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Sparkle, please submit the application at k9orphans.org to be considered.",

He saw her lying next to the bike path and she appeared to be suffering or dying. He was not able to get close to her so he reached out to rescues and posted on social media until we answered his plea.\n\n\nLike so many other dogs living in the woods, along with our bayous, or on the streets, Cassi was starving and terrified. The heat had become unbearable for her, especially without any water or shelter. She was evaluated at Vergi an emergency vet who gave her fluids and monitored her overnight. She was able to go to our usual vet where she received her vaccines and was given the okay to go into a home to gain weight to be healthy enough to be spayed. She unfortunately is heartworm positive and HAS COMPLETED HEARTWORM TREATMENT ALREADY. Cassi was very scared of people when she was first rescued. We brought her to a boarding/training facility for the staff to help socialize her.\n\n\nSince she has been there, she has absolutely blossomed with people and she is great with other dogs. She has gained weight and she is more than ready for a home of her own! Cassi is clean in her kennel, great on\u00a0 a leash, and pretty laid back in general.\n\n\nThe vet believes she is about 3 years old and she weighs 60 lbs. Cassi is now spayed, up to date on vaccines, and has completed heartworm treatment.\n\n\nEmail us at info@adorehouston.org if you have questions about Cassi!",

He has issues with resource guarding and is fence reactive to the point that he will \"zone out\" and forget that the person on the other side is a friend. He has great potential, but this is a dog that wants a job, activity and training! He has taken his resource guarding to the point that he has actually bitten people and other dogs. He needs an outlet for his energy and the right person to work on his behavioral issues. He is very food motivated and we have been working to teach him to sit and wait for his bowl, and to eat once he has been told to \"get it\". Shadow loves and craves attention and affection. If you have a predictable, adult only home and feel that you are willing and able to give Shadow what he needs to be a happy and content companion, please email us at sanctuary@milofoundation.org\n\nPast Notes: His main issues are resource guarding and high drive. He is very ball motivated, He is a great swimmer and it is serves as a great anxiety reducer for him. He will charge off and should be on a long line. He does return. He is a natural hunter and needs extensive training for his behavior issues. Someone with patience and understanding. I truly love him.",

            "description": "Kingston is a handsome 7-year old male Pit Bull Terrier who arrived at the HSOV on September 21, 2020 after he was picked up in the Cutler Ohio area by the Washington County Dog Warden (and was surrendered by his owner).\n\nKingston has a brown short smooth coat with a large patch of white on his chest, a long tail, and an adorable face with a splash of white on his muzzle/white stripe on his forehead, a liver-colored nose, and short cropped ears. Kingston was quite friendly when HSOV Kennel tech Kim Cowman accompanied him outdoors for his photo session when these photos were taken on September 22, 2020 :)\n\nThe information on Kingston's intake form indicates that he is not good other animals. He apparently was kept indoors since it is noted that Kingston is housebroken.\n\nKingston weighs 55 lbs and walks fairly well on a leash.\n\nKingston was neutered on September 30, 2020 and was also given rabies vaccine. Kingston was adopted later that afternoon.\n\nUPDATE: We were saddened when Kingston was returned to our shelter on January 7, 2021. His adopter stated that Kingston did not get along with her other dog. \n\nKingston appears to have some arthritis (or neurological issues) in his hind legs and hips and also has a slight head tilt these days :( We are listing him as a 'Special Needs Dog' for that reason but we prefer to think of him as merely very special.  Kingston still loves to walk with our kennel techs and volunteers and puts forth a noble effort whenever anyone offers him the opportunity for some one-on-one time and attention :)\n\nSo this sweet boy is looking for a fabulous home with a compassionate individual or family who will love and cherish him forever and ever.\n",

            "description": "Puppy wiggles, bright eyes, and a heart full of happiness... sound good? This is Mona, a sweet, happy girl looking for her place in the world. Could that place be with you?\n\nMona is a 34lb Carolina Dog and approximately 9months old. She's all happiness and puppy love! She gets so happy that the wiggles shake her whole body! Mona is still a puppy and is working on all that comes with that. She sleeps in her kennel and stays fairly quiet. She still has accidents, but is getting better and better with each passing day! Mona is good with other dogs of all sizes, but she is still learning manners and body language! For a puppy, she does have a fairly good \"off switch\" and will take naps throughout the day! So if you're looking for a sweet, trainable puppy to help guide to adulthood, Mona is your girl!\n\nFor adoption information or to complete an application, please go to: http://www.pawsinthecity.org/adopt.htm\n\nReferences and a home visit are required for all adoptions.",

            "description": "MEET CANNON !!!\n\nThis boy is just amazing with both big and small dogs, but is a rough and rowdy player. Cannon would do great with another like minded dog with a big fenced yard to play. Because of his rowdiness, please consider a slow introduction to other family dogs. Cannon is doggie door trained and doesn't mind being crated while you are away from home. This sweet boy is still a pup and demonstrates lots of typical puppy behavior--occasional digging, mouthy and jumpy when excited. He may be too rough for young children. And keep flip flops, couch pillows and other fun items out of reach! Cannon likes to take them outside and eat them. Also, some other favorites include rope toys for tug of war, chew toys, tennis balls and bones. Kongs with peanut butter are the best and will make him happily go in his kennel.\n\nCannon also enjoys walks and would be a great hiking partner. He is still working on his leash manners and does like to pull. He is a bit car shy but once in, he settles down quickly and is very well behaved. Although Cannon is a great sleeper at night, but he is a early riser and ready to play! This friendly boy likes everyone he meets--he just loves attention. Cannon could use some basic training but he is intelligent and eager to please and will learn very quickly. Won't you give Cannon a chance? He has a lot of potential and can't wait for you to make him part of your family.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this dog, please visit our website for our online application www.underdogaz.com",

He\u2019s about 10 years old and weighs just 14 lbs. \n\nWe took him to Berkeley Veterinary Clinic to have him evaluated. Teddy\u2019s blood work is fine. He's amazingly heartworm negative and now groomed and neutered. \n\nTeddy is blind because of dry eye which was never treated. Other than that, he's a healthy, loving, happy little guy! And house-trained! Because of his blindness, he can become a little anxious if he can't find his way out of rooms. Teddy loves to be near the sound of his foster mom\u2019s voice and he follows her voice by command. Teddy walks fine on leash. He is very laid back with no running or jumping.\n\nTeddy enjoys exploring around the house and in the yard, but he needs to be closely monitored. Teddy has special needs which include blindness in both eyes and possibly some skin allergies. His skin is improving with treatment. (Teddy will likely need lubricant drops for his dry eyes daily for the rest of his life).\n\nTeddy loves snacks and puppy massages. The company of other dogs and cats do not bother him. When foster mom leaves Teddy alone, she leaves him confined to an area of the house or his puppy pen to ensure his safety and comfort. He is happy snuggled in his bed and blanket.\n\nTeddy is up-to-date on vaccines, neutered, microchipped and being maintained on monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention.\n\nTeddy will need a home that has experience with blind dogs. He also needs a loving and calm environment. He still has good years left to give his person lots of LOVE. Thanks to Berkeley Veterinary Clinic and Cuts-4-Muttz for helping this sweet senior boy!\n\nMessage from foster mom: It has been a joy to foster Teddy. He is the sweetest little guy and no trouble at all. Senior dogs are the best!\n\nThis dog is currently being fostered as part of Diamonds in the Ruff Canine Rescue. An application is required, along with a home visit and small adoption fee.  Applicants must be at least 21 years of age. **FENCED IN YARD REQUIRED**\n\nPlease visit us on our Facebook page for additional photos, give us a like while you're there! \nhttps://www.facebook.com/diamondsintheruffNC\n\nAll of our dogs are fostered in homes and are INDOOR dogs. We believe all dogs are family members and should be treated as valued members of the household. \n\nPlease review our adoption guidelines for further information on adopting from Diamonds in the Ruff Canine Rescue before submitting an application. www.DITRnc.com.\n\n\n.",

            "description": "Breed: German Shepherd\nSex: Neutered Male\nDOB: ~09/07/2018\nWeight: 70 lbs\nEnergy Level: Medium\nPersonality Type: Timid but Curious, Quiet, Sweet, Energetic\nHistory: Transferred from another shelter/puppy mill seizure\nGood With: Dogs\nFence Requirements: Physical fence required. \nIdeal Home: Dog-experienced home. No young children (teenagers ok).\nSpecial Info: Remi is discovering his love for tennis balls!\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

            "description": "Please note that while we are closed to the public we will not be responding to pet inquiries. Once animals are posted, we immediately begin receiving adoption applications. With one volunteer available to review all applications, we appreciate your patience as you wait for an email response. Adoption appointments are scheduled in the order that approved applications are received. You can find our adoption procedures and online application at warmhearts.org/adopt.\n\nBlue came to us with a group of 21 dogs who had become too much for the property owner to handle. Blue had a small litter of puppies here; and now that they have been adopted, it is her time to find a forever home. Blue is a loving girl and seems to do fine with all people and other dogs. She's a bit shy and may be a flight risk, so she'll need a wooden privacy fence in order to stay safe while exercising and being outside for potty breaks. Blue's estimated DOB is 5/1/2018; she weighs about 44 pounds at this time. We do not know if she's house trained, but she is good on a leash.\n\nHSPC's adoption fee is seventy-five-dollars through December 31, 2020, unless stated otherwise within the pet's description. At times, our adoption fees are lowered during special events that are posted to our website or Facebook page. Every pet that is available for adoption has been spayed/neutered, microchipped, and is up-to-date on vaccinations including heartworm preventative (canines). Adopters are required to schedule a wellness exam with their veterinarian at their cost within 7 days of adoption.\n\nPlease only submit one application. Once you are contacted by email, you will have an opportunity to provide us with any additional animal(s) under consideration.",

To arrange a meet and greet with a dog, you MUST fill out the adoption application so that it can be sent to the foster parent for review to determine if your home is a match for the dog. If a dog receives multiple applications, we operate on a best-fit basis, not first come first served.***\n\n\nHello world!!!\n \n\nMy name is Kane and I am the most handsome, lickey lickey boy there is and now I am ready to find my forever home! Living with foster mom has been great and all and she has really gone the distance to help prepare me for my forever home. You see, when I first came into her care I was such a nervous, fearful dude that I really only liked her and a very select few people. Men in particular scared me and I wanted to make sure that new people left me alone so I used my big, scary voice to keep people away. \n\nFoster mom didn't completely lose hope with me though and she sent me to meet a new friend who does this thing called \"\"training\"\". I'm not sure what training is exactly but I will tell you this, I really got to start seeing the world with my friend Dawn. We went to parks for nice walks (plus the car rides!), and even got to go to restaurants together! She really expanded my world. And with that expansion I started to learn that people really aren't so scary. \n\nAfter \"\"training\"\" I got to come home to foster mom and boy was that exciting! Unfortunately I broke with some nasty skin allergies that required going to the vet and foster mom was not sure how I was going to do at first. Well let me tell you this, I made a lot more new friends! And now when I go to see them I whine and want to say hello and lickey lickey them until they just can't stand it anymore! And now that all my skin allergies are under control (I just take a pill with my food twice a day to help curb the itch) I am all ready to find my forever home. \n\nCould that be you? Here are some things I am looking for:\n\nI am looking for a home where I have a mom/dad who is a leader. I need someone to love me who will also let me know that they have things under control and I am just along for the ride. The more confident my person is, the more confident I am, funny how that works right? My mom/dad needs to understand that I am not a dog who needs to meet all their friends right away. I need some time to work up to meeting new people and knowing that they are okay and we can be friends! I am okay with having to be put away when new people are at the house.\n\nI am looking for a home where there are no small kids. While I have been around foster mom's kids, the energy is just not something I really enjoy. Plus, I am still learning impulse control. Foster mom says I like to \"\"mouth her\"\" sometimes when I am doing all my kisses and while she also says I have a \"\"soft\"\" mouth, it is something kids would not appreciate. \n\nI would also prefer to be the only furry love of your life. I made some doggy friends while at training but overall I am just happier being your only love and cats are just way too tempting to chase. They look like squirrels and I can't help but want to chase them.\n\nI am perfectly housebroken, even when I had to take some prednisone for my skin. I am also kennel trained. A fenced in yard would be cool to have so that I can run and play off leash safely. I really do enjoy time outside and getting to just dog around the yard. \n\nBut even though I would love a fenced in yard, I still want a home that likes to walk and be active. You see, after going to training, I really really enjoy going for walks and getting to explore the world around me. Plus, the more I am out in the world the more confidence I have in being a part of it. Foster mom will happily help teach my new family how to walk me to where I feel safe and am such a good boy. \n\nI know I keep mentioning this training thing, but I also figured it was worth mentioning that my friend Dawn said she would be happy to work with whomever becomes my forever family too! Plus I can't lie, I always enjoy seeing old friends! \n\nNow for all the nitty gritty details: I am neutered, up to date on vaccinations, dewormed, on heartworm and flea/tick prevention, and microchipped. My adoption fee is $300 which includes the professional training I went through! If you have questions about me you can email my foster mom at jones@secondchancenc.org",

            "description": "This super happy-go-lucky girl is 6 year-old September.  September arrived at the shelter as a stray on 9/3/2020, but is safe with us now.   When she arrived at the shelter as a stray, she was terrified and depressed, preferring to lay in a corner of her stall and avoid anyone who tried to get her attention.  Over time, though, shelter staff earned her trust and saw a much happier, confident pup!  \n\nShe still has a ways to go and she seems to be more nervous of men than women but, considering her transformation while stuck at the shelter, we\u2019re confident that once she\u2019s in a loving home, she\u2019ll come around very quickly!  In fact, she has settled in quite nicely with her foster family!  While September can live with other dogs and has done great with other dogs at the shelter, it would require an experienced family that can recognize and manage the external stimuli that can get September excited.  Otherwise, would be best for her to be the only dog.\n\nSeptember has spent two weeks with professional trainers and they have said she is super sweet and one of their favorites.  They did not observe any adverse reactions towards people and was super sweet with everyone she interacted with.  \n\nShe loves to play fetch and will drop the toy at your feet when the command \u201cout\u201d is given.  She is also doing well with other commands such as sit, stay, come, kennel, etc.  Additionally, she is crate-trained as well.  However, her absolute favorite thing to do is cuddle!  She loves snuggling up to any human nearby and if there is any little space for her to squish any closer to you, she will take the opportunity.\n\n\nPlease help us get sweet September into a safe, loving forever home!  If you're unable to help by adopting, sharing this post or donating is always appreciated.  Don't forget, Passion for Pitties is a 501(c)(3), so all donations are tax-deductible!\u2026every little bit helps!\n \nIf you would like to adopt loving September, please fill out an application at www.passionforpitties.com under the \u201cAdorable Adoptables\u201d heading.",

While in their shelter he was a handful to say the least. Since coming to ARC, staff has been working on teaching Keller how to \"communicate\" using basic hand signs. This has also been a learning experience for us as well. Keller has shown us that he is a very intelligent dog. He has learned to \"sit\" and is slowly learning signs for \"off\" and \"wait\". Keller does very well with other dogs at ARC and is currently best buds with Hank. Keller has learned how to play well with others by watching how other dogs respond to himself as well as people.\nKeller walks well on a harness but is easily distracted by the sights around him and we are still learning ways to keeping him focused on the task at hand.\nKeller is a very happy guy and is so eager to please. He is very treat motivated. Keller would thrive with having training from a professional or just someone who can do one on one with him. \nAbove all, he is a really great dog with personality that goes for miles. He's always happy! Keller would do best with a dog of his own energy level and one that doesn't show dominance over him. Keller and Hank  are both relatively couch potatoes after a good game of tug. He will do best in a home with older children. Best with no cats. He really needs someone who can take the time and have the patience with helping him learn to make the best of his silent world.",

She does have a grade 4 out of 6 heart murmur, but has no symptoms.  Her eyesight isn't the best, but that doesn't seem to slow her down.\n\nShe has been shaved because her heavy undercoat hadn't been removed in a long time.  She is sweet, loves affection and attention, but isn't demanding.   She gets along with other dogs and is willing to share her food bowl, but she ignores the cats. She is very happy to use the doggy door and show how well housebroken she is.  \n\nDaisy Mae's adoption fee is $125.00.  If you are interested in adopting this special senior, please complete an application and send it to myhappytail@yahoo.com.

He is located in Vancouver, WA.\n\nThrasher is a 2 year old, 64lb guy with a unique look. Thrasher is a shy guy at first but warms up once he gets to know you. He startles easily and can get over excited when playing so he would likely do best with older, dog savvy kids in the home. Thrasher LOVES to play and definitely needs an active family who will keep him busy and continue his training. He is sensitive about how he is touched so he needs a family who will respect his boundaries and be gentle with him. We are not sure how he is with dogs but he has not shown any reactivity in the shelter. Thrasher would love to live out in the country with lots of room to roam with his favorite people. Please network and share Thrasher!",

            "description": "Zulu is an affectionate rambunctious pitbull mix. He is around 57lbs and a year and a half old, but has to spirit of a big puppy.  He\u2019s the type of dog that lives in the moment. Zulu has a very curious personality so we are looking for an adopter who can keep a mindful eye and give lots of structure. \n\nZulu loves everyone he meets! He wags his tail nonstop when someone gives him a glance. Due to his powerful wiggles and excitement, we\u2019re recommending him to an adult only home. Zulu is housebroken and crate trained (even though he will complain a bit). He knows sit, down, shake, and is working on muzzle training. To make sure Zulu has the best chances, his foster parents have been working with a trainer on leash skills, reactivity, and place command. Zulu should be an only dog, but can work up to a structured pack walk for healthy socialization. He would do best in a quiet suburban neighborhood.\n\nWe are looking for a strong breed savvy adopter who loves an active dog and a silly face. His forever parents must be dedicated to maintaining and continuing his training. Zulu\u2019s trainer has dedicated a complimentary 90 minute transition training session. If you would like to see Zulu\u2019s foster journey, please see the highlights on his foster\u2019s instagram @ohcowdog! \n\nIf you are interested in Zulu, please see our criteria below before applying. \n\nPit bull & strong breed adoption criteria\n- Must be over 25 years of age to adopt a Pit Bull, Pit Bull mix, or strong breed dog.\n- Written landlord permission or a pet policy allowing the specific breed is required for adoption approval.\n- A virtual home visit may be required.\n- Training or breed experience is required as part of the adoption.\n- Agree to not take the dog to dog parks or dog daycare.\n- Pit Bull only: our values very closely aligned with Villalobos Rescue Center. Read Pit Bull Facts on their website (https://vrcpitbull.com/pit-bull-facts/). We will not match our pit bull dogs in homes who have not done their research. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting please fill out an application at our website www.gobeyondrescue.org/adopt. Our adoption fee is $350 and includes spay/neuter, microchipping and up to date vaccines. We Adopt in the SF Bay Area Only.",

With his special needs, he would do best in a calm home without kids where he won't be easily startled. Wesley does have a bite history, but has had some professional training and would benefit from continued training and a routine. He bonds deeply with his family so an experienced home is ideal.

Keegan is house trained, crate trained and walks on the leash well. Keegan is fully vetted, up to date on all his shots and neutered.

I've been at the shelter for 6 months now, I love everyone here but I really wish I had a home of my own! Everyone here tells me my loud bark is what scares people away... why don't they understand that I just want to say hi?! Being  behind a kennel door can be frustrating for an outgoing and exuberant pup like me! I am an active dog who likes playing fetch, going for runs, and for long hikes! I consider myself a package deal---I will shower my family with lots of snuggles and kisses while also keeping any strangers away from the house! So far I know sit, down, and paw! I love learning and working for food so I hope my future family will teach me more tricks! Did I say I was house trained AND crate trained?! Well, I AM! I can't wait to find my future family!\n\nApartments, busy households, and homes in the city will NOT be considered. Coop needs a quieter neighborhood and lots of space to get his energy out! Applicants who have not owned a large dog before will not be considered.\n\n\nAdoption Fee is $350\nHe is up to date on vaccines and has had a wellness exam, heartworm tested and micro-chipped.\n\n In order to meet any of our dogs, please fill out an application. To fill out an application \ngo to http://caninehumane.org/adoption-application/ \n\nIF THE DOG IS ON PETFINDER THEN IT IS STILL AVAILABLE\n\nwww.caninehumane.org \n\n***BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR SPAM/PROMOTION EMAIL FOLDER FOR CHN RESPONSE TO YOUR APPLICATION***",

If you feel you meet all the requirements, then please go to petresqinc.org to fill out an adoption application as that is the first step in our process. Martini is an 18 month old typical Chihuahua. He believes he is a 100 lb beast in a 5 lb body. Once he loves you he will be attached at your hip. Martini would do best in a single person household with no other pets and no kids. While he loves other dogs, he can be possessive of his person - Chihuahua style! He will also need a completely fenced in yard - no exceptions. Martini can be a barker so no apartment life for this guy. He is current on his vaccines and is neutered.",

The adoption fee includes age appropriate vaccinations and deworming, Frontline application, spay or neuter surgery, collar, ID tag and a leash. A $35 (non-refundable) deposit will hold the pet for you for 5 days. The Shelter is open Tuesday to Friday from 11 am to 4 pm and the first and third Saturday from 10 am to 1 pm.

Sadie came to us when her owner passed away and she would love to find her forever home for the holidays. Sadie is an outgoing, adventurous athlete when she is outside and a cuddler extraordinaire when she is inside. She loves people. You will love this smiley girl who loves to snuggle next to you on the couch. Sadie will thrive in a home where she can shine as an only pet, but she may do well with a larger male dog. She will do best in an adult home or with older teens. Housebroken, crate trained, ok in the car and when left home alone. Six foot fence required. This super sweet girl will make a wonderful companion. Sadie is UTD on vaccines, microchipped, wormed and h/w negative. She is currently fostered in the Portland area. If you are interested in this sweet girl, please fill out an application at www.saintrescue.org.",

Walter spent his entire life on a chain until he came to us last November.  He lived in the elements year-round with hardly no human contact and defiantly no care.  When he arrived at HCW he had received no vetting and really didn't know how interact with people.  He tested positive for heart worms, he has since completed his treatment and he is officially heart worm negative.  You could tell he had, had chronic ear issues but all of that is under control now.  He's healthy as can be now.  He is house and crate trained.  He currently lives in the house on our rescue property and he has amazing house manner (loves the heat and ac, oh and the sofa).  He's great with other dogs, he can be a little bossy when he wants attention from the humans (his bark gives it away).  I will be honest and tell you he isn't a fan of anyone poking and prodding on him, the vet does have to muzzle him.  He can sometimes be grumpy, so we are going to request a home without small children.  But I think it's just because in his 7 years he's never experienced what he has in the last year.  He's a lover and he has finally adjusted to a life of love and trust. \n\nIf you feel like Walter has your heart please follow the link to submit an adoption application: www.hcwdogrescue.com/adoptionapplication.\n\n\n*Adoption Fee*\n$200.00 includes the following:  neuter, parasite free, rabies vaccination, DHLPP vaccination, Bordetella vaccination, microchip, heartworm negative and current on prevention.\n\nThanks for choosing adoption!!!!",

Her tail is always happily wagging. \n\nTootsie knows the command \u201csit\u201d and takes treats gently from your fingers.\n\nShe is currently being kenneled in Union, Illinois, where she is great with all the other dogs, but not cats!\n\nTootsie is also wonderful with people of all ages. She is very sweet, snugly and loving. She prefers cuddling to playing ball and doesn\u2019t seem to have an interest in playing fetch.\n\nTootsie was found stray in Schaumburg, Illinois, and her teeth are all ground down. Perhaps she was chewing on a chain or rocks? So she recently had all the nubs removed so she only has a couple of teeth left.\n\nI first photographed Tootsie in June of 2017 and she has been kenneled ever since.\n\nShe is crate-trained and appears to be housebroken. Isn\u2019t it time she found the home of her dreams?\n\nTo meet and possibly adopt Tootsie, please contact Melia at melia88@comcast.net for an adoption application. \n\nHer adoption fee of $200 benefits the rescued dogs of Lucky Dog Rescue. She is healthy, spayed, up-to-date on vaccines, micro-chipped and heartworm-tested negative. \n",

Need his attention ASAP?? Squeeker toys!!!\nHe isn't mean to people, but he can be nippy in a playful way so we wouldn't want him around younger children!\nHe is VERY strong, and would need a strong owner to be sure you can control him on walks ext.!\nHe is crate trained, loves car rides, LOVES his barista who gives him treats, and does know basic manners but he is still learning how to focus! haha\nTitus was used as a bait-dog in his early years and has visible bite marks on his face and body. You can tell that someone was not very nice to him, especially when he sees a rope/leash.\nPoor baby boy did NOT deserve to end his life that way, so we want him to spend the rest of his days comfortable and knowing that nobody will EVER hurt him again!!!\nFor that reason, animals trigger Titus, and he should not be allowed near them without a muzzle on!\nWe are working on positive-association to a Muzzle to that it is not seen as a punishment, rather than a safety barrier for him and for other animals on his walks and vet-trips!\n\nOnce again due to high volume of apps with other animals:\n******TITUS MUST BE THE ONLY ANIMAL IN THE HOME!******\nNO EXCEPTIONS!\nHe is not as fence/barrier reactive, and will walk past a dog on his walk with no problem unless that dog was being super invasive!\nHe would definitely protect you and your property from unwanted guests/critters!!!\nHe is pretty quiet, barely barks.\nHe also has a very handsome smile (not a snarl, a real smile haha)",

Kobe has the cutest \"funny face\" because it looks like he has big bushy eyebrows! He loves to play with the other big dogs in his foster home. He has a rowdy play style with the bigger dogs, but shows his gentle side  when he is playing with smaller dogs. Kobe doesn't live with kids, but he is friendly and seems to know when to be gentle, so he should be fine with kids over the age of 6. He loves to play with toys too, but big expensive toys are not necessary, any old stick will do! Kobe also loves to swim. Who knew that a Husky would like the water? Kobe has a medical condition which is successfully treated with inexpensive medication. Kobe knows several commands, and he loves treats, so he will be easy to train with positive reinforcement. \n",

Mixie is more outgoing of the two and she is putting on weight nicely.  She is also learning boundaries.  Tie outs were used previously so they do pull very hard on leash so we are working on that and she is learning quickly.  She is also learning to sit and wait for permission to eat versus knocking us over for food.  She will get better as she gets up to a healthy weight too.  She is a typical higher energy lab girl ready for a family to love.  She loves water and of course, fetch.

He is pretty good at it too!\n\nZeppelin seems to be okay around other dogs his size, but we feel more comfortable if the other dog is a female. (What can we say he is a ladies man). Zeppelin should not be in a home with small dogs or cats. He loves to go for walks. He is affectionate once he knows you.\n\nZep would be an excellent companion for someone who is looking for a furever friend to keep them company.",

            "description": "MEET OLIVER!!\n\nAre you interested in adding a 4 legged friend to your home? Oliver is a calm, super sweet and generally mellow guy, but he does not fully know his strength when playing, so it is recommended he goes to a home with no children (or older children aged 16+). Oliver is dog friendly, big dogs small dogs young dogs old dogs, he loves them all! Oliver has a 16 year old blind chihuahua foster sister who occasionally bumps into him, and he is not bothered by her at all! Dog intros are still recommended though, as per our usual recommendation. Oliver LOVES going for walks, but he is very reactive and tries to chase any cats he sees outside. It's not clear how he is with cats in a home, but based on this it is recommended he go to a home with no cats. It is possible it would be different inside a home.\n\nOliver has some basic training. He knows how to walk on a leash (but does still pull a moderate amount), is potty trained, uses the doggy door, knows how to sit, knows 'come here', and is crate trained. He loves to go for rides in the car as well, but only if the windows are down! He needs a committed family who will continue to work on his training. What he really likes is water and the hose. Get him a kiddy pool, and he will love you forever. Just make sure to protect the hose because he thinks it is a toy. Oliver also has the cutest stretch he does when he's tired or trying to get comfortable, it's adorable!\n\nIf you have other dogs and leave food down, he will eat it! We are working on that :) Oliver can be a little stubborn, but what he really wants most is a home to call his own where he can nap comfortably and get lots of pets. Oliver has allergies and will need ongoing treatment for this. We put 1 capsule of fish oil in his food once a day, and he gets Benadryl 2x a day and this has helped tremendously! We also give him baths with shampoo from the vet, and that is the only treatment he has received for his allergies, easy-peasy!\n\nOliver will need time to decompress in a new home, and an experienced owner is recommended. He needs someone to lead the pack otherwise Oliver will assume the alpha position. Over time he will realize you are his forever home, and then he can relax and enjoy the rest of his years the way he was supposed to live them--getting belly rubs, lounging in the pool, and chewing on bones.\n\nWe have been fostering Oliver through Underdog Rescue of Arizona since the end of October. While he's happy to be out of the shelter, he wants to be with his people in his furever home. Are you interested in meeting Oliver? Please reach out to Underdog Rescue of Arizona,\nhttps://www.underdogaz.com/animals/#action_0=pet&animalID_0=16077281&petIndex_0=0\n, or email Oliver's foster mom Rachel at\nrae14022@yahoo.com\n(please put Oliver's name in the subject line!).",

She is used to being waited on, kind of diva. She has 2 beds that\u2019s she burns a trail from one to another all day long. Bailey insists on having a brushing every morning with her coffee and peanut butter pill pocket (allergy medication). She\u2019s friendly with all humans..but she is particularly fond of men. She is currently living with a lab foster brother, who soon learned their snuggling happens on Bailey\u2019s terms. She does have bouts of hilarious energy where she runs as fast as she can, but it\u2019s as if you\u2019re watching her run in slow motion. So much chonk. If you\u2019re looking for an actual potato to lounge on your couch, Bailey is your gal!",

I love hugs .. and walks and treats! I get along well with everyone - humans, dogs, kids... and I\u2019ve never met some I don\u2019t love!  I love toys & I walk well on a leash...what more could you possibly want in a forever companion?!! Won\u2019t you take me home?

He will give a lot of love in return.\n\nHe is fully vetted, neutered, tested heartworm negative, microchipped or can be with a voucher.\n\nGramps can be seen at our adoption event or by appointment to approved applicants.

He saved her  from death. they would kill all dogs that come onto base and  kill puppies too. He stashed her off base and brought back after retirement, . She   was 4 mos old then.\n     High energy so. she needs to  walk and does guard her home. Loves people and kids. Now he is getting divorced and selling the house.   We need a foster home , rescue or adopter. Dog is all vetted, spayed, . 8 yrs old and 72 lbs, hw neg.  on holistic  delivered pet food. well cared for.. NOW  we are on a time crunch. we will pay for her transport or find a pilot.  Any  ideas to help her or any rescues who might take.????  Beautiful dog.  Had a month of training. Needs proper introductions to other dogs, lived with a mastiff  all her life. \n    Her name is ASIFA. She lives in Clayton NC  He would even take her back after he gets a new job and home in Ga. if necessary.  Maybe 3-4 mos. He does love her and wants what is best  for this dog.  Please help. !!\n\n He would  bring  her to be introduced to other dogs  if within a driving  distance.\n Thank you \n\n",

My human passed away and his family couldn't care for me after trying their hardest, so I've found my way back to P4P. I'm a pretty special girl. I've got 3 legs, but it doesn't slow me down! I'm playful and energetic, but I can be a bit vocal when I play, which scares some people who don't know me. I do really well with dogs who are my size or bigger. No cats or small dogs, please! I'm ready to open my heart again to a family who will love me forever. Is it you?\n\nMy adoption fee is $195, and I am spayed, microchipped, and current on all vaccines!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please go to our website at www.partnersforpetsil.org and fill out an online application.\n\nAdoptions are held at the O'Fallon, IL PetSmart every Saturday of the month from 11am-3:30pm and at the Glen Carbon, IL PetSmart every Sunday from 11am-3:30pm. We are also at Petco in Edwardsville Crossing on Sundays from 11:30-3:30 pm. The cats are only at Glen Carbon Petsmart. Please let us know if you are interested in a pet and we can arrange to have them meet you at one of the adoption events.",

I am a staff favorite and known for my charm. I'm just as happy to go for a long walk on a trail as I am to cuddle up with you on the couch. I am even good when they give me baths.

            "description": "Leroy Boudin is a beautiful mix of a black lab and a pittie and came to us from Louisiana's hurricane disaster relief. He is a super sweet but strong boy. He needs a firm hand and training on the leash. He is house trained which is a huge bonus. He got good grades on his behavioral assessment. Needs someone who will take him for long walks and play with him, but I suspect he will be a good cuddle buddy on the sofa too. Once he gets some of his youthful energy out, he is definitely interested in hanging out and getting and giving some affection. Don't miss meeting this goofy handsome hunk 'o burnin' love. \n\nObservations by volunteer Susie Shaffer 10/7/20",

I was underweight and had some matting that had to be cut out when I came into rescue. I am gaining weight and my coat is filling back in nicely.\n\nI am 3 years old and such a sweet boy! I am affectionate and as you can see I love to give the Pyr paw! When people talk to me I am ready to learn and please. You can ask me to sit, down, wait, and come. I am good with children, fine with cats, and good with dogs of all sizes. I'm still playful and one of my favorite things are squeaky toys. I'm very gentle with them. When they squeak I lay them down and nuzzle them. I never have accidents in the house, I like car rides, and am good on a leash. If I hear sounds outside, I will alert you with my bark. My home needs a 6 ft fence as I am pretty agile. I will come to you neutered, up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, and up to date on heartworm and flea/tick preventatives. I have been very patient, but I am ready for a family of my own! \n\nApplicants must have a secure and visible fence. In order for your application to be approved, you must also pass a home check and a vet check which includes having at least a two year vet history. Children in my home can be 8 years or older. I can be adopted in Missouri and surrounding states: Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. My rescue is able to transport me to those states. If you would like to give me a furever home, please fill out an application on my rescue's website. \n\nBeing fostered in Mountain Home, AR",

He is very full of life and and will keep bringing you fun every day.\n\nMeet Rufus, a big sweetie! He is friendly and affectionate. We aren't sure how he is with cats but does love a good squirrel chase. He is a big lover boy and fairly mellow but if you will play ball with him all day in the yard, he will sleep so happily! A yard will be ideal for him. He has lived with another German Shepherd before and did well but he has not been socialized much with other dogs.\n\nGentle kids over 14 are best for him, as the hustle and bustle of youngins is uncomfortable for him.\n\nWhat is most adorable about him is that he loves to fetch, play ball and he likes to carry around rocks! He licks them and has had one rock he kept for six years!\n\nCheck out this superstar boy at the YouTube video posted.\n\nThis big boy is updated on shots, neutered and chipped. His adoption fee is $295.\n\nWe cover the medical to prepare the pet for adoption and the adopt donations go directly to cover those costs and range from $295-$495. Thank you for stepping up to save a life!\n\nTo expedite to meet with this dog, please go to our site at www.savinggreatanimals.org and fill out an application. We look at the first applications to arrive, so we hope to hear from you soon!",

Most of his hair was missing from his stomach and legs and he was very itchy. 2 different skin scrapings were negative for mites but since the itching and hair wouldn't improve we started mange treatment anyway. He's doing much better and his hair has actually started growing . He is your typical puppy; happy, hyper and loves everyone. All he wants to do is play. One thing I noticed almost immediately was he was very smart. Just in a couple of weeks he has learned sit, lay and crawl. If you would like to add Charlie B to your family, please, send us a message.",

So very sad that this big boy has lost his home and the man who loved him. General Knox is so very friendly and still has his young dog energy motor running full speed ahead. We are looking for a youngish, active family with a fenced yard and lots of playtime and attention to give him. He's also quite strong, so very young children or elderly people might not be a good fit. General Knox would do best as an only dog in the home or maybe a submissive female dog that is not an alpha or dominant. He has not been tested with cats but we know he is housebroken and crate trained. Gen. Knox is a loving boy with a goofy smile and all the love in the world to give someone. We just want him to have a stable home and lifestyle . If you are interested please email at candacesimpsongiles@comcast.net\nADOPTION FEE REQUIRED. Contact ccrtennessee@gmail.com.",

I am an incredibly sweet, goofy girl who loves to cuddle and just wants someone to love on.\n\nMy foster mom thinks I had a bad start in life, so I am timid of men at first, but I get used to them within a day or two once they show me they will love me back! I am great with the other dog in my foster home and love to play. I am still learning to how to fetch, but it\u2019s really fun to chase the ball anyway! \n\nI am great on a leash, crate-trained and potty trained if I am let outside frequently. I am still a puppy, about 10 months old, so this will come quick with some training! Right now I am 42 pounds, healthy, and don\u2019t expect to get that much bigger. I can\u2019t WAIT to meet my new family and find my furever home!",

Holly's story is a sad one. This poor girl had been in boarding since Christmas. Her owner moved and was not able to take her along. Her hopes were to get her back but unfortunately was not able to. So she was officially surrendered to our rescue partners down South and transported up to us. Fenced in yard required, she will escape if given the chance. This poor girl needs another chance for sure! She knows 'sit' and 'paw'. Very active. She LOVES to be with people and does not want them to leave....understandably. *Per JSAC policy, puppies and kittens under 6 months will not be adopted to families with children under the age of 6 years.",

            "description": "Dobby is a very sweet (but sassy) terrier mix, about 1 yr old, 35ish lbs. It may take some time to earn her love, but when you do; you\u2019re locked in for life! \n\nShe\u2019s still learning how to be a dog, and is blossoming with confidence everyday. She loves her foster fur-sister who has been very sweet and patient, teaching her all about being in a new environment. She would love another submissive, very sweet fur- sibling to help her acclimate and continue to build confidence. Being able to be a puppy and play with her favorite bone is the favorite part of her day. She knows her ears are her best assets, no need to deny it. If you\u2019re looking for a cuddle partner look no further!",

You will never be lonely with Tee-Bo around an awesome BFF. His estimated age/DOB: 10/26/2010 and currently weighs 76 lbs. He is affectionate (see his video below), laid back and yet still playful and goofy. Tee-Bo would flourish best in a home as the only dog where he can be the top dog; he tends to be jealous of other dogs. He is house broken with supervision, crate trained and good with children. Tee-Bo would love to be your snuggle buddy, and just hang out around the house with daily walks or jog. Don't let his age fool you, this boy still has lots of energy for walks and a run around the yard. If you're interested in meeting and possibly adopting Tee-Bo, please apply at http://www.arfla.org/info/adoption. Updated 09/26/2020\n\nClick here to watch a video of Tee-Bo.\n\nSee our Adoptions Info webpage\n\nfor more info on our adoption requirements, fees.

Teddy has had a rough start to life but is an incredibly happy and loving dog. \n\nDespite being a total lovebug once he knows you, Teddy is very protective over his home and his people causing him to bark at new people coming in who he hasn't yet met. Teddy has come a long way in his training and in addition to accepting new people after meeting them outside, he has also learned to sit  shake, and comes when he is called. \n\nTeddy is housebroken but due to his kidney issue he drinks a lot of water and needs to be let out more often. Teddy's forever home will be one where his people can come let him out throughout the day. \n\nTeddy gets along with dogs of all sizes. He and his foster brother (Mastiff) play well together and he has also played well with smaller dogs. Teddy loves going on walks and swimming, if it were up to Teddy he would go on as many long walks as possible everyday. Teddy is a very happy go lucky dog and is looking for his forever family who is willing to continue to work to make him his best self, but still love him unconditionally.  \n\n****PLEASE READ******** \nDogs in our program are fostered in a private home, we ask that you fill out an application prior to requesting to set up a meeting or you can meet them at an upcoming adoption clinic. \n\nVisit our website or FB page for dates/times. If they are still listed on Petfinder, they are still available. Due to the volume of emails we receive daily, We can not respond to \"Is he/she still available\" or \"how can I meet them\".  \n\nApplications can be filled out here  http://rottieempirerescue.com/adopt-2/dog-adoption-application/\n",

            "description": "Do you have a high-energy pup that needs a brother to play with?  If yes, then Raj may be perfect for your family.  Raj is a very active 11-month-old and 50-pound mixed herding puppy. He LOVES to play with other dogs and toys.  He does a great job of sharing his toys, too! Raj is a happy boy who is constantly on the go. He was surrendered to the shelter as the owners did not understand the fact that he was a herding breed. Raj solicits attention/affection by jumping up and being very mouthy, and the owners didn't know how to work on that problem.  Due to this, we will only place him in a home with teenagers and up. He needs a fenced yard and not in an apartment. He is housebroken and crate-trained.  Raj is very much a puppy that just needs obedience training and guidance to flourish. \nIf interested in fostering or adopting Raj please fill out an application: https://www.lostcoveanimalsanctuary.com/adopt/adoptionapplication/",

This great program saves shelter dogs from euthanasia, placing them with inmates at the county jail who have been approved to train and nurture them so that they will be good pets in their permanent adoptive homes. The goal is for each dog to be leash trained, housebroken, and have knowledge of basic obedience commands.\n\nOur gorgeous Bella from our Gwinnett Jail Dogs Program is still waiting for the right, loving family to find her.  She has been with the program for almost 3 years and needs a home where she is the only dog.  She is a senior girl who is approximately eight years old with some arthritis/hip issues that go along with the German Shepherd breed.  She would be a great addition for a family without small children and someone that is familiar with a working breed dog.  For more information on Bella, visit www.jaildogs.org and fill out an adoption application if you\u2019re willing to offer her a loving retirement home.\n\nBella is fully vetted -- spayed, heartworm negative, and current on vaccinations and deworming.  Her adoption fee is $250 (cash only, please).\n\nYou can check the status of your application by emailing jaildogs@gmail.com. \n\nGet more info about the Gwinnett Jaildog Program at www.jaildogs.org.",

So far, Vaughn has been in a good mood, despite some discomfort! He seems to enjoy the attention of human companions.

Vaughn will need an adopter dedicated to his needs as a rottweiler, (socialization, guidance), and his medical needs. Vaughn is on our None Left Behind program and the League will cover the cost for vet visits and medication related to his arthritis. His adopter will be required to use the Leagues veterinarian.

I get along with dogs who are friendly and have good manners, although I will admit I like being the leader.\n\nI had a home but I was not happy there and I escaped the yard every chance I got.  My mom was very ill and she did not have time for me.  So I went looking for another home.  That\u2019s how I ended up in rescue.  I promise not try to run away if you love me and pay attention to me, and give me treats when I am a good dog.  \n\nI am crate trained and house trained.   I am 4 years old and weigh 50 lbs.  My fur had a gorgeous shimmer to it and don\u2019t  you just love my baby blues?  \n\nP.S.  I have worms in my heart but I am taking medicine to get rid of them.  \n\nIf you would like to be considered for adoption, please complete the adoption questionnaire on our website www.heartsofgoldpitrescue.com.",

Zane is really good at redirecting his attention and going the other direction when another dog is spotted. All the low calorie treats he gets has slowed his wight loss a little bit but he is still down 10 pounds from entering the rescue.\nI am potty trained, and my foster mom leaves me out all day with no issue. I have a crate that I hang out in every now and then, but I would prefer to be in your personal space if you are home. When I am home alone, I mostly lay on the couch and bark at people outside or sleep right on my mommy's pillow's. I do not surf the countertops but one time I did eat an entire gingerbread house that mommy left on the table way to close to the edge. It was practically calling for me to eat it!\nEven though I am reactive when seeing other dogs, I love ALL HUMANS from little kids to the neighbor lady who is 84 years old. I would prefer to be your 90 pound lap dog and still all of your attention. On days when my foster mommy has a hard time I am really good at being her emotional support. Heck, I personally think I would make an amazing support animal for anyone who is looking for that additional love in their life.\n____________________________________10/8 UPDATE: Zane continues to lose weight and loves to go for a walk anytime you are up for one. He has started working with a trainer in his foster home to be calmer when passing by other dogs. He needs to be an only dog at this time.___________________________________Zane was the sole companion for a senior citizen who recently had to go to a nursing facility. Zane is a loving boy who can be amazingly agile for an overweight big boxer boy. Zane likes to keep an eye on the neighborhood and will alert you to people going by with a bark. He loves his walks and needs to go on lots of them to lose weight. 2/2/21 9:16 AM",

Bruce is about 2 years old, neutered, and up to date on vaccinations. Due to his size and features, we think Bruce is mixed with a Great Pyrenees or another type of large breed dog. Bruce is a very sweet and loving dog. However, Bruce is in need of a home where he will have someone who is able to devote a lot of time to training and working with him on trusting the world around him. Bruce has a lot of fear of the unknown and due to his size and strength, he can be a handful at times. He is in need of a family with lots of large dog and guardian dog experience. Due to Bruce's speculated breed mix, it is in his nature to guard his people from strangers (people who live outside the home) or other animals. Bruce likes most dogs, however, due to the amount of training and adjustment time he will need, we feel it is best that he is an only pet at this time. He also is inclined to chase small animals so he can not be in a home with cats or other small pets. It would be best if Bruce DID NOT go to a home with children under 16 years of age due to his size and nature. Despite all of this, Bruce is a dog who truly wants to be a good boy with a family who will help him gain some trust in the world around him. \n",

I like to play with other dogs, but I can be selective with who I choose to play with. I think I could be a great family pet and would do best in a home with children over the age of 5. I do have a decent prey drive so I should be kept away from cats and other small animals that I might confuse for toys. I would be very content with either an experienced dog owner or a first-time adopter but I would REALLY like to find a home with a big yard for me to run around and play in. I think I'd do best in a busy home, particularly one that has lots of visitors for me to greet! I think I may even be the type of dog that you could take out in public with you as you do your daily activities. I appear to be well-trained, but could always benefit from some further training. I love to go on nice long leashed walks or runs, play with my toys, and snuggle up next to someone I love on the couch!",

We have done everything we can to put him on the best path forward. Regular physio and daily care and assistance in most things are needed to help him grow. He is approximately 28 pounds and growing. With a Catahoula Leopard Dog and Standard Poodle for parents Tucker will likely be a big boy. He has learned to use his speedy wheels and loves to zip about in them, though obviously cannot get in and out of them by himself. He has neither bladder or bowel control but is aware when he needs to \u201cgo\u201d and will let you know with a special bark. He has learned a number of commands and is a very, very smart puppy. He loves other dogs, is fabulous with people and children, and like most puppies his age, likes to nibble on fingers if he is overtired or over stimulated. Tucker is an extremely loving and sweet boy who enjoys being a part of the action and would benefit from the company of another dog. His daily needs include Assissi Loop and E-Stim treatments, playtime with toys and his people, a walk, socialization, time in his Help-me-up harness and just some hanging out in his wheels. And though he wears a bellyband, and keeping to an elimination schedule helps, accidents do happen and he may need to be tidied up to keep him clean and dry. While the movement in his back legs has improved since being in our care, and we are hopeful that he will become more independent as he matures, we cannot predict the future for Tucker. Other than we know this sweet pup will make an amazingly loving companion for just the right person or family who have the dedication to helping him grow into his best self. \nNeuter and obedience will be mandatory. Tucker's adoption will include his wheels and a pre-paid physio package with our rehab veterinarian. \n\nTo apply please visit: \nhttp://www.misfitmanordogrescue.com/adoption-application.php",

She had obviously been used as a \"\"bait dog\"\". Hyacinth's scars have healed and she enjoys treats, toys and her \"\"Giggle Ball\"\". She loves attention, and would make a great family dog. Hyacinth will need a family who will spend time with her, and show her what it means to be a house dog. She is good with kids and adults. Due to her past, she would have to be the only pet. She deserves the chance to know what a home feels like!",

            "description": "Ruby is a very sweet Doberman, born September 2015. Ruby has Wobbler Syndrome; however, she has responded very well to medical management. When she came into rescue, she could barelly walk, but she continues to improve. Although she still hasn't mastered going up and down stairs and getting into vehicles, she does well using a ramp. Her very patient foster mom continues to work with her, and she is making progress. Her perfect home will have very few stairs or the possibility of a ramp. It is difficult for Ruby to walk on smooth flooring such as wood and tile so carpet or rugs are needed inside the home. Any resident dogs should be calm and not too pushy. \n\nWobbler Syndrome, a disease caused by compression of the spinal cord in the neck area resulting in nervous system problems which make it difficult for the dog to move around normally, \n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Ruby is $300. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

He's currently living with a loving foster family but would love a family to call his own. Wallace is a smart boy! He is house trained, leash trained, and is learning some commands! When he's at home relaxing, he REALLY relaxes. He loves to chill next to his people all day - he's a pretty mellow guy. His foster mom loves the way he looks at her, as if he always has a question. As for a forever home, he would do great in a family with kids, but would prefer to be the only pet. Wallace hopes for a family who will let him lounge with them, too. Wallace deserves the perfect forever home. Could it be with you? Apply to adopt Wallace today!

            "description": "Kona is a sweet girl and enjoying life with her foster human. Kona had a rough life of running the streets of Dallas and was essentially a feral dog but has come a long way in the 2 months (September) since I have been fostering her. She is working on overcoming her fear of humans. She gets along well with my dog. Unsure on cats. She would do better in a home with another dog. Would not do well in a home with children under the age of 14. She likes a calm and quiet environment. Loves to spend her days near her person curled up on the dog bed. She is very food motivated and crate trained. Her crate is a safe zone for her. She has soulful eyes and loves to give her person licks once she feels safe with them. She is currently working with a trainer on becoming comfortable on leash. She is a sweetheart with a funny personality. All Dallas Pets Alive adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon adoption. The standard minimum donation for dogs over six months to seven years is $200, puppies under six months is $250, dogs eight years and over are $100 unless specified otherwise. You can view all adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallaspetsalive.org/adopt/adoptable-dogs/ .

She has trust issues with people and will need many introductions to learn to trust her new owner. Brooke has an easier time with woman but has gotten close to men, as well. She is a staff favorite looking for a  home without a lot of random people coming,  going a fenced yard, ideally, and daily adventures. \n\nWe are networking for Harvest Hills Animal Shelter. The potential adopter should plan on several trips to get to know Brooke. . The shelter is offering their trainer to help her adjust to her new home so, close proximity to the shelter will be best.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adoption, please fill out our online adoption survey at http://olddogsnewdigs.com/form-adoption.html.\n",

Pearl's back was so badly broken, the veterinarian that first examine Pearl said it was amazing that Pearl even survived such a severe injury...her spinal cord was essentially severed.  After months of physical therapy, Pearl is able to run around with her doggy friends but it is likely that one of her legs will never be completely normal.  She may require a back leg bootie long term for protection but it will not slow her down a bit.  Due to the paralysis, Pearl also requires bladder expression throughout the day but she can poop on her own.\n\n \n\nDESCRIPTION (BIO)\n\nThis adorable young lady loves toys and attention from her people.  She is known to get quite spunky during playtime, yet melts in your arms during a good cuddle session.  Since the veterinarian has requested limited exercise, Pearl enjoys being carried around like the princess she is.  An ideal home for Pearl would be one with lots of patience and understanding.  It is also essential that Pearl continue with her weekly physical therapy until the vet discharges her.  Although she would be fine being the one and only fur-baby, Pearl has spent a lot of time with other dogs and really enjoys playing with them.  Additionally, she recently met our office cat, so it is possible, with proper introductions, Pearl would happily live with cats too. \n\n \n\nWon't you consider being a mother of Pearl...or father?\n\n \n\nAdopters must live in the Los Angeles area.",

She enjoys long walks and playing with children and other dogs.   House broken from day one! She weighs 39 lbs. She would love to be part of an active family that will enjoy her playful loving nature. She is crate trained and is walking better on a leash.\n9/21/2020\nTemple is a medium (35 lb) three year old pittie mix with an inquisitive nature.  She loves adventures such as chasing pesky squirrels out of the yard or going on explorations.  She has been around cats but they get her a little too excited so it's probably best to not be in home where they reside. An active family or a home with another active dog would be an ideal situation for Temple as she is described by her foster family as a high energy gal.  She does well in her crate and behaves nicely with a regular routine.  For more information on adopting Temple, visit www.wagsrescue.com and complete an application.  \n\n\n\n  To begin the adoption process please, fill out our online application. Go to wagsrescue.com and click on adoption form.\nPlease call Susan @ 267-312-3372 if you have questions.",

            "description": "Wyatt von Elsnig is a beautiful 4 year old German Shepherd. He has a sweet, initially shy personality and gentle demeanor that will draw you in. While he likes to take his time easing into new situations and relationships, once he has the lay of the land, he opens up. Thus far he seems more shy with men, but once he's comfortable, he'll offer you kisses. We think he is likely housebroken. On walks, Wyatt is a bit cautious and can pull if he gets nervous, but with corrections he settles down, even walking nicely next to other dogs when he gets the chance. Off the leash, Wyatt becomes much more social and you\u2019ll see his tail wagging in delight when he gets to go out to the yard around other dogs. He likes to avoid overly-pushy dogs but, other than that, gets along nicely with others. Wyatt knows his new family is out there looking for a dog like him, and he\u2019s ready to come to a feline free home with you.\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website! So, check in and log on often! \n\nWestside thanks you for looking at our amazing dogs and for choosing to save an animal's life through rescue. \n\nDon't forget to visit your local animal shelter...the source of many of our dogs.\n \nwww.sheprescue.org\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WGSRescue\n\n",

I\u2019m Truffles and I\u2019m a fabulous medium-sized, adult dog, who is looking for a home with an owner or family who wants an affectionate, energetic, and intelligent companion.  I have all sorts of love to give and am just waiting for the right person to come along so that I can shower him/her/them with attention and adoration.  I had a prior experience in a shelter and boy, I sure don\u2019t want to be in one of those again.  But, you ask, \u201c what would I like\u201d?  I\u2019d be very content to be in a home where I can get regular meals, some treats and chew toys. I love to play with balls\u2026any kind of balls. Balls are definitely my favorite of all toys.  I would love to get cuddles and take naps together.  Although I\u2019m definitely an in-home kind of gal, some time in the great outdoors would be wonderful. Rolling in the grass and basking in the sun are two activities at which I excel. I love to be a travel buddy with someone.  As you can see, I am definitely not picky.  I will thrive with attention and training. I know a couple of commands, but I would be more than happy to learn some other commands as well as some tricks.  I super treat-motivated and my foster mom says that I\u2019m a quick learner.  I\u2019m friendly with other dogs, as long as the other dog accepts me.    I am fully vetted, microchipped, and spayed.  Would you like to meet me? Please contact:  info@wagsfundrescue.com",

            "description": "Max von Rossow is a very handsome 2.5 year old German Shepherd. Max is a bigger boy who has been a happy and fun presence around the rescue. He's affectionate with staff members, and quick to roll onto his back for belly rubs. However, as not uncommon with shepherds, we were told that while he was great with his family, he wasn't always sure of new people in different situations, so we think an adult home without lots of visitors would be best.  Max is housebroken and knows some of his commands. He comes out of the kennel ready for action. Max does wonderfully around other dogs on walks and in playgroups, approaching them curiously and happily. We think he would love a canine friend in his forever home.\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website! So, check in and log on often! \n\nWestside thanks you for looking at our amazing dogs and for choosing to save an animal's life through rescue. \n\nDon't forget to visit your local animal shelter...the source of many of our dogs.\n \nwww.sheprescue.org\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WGSRescue\n\n",

She has captured hearts in her foster home and is loving the security she feels as an indoor dog. \n\nWe think Milan is a Shiba Inu/Lab mix. She's intelligent, loving, and active. Once she knows you, Milan is a total love bug who just likes to hang out and be around her people. She is an affectionate girl and likes the be the center of your attention. She will lavish you with attention, too! Give her some belly rubs and see her adorable grin. And she absolutely LOVES her toys! Squeaky toys especially!\n\nMilan is a very vivid dreamer. Her foster mom has seen her talk and \"run\" in her sleep! We imagine she's dreaming that she is your personal superhero. Not all heroes wear capes--but this loyal girl would probably put one on if that would make you happy!\n\nAlthough she is a senior, Milan really enjoys to accompany you on a nice long walk. Milan would do best in an adult only home, and she would LOVE to be your only pet. That way she doesn't have to compete for those belly rubs that she loves so much! \n\nMilan is 55lbs, 8 years young, crate trained, potty trained, a quiet and tidy companion! If you'd like to know more about Milan, please send us an email to adopt@liveloveanimalrescue.org or fill out an application form at liveloveanimalrescue.org.",

            "description": "She does have a medical condition called laryngeal paralysis. This is where there is a narrowing that limits her ability to love air efficently to describe it best. Because of this condition she should limit her activity (which she's not happy about) and avoid getting overly excited. Prlonged periods of either could cause severe respiratory distress to the point of being an emergency. To complicate it further Prudence has separation anxiety most likely because of her pre-SAAP life. This causes her to become very upset when she can't see you. Prudence must crated or contained to a dog proof room when she is unsupervised. To complicate it even further she has a crate anxiety. All of these anxieties cause her to be visibly upset and bark continuously when someone is not within her site. Obviously no one can be at home all the time but it would be best that Prudence find an adopter who is home most of the time or is able to have someone check on her during the day.\nAll SAAP animals are vet checked, UTD on vaccines, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, and given flea and heartworm preventative as age appropriate.\n\nOur website is: http://www.adoptastray.com/\n\nTo check if this animal is still available visit our master pet list on our website at:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/adoptable-animals/\n\nHave questions:\nPlease email us at saap@adoptastray.com for more information about this animal or to answer any questions you may have.

Most importantly, if you like Bubba, you must love dog kisses!\n\nBubba needs to be the center of attention at all times. He needs to be the only pet in a home, so he can get all the attention he deserves. Some fenced in land would be nice too.\n\nBubba is about 6 years old.

His foster mom will work with any prospective adopter on his training commands and tips.

She is the type of dog who has baggage. And we will never quite know what all it holds. Phoenix is not a big fan of men and she also feels the need to guard her things. She does love to be loved and she can be an absolute sweetheart. \n\nPhoenix is a beautiful 6 year older Maltese Mix. She\u2019s sassy, bossy and loves her toys. \nYou can usually find her tossing them around. \n\nMost people are going to want Phoenix. I mean look, she\u2019s adorable. But she will require an experienced owner. And a home with no kids. \n\nPlease be sure you read and understand her story before you inquire as she will only be looking for the home that is the right fit for her.",

She is extremely well mannered and easy-going, and she\u2019d make the perfect addition to any family looking for an adorable 3 legged companion. \n\nLearning to walk and trust. Patricia was found as a stray, and after FFL discovered an old injury we decided the best thing for Patricia was to amputate since then she has learned to walk on 3 legs beautifully! She is quickly learning to trust the humans around her, and willingly accepts any and all pets and belly rubs once she feels comfortable!\n\nA very good girl. Patricia is extremely well mannered and gets along with other dogs, as well as both men and women. She is comfortable when left in a crate and stays on her best behavior when left home alone. While she isn\u2019t very interested in toys, she always looks forward to meal time!\n\nPlease reach out to a staff member if you\u2019d like to meet this sweet girl. You won\u2019t regret it!\n",

Sadie is not only sweet but she is smart, affectionate, easy going, is a great kisser, walks well on a leash, likes to play, knows basic commands... I could go on and on.\nSadie is about four years old, medium to large sized and was given up because her owner could no longer keep her.  She has been very well behaved while with us, doesnt know a stranger and is taking her days here in stride.\nSadie is looking for a forever home with a loving family she can call her own.  Sadie prefers not to be alone and would require someone to be home all or most of the time.  She would be perfect for homebodies, retirees, someone who works from home or large families where someone is always home.  She doesn't seem to be destructive but attempts to dig out of her cage or drools and paces when left alone.  She is so incredibly amazing that you wouldn't mind staying with her or springing for a babysitter when you need a night out (if it's somewhere she can't come with).\n\n*We are closed to the public for viewing. Please email adoptions@pawstinleypark.org if you are interested in adopting.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet, please visit our website to check on their current availability: http://www.pawstinleypark.org.. Adoptions are limited to 50 miles from the shelter. We do not ship animals. Adoption fees for dogs are $125-$275 based on age. While we do our best, we cannot make guarantees on breed, exact age and house training of our dogs. Peoples Animal Welfare Society (P.A.W.S.) of Tinley Park, IL is a no-kill non-profit 501(c) (3) organization.\n\nPhone: 815-464-7298\n",

Here are requirements for Timmy's new family:\n-Must have a 6 foot fence (we do home visits and will be verifying a sturdy, safe fence)\n-no apartments\n-no children\n-must have a compatible dog for Timmy to live with. Resident dog must be spayed/neutered and vaccinated. We do get reference checks.\n-adopter must understand that Timmy will take some time to acclimate, gain his trust and feel comfortable in a new environment. Positive, reward-based training only.\nPlease do not apply to adopt Timmy unless you meet and understand all these requirements. Thank you.\n\nTimmy (or Tim-Tim, as his foster mom calls him) had a rough start to life. He lived with a hunter as an outside dog, and the hunter gave him to someone else where he lived a raised kennel with other hunting dogs. He came into rescue poorly socialized, but has made tremendous strides while at the foster home.\n\nTimmy likes to play with other dogs and finds comfort in their company, so we are seeking an adoptive home with a friendly dog that could show Timmy the ropes and be his BFF. Timmy is fine with cats, and can easily live with a few, if you happen to be a cat lover.\n\nAt the beginning of his chapter with our rescue, Timmy was super shy and scared, but now he seeks attention and sleeps in bed with his foster momma. (And a few other beagles).\n\nTimmy likes to go for walks and does fine on leash, as long as you let him use his super beagle sniffer along the way!\n\nTimmy exhibits some signs of separation anxiety, but can be crated (with a little pharmaceutical help) while his foster mom works long hours. We'd prefer that he go to a home where someone is home a fair bit, but he copes with being left when necessary.\n\nWe are seeking an adopter who is patient and extremely kind and understanding.\n\nTimmy is a sensitive soul who deserves someone who will go slow and accept him as the sweet, quirky fellow that we have grown to know and love. He's going to take a little extra work, but that's going to make his addition to the right family all the more satisfying.\n\nTimmy is 4 and half years old, neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, parasite-free, and on heartworm prevention. If you're interested in adding this goofball to your family please fill out an adoption application.All animal breeds and ages are a best estimate\n1/31/21 12:11 PM",

We've been treating them and taking care of her and they are close to healing. It seems obvious that she was kept in a yard and not taken care of properly. She has some arthritis in her left hip and it can be managed by a pain reducer/anti inflammatory pill prescribed by a Vet. Please be sure that this is in your budget if interested in adopting her. Daisy is sweet and affectionate and is very active. She will need home that is patient while training her and where she is treated like one of the family. Potential adopters should be experinced with size and breed. Daisy is looking for a home where she is the only pet and can soak up all the love. She is a barker and was probably kept outside as a guard dog. no doubt she would be better once she was let in and made part of the family.",

            "description": "Lola is a Belgian Shepherd mix who is 4 years old and we call her our \"street dog\". Her life before rescue wasn't the greatest, she was dumped when she got pregnant the first time and was finally trapped when she was found pregnant again with 2 of her one year old babies roaming the streets of Oklahoma. Lola is a VERY sweet, gentle girl. She does take a bit to warm up, as you can imagine the human hasn't always been her friend. She does enjoy running and playing with the other dogs in the house, her approach to humans is slow, but once she knows she can trust you, she will come to you for pets and ear scratches. Lola will take a special person that doesn't mind taking a week or two to allow her to adjust to her new home. She is crate and potty trained.\n\nLola came to rescue with heartworms, she finished her treatment on December 5th. This is all common, especially for a dog that fended for herself for at minimum 1.5 years. She is now healthy and ready to find that forever family to continue to spoil her and show her life doesn't have to be as rough as she started out in life.\n\nLola's adoption fee is $200.00 which includes DLPP, Bordetella, Rabies, Spay, Microchip and her next dose of heartworm preventative. If you are interested, please complete the\n\nAdoption Application\n\non our website at\n\na4apetpantry.org\n2/1/21 4:29 PM",

Toby was trapped in South Los Angeles with several BB pallets under his skin. Despite both having a rough start, they are very loving. Leia is more outgoing than Toby, so she helps him to come out of his shell. They are both very playful and very affectionate and silly. We are looking to place Leia and Toby together into an adult (no children) household with yard access (no apartment or condo situations). They are high energy but crash after they play and take naps. Both are the perfect size at about 45 lbs.\nThank you for your interest in adopting. Please make sure to read the dog's bio carefully. We get to know the dogs very well to make sure, they find the right match for their forever home. Due to limited staff during this crisis, please only contact us, if you meet the basic criteria listed in the dog's bio.\nIngrid\n(310) 480 6030\npcdrapps@yahoo.com\nIf you'd like to meet this cutie, please fill out our adoption application: http://www.pcdogrescue.org/online_application.html",

He loves the other dogs in his foster home and is more confident around them and his adoption requires another dog in the home. He's learning to be an indoor dog and to tolerate humans. If you're looking for a cuddle bug or only dog or a dog to hike or travel with, he's not your guy. If you're okay with aloof and know how to be around a fearful dog, let us know why you're the one at www.lovefordogs.org/adopt-foster so we can reach out. We will not be replying to every inquiry.",

Soon we can address her terrible teeth! Keep the good stuff coming her way!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nUPDATE: The news isn't good but it's not the worst news we have ever gotten. We will do all we can to improve her quality of life and make sure she knows she ma\ntters.\nFrom our vet's office:\nWe got Gracie worked over today and found many things going on. Her bloodwork showed increased white blood cells and an increased kidney value that we are worried about. Doc would like to start her on some IV fluids to help get that down. She has an ulcer on the right eye we want to start vetropolycin to see if we can improve that. Her left does have some minimal vision due to cataracts. Mouth is difficult to examine because she appears painful with it. That's something we will work on more as we go. She has fleas and chronic dermatitis for which we want to start apoquel for. An ear infection in the left ear. We will have mometamax to start for that. 4DX was positive for Lyme so we have doxycycline. Her fecal shows hooks, we have heartgard to get rid of those. We were able to vaccinate today.\nSo please send some good thoughts and GLOW to little Gracie as we move forward for her. She has suffered\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMeet TLC Rescue's newest intake...little Gracie\n\nGracie was with some awful people that tried to pull her teeth with pliers and just broke them off.\n\nShe appears blind in one eye and has quite a few problems. She is safe right now with one of our vet techs and will be going to our vet on Tuesday.\nShe will be completely checked out and get blood work and everything she needs. We will see what can be done about her mouth. She is very, very sweet and petite.\nI am so glad a kind person intervened and got her and that Chris reached out to me\n\nI won't even say what her old name was. It's Gracie now. All her past is just that...past, never to be seen again. Welcome to your new life, little love\n\nTLC Rescue is a reputable 501c3 so donations are deductible as allowed by law.

            "description": "Bosti is a graduate of our decompression program for shy and fearful dogs. When he came to us he was very scared to be in the shelter, but who wouldn't be? But, he really blossomed during his time with us. He's curious about other dogs, but has been keeping to himself for the most part. Bosti knows how to walk nicely on a leash and loves tasty treats, like chicken (smart guy). Bosti was brought to PACC as a stray after he climbed a six-foot fence to get to a lady he really wanted to meet, so he'd do best in a home with a secure fenced yard and a patient owner who is willing to give him time and space to become comfortable with his new family. Bosti lived with a family briefly who said he was a little too interested in their cats, so no kitties please! PUPDATE: Bosti spent about a month in a home where we learned that he was housebroken, did great with a 7 year old child, and enjoyed sleeping in bed with his owner. Ask Bosti's volunteer advocate, Robin, about him: rldaniels18@gmail.com BOSTI IS ENROLLED IN THE GOOD DOG PROJECT AT PACC - Read a message from his case manager here: tinyurl.com/gdpmessage - Ask his case manager about him: rachel.jones@pima.gov",

Our trainer feels she can be worked with, but will need an adopter who is willing to get the extra mile for this amazing girl. She will shower you with love and kisses. She has a lot of energy so we are recommending her forever home with only children OVER ten years of age, she loves all people! \n\nWe think she is a pit mix, possibly with greyhound and about a year old. She is very sleek. Melyzia LOVES running in a fenced in yard; she is super fast. Melyzia is also very food motivated and a people pleaser. \n\nMelyzia came in to us as a dumped stray and after 70k shares on Facebook, no one stepped forward. Look at that beautiful face!\n\nShe must go to a home with NO OTHER DOGS. She MAY find a perfect dog match working with a trainer. We are sure Melyzia would like to be the queen of her own castle. \n\nShe is utd on shots, dewormed with Drontal, on heartgard and flea & tick prevention. She is also microchipped! \n\nIf you are interested helping Melyzia get a furever family, go here to apply ??~~?~~??~~> https://goo.gl/AzrASu",

He knows sit, shake, heel, and has so much fun playing with his toys. He loves to go for car rides and anything outdoorsy works for him. As long as he has his human companion. Chief does need to be your one and only. No other pets in home, please.\n\nWe recommend Chief to be adopted into a home with no kids-- he does have some resource guarding tendancies and will do best with only one or 2 adults in the home, no other visitors or other people residing.\n\nHe likes to go to sleep early and will make sure you and your family are safe as he will be first one up making sure you are all still there and his family hasn't gone anywhere. Please open up your home to this young,playful, fun, loving sweetheart. He is a really cool dog and you don't want to miss this opportunity to have him apart of your family.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this dog, please visit our website for our online application www.underdogaz.com",

Deana is now a healthy 50 pounds but when found she was only half that. \n\nDEANA is a wonderful friend and companion who would be an excellent addition to any family!\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIf you would like to meet, foster or adopt this pet, please fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser. EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

Poppy was already at our rescue when Parker came. Parker was found almost dead with severe roadburns, on a horse trail. Our vet performed a miracle and with medical care and lots of TLC, Parker has made a full recovery. Once he was ready to join our small dog playgroup, he picked Poppy as his favourite playmate. They spend pretty much all day together and we are looking to place them into a home together. They love to sit in your lap and snuggle but they are young and active so they wouldn't be a good match for a senior household. Poppy and Parker are looking for an adult household (no children) with yard access (no apartment or condo situations). They are both super sweet but will need a gentle home with a slow introduction to the big world out there.\nThank you for your interest in adopting. Please make sure to read the dog's bio carefully. We get to know the dogs very well to make sure, they find the right match for their forever home. Due to limited staff during this crisis, please only contact us, if you meet the basic criteria listed in the dog's bio.\nIngrid\n(310) 480 6030\npcdrapps@yahoo.com\n",

Tank doesn't seem to mind other dogs, but we require meet and greets just to make sure. He may treat cats as chew toys so we would recommend no cats in the household. \n\nWE ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING BY APPOINTMENT ONLY DUE TO COVID-19\nUnless otherwise stated, the adoption fees for dogs over 5 months range from $50-$175. Puppies under 5 months are $175.00. Cats over 1 year are $35.00, kittens under 1 year old are $60.00. Dog adoption fees include a microchip. Cats can be microchipped by request for an additional $5.00.\nThe adoption fee includes the animal's surgery, vaccinations, flea preventative, deworming medication, sample bag of food/treat samples and a free first exam with participating veterinarians. Shelter policy and 2018 Indiana state law decrees all animals must be spayed or neutered prior to leaving the shelter.\nWE ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING BY APPOINTMENT ONLY DUE TO COVID-19\nOur shelter is open to the public on Monday- Saturday from 8:00 am -5:00 pm EST with the exception of Wednesdays on which we typically open by 1:00 pm. If you would like to make an appointment to meet one of our many adoptable animals, please send an email to us at pvchs@joink.com. To apply to adopt, you may download an adoption application from the Applications and Fees tab on our website. The web address is www.pvchs.cfsites.org.

Puppies under 5 months are $175.00. Cats over 1 year are $35.00, kittens under 1 year old are $60.00. Dog adoption fees include a microchip.

I love to play wih other dogs, but I prefer female dogs. I love to chase cats. Not suited to a home with cats.\nCrate/house trained: I am not 100% on crate/house training. I need a lot of time and patience.\nCar rides: Nervous at first. Once I get to know you and your car, it is no big deal. I will be good I promise. \nLeash walks: I am good on leash. I have scars on my neck, I am more comfortable and walk much better in a harness. \nVacc/worming/flea: UTD on vaccinations? Flea/tick, worming? Vet checked? Microchipped?\n\nHello, my name is CRICKET. I was born on the island of Antigua. Things have happened in my past that only my eyes have seen. I have some scars to prove that some people were not very nice to me. \nI used to live on the streets of Antigua. Once owned, but discarded like trash. I struggled to find food, and survive. Street dogs often perish from hunger, disease, poison, or run over by cars. It's a tough life on the street. A nice lady spotted me, and started to feed me, eventually I was able to get to a vet.\nNow I've made the journey to Canada to find my Fur Ever home. I have tested positive for heartworm. What does that mean? Not much really, you would not know I have it. I'm not sick. I have been treated already. I just need to have a blood test in a few months to make sure it's all gone. I'm bouncy and playful, sweet, and sensitive too. I want to please you, and have learned already a few basic commands. I would prefer a quieter home, since I'm not used to busy streets and noises. I love to run and leap through the fields. A large property would be ideal for me. I havent had much experience living inside a house, so I will need someone to help me through patience and structure. I have worn belly bands to prevent indoor marking.  When left alone I get anxious. I may bark, howl, mess, or be destructive inside and/or have anxiety in the crate.\nI have proven that with time, exercise and patience I can be crated successfully, and be good in the house with minimal accidents. But this doesnt come easy, it requires a knowledgeable person and the right environment. This could take several weeks, or even months for me to become comfortable. An alternative would be an outdoor heated shed or kennel that I could go in while I cant be watched. I dont mind this option at all, this works for me!\nI am a smart guy, I love to cuddle and I love to hang out with my people. My favourite thing is to go out for hikes in the woods. I love to run! I will stay nearby my family. \nI have so much love to give, I will be patient for that perfect home. If you think you have the right environment for me, fill out an application!\nClick the application link here:\nhttps://form.jotform.co/83008434566862\nfureverfriendsadoption@gmail.com \nLove Cricket ?",

This sweet fella lived on a 5ft chain with another female companion of his life. A Tail To Be Told Animal Rescue stepped up and took him and his female companion in. Not surprisingly, he also tested positive for heartworms . He received his treatment and now is on monthly prevention. He has made a full recovery and live a long and healthy life thanks to this wonderful rescue. If you like the Boxer personality this is your guy. He is goofy, wiggly and 100% all about getting love and affection. Zeus is doing great with his house training ( bell training) and is already crate trained. He has rocked his board and train program so far and ready for adoption. He knows all his basic commands, working on house manners, door manners, leash walking at a heel and recall. We know Zeus needs to go to a home without kitties or small animals. He would prefer to be the only dog or a submissive female ( He did have a bad experience with another dog attacked him. Since then he has become fearful and can be aggressive when meeting new dogs) We would really like Zeus to find a home before his board and train is completed with Enriched canine training, so he does not have to go back to the rescue.\nThe trainer will complete a turnover lesson with you as well as give a follow up complementary lesson with you and Zeus to make sure you are set up for success.",

She's approximately 4 year old, spayed female - breed is our best guess...  She is extremely loveable with her person - preferably female- Her special need is that she has extreme stranger danger and will go after new people.  It takes her time to warm up but once she does she is extremely loving and playful - loves playing ball in the yard!  She needs time to feel safe and still is not a fan of being grabbed at - I feel she may have been punished that way.  she is very treat motivated - but she was surrendered to a kill shelter with a bite history when someone tried to grab and drag her out from under a table - Please inquire if you have a quiet home with no visitors, no children, no other pets - she can get along with other dogs, but she is very pushy at first and doesn't back down.  Please inquire if you'd like an application to meet this young lady.  In her foster home she does amazingly well!",

Beans fetches perfectly, gives you the ball, and sits patiently. Beans really, really love soccer, but can easily learn more advanced games, like frisbee. He also plays fetch in the water!\n\nHe greets dogs well on a leash, and occasionally likes to play with other dogs. He does not want to live with other dogs, and prefers to play with humans.\n\nBeans likes chew toys, and does not suffer from separation anxiety. He is not overly cuddly - he prefers play, but is affectionate and excited towards his humans.\n\nBeans had an issue meeting new people when he first came to us - this is now resolved, and he feels confident within a few minutes of meeting someone new.\n\nBeans is one year old and healthy.\nHe is up to date on vaccines, dewormer and heartworm prevention, and had been neutered.\n\nrebeldogsdetroit.com/applytoadopt",

He wants to be wherever you are, sitting/lying right next to you or ON you ? He's like that annoying little brother that follows you everywhere, instigates you to play, and wants to do everything you do but that you can't help but love and adore!!! Paloma (Banjo's housemate)  is always quick to correct him and like a good puppy in training, he listens. He is still a big puppy, but he is AMAZING!!! Once he puts his big ol' paw on you and gazes into your eyes, you fall so in-love!!! So if you're looking for a forever love to fulfill your home, family, and heart...Banjo may be your guy! Banjo has been working with a trainer to make him a more polite gentlemen, and it's going very well.  Banjo seems to be generally fearful of new people, and needs to be introduced slowly to new people and situations.. Undersocialized dogs can be easily intimidated or confused by human body language that mimics canine body language - things like maintained eye contact, stiffness, sudden motion, sticking out hands to be sniffed/deliver treats, etc. Banjo's overall excitement combining with this fear in the moment leads to  overreactions. We are looking for an adopter who will be patient and continue with his training.  \n\n-----\nTo adopt please complete the application at tarnj.org/adopt\n\nIf you have any questions at all, please DO NOT use the PetFinder inquiry form. Please email us at info@tarnj.org.\n\nWe are all volunteer-run and do our best to respond to every application, if there is a match, within 2-5 days. If you do not hear from us, please check your Junk folder or email us for an update.",

            "description": "This handsome guy is Kashi. He is a three year old, 90 pound Yellow Labrador Retriever and Shepherd mix. He is fully vetted and ready to find his forever family.\n\nKashi is young boy with lots of puppy energy still! He is big and never taught just how big he is. While he doesn't have a mean bone in his body, his size sometimes gets in the way of his play, like when he knocks you over by accident. He seems to pick up new commands quickly, but he is easily distracted when he sees something like a squirrel or cat (he has a prey drive). In his foster home he is playing with other dogs of different sizes and ages.\n\nKashi rides very well in the car! He will sit or laydown and stay the whole drive. He will be a great family dog if you give him time to settle down and are willing to work with him on his manners. If you have young children, please consider his size and the fact that he can't stop quickly and plays a little rough, so small children (or adults) could easily be knocked down or pushed over.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Kashi please submit an inquiry directly with Greater Charlotte SPCA by visiting charlottespca.org/adopt.\n\n***Because our rescue is composed entirely of volunteers and we require a home check for each of our adoptable pets prior to them going to their new homes, local applications will take precedence. We will accept out of town applications, but any family further than 60 miles from Charlotte is responsible for finding a representative of a rescue local to them that is willing to perform the home check. All out of town applicants will also have to be willing to drive to Charlotte to meet/pick up the pet as soon as the application is approved.***",

Ideally, adopters of dogs in the BLUE category will be knowledgeable in the area(s) the dog will be challenging; therefore, adopters should be willing to participate in a training plan to further the work staff and volunteers already have started. \n\nDogs are assigned to color categories using any previous owner notes, general handling, as well as staff and volunteer observations. As we continue to get to know the dogs and gather further insights into their personalities, colors may be adjusted accordingly.\n\nRancho Coastal Humane Society remains temporarily closed to the general public, but we have companion animals in our care that are ready for adoption BY APPOINTMENT ONLY, and our staff is ready to make that happen! Please visit our website for updates and more information.

I am currently lounging in a fantastic foster home so please allow for a 24 hour notice for a meet and greet appointment. I will need to stay on my special food for allergies but the nice staff will be more than happy to go over all of that with you. Can't wait to meet you!\n\nWeight: 41.40 lbs.\n\nAdoption Price: $100\n\nWANT TO TAKE ME HOME TODAY? SCHEDULE AND ADOPTION APPOINTMENT.\nTo Schedule An Adoption Appointment:\n1. Fill out and submit our online Adoption Application.\n2. Please only submit ONE Adoption Application. (Our Application is for general pre-approval, not for a specific adoptable animal).\n3.

If you haven't found your perfect match at the shelter, that's okay too - pre-approved applications are valid for 6 months!\n\nCome prepared! Please bring proof of a current rabies vaccine for all pets living in the home. If you have another dog, you are welcome to bring him or her with you so that we can safely perform a dog interaction.\n\nUnfortunately, animals cannot be held for you.\n\nA Special Note from the Allen County SPCA:\nRemember, pets are a lifelong commitment. We at the Allen County SPCA ask that you take adding a furry family member to your home seriously, and do your research on the different breeds before adopting. We also ask that you are able to keep up on yearly vaccinations, monthly preventatives, a good diet, daily exercise, training, and most of all, LOVE. If you ever have an issue with a pet that you adopted, please contact us right away; we may be able to help, or we can put you in touch with someone who can. All set? Come in and adopt today!",

            "description": "Meet Eliza!\n\nThis one year old petite border collie mix is looking for a special person to continue her training and socialization. She is very fearful and distrustful of people until she bonds, but once she trusts is a fun high energy walking, hiking and jogging companion with her chosen buddy. She's fearful and avoids other dogs and is looking for a calmer adult home with just one person she can bond to and protect. She loves to catch frisbees and play fetch and is a dog who needs a \"job\" to keep her mind busy and give her an appropriate outlet for her energy... no couch potatos for this dog! Eliza is about 35lbs full grown and has the intelligence and energy of a border collie, with a bit more of the independent attitude of a shiba or spitz type breed. Please submit an application for an appointment to meet her Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: White Age: 1yrs 4mths 1wks Animal has been Spayed",

My ID number is 333962\n\nIam available for adoption; however due to my breed my adoption will have to be facilitated through a rescue organization. Please see the front desk staff or contact the Shelter at (248) 858-1070 for more information.\n\nMeet Dennis! Check out this happy youngster! Dennis has the best disposition...he is happy and agreeable! He loves to play, play and play some more! Dennis was found running the streets and at 1.5 years old, that was no place for him! With so much life ahead of him, Dennis hopes to join an active family where he can be included in all the adventures! Looking for a very cool side-kick? Dennis is your guy!\n\nThe following descriptions describe behaviors that were observed during testing and/or veterinary examination: evaluated for temperament with 333881 (male), and 333797, 334079 (females). did very well with all. he is interested in wild play. this may not be acceptable behavior with older more reserved dogs 8/20/2020\n\nAmerican Pit Bulls are a misunderstood breed; for this reason, we implore adopters to these beautiful dogs to be very vigilant in training and socialization. This breed is very energetic and will need daily exercise. Because of their strength and energy, apartment living may not be the best fit. This breed can be loving, loyal and very smart. \n\nThe above behaviors and personality traits have been observed while at the Shelter. If this animal was relinquished, information is gathered from the owner regarding behavior. Our wonderful volunteers spend time with these animals and give input on behaviors and traits. However, this description may not be all inclusive to how this animal will act in a loving forever home. Introduction to established family pets should be slow and monitored always. The same goes for children and other family members. Adopting a pet is a big decision and should be thoughtful. We suggest researching different breeds to match traits and personalities to your lifestyle. When adopting a pet, please know that this pet will be with you for their lifetime; patience and consistency will make for a successful adoption.\n\n Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: White Weight: 65lbs Age: 1yrs 11mths 1wks Animal has been Neutered",

            "description": "Lakota is a young and playful dog in search of a better matched home.  He is very strong with plenty of energy, and needs a strong person to handle his level of activity.  Lakota will need space to run at his new home, and  he does have a bit of separation anxiety (he was originally found wandering but no owner claimed him). His behavior is the lab part of him  - he is NOT the \"guard my sheep\" type.  Lakota is playful with other dogs but probably not a good fit with other animals including cats, chickens, etc.\n\nLakota is a very loving dog.  He is quite smart and he is good off leash - he listens well and won't take off.  So he's great for hiking and horseback riding.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about Lakota please call Meghan at home 530 474-1729 for more information (no early morning or late night calls, please).  Lakota is a sweet dog, and with a confident owner and the right setting he'll be a great companion!\n",

He hasn\u2019t been crated in over a year. When asked if he was good with other dogs she said she didn\u2019t know. Same with kids. It was just them and him. But he was always good when people came over. Excited but good. \n\nMax was adopted at the end of July but it is not working out with the adopters boyfriend. Max is a typical German Shepherd- he\u2019s protective over his family. He is also still decompressing after his family surrendered him back to us. He is confused. Max needs a home without other dogs or cats. A quiet home with a fenced yard. And someone with experience with GSD\u2019s who will understand him and know how to handle him. He\u2019s about 100lbs. I\u2019ve met him and he\u2019s a great dog! Someone please give this poor boy a chance!! \n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Max, please visit our website to apply:\n\nhttp://queencitypitties.com/adoption-application/",

Takes commands and direction well so could be a candidate for agility or specialty training. Requires a GSD experienced home and no small kids because she might knock them down with her activity level. Most likely a no with cats and small dogs based on her prey drive, but we can test beforehand with an approved adopter. Crate & house trained.\n\nInterested in adding Daisy to your family?

Sadly, his momma was flooded by Hurricane Sally and lost everything she had and as hard as it was she had to surrender her pups because that is what she felt was the best decision. Jojo is a Chi mix. He was originally picked up as a stray a several years back. He was so scared you couldn\u2019t hardly touch him. This boy has come so far. He\u2019s still timid in new situations and needs some patience to get adjusted and comfortable but he\u2019s the sweetest guy. He\u2019s great with all size dogs and cats. Sometimes they play and chase the cats but never hurt them and will even eat out of the same bowl as them. Jojo May have a lot more gray than the original pic we were sent but this boy still has lots of years and spunk left. He\u2019s a super sweet boy who is doing fantastic in his new foster home. Jojo is around 10 years old and 15ish lbs. He will use a doggy door and loves to go outside. Jojo is utd, hw neg (tested below detectable levels) and neutered. \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue.

She particularly enjoys chasing tennis balls.   Daisy Mae is playful, sweet and goofy, all at the same time.  She has her favorite rope toy that loves to play with.  She loves kids & other pups alike!  What Daisy Mae really wants is a furever family all of her own!    Won't you please consider this sweet girl?  \n\nAll our adoption fees include spay/neuter, micro-chip, up-to-date vaccinations, including rabies thru date of adoption.

Part of our approval process requires, among other things:\n* Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered.\n*The majority, but not all, of our pets require a fenced yard or secure enclosure.  In the case of apartments, we require Landlord approval and designated dog area in complex.\n*Verifiable good veterinary history INCLUDING regular vaccination/visits and good Heartworm Prevention history is a MUST!\n*Adopter must be able to have time to spend with the pup and be able to provide the pup a safe environment to live.\n*ALL our dogs are expected to be primarily INSIDE dogs.  They MUST sleep inside the home.  We truly understand that some folks have working dogs (i.e. farmers, ranchers,etc); however, the majority of our dogs have had a rough life prior to coming to us & we want to make sure that they are showered with LUV & maybe even a bit spoiled for the rest of their lives. \n\nOther facts are also considered, including whether children or other pets are a good fit with the dog. \n\nMust Luv Dogs reserves the right to deny any applications that we don't think are a good fit with the pup. Our first & foremost concern is the dog's best interest. It is our MISSION to place them in a home that is a great fit for their needs for a lifetime of luv & being part of a family.\n*We will consider adoptions in any area; however, will do not ship or transport puppies under the age of 12 mos. We will ONLY transport an adult dog on a transport approved by MLD, at adopter's expense.\n* In order to be affordable and afford every family an opportunity to have a pup of their own, we keep our Adoption Fees low; however, please keep in mind that the fees we charge do not cover all costs for the pup.  Any additional donations are greatly appreciated!\n\nPlease note that all of our pets are in private foster homes. In order to reduce any stress or confusion for our pups, we require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meet & greet for any of our pups.  Alternatively, you are always welcome to come meet any of our pups at one of our regular Adoption Events.   Our events are always posted on PetFinder OR on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/mustLUVdogs.org.\n\nFinally, THANK YOU for considering Must Luv Dogs for your next pet. \n\n*Most dogs require a fenced area in yard. \n*Apartments okay IF nearby dog park or walking trails (with landlord appoval).\n*ALL dogs must be INSIDE dogs and treated a part of family. \n*We are a DUE DILIGENCE Adoption Rescue.  \n*Must have good Vet history & Heartworm prevention is a MUST!\n*ALL dogs are fully vetted, spay/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption.\n\nFYI:   Even though this pup tested heartworm negative, we provide the following procedural information for your information:  Any of our pups who test HW+ are treated with the *slow kill method of treatment.   The *slow-kill method, simply stated, is a 30 day regiment of  doxycycline followed by a monthly dose of Advantage Multi for 12 months, then retesting.   Most dogs test negative after one year of following this treatment; however, we always recommend that potential adopters consult & follow the advice of their family veterinarian upon adopting any of our hw+ pups.   Although the fast-kill method is still considered the \"gold-standard\" by the AVA, and may be preferred by some vets; the slow-kill method has proven to be effective in our rescue. The main reason we utilize this method is due to our limited financial constraints and the high number of our rescue pups that are infected.   In the cases of severe infection and if the pup is highly symptomatic, we sometimes use the fast-kill approach instead.   Again, we recommend for you to consult with your veterinarian after the adoption is complete and follow their recommendations.",

She is a good weight and full grown.   She runs after the ball and runs with it in her mouth but needs to work on the retrieving part.   Her teeth look great and she has been well cared for in her previous home.  She was owned by an older man that now doesn\u2019t feel he can give her a good home.  She would be best with an active family.  She is a burst of energy kind of gal and then she is chill and enjoys lounging around.  She is good with all people and no one is a stranger and all are potential friends.  She jumps up which as we can see is her only negative.  She is potty trained and decent on the leash.  She has lived as an only dog so that probably will be her best home again.   She will be a head turner for sure and will be perfect for the active lifestyle where you take your dog to the store or local coffee shops.  She is a good representation of the bully breed.  She is healthy, getting some new vaccines and will be spayed soon.  She is here in Texas and can be adopted locally or we can work with one of the wonderful transporters to deliver her to Washington, Portland, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Vermont or all along the East Coast.  Her adoption fee is 250 and transport is 185.  Rhode Island and Massachusetts are not states we adopt to because of the regulations imposed by these states\n \n \nContact Marlene at 210-867-1769 or email to ccpalinquiries@gmail.com if you have questions.  Online applications at www.ccpal.info/    See her cute video!!",

People just kept passing me by.  I was so sad because I didn't understand why. Another dog, Sandy, was getting pulled from my shelter and the nice girl there pleaded for me to be rescued too because I was one of her favorites... so, here I am!\n\nMy foster family now knows why I was one of the favorites at the shelter.  I have so much love to give and I adore my foster family so much.  I'm a 7 year old bully mix that is an absolute lovable goof.  My foster family is not sure if I ever lived in a house before and I'm not talking, so this in an ongoing learning experience.\n\nI'm very smart and I have made tons of progress!  I'm perfectly crate trained and definitely treat motivated. I do well on a leash and enjoy my baths. I like hanging out with my new buddies, Sandy and Finn.  A couple of my favorite past times are rolling in the grass and laying on the couch with my foster family. This happy go-lucky boy so wants to hang out with my people.\n\nI'm just a huggable lug that is waiting for just the right arms to hug me just right.\n\nLove, \nTodd\n\n\nTodd would be best suited in a home with children over 7 years old.  He loves to cuddle with his people, but sometimes doesn't realize he's not a little dog. Technically a senior, adoption fee is $125, but he hasn't slowed down and is active and affectionate. If you would like more information or to set up a meet with Todd, contact his foster dad, Dan, @ 865-919-3437 or thenumber1evild@gail.com.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all Almost Home dogs are healthy, spayed/neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, and flea & tick preventative.",

My foster mom has helped socialize me with cats and I'm good wit other dogs with a proper introduction. Kids are scary. I've never been around them before my foster mom's grandkids and I didn't do well. They make me uncomfortable and I would much prefer a home without them. I am a good girl, I love all things life- except tiny humans. I will need a home with a fully fenced in yard & an active family. \n\nMy family who surrendered me to The Pit Bull Pen took me to the dog park frequently, but never socialized me with people, kids, cats or anything except other dogs. Please be patient with me, change is hard. I'm under 2 years old and have been in 2 homes, please make the third my last and final home! I promise to do the best I can and be a good pupper for you. I am already spayed, up to date on vaccinations, microchipped and ready to love you for the rest of my life. \n\nApply here: thepitbullpen.org",

She's extremely smart and will be a loyal best friend to you. She's a little unsure of new surroundings and people, but warms up quickly. She does need a yard and a house, she is not suited for apartment living or dog parks.\n\nHasn't been dog- or cat-tested yet, so more to come on this beauty soon!\n\n \n\n \n\nApplications are at https://bit.ly/codys_adoption_application.",

            "description": "Update from foster: Willow has settled in at her foster home and has mastered crate training! She has also been reintroduced to kids and did wonderful with them, although her tail can still be a whip when she is happy (which is most of the time). As she has settled in and gotten used to her surroundings, she barks less, unless of course the door bell rings or someone knocks on the door. She loves her walks but also loves to curl up next toyou and sleep the chilly afternoons away. Willow is still a snuggle-bug, in fact she prefers to snuggle under the covers with you on the cold winter nights. \n\nWillow, born September 2017, is a Parvo victim. Her fur-sibling died of Parvo, and, when Willow started showing symptoms, she was taken to a shelter to be euthanized. Muddy Paws was contacted, and Willow received treatment and has made a complete recovery. Willow is a little shy at first but once she warms up to you, she loves to snuggle and has unlimited kisses. She is energetic and loves to go for walks and run around the fenced yard. Willow gets along with other dogs and is indifferent to cats. She is potty-trained and working on crate training. She has some separation anxiety so she prefers to have people around as much as possible as she doesnt like the crate yet and can be a little destructive and quite noisy when she is alone. Willow likes to let you know when she hears any weird noise (like the toilet flushing, etc) so apartment life would not be a good fit for her. She has been known to nip and her tail can be classified as a secret weapon so she would prefer to be around children 10 years old or older.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Willow is $350. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

Although she has never had formal training she does know sit and she would love to learn more. She is a total inside dog and I will not let her go to a home that doesn\u2019t let her be one. She\u2019s used to sleeping on the bed with me. She MUST NOT have other pets in the home. I have had her since she was 8 weeks old and due to circumstances I can not control I need to find her a new home. She is now 4 and is the best dog ever! She is fixed, microchipped, up to date on shots and loves to be with humans. She is the perfect companion animal.  Willing to dog-sit her for free when you need a dog sitter.  I\u2019m requiring a $100 re-homimg fee to ensure you can afford her and that all inquires are serious.\n\nPlease contact me if you would like to meet her:\n\nConnie-  guamccruz@gmail.com\nph: 404.507.2789",

Learn more about me by reading my profile below; I just might be your new best friend! Apply on our website\n(\n\nhttps://www.healingheartsrescue.org/adopt\n\n)\n\nto\n\nset up a private meeting or check below for my adoption event schedule.\n\nAge: 2 years\n\nWeight: 65 pounds\n\nDog friendly: Not currently, maybe with some proper training\n\nCat friendly: Unknown\n\nKid friendly: Best with no kids or dog savvy older kids\n\nPotty trained: Yes\n\nCrate trained: yes, not not a fan of it when people aren't home\n\nHello, My name is Kaia and I love squirrels, chipmunks and being outside. My early days involved some difficult situations. I had two mean sisters. Since being rescued I am working on doing my best interacting with a loving family. I love being outside and playing so much, I forget that I weigh 65 pounds and get a little goofy. I do best with a fenced yard and plenty of room to run. I have been through basic manner training and am excellent in my potty habits. I am a super fast learner and I am very smart.\n\nLet's talk about Walks!!! I love, love, love, love them. I have a lot of energy and love to walk and run with my owners. I have been working hard on loose leash walking but sometimes my nose overtakes my brain and I forget to walk when I smell squirrelies or see other doggies. After a day of good exercise, I like to crash peacefully around where the family is or put myself in my kennel. Regarding my kennel, I don't mind sleeping there but want to be with my family as much as possible. I have some separation anxiety and don't always like the kennel, when they are gone.\n\nIf you know pitties, you know we're really comedic, loving and loyal. I'm all those things, and love to snuggle on the couch and on the bed. Also as a typical pittie, I can be a bit bullheaded. I thrive in a home with a strong pack leader who gives me the correct direction I need to thrive. I would do best in a home with either no kids or older, dog savvy kids as I tend to try to take advantage of their weakness if given the chance. I love meeting all people, including kids, outside of my home tho and can be a perfect angel when you tell me I need to be.\n\nI can't wait to find my forever family. Do you think it might be you?\n\nAdoption Fee: $195\n\nINTERESTED IN MEETING ME?\n\nIf you'd like to arrange a private meeting or begin the adoption process, please fill out an adoption application by visiting\n\nhttps://www.healingheartsrescue.org/adopt\n\n**Note on breed and age determination:\n\nBreed and age are often determined on appearance, our own knowledge, veterinarian advice, and/or information from the sending shelters or previous owners. Most of our adoptable dogs were previously stray dogs with little history, we can't be 100% sure of a dog's breed mix, and unless there is a specific date of birth listed, we can't be 100% sure of a dog's age. Additionally, our assessments of a dog's interactions with other dogs, cats, or children are based on OUR experiences. Your experience may differ.\n\nADOPTION FEE INCLUDES:\n\nWellness check\n\nSpay/neuter (puppies adopted with required spay/neuter certificate)\n\nAge appropriate vaccines - rabies as required by law and distemper combo or proof of positive titer test\n\nHeartworm test if over 7 months of age\n\nFecal test and/or deworming for parasites\n\nMicrochip\n\n\n\n~ Healing Hearts rescue will also provide dental procedures, bloodwork, surgeries, and/or any other additional vet work as needed while dogs are in our care.\n\n~ Adoption fees are non-negotiable and fees are listed on the dog's profile\n\n~ Adoption fees can be paid the following ways with the required sales tax (7.525%) added:\n\nPayPal\n\nCredit Card\n\nCash\n\nWANT TO HELP SAVE MORE DOGS?\n\nHealing Hearts Rescue is a nonprofit, foster-based rescue\n\nlocated in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota\n\nthat is 100% funded through adoption fees and donations\n\n. We are excited for you to join us on this mission to save the lives of dogs in need.\n\nWe believe every dog deserves to be loved as true members of a family and are committed to fulfilling that dream one dog at a time!

I am a very loving gal and I just want to be your best friend. I love to play with other dogs of similar energy. I am a sweet pup that would enjoy anything you would like to do whether it is cuddling up next to you while you enjoy a good book, take a stroll or settle in for a nap. Sadly me previous owner did not give monthly heart worm preventative and now I have tested positive for heart worm disease. The nice people of BDRR will get me all fixed up by giving me heart worm medicine. They can explain the whole process to you and then also tell you why it's so important to keep us pups on monthly heart worm preventative. I can't wait to go home to a forever loving home!",

When he\u2019s by himself,  he loves to play and chase sticks and toys. \nCooper definitely needs a backyard with a tall fence because he can jump really high. Cooper hasn\u2019t met too many cats yet, but seems to mostly ignore the neighbor\u2019s cat when he sees them on walks.\nCooper has been working on jumping. Most of the time, he\u2019s just excited to give you a huge, but he\u2019s still making progress on being calmer inside the house. He\u2019s definitely not a destructive dog, but does need attention and supervision in the house because he\u2019s so curious and energetic. Cooper can get nervous when he sees a flat hand or rolled up newspaper, but he\u2019s made a lot of progress with this since being at his foster home.\n\nCooper is heartworm negative, neutered, and up to date on shots and vaccines. \nHe hasn\u2019t had an accident in the house since being neutered. He\u2019s does great in a crate as well. \nCooper loves playing, chewing toys, and even bath time. He would make a great family dog, but would be best without small children.\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

            "description": "There is nothing better than a big ole Hound Dog and Trapper is the perfect one if you love the breed! He is a Black and Tan Coonhound around 12-18 months old. This boy is fun loving and playful. Like most hounds, he probably got a sniff of some wonderful smell and took off to follow his nose. Before he knew it, he was far from his home and lost. We tried for several weeks to find his owner but no one has claimed him. Trapper is now ready to find a new home and a fresh start. Hounds require a fenced yard to keep them safe from doing what nature has taught them to do and that is follow their nose. This sweet boy has shown us that he is such a great dog. He is doing so well on his house training and loves the company of other dogs and all humans, big and small. Cats would not be recommended due to his breed and we insist on a secured and big fenced yard. Trapper came to us under weight and currently weights about 60 lbs. He is enjoying every meal and will soon blossom. Trapper is neutered and fully vetted and ready to share the couch with his new family. If you are interested please email at ccrtennessee@gmail.com\nADOPTION FEE REQUIRED. Contact ccrtennessee@gmail.com.",

She was living outside, covered in fleas and dirt.\n\nShe's 9 years old, and in dire need of a dental and a hw test and updates to all vaccines.\n\nPlease consider making a donation to this senior purebred Dobie! She's a fantastic dog, and once she receives the care she needs, I have no doubt she'll be a stunner!\n\n*Update!\n\nSchotzie is doing great!! She's gaining weight and her coat is improving but we did find that she is heartworm positive and we've started the treatment process. The entire cost for the heartworm treatment is $609. Any donation towards her care will be greatly appreciated, it all adds up! Let's help this beautiful senior get healthy\n\nNo Cats!",

Cooper is a owner surrender who seems to steal the hearts of everyone he meets. Cooper has told us he appreciates a strong, calm and confident human sidekick to enjoy his adventures with, and one who will help him make the right choices when it comes to discerning those he meets. He has proven to be quite the gentleman when paired with a person whom he trusts. As a teenage pup he asks for training and patience as he continues to learn his manners that he\u2019s been mastering well so far. He would prefer to be in a home where he\u2019s the the only dog you love. He prefers not to be approached by large dogs during his outings, but will happily allow small quiet dogs to walk by him. Favorite activities are playing fetch, walks in the park where he tries to make friends with the squirrels, and exploring the countryside with his human companion.

            "description": "Archer came to our rescue after being picked up as a stray. He doesn't know his front ankles aren't 'normal' as he gets around just fine. This condition is Angular Limb Disorder and attempting surgeries to resolve could make his situation worse. While he wouldn't be a great running companion he still loves going for walks and short jogs. Long or strenuous walks could make him sore, so his family would want to avoid that as he would go if asked.\n\nThis handsome boy is a happy, outgoing, gentle soul. He loves humans of all sizes and ages. Being with his humans and getting attention is his very favorite thing. He lives with lots of other dogs and is fine with everyone unless they are nasty to him; he won't be bullied by anyone. He is good around the cats in his foster home who are very dog savvy. \n\nArcher has excellent house manners and is crate trained. He is engaged with his humans and treat motivated so would do well with training. He already has great recall and will sit for treats. He loves going for rides and would be a great go-everywhere dog. \n\nArcher is fully vetted - current vaccines, neutered, microchipped, and on flea/tick and heartworm prevention.",

That family taught her so much. She knows sit, lay down and shake. Cash is said to be good with kids and house trained, but might need to be an only dog.  She is up to date on shots, now spayed, heartworm tested negative and will be microchipped upon adoption.  She is waiting to meet you in run 882, her ID is 624969.  She wants to please and will happily try to roll all  the way around on her back for a treat. \n\nCash video - https://youtu.be/UjHwQScCaJw\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

I came from a sad situation where I was one of many dogs and as a result I was left alone a lot and didn't get the nurturing and socialization I needed.\n\nThat is in the past though and I am young (almost 2 years old) with my whole life ahead of me. I am in a foster home now and I learn a lot from watching my foster brother.\n\nMy foster mom has shown me what it is like to be loved and petted and I LOVE it and can't get enough! If you are patient with me it will be worth the wait and I will give you unconditional love. I am very loyal once I trust you and my foster mom even calls me a shadow. I want nothing more than a forever home where I can be petted, love, and grow.\n\nI would do well in a home with 1 (maybe 2) dog that is easy going so I can learn. I could be an only dog but it may take me longer to learn without pack mates to show me the ropes. A home with young, active children is probably not for me but I do well with older children.\n\nMy foster mom would be happy to answer questions, show you more pics, or even a video that shows my silly side!\n\nChihuahua/Pug mix\n\nAlmost 2 years old\n\nFully Vetted and Spayed\n\n$125 Adoption Fee",

            "description": "Sage is a wonderful dog who has probably one of the softest short coats you will ever feel.  Everyone who gets the opportunity to pet her comments on how soft she feels.  Once you are close to her you'll also learn why we call her Snortle Pig as she makes this grunting/snorting type sound when being loved.  She has the sweetest brown eyes with which she shows so much emotion.  You'll also know when she's happy or excited because she'll sing you a song and her whole body wiggles.  You best watch out for her tail which can get you and feel like getting hit with a whip.  If she's under the dining room table it'll sound like a game of pinball going on with how fast and furious it can be.  She's not big on kisses but she shows plenty of affection and sometimes tries getting in your lap despite being 60ish pounds.  \n\nShe is crate trained, house-trained, leash trained, and is very well listened.  Sage is also bike trained and treadmill trained and has no problem with either and she's never met exercise of any kind that she doesn't like.  She loves to play tug or Jolly Ball with you but isn't a throw a stick and fetch type dog.  She seems to fall in love with her Jolly Ball and then chews it to pieces over time and you have to sneakily throw it out eventually and surprise her with a new one.  If she sees you do this she'll most likely just stare at your trash can and not play with the new ball.  She does require quite a lot of exercise and would not do well in a slow paced environment.  Sage isn't the best with not getting on furniture, as she loves getting on beds and even more so if you let her under the covers. She loves a good morning snuggle in the bed and will let you know if she requires some petting by boxing you with her sandpaper paws as she looks at you lovingly.  That soft coat of hers is probably not the best feature for winter here and she loves being under blankets or in her jacket.  You'll know if she's cold as she will visibly get the shivers.  She'll also lay or stand as close to the woodstove as possible.\n\nSage is very food driven and will certainly let you know when she's hungry, which, come to think of it, is all the time.  Her eyes go back and forth from you to the pantry where the dog food is stored politely asking with her eyes \"Is it time? - the foods in here - do you know the foods in here? - is it time yet?\"  This action will be repeated regularly somewhere around 7:30am and 5pm daily.  She will also try to steal food and you have to be careful as she'll contort herself in whatever way required to snatch that dozen cookies off the counter you were planning on sharing with friends or family.  \n\nWe believe Sage will make for a great companion.  She is very unsure of herself and nervous around other dogs and we and a trainer have worked a lot with her to help her with this.  She still has plenty of work left though. Although she does well at being in a controlled environment with other dogs, we feel she would do best in a home as the only dog and would not be  the type of dog that enjoys dog social activities. Although she lives with kids, due to her insecure nature, we feel she would do best in an adult-only home. She also has a strong prey drive prey drive and should not live with cats or other small animals.   \n\nSage is looking for a patient and experienced owner who can help her with her insecurities. She will love you unconditionally as she loves our family.  She would love a home with lots of space and land or a big fenced yard.  She's not the type of dog who has ever tried to escape or get away from us, probably because she'd then be unsure where her next meal might come from.  Sage really is a wonderful dog, she's going to make someone very happy and feel very loved, and it's sad that we cannot be the fit for her and we're looking to provide her with the best opportunity for the life she deserves.",

Geo will be a great family member. The only thing to be careful with is she did run out the door of her foster home during the first week there and did not stop running until the foster caught her. She tore her ACL but we provided surgery to repair it Oct 30th and she's doing great. A secure home is needed with lots of love. 3 yrs old, 56 lb. Spay, vaccines, microchip provided.",

He loves being around his people and will take every opportunity available to cuddle. His foster mom calls him her shadow ?? Though he is estimated to be around 5 years old, he has a lot of energy and loves zooming around the yard and going on walks. He walks well with his harness but does pull at times. \n\nGoodwin does great with other dogs but he\u2019s not into having any cat friends. He\u2019s been in a house with children and has done excellent. He is very vocal, his foster mom is working on that, and although he\u2019s improved we think a house with older children would be best. He lives with a 6 year old and Goodwin has been amazing. .\n\nHe does great in his crate. He can sit, lay and give paw. Goodwin loves getting his neck and chest rubbed. He has so much love to give and he\u2019s learned and grown so much in just the couple months he\u2019s been with us.\n\nYou must be over 21 and a home owner to adopt me. Please visit www.pittiesandpurrs.org to fill out an application. For further information contact adoptpitties@gmail.com\n",

Those 4 legged things called cat though, yummy yummy I love them a little too much and can not be in a home with them. I am a huge fan of walks and love to visit with those small humoons. Please let me into your home, Id love to keep your feets warm!!\n\nI am currently in a foster home and not at HSNBA, if you are interested in meeting me, please contact the nice folks at HSNBA so they can put you in contact with my foster family to set up a meet & greet. E-mail HSNBA at adoption@hsnba.org, call us at: (830) 629-5287 or stop by and speak with the folks at HSNBA at 3353 Morningside Dr. to get your information sent over to my foster home. My foster family is the best and can give you more information on me.\n\nI have tested heartworm positive. This means I have a parasite and need treatment. While my friends at HSNBA desperately want to help me, the shelter is too stressful an environment to undertake treatment, and the treatment itself is very expensive. The shelter has a few options to help with treatment, and if I steal your heart you should talk with them and your vet about what my treatment is like. For more information on heartworms, please visit the American Heartworm Society here https://www.heartwormsociety.org/pet-owner-resources/heartworm-basicsHSNBA lists all animals online from the moment of intake, and our listings are updated automatically every midnight. Some of these animals may not be available for adoption at this moment, but you can always call the shelter at 830-629-5287 for clarification on the adoption process or the animal's current status.",

He is looking for a human who will take him on his next big outdoor adventure! He is polite and eager to meet folks who pet him, but he is not very interested in meeting other canines. Carter is not a big fan of a crate, but that is okay because be doesn't need one! He is house trained, and will politely scratch at the door to let you know it's time to stretch his legs, or have a potty break. Carter is very mellow, and is fine being left on his own indoors while you are out running errands. He also likes to be around his people and enjoys getting moral support. Carter has been through a lot in his short life, but he has not let it get him down! He is more mellow than most pups his age, which is great for a home that is looking for a chill pup to pamper. He is a cuddly, friendly, loving, calm, and gentle soul who is looking for the next lucky person to share his life. He is loyal to his humans, and will look at you with his big striking eyes when he wants attention. Carter would thrive in a home with adults only where he can be the solo top dog. He would love a home where he can sniff the backyard to his heart's content, but would do well in an apartment with outdoor access for potty breaks. Carter likes creature comforts, and relaxing with his humans and cuddling. He is just happy to have a human to love. Come meet Carter, he wants to cuddle!",

He has a great personality. Loves dogs and people. Hobbes weighs about 10 pounds and has the softest fur.\n\nHe is a pretty gentle guy. He plays well with other dogs and has low-medium energy. Hobbes is definitely a love bug. He likes to sleep under the covers with you and curls up as close to you as you will let him!\n\nWe are working on potty training. Hobbes is doing well but not 100% just yet.\n\nIf you would like to make Hobbes a part of your family, fill out an application. You can do so online at happidogrescue.com. Adoption fee is $295 and includes all vetting, neuter, and microchip.",

Simba is not tested with cats. \n\nSimba does well with kids and would make a great family dog. Due to his energy level and size, we are looking for kids of the age of 8.\n\nSimba is UTD on shots, microchipped and neutered. His adoption fee is $450.",

            "description": "Meet Edison, literally the happiest guy around. He has the best prance, snorts a lot, nd loves every person he meets! At 8 years old, he has the spunk of a younger pup and the love to relax like a seasoned gentleman.\n\nEdison does occasionally bump into things due to a dry eye issue, which sometimes makes it hard for him with his depth perception and part of his vision, but it never slows him down. He is ALWAYS happy ? \n\nEdison is working on mastering manners! His go to trick is paw! He does well with kids, but his dream home would have kids 5+, sometimes he can be mouthy. He loves dogs, but is way too much \u201cin your face\u201d enthusiastic. Most dogs would not appreciate it, so for this reason he would do best as an only dog.\n\nEdison is such an incredible boy, who just wants to live the comfy pampered life, play with stuffed animals, and live happily ever after!\n\nYou can apply online at our website at rescueapittie.org",

He is a high energy and drive Malinois through and through, and is looking for a loving and experienced forever home. In the right home he will thrive and be a wonderful companion. \n\nRocket is very energetic, strong and lacking training. He has a lot of energy that he needs help channeling in the right ways, as typical working breeds do. He will require a GSD or Malinois experiences home, that knows how to train and work with the breed. \n\nRocket is still working on his social skills with other dogs. At this time he should be an only dog in the home. With proper training and structure he could get better with other dogs. We do not recommend him with cats. \n\nSince he can be jumpy and mouthy, he needs a home with kids over 15, adult only preferred. \n\nRocket is in the process of being neutered and will be neutered prior to adoption. He is UTD on shots and microchipped. His adoption fee is $500.",

She loves to play - although her idea of fetch is more chase the ball and play with the ball rather than actually bring the ball back. LOL.\n\nShe's a beautiful girl with nice managers who is active without being spazzy. She enjoys a good romp but can also be calm. She loves people and enjoys playing with her doggy friends, too. \n\nRuby's approx. DOB is 7/1/2012.\n\nOur adoption fee is a $250.00 donation to Pup Squad Animal Rescue. Our adopted dogs are all spayed/neutered, vaccinated and micro-chipped. If you are interested in adoption, please go to www.pupsquad.org/adopt to read more about our policies and find our application. Applications should be submitted via the online form http://pupsquad.org/adopt/adoption-application.html.\n\nDuring COVID 19 - We may not be able to help coordinate transport out of state due to limited resources on our end and limited transport options to get the dogs to destinations outside of Texas.\n\nThank you for choosing to rescue an animal in need!\nwww.pupsquad.org",

Their destiny is leaving for their forever home as a bonded pair. These two start playing the minute their eyes open in the morning and they will continue until bedtime if allowed. These two love to do almost everything together including galloping in and out side-by-side for potty breaks, patrolling the property, and digging holes in the yard. Muffy is a sweet and sassy 5 year old Pyr mix who likes to supervise humans cooking in the kitchen and tends to want to help. She is a good-natured and well-mannered girl who loves to go on walks and rides and is always ready for her next adventure but is not at all opposed to an afternoon nap or cuddles with her foster mom on the couch. She will alert her humans to any potential activity occurring outside and when she's not guarding she likes to relax in the yard or tend to a good hole she and Barbie have started. Muffy knows several commands, including \"sit,\" \"shake,\" and \"come\" but typical of Pyrs, may decide not to do these unless you make it worth her while. Muffy need a home without cats or other small pets. Muffy does NOT like sharing food or treats with Barbie so they need to be separated while eating. Muffy and Barbie are being fostered in Tacoma, WA.\n\nAll our dogs require secure VISIBLE fencing. All current pets in adoptive home must be spayed/neutered and up to date on vaccinations.\n\nAdoption Fee: $350\n\nAll of our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped and up to date on vaccinations.\n\nTransport Fee: $300\n\nTransport fee includes the cost of transport plus the Health Certificate required for USDA approved transport.\n\nAdoption applications can be found on our website: www.greatpyrsandpaws.org\n\nhttps://greatpyrsandpaws.rescuegroups.org/forms/form?formid=5959\n\nNorthwest adopter pays cost of transport to independent transport company.

He is very high energy, smart, rides well in the car , is crate trained (he had no free reign in the house), has a tendency to run off,  and they reported he is good with other dogs, although he never lived with any so a dog meet would be required . He cannot be placed with cats. \n\nHe comes fixed, chipped, vaccinated, and heart worm tested negative.\n\n***If you are serious about adopting, you must first complete and submit an application on our website.

Florence was found wandering with her puppy Bisbee so we don't know much about her past or what she has been through but she needs a little help with her confidence. She has shown us that she knows how to trust and she has become tolerant of handling, and dare we say, she may like getting pet (good girl Florence!). She's a very brave lady. Florence has cherry eye that will be repaired before she goes home. This sweet girl is really starting to blossom and would love a quiet, patient home where she can learn to trust again. decomfosters@gmail.com for more info about Florence",

            "description": "\nMishka here! I am looking for some new digs away from my son! He has been following me around for the past year and not giving me any personal space! Kids! I was in a pretty bad place not long ago, being abandoned by my owner but a wonderful lady came along and got me away from that situation. She took me to a beautiful place in Montana where I now have room to run and play and get away from my son! I am learning how to walk on a leash and do other basic commands and will soon be ready to have my own family. I am not too sure about other dogs but I suppose a mellow male would be OK. I do like kids but the small ones seem to fall over a lot when they are around me and I don\u2019t want to hurt them so the bigger kids would probably be best.\n\nFrom Moonsong: Mishka is about 5 years old, spayed and up to date on her shots. She is in a 3 week training program in Montana and when finished, will be a great dog for almost anyone. She is guarded around other dogs so might do best in a home with no other dogs or a mellow male. She has been around young kids but we do feel because of her size, older kids would be best as she does get excited and could possibly knock a smaller child down. She is a sweet, very energetic dog who would love to be someone\u2019s running partner or be trained for skijoring. She will need some patience as she has little experience being inside and will need some house training. She is also a digger so a secure fence with a dig guard at the bottom is essential. If you\u2019re looking for that special dog that is longing for the love and attention she deserves, take another look at Mishka. She wants to go home with you!\n",

She is a sweet girl who just wants to be loved on. She loves everyone and is great with other dogs. This smart girl is also completely house trained and knows sit, shake, and down. Clara's puppies found their forever home and now she's looking for hers!\n\nBefore applying to adopt Clara, you need to be familiar with your local breed-specific legislation regarding Pit Bulls. Applicants must live within 50 miles of the Omaha/Council Bluffs area.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Clara is $350. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

            "description": "PAWS is currently closed due to COVID-19.  The animals are receiving the same high level of care as always.  During this time, we are taking application over the phone.  Until we can safely to resume normal operations, we will be taking deposits and doing adoptions by appointment only on Wednesday evenings, 5 - 7 PM and Saturdays from noon until 3.  We know it\u2019s difficult to choose a lifetime companion animal from a picture but it\u2019s been working out well for our adopters and most importantly, for the animals in our care. The financial impact is obvious but we're committed to keeping our community and volunteers as safe as possible and providing the best of care for our animals.  Any donations are greatly appreciated to help PAWS provided that care.  Thank you.\n\nAs you may know, PAWS was one of the rescue groups called upon by the Illinois Department of Agriculture over the Labor Day weekend to help with the surrender of over 300 dogs and cats.  These are some of those dogs.  The breeds include German Shepherd Dogs, Australian Shepherds, Great Pyrenees, Bernese Mountain Dogs and a few Newfoundlands.  We\u2019ve spent this past week bathing, trimming, vaccinating and vetting these animals thanks to the heroic efforts of the staff at our vets office and the dedication of our PAWS volunteers.  The dogs were in deplorable condition, matted and covered with clumps of mud and sadly, their own waste.  They are no longer living that life.  We will be offering these deserving animals for adoption and are doing everything possible to have them into approved adoption homes as quickly as possible.   Please be patient.  Our volunteers are returning calls and processing applications as fast as they can.  If you are interested in one of these animals, please call our office at 217-243-7297 and leave a message expressing your interest.  Repeated calls will only slow down the process.  Thank you for your patience and understanding.  Now, on to the dogs.\n\nThis guy is Bolt and he\u2019s a favorite with the volunteers at PAWS.  With his great personality and his gentle demeanor, he\u2019s earned the spot as a favorite.  Bolt for some reason is not a fan of small dogs, cats and kiddos, especially younger ones so please, no little animals or kids younger than teens.  Bolt\u2019s coat will be gleaming white again in short order with good nutrition and proper, consistent grooming.  Bolt weights right at 80 pound.  He\u2019s thin so a few extra pounds will be good.  His adoption fee is $200\n\nAll of our animals are provided with age appropriate vaccinations, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. \nPAWS has added the H3N2/H3N8 combo flu vaccine to its shot protocol. Every dog is being vaccinated upon intake, however we urge adopters to get a second flu shot for their new family member to ensure as much protection against the flu as possible.\nTo meet our incredible dogs and offer them the love they deserve, stop by PAWS on Friday, Saturday or Sunday from 10 - 4 PM, call us at 217-243-7297. We do applications in person or over the phone. You can also see pictures on our Facebook page, PAWS Jackson.  With an approved application, a deposit will hold your new best friend for up to 1 week to allow you time to come to PAWS.  This deposit is not refundable nor transferable.",

She loves her walks, and she is super playful with young dogs. She is perfectly housebroken, goes in the crate on command, albeit a little sadly, and is just a joy to be around. She is waiting by the tree for Santa to give her a forever home. \n\nIf you would like to meet Dixie and potentially adopt, fill out an application and our team will schedule your appointment.

She just wants to kick back, relax and share her dreams with someone special. \n\nThis is what her foster had to say about her:\n\nShe loves pets on her face and chin and will lay her chin on your lap to get pets. She snuggles up on any comfy spot she can find. She knows sit and will sit for her food and treats. She likes car rides and sticking her nose out the window. She lays in her crate freely and will easily go in at night for a treat. She likes sniffing all the scents on her walks and gets very excited for walks. She's a sweet girl and I'm hoping she'll find her forever home soon!\n\n Submit an adoption application and come meet this special girl today.

Tawny is a super friendly, big lap dog with a cute widow\u2019s peak design in the fur on her face.  Weighing in at about 45 pounds, her long legs make her appear larger.  She loves carrying around her toys and knows how to sit, shake, and walk on a leash.  At about a year old, Tawny has lots of love to share!  All she wants is a family to love.\n\nOur HALAH dogs are currently only available to meet by appointment at the Home At Last Animal Haven grounds\n\nSee www.halah.org for more information and photos.

He has a couple quirks, like being afraid of thunderstorms, fireworks and not a fan of being bathed with a hose. But who does like being bathed with a hose? He likes other dogs, but prefers them to be the submissive type. Loves the game of chase. We are not sure about cats or kids. BB would love to have a home and family of his own.

            "description": "****** PLEASE READ THIS IN ITS ENTIRETY ... APPLICATIONS FOR ELLIE ARE CURRENTLY PAUSED *****\n\nWhen Ellie is ready for a new home, she MUST have the companionship of another dog. The resident dog must be gentle and obedient so Ellie can learn the ropes in the proper manner. Ellie seeks the company of other dogs and finds comfort in being with them. Therefore, the first requirement for potential adopters is that there must be a dog already living in the home. The second requirement is that she needs a human who is SUPER patient. She needs constant coaxing and reassurance, but once she has bonded with her human, she will stay close by. She still is \"high strung\", meaning that if someone drops anything on the floor or a door slams or someone yells, Ellie is *instantly* running for cover. Ellie isn't your typical come-when-you're-called kind of dog, lying next to you on the sofa while you watch TV. She will come say hello, allow herself to be petted, then she will retreat to her doggy friend(s). \n**************************************************\nShe still has a long way to go so she won't be available for adoption for a while yet. \nPlease keep watching our FB and IG accounts for updates! We'll gladly post when she's ready for the next phase of her life and when we'll be accepting applications for her again!! ...Thanks!!! \n\n******************************************************************************************************************************************\n\nOur little friend Elle is still very withdrawn and scared. In the best interest of this pup, we have sent her home with our Animal Control Supervisor for some TLC.\n**\nOfficer Michele has 2 dogs at home that will support Miss Elle and help her come out of her shell.\n**\nAfter Elle has had time to acclimate to her new surroundings, Officer Michele will be able to see what her personality is like and assess what her needs are.\n**\nWe will post a follow up when we think she is ready to go to a foster home LOCAL TO OR IN Montclair, as she will still need to be treated by our veterinarian for heartworm.\n**\nThank you to all who expressed interest in Elle and watch our Facebook and Instagram pages for updates!!! \n************************************************************************************************************************************\nElle is an adorable blue heeler mix who is terrified of absolutely everything.... Noises scare her, people scare her, outside scares her. We have been trying to work with her quietly and slowly since her arrival here. She had tested positive for heartworm and we are awaiting treatment protocol from our veterinarian, but since everything has been shut down, we are in standby mode. Eventually, her heartworm will be assessed by our veterinarian and a protocol will be developed to treat her heartworm, which will involve monthly trips to/from our veterinarian here in town. Therefore, applicants must live in the close vicinity to accommodate her heartworm treatment schedule. \n\nElle would probably do best in a QUIET home without children, with someone who will help coax her out of her shell BUT not push her too far, too fast. We think she might be a flight risk, she would need to be crated at night and supervised WELL during the day. We suggest keeping the leash on her and keeping her tethered to your waist so wherever you go, Elle goes. This helps her bond with her person and keeps her out of trouble. \n\nElle is responsive with other dogs and might do well in a home where there is a calm dog she can rely on, and follow to help her build her confidence. BUT please keep in mind that she has been so shut down that we haven't been unable to test her with other animals, it wouldn't have been fair to try to assess her in her current mental state. \n\nSince Elle is such a special case, we must take every precaution possible to place her in the proper home. This means that sorting through the applications takes a little longer because we are more restricted than as if placing a well-adjusted dog. \nSo if you have already submitted an application for Elle but do not meet the criteria above, your application will not be processed. We are only contacting applicants who might fit Elle's specific needs, we hope everyone can understand. \n\nThat being said, if you are interested in Elle and understand the responsibilities of caring for a special needs dog like her, then please submit an application and we will contact you as soon as we can.

Meet Sully, a 7.5 year old neutered male lab/pittie mix who weighs about 65 lbs. Sully came to All 4 Paws because he was not getting along with the other dog in his home. Sully is a wonderful, sweet dog who loves attention and being near his people! He is fun-loving, full of personality and very affectionate and snuggly. Sully is a loyal, caring and protective boy who promises to be devoted to his new family. He is well-behaved, well-mannered, and eager to please. Sully loves to lounge in the sun, snuggle up in a cozy blanket, watch (and chase) squirrels, and enjoys a good romp in the yard. Sully is hoping to find a home with a big fenced-in yard that he can stretch out his legs in. He adores people, but kids tend to make him nervous, so he is looking for a family without children. Sully listens very well to basic commands (come, sit, lay down, stay, paw), loves to relax with his people and chew his bones, and he is housebroken and crate-trained. He loves toys, cuddling on the couch, and snoozing with his blankets in his crate. This handsome boy is quite the catch! He just needs a home to call \"his own!\" \n Please help us find this special guy the forever home he's dreaming of!\n\nInterested in adopting?

You'll probably wonder why her name is Joy. What you aren't seeing in that first meet is her amazing ability to trust and her sheer joy in some of the simple things.\n\nShe loves to run, she will alternate between leaping around like a gazelle and running with her butt tucked under for maximum speed! Joy loves other dogs and cats (much to their dismay). She will get along even with old grumpy dogs but takes a bit to learn their signals for 'no'. Ideally, Joy should have an equally energetic dog to play with. The good thing is that she mostly understands that inside is cuddle, nap, or quiet play time and outside is run around like a crazy dog time as long as the other dogs are being calm, too. She has done quite well with indoor cats but the outdoor cat in her foster home was a bit too indulging of some of her bad antics and now she tries to play with him by mouthing on him, which he doesn't like.\n\nJoy is mostly crate trained and partially housebroken. If she gets to go potty on a schedule like a puppy would then she doesn't have any accidents. She is calm and quiet in her crate but will have occasional accidents if she has to wait too long or if she drank too much.\n\nShe can be skittish, she will not do well with anyone that uses negative reinforcement/punitive measures. She has responded well to positive reinforcement and blossoms quickly in new environments with those methods. She should not go to a home with small children, but should do well with teenagers. Once she gets the flow of her new home and some treats she will even do well with a few visitors over.\n\nJoy LOVES soft toys and will hoard them. She will either drag them all into her crate or pick a corner of the house near the person she trusts most to hoard them and fall asleep. In fact, when she first gets to a new home or when she doesn't have access to toys she tends to do a lot of pacing. Toys help make her feel secure and she doesn't destroy them.",

The foster family are really working with her and doing great. She loves belly rubs and butt scratches! She also does really well in the bath and likes water! She is very bouncing likes to dance and run around our big yard! She is very sweet. She needs some work on her excitement because she does jump. She is working on commands of place, lay down and crate! She can shake, sit pretty, stay and sit. She gets along very well with our other Akita Rosie! She still would prefer to sort of stay separate if the pack outside but loves to cuddle with them inside. You do have to watch the other dogs and her because her personal space bubble is pretty big and she doesn't like if you are paying attention to her and another dog comes close. She has growled a few times due to personal space. She has done well on walks but needs to work on walking next to you because she does pull quite hard. She also does well in the car but needs reminders to say in the backseat. Food and toys have been great she will even drink out of the same bowl of water as the other dogs while they are drinking. She will take treats nicely with the other dogs present. Toys she doesn't play much but doesn't mind if the other dogs are playing with the toys. She does get excited when she doesn't come out of her crate and will grab anything blanket shoe, etc. and try and run around with it! She does get board in the kennel and will chew on whatever is inside bed or blanket but has done better with chew toys inside her crate. We did have one major scuffle between her and our male dog over play time. They both play loud and hard sometimes need reminders on when to stop. I always make sure they are supervised. She does have some dominate behaves such as marking and kicking up grass. We have been working on training out of her and is going really well. She is Overall very happy girl! An adoption application can be downloaded from the DHS website www.dekalbhumanesociety.org. \n\n\n*BEFORE ADOPTING ANY DOG, PLEASE RESEARCH THE BREED TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE A PERFECT MATCH FOR YOUR FAMILY LIFESTYLE*",

We all were not socialized and I was in the worse shape with a broken jaw. It's been repaired and I'm waiting for my special someone to make me a part of their family.\n\nI've been in two foster homes since I've been with C.A.R.L. In my first foster home I lived with other dogs and made tremendous progress and I was doing really well. I'd run around the house and I'd try to get the other dogs to play with me. I'll need a playful and easy-going brother and/or sister in the home who will not only play with me but show me the ropes too. I learned to walk around my foster parents comfortably, but I still wasn't comfortable taking food from them. I was pet every day and eventually they were able to pick me up, but I wasn't entirely comfortable when they did. They sadly moved out-of-state, but I was lucky enough to go into a new foster home.\n\nMy second foster mom calls me Sunny. Scared and unsure of my new foster mom and new foster home, I would cower in a corner or hide in my crate. My crate is left available to me so I always have a safe place to be, but I decided rather quickly that I prefer being outside of the crate and now I don't want to go in it. I'm fed in the crate so I feel comfortable should I need to be put in it to go to a vet appointment.\n\nMy second foster mom has been allowing me to approach her at my own pace. She can only get close to me on my own terms. I appreciate that she is allowing me to do this as I slowly learn to trust. I do come when called, but still keep my distance. I'll need a patient and loving person who will continue to work with me to help build my confidence and trust. My foster mom says she can see I want to join them on walks, but she hasn't attempted to yet as in my first foster home I wasn't a fan at being leashed up. I'd do the alligator roll. She'll try a harness once I get more comfortable and she can pick me up. I'm sort of house trained as I will go outside via a doggie door, but if it's raining or I have no way to go out I'll do my business inside without warning. My foster mom is using training pads when I can't get outside.\n\nIf you have the love and patience that I need as I continue to learn to trust, fill out an application to meet me.\n\nAdditional information: *Current on shots\n\nIf you haven't already you may read their story below.\n\n16 DOGS RESCUED FROM SINGLE FAMILY HOME....\n\nEven when times are financially tough for our rescue, we try our hardest to help out when we are needed. A family, who was in over their heads because their dogs were not spayed or neutered, reached out to the rescue community for help. They initially said that there were around 9 Chihuahua mix dogs.\n\nOn Sunday, four C.A.R.L volunteers drove two vans loaded with crates to South Central Los Angeles to assess the situation. It was far worse than expected. All of the dogs had lived their entire lives outside on a cement patio with very little human touch. They were curious and wanted the treats we brought, but were very scared at the same time and would not let us pick them up.\n\nIt took almost 3 hours to catch 4 female Chihuahua mixes, 4 males and 7 puppies. The mother dogs had dug a deep hole under the cement patio about 6 inches in diameter. The puppies (who we think are about 4 to 5 weeks old) were packed inside and not easily accessible.\n\nIn the very corner of the yard was a large, old dog chained to the wall. He had broken free from his collar so the family used phone cords to secure the heavy, metal chain around his neck. The dog, who we named \"Sam\", had severe fly strike on his ears, scabs on his hind legs and sides from sleeping on concrete and was extremely malnourished. The family said they kept him chained up as a guard dog and also to keep him from hurting the little dogs. We approached him with caution, but he was eager to get to know us and came out of hiding for treats and love. He pushed his big head into our hands and we all instantly fell in love with him. We knew that we needed to save him too.\n\nAfter a lot of convincing, the family finally agreed to let us take Sam. In all, we brought back 16 dogs (this includes the 7 puppies). One of the other females looks to be pregnant too and we will verify this with an ultrasound this upcoming week. .\n\nAfter returning to our sanctuary, all of the dogs were situated with comfy beds, food and fresh water. In a few days after they have had time to decompress, they will all go to the vet for care.\n\nThe two moms with puppies are in a temporary foster home. They were covered from head to toe in fleas and ticks. Each puppy had at least 8 ticks on them. Several have skin infections that need immediate treatment.",

But I've been in shelters even longer than that, because I was pulled from another shelter since I didn\u2019t get much attention from adopters. I really need a home -- it's been hard to live in small kennels this long. I have a lot of energy and really like to run around; however, I'm a gentleman on the leash. I'll walk right by your side. I will need plenty of exercise for sure and a family committed to providing me with continued training. I would do best with kids over 12 years old as I do tend to guard my resources (bones, food, etc.). I also get mouthy when excited and at times forget my good boy skills! I do know a lot of commands and am pretty smart, so I am sure learning new things will be a breeze. I played off leash with a dog here and did okay! Like many bully breeds, I have a rougher play style, so a dog that can keep up with that is necessary. No little dogs for me! A dog my size or larger is best. I will also need a feline-free home as well. If you\u2019d like to get to know me more, ask my friends about me, Percy!",

He\u2019s a 5 year old cattle dog mix at about 42 pounds. \n\nHe would really like to live in a home with another doggy friend to keep him company when he is lonely!. He is housebroken and has never been destructive when left out of his kennel. He's good with kids, cats, small or larger dogs, and people. Kado is up-to-date on shots, neutered and heartworm negative. He is great on walks and would do best in a home with a large fenced yard to play with you in! Kado is a great dog and any family would be lucky to have him. \n\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\nAny additional information can be found on our website. Thanks for considering a rescue!",

We quickly realized this incredibly shy boy was one of the sweetest dogs in our rescue. Extremely guarded an unsure the first introduction, but affectionate and loving the next time. \n\nHandsome Tommy has spent time with our trainer to make sure he can get along with other dogs. Tommy quickly joined his pack. He went on walks daily and spent quality time with other dogs. \n\nTommy loves the ladies and a bit guarded of males. We are not sure but feel his previous owner was not too kind. \n\nOur trainer has suggested slow introductions to other dogs and also supervised play time at first to avoid any dominant tendencies during playtime. \n\nTommy will be amazing for a single female owner. He will need a fenced yard to be able to have some fun. Daily exercise is a must. He will do best with an active adopter. \n\nHandsome Tommy has worked hard to become a better dog and hopefully someone's amazing pet. \n\nHe is currently in Houston, but can be transported to the Pacific Northwest if adopted. Unfortunately at this time we had to cancel all meet and greets due to Covid 19 and had to keep all dogs in Houston until their adoptions. \n\nFor an adoption application please go to www.springbranchrescue.org",

I will be furever grateful in your home!\n\nSven is a 5 year old, 59lb greyhound/boxer mix who is UTD and microchipped. Sven is learning leash work but is crate and housetrained. He needs a home with another dog who is calm and confident to help with his anxiety. He is GREAT with kids and loves to play dress up with his humans. He is currently in training through us to help his confidence and will continue training after adoption to ensure successful transition. \n\nAdoption requirements are as such:\n\n\n\tAnother dog who is calm and confident \n\tLeash reactivity experience \n\n\nPlease note, Sven is part of Happy Trails Animal Rescues rehoming program.

He was shot at as a puppy and timid from that. Then, in his 'home,' he was bullied by the other dog in the household, and because of that was relegated to the garage. He has been with us for a bit and then was adopted, but he is not the right match for his current household (due to the other animals there)... This boy needs a home where he will be loved and where his family can provide for (and match) his needs. Fergus is very, very sweet with people - he is a love -- and will love you to pieces once he gets acquainted with you and feels comfortable. It just takes him a little time at first as he is timid upon first meeting - but he is a total love (sensitive and sweet) once he gets to know you. And he has NO people aggression whatsoever - NONE!As for other animals, Fergus has interacted fine with the female dogs in the household. But he can react quite negatively to some male dogs, and he is NOT at all good with cats. So we are seeking a home without any cats (or other small animals) and without male dogs. And, just to err on the side of caution, we are actually seeking an adult home where Fergus be the only animal in the household.Fergus is smart and is housetrained. He is also doing so much better on leash walking. But since he can be timid upon first meeting, we feel the best environment for him would be a home with a physically fenced yard.\nIf you are interested in considering adopting Fergus - to provide him a loving, caring, responsible home for his whole life - please register on our website, www.safeatlast.net (by clicking Register on the left-hand side of our homepage). Once you receive your password on your email account, please log back on to our website to complete the Safe at Last online adoption application (by clicking Forms/Applications on the left-hand side of our homepage). If, after preliminary review of your application, your home appears to be a good match, a volunteer will be in touch to commence the review process. Our process is very straightforward but does involve the phone interview, reference checks and a home assessment.\nApproved adopters are required to go to Fergus's current home (in Preston Hollow NY, Schoharie County) to meet him and complete the adoption.\nFinally, you must submit the Safe at Last online adoption application and be approved prior to meeting him. If you do not submit the adoption application, we cannot consider you.\nThank you for choosing to rescue and for your interest in Fergus.\nNYS Rescue Registry No. RR 087. 2/1/21 9:19 PM",

Our vets are addressing her skin issues and lumps and bumps. At a spunky 50 pounds, her spirit is definitely not broken, and she has plenty of pep in her step. She looks to be mixed pointer and would love a foster or permanent home without cats.\n\n**BECAUSE OF OUR REQUIREMENT FOR A HOME VISIT, WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO ADOPT TO HOMES IN THE NORTHERN VA / MARYLAND / DC METRO AREA**\n\nWe have adoption events EVERY SATURDAY from 12-3 p.m. Please note that not all dogs can attend every event, so if you are interested in meeting a particular dog, please complete a no-obligation application on our website at http://www.muttloverescue.org/application.html OR write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nUpcoming adoption events:\n\nMutt Love Rescue is doing everything we can to ensure the health and safety of our volunteers and adopters while continuing our mission to find homes for as many dogs as possible.\n\nEffective immediately, we will not be holding our weekly adoption events. Dogs available for adoption can be met by appointment only. Potential adopters should submit an online application at http://muttloverescue.org/application.html. Once we receive your application, we will contact you to let you know the next steps.\n\nWe are always desperate for foster homes, now more than ever. If you are interested in fostering during this difficult time, please complete an application... unless you are a previous adopter/foster, then you can just contact us via phone (703-988-2608) or email (adopt@muttloverescue.org) to tell us which dog you want to foster!\n\nFor information on sponsoring this dog, please write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nWE NEED FOSTER HOMES!

This cuddly, affectionate boy gets so excited when he meets any new humans and he loves nothing more than being close to them. He'll lay his head in their laps, and roll over for all the belly rubs and cuddles he can get. This respectful and mostly calm big boy enjoys sleeping on the couch, and chewing on toys. Occasionally he'd like to do a zoomie (who doesn't), but he is recovering from two fractures in his hind legs, so he is postponing his antics until he is fully healed. He walks well on his leash, and he only pulls when he sees a pesky squirrel sticking his tongue out at him. He's a treat-motivated, housetrained boy who sleeps well in his crate, and answers to 'sit' and 'lay down.' Rocco has gotten along well with other dogs and should do well with kids. He is heartworm positive, but that just means he'll need a couple of months of rest during treatment, at APA!'s expense. Come meet him, he'll show you his belly and ask for rubs! You can also follow his silly antics on Instagram @roccothedog_apa.",

He holds his own with dogs and likes to run and play with everyone now that he has been here a while.  He likes to stand for treats, likes to eat and is very good with the dogs over food etc.  He likes to sleep with his humans,  loves being petted and belly rubs and paid attention to.   He gets through small holes in fences but it is to be with you and not run away although a very secure yard is important because when you leave he may follow.  He has a big personality for a tiny guy, loves to do silly things when he is feeling chipper .Not sure on cats, isnt that thrilled with children but Billy is not an aggressive dog.  UTD, chipped and fully vetted, Billy is ready for a home that will be playful and fun but in a gentle way.  Does that make sense?.  He should be with someone who will spend time with him.  He is tiny at less than 10 pounds and very cute. Smart too,  He is a very sweet dog and though he sports a white face he is only said by old owner to be 6...an active home is the best home for little Billy!",

Even her dry eye is showing signs of health and needs fewer drops.  She was spayed 9/18 and what teeth she had left were removed due to infection.  She is very sweet and shy and will require a home with lots of TLC to give. Precious little dog. She is a smart dog so it is fun to have watched her come out of her shell and start on a healthier future.  She is a favorite of the director.  She burrows and sleeps and eats on her own and does not like to be held or fussed over much. Independent and often hard to find buried under blankets...so be sure to have plenty on hand as that is her very favorite thing to do...sleep tucked in.",

He is in great shape and a happy and busy little guy who is smart and loving and would make a great companion dog.  He is beautiful with a shiny coat and a nice countenance.  He too has what we call our 'Peter Falk' look with one milky eye.  It is not sighted but healthy currently and there is no need to treat or remove it at present. Jessie is a small dog at about 10 pounds.  He has certainly come out of his shell in the last couple weeks and when not sleeping he loves running with the best of them..  Zero aggression but if children are involved they will need to be calm and respectful..  Currently Jessie is with a foster friend in Cayucos.",

            "description": "Our adoption area is limited to UT, NV, ID, OR, WA and MT with a home visit. If you are outside of this area please do a search for your local GSP/GWP/Pointer rescue group.\n\n--------\n\nI'm TAHOE! I'm a nice, solid guy.  My approx. DOB is 2/23/2019 so I'm still a sweet young thing.  I'm 23.5\" at my withers and a nice, solid 58 lbs. I didn't have a lot of experiences in my past life so I'm still learning to trust and completely enjoy myself.  The big dog in my former home used to pick on me so I'm a little nervous until I've been in a situation for awhile.  I like being with my daycare pack.  I'm still nervous getting into and out of cars - it's a little scary.   \n\nI totally love my ball and will play with it as long as there's someone to throw it for me.  I'm somewhat adverse to scary situations.  I'm not going to make a good hunter but I'll be a wonderful hiking/running companion.  I'll do well with another well-trained, well-socialized dog in my new home to show me the ropes.\n\n---------\n\nGENERAL APPLICATION NOTES:\n\nWe strongly urge adopters to consider a male canine companion if they already have a female GSP/GWP. We get asked several times a year to take in one member of a 2-female GSP family because there are control issues between their girls that result in pretty ferocious fights. Interestingly that never happens among males. Go figure.\n\nDogs under 2 years of age need to go to a home with another well-socialized canine companion of a similar size (when grown) and within a few years of the pup\u2019s age. This is how they maintain and continue their learning/socialization process. Socialization outside the home is important but doesn\u2019t replace the in-home learning that is so important as the pup ages. https://www.facebook.com/ UtahsPerfectPointers/posts/ 1460968517254816\n\nMost older dogs aren\u2019t interested in having a puppy incessantly chewing on it and demanding attention. If you live outside of the Salt Lake area and are sure that your older dog just loves puppies, please arrange a visit at your home with a 2-4 month old pup for a couple of hours and make sure that your older dog feels the same way about this that you do. Please video the interactions and send it to us.\n\nJust a word of caution........ most pointer types need jobs. Otherwise they're not good pets. They need to be able to utilize their brains and no amount of exercise without a \"work\" or \"thinking\" component is adequate. The job doesn't need to be hunting. But it does need to be something that satisfies their genetic predispositions - nose work, agility, tracking, dock diving, etc. The job cannot just be obedience. If they can't use their innate senses they're just never going to be the dog you want for the next 15 years.\n\nA physical fence is required for most of our dogs.\n\nAs far as other breeds go, the pointers are generally good with most other breeds with the exception of the Arctic breeds and bulldogs. I'm not sure why, but if there's ever an altercation in daycare between a UPP dog and another dog, it's generally one of those two breeds. It may be the difference in energy levels. It may be some ancient behavior we know nothing about...... Not sure.\n\nUtah's Perfect Pointers is a very small rescue group and doesn't have the resources to adopt to states except for the ones noted above.

If you're interested in Fostering or Adopting Bongo, please contact Angela and the info below:\n\nAngela Springer\nHarbor Foster Volunteer\n310-717-2442\naspringer.pv@gmail.com\n\nBongo is a really sweet boy who mostly likes to hang out at home and cuddle.He likes to go on hikes in Malibu and  explore the outdoors. He's really good with people  and is really quiet in the house. Bongo will always be by your side and deserves a great home. \n\nTemperament: Bongo is calm and quiet in the home. \n\nFoster Notes:  He is house trained, a good listener, a quiet demeanor,  and loves car rides.  \n\nLeash Skills:  Bongo's leash manners have improved dramatically in the last 5 months. His foster takes him on walks 3x per day.  \n\nDog Experience:  Foster has not introduced Bongo to other dogs.  He is interested in other dogs when going on walks.  With slow & proper intros, Bongo can definitely meet other dogs. \n\nRecommended Home:  For now, I would recommend Bongo to be the only dog for the main reason is that he's not been dog tested. With proper intros & training, he can be slowly introduced to other dogs.  Bongo is in a quiet, loving home right now.  So, someone with a regular routine & lots of daily dog walking is perfect for Bongo.",

            "description": "Dunn was pulled from a shelter near Corpus Christi with his brother Brooks.  Dunn is the bigger of the pair.  At 10 months old, he already weighs 50 pounds and stands 18 inches tall.  A DNA test on his brother recently reported that his hound genes come from a Catahoula Leopard mixed with Great Pyremees.  He also has 16 % Super Mutt mixed in!!  Here is what his foster Dad has to say about this sweet boy!\n\nWhat can I say about Dunn?  He is an amazing PUPPY in a DOG\u2019s body.   He is very high energy.  He most certainly will need to be part of a pack and not a single dog.  He will not do well in an apartment.  He has to have a dog door.  I have never had to scoop indoor poop and I only had to clean up 3 puddles before he learned the dog door and that was in the first 24 hours in the house.    He is crate trained.  He still needs work to settle before he eats.  He uses a maze bowl to eat, because he is a CHOW HOUND!  \n \nHe is crated when we leave the house.  He\u2019s going to need that for a while.  But this week we have been letting stay with us in the bedroom at night.  He would probably sleep in the bed with his people if he was allowed but our pack is too big.  That being said, he does not protest and sleeps on his pillows on the floor in the bedroom.  He comes and goes at will during the night. \n \nHe plays all the time with the dogs.  He does really well.  He and sugar play tug of war all the time.  He acts like a gangly teenager.  He is LONG; all legs.  He doesn\u2019t know his back legs will spring him forward yet to jump so he climbs  \n \nHe learned sit and stay and down, but he is still working on not taking food before he is told it\u2019s his.   He can nose the table while you\u2019re eating by just craning his neck, so we are working on teaching him boundaries. \n \nDunn will be a wonderful addition to an active family with other dogs and kids to chase around!\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, THE FIRST STEP is to complete our adoption questionnaire. Please visit our website at www.HoustonBeagleRescue.org and follow the instructions on adoption.  Our regular adoption fee is $275; mixes are $200; special needs and senior dogs are $175; pups under 8 months are $300. The fee includes the spay/neuter, the vaccines, flea and heart worm preventative/treatment, a new leash/ collar/ rescue ID tag, microchip, and some training. Some dogs may have had additional vet care such as orthopedic surgeries, heart worm treatment or other procedures, but these extras will not affect their adoption fee. Donations to help with vetcare are always welcomed!",

A perfect home for them would be a nice quiet home with a fenced in yard. Bender is leery at first when meeting people where Darling will go right up to people. Bender needs an owner where his leaeriness is accepted and his owner is able to work with him and reassure all is well.\n\nDarling is a friendly girl, who enjoys your attention. She's an easy going dog, who enjoys a walk around the block, but doesn't need strenous exercise. She'd love to hang out and watch Netflix with you. She just loves to be petted and is a real \"people person\".\n\nShe is very bonded with Bender and they do need to be adopted together. They occassionally go to the nursing home to visit with the residents. She is totally housetrained.\n\nDarling is selective about the dogs she likes. She loves Bender but doesn't really care for other dogs.\n\nDog for a Day Update: We took Bender and Darling to Lake Eola on Saturday to participate in the dog for a day program.They did great! They walked great on the leash and really enjoyed.\n\n--\nDarling was living in the woods with her two babies, Natasha and Boris. Darling was a fantastic mom and her babies have a home of their own now. Darling is anxiously awaiting her home too.",

Nobody knows for sure because I was found as a stray roaming the streets. People who worked at the businesses in the area were nice enough to feed me & give me water. They said I had been wandering around for over a month when CageFree finally found me. They took me in, got me neutered, vaccinated & microchipped & now I'm ready to find a new home! I am a super sweet guy who gives lots of kisses to my human friends. Once you gain my trust, which I promise won\u2019t take very long, I\u2019m all yours!!! I also get along with other dogs. I know I will make the perfect loyal companion when the right family comes along. If you are interested in meeting me, please send an email so my caregivers can arrange a time for us to get together. Oh, by the way, I love hot dogs & barbecue! So please feel free to bring some when you come to visit :)",

She came from a hoarding situation and was never socialized, so she is shy of new people he doesn't know. Katie has a best friend, Brodie, and would be best if she could be adopted with him. Katie and Brodie have been together for about 4 years, Brodie also came from a hoarder. Katie would do best with older kids in the house, or none at all. She will shy away and bark at anyone she doesn't know. If you are interested in these two buddies you will need to come out and spend time meeting them and letting them get to know you. \nA home check is required before any dog can be adopted. \n928-925-7219",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Oscar. I'm 14 years young, and I love playing fetch and treats. My eyes are a little hazy, but I still get around great, and I'm very spry. I love my bed and my kennel, and if you take me out regularly I'm very well potty trained. I don't know if I like other dogs, but bigger things darting past me scare me a little. I do have heartworms, but I'm on the slow kill treatment so I can be super healthy! I'm not very noisy at all unless someone I don't know comes into the house, and once my people let me know the visitor is okay, I calm down really quickly. Because I am a senior I'll need a little extra vet care, and I would appreciate a calm home with no boisterous kids. I hope that I can find a really great family soon, and thank you for considering me!\n",

He is a social, happy guy who escaped from a high kill shelter and is doing great in his foster home. He has 2 foster hound siblings that he runs around and plays with, and he does ok with with resident cats as well. He is very smart, and although he loves to catch a scent and chase, he is learning to be called off of that. Paxton is by nature part of a pack, and this is where he will be happiest. We need his adoptive family to have at least one other, playful dog in the home (more would be fine as well!) and a fully fenced in yard so everyone can run around and play. Paxton will be respectful to an owner who can set boundaries and realizes that consistency is key. If you want to meet Mr. Pax, send us an application!    \n\nPlease only children 15 or older in the adoptive home. \n\nThe adoption fee of $200 will include spay/neuter, microchip, age appropriate/required vaccinations, treatment for heartworm and any other necessary medical treatment to assure a healthy new pup for your family. Although we do the best to describe breed, since our pups all come from shelters we can make no guarantee. We can tell you that they are 100% RESCUED! If you are interested in adopting/meeting , please visit our website at www.starfishanimalrescue.com or you may complete the online adoption application on our Facebook Page https://www.facebook.com/starfishanimalrescue/app/134425496630143/?ref=page_internal Once you complete and submit your dog adoption application we will set up an appointment to meet this pup! *please note that we are a foster home based rescue and we do home visits as part of the adoption process - we are unable to adopt to families who live outside of the Chicago and surrounding suburbs. Thank you for your understanding.",

She gets along with other dogs and is good with kids and strangers. She is NOT currently potty trained, and does still have accidents in the house, which was one of the reasons she was surrendered to the rescue. She's used to being crated and doesn't have accidents in her crate. She also has some skin issues we are currently working on (alopecia). Daisy is very sweet and loves everyone she meets. She will need a little bit of work in terms of potty training, but otherwise she is a very easy dog and cannot wait to find her forever home!",

            "description": "Caillou Cuddles is a sweet and comical little dog. He is 13 yrs old but you would never know it by the way he acts. He loves to run, play with, and chase his foster brothers. Caillou does not like to be picked up, and he is very reserved when he first meets you, but give him his space and he will come to you when he is ready. When he gets to know you, he loves to be petted and have some lap time. When he is tired of playing he retires to his bed and rolls up in his blanket. After a short nap, he is refreshed and ready to play again. Caillou loves to eat but is not a food hog. He will not steal food from the other dogs but will wait politely until they are done and then approach their bowls to see if there are any leftovers. He will then lick the bowl clean to make sure he did not miss anything.I love the way he always has one ear up and one ear down-he looks like he is ready for takeoff but can\u2019t get enough power to lift him up. Caillou is house trained, good with other dogs big and small. I have no cats or children but given his temperament I do not think there would be any problem, but given his age and quiet nature, I think he would do better in peaceful household without any young children. He has the run of the house when his foster mom leaves to run errands as he is non destructive. Caillou is patiently waiting for his forever home!",

They are both heartworm positive and have started their treatment. \n\nFOSTER THROUGH HEARTWORM TREATMENT BIO (NEED TO START TREATMENT)\n\nNTTS is placing me for Foster to ensure I can get into a home sooner than later and start learning what it means to be a loved house dog. You see I came to the rescue with heartworms and have to go through the treatment to kill them. They say it is long and expensive and I have to stay well rested and not stressed. Can you help me get through this treatment?? The nice people here will provide everything you need to take care of me! You just have to give me love and my medicine everyday! \n\nIf you would like to learn more about heartworm treatment, please visit this webiste https://www.heartwormsociety.org/heartworms-in-dogs",

She loves to jump on the trampoline, balance in the hammock and patrol for chipmunks. Jamie is a happy girl that would be best suited in a house with older kids that can respect her boundaries. To complete Jamie's best home she will need a canine playmate her size or larger, she is not afraid of playing with the big boys. Jamie requires a home with a minimum of 6ft privacy fence, anything less is just an inconvenience for this prey driven girl. Not recommended for cats in the home due to high prey drive.\nJamie is slow to warm up to new people but once she does she is a constant companion.\n\nDOB 11/12/20. Jamie is spayed, microchipped and up to date on vaccinations.\n\nI'm in a foster home, so if you are interested in a\ndopting me, please fill out an online adoption application at\nhttp://colonycats.org/adoption_app.html\nto expedite the process. Due to the large number of inquiries received, we are unable to respond to emails quickly.\n\nAS",

They were born in a field on the side of the road, and lived as a family until good samaritan's were able to catch the dogs and bring them into rescue. Ivan has learned to trust people, but he still needs time and space to warm up to strangers. He will thrive in a home with another confident dog that is playful and outgoing. He LOVES toys, especially soft and squeaky rubber ones. Ivan is also very treat motivated, even if he's nervous he will take treats, so he will be a super star in obedience classes and this will help to grow his confidence! Ivan will require a home with a physical fence, given that he is a fearful and could be a flight risk. He has not been introduced to cats or children, he could potentially be a fit with a dog savvy cat and older children that can recognize a fearful dog.\n\nIvan's adoption fee is $250 and includes his neuter, microchip, current vaccinations and preventatives PLUS a free obedience course at Cedar Run in Hiawatha. Last Hope requires that all animals be altered, current on vaccinations and preventatives and kept as indoor pets only. Our adoption process includes reference and vet checks, a home visit and background check.",

He has been in my rescue since mid September, has been viewed 598 times on petfinder with not a pinch of interest. I have no idea why!! He's a BEAUTIFUL year and a half old sweetheart. He's dog friendly, kid friendly, and is easy to train. He is a people pleaser. He will do anything for a kiss. He's constantly smiling and is a mega mood booster! He loves the hammock with his human, long walks, and the leaf blower! He's a great cuddler and matches the energy of his family. He has A LOT of energy and loves to stay on the move...but will settle down for a snack and a movie. If a dog or child is shy around him, he lays down or rolls over to make sure he doesn't come off as intimidating. He has a small amount of separation anxiety. He is not destructive if left alone for short periods but he does get depressed quickly when lonely. He would love a larger sized family so that he can have extra attention without having to be clingy. But ultimately he will bond with whoever loves him the most! \nMore Pictures and videos can be found at:  linktr.ee/lcpitbullrescue  \nfill out the foster to adopt application and a matchmaking quiz for consideration",

            "description": "Jingle is available for adoption at the Tacoma Humane Society. \n\nHi, my name is JINGLE and I would love to meet you. I am a Spayed Female Pit Bull Terrier and Chow Chow. The shelter staff think I am about 2 years and 7 months old. I have been at the shelter since Aug 07, 2020.\n\nJingle spent the past month in a wonderful foster home where we learned so many things about her silly and funny personality!\nJingle is a cuddly clown in the house. She loves to play with her toys, chew on her bones, and snuggle with her people. She enjoys some good zoomies in the yard but that`s pretty much enough for her to settle down in the couch with her peeps. Her foster mom reports that Jingle does fine sleeping in her crate but would MUCH rather spoon in bed with someone! \n\nThis sweet girl came to the shelter as a stray, so her history before foster is unknown. Jingle enjoys going for walks and runs but she tends to be very excitable and vocal when seeing other animals. Her foster home was working on this behavior and she is slowly coming along but will need the help of a qualified trainer with her new family. But it is easy enough to find places where there are no other dogs for walks or she is pretty content to run and play in a fenced yard. \n\nJingle would love a home with a big fenced yard where she can run and play as much as she wants. Jingle is looking for a home with Teens or Adults who would be comfortable interacting with a bouncy dog. At this point she does need to be the ONLY PET in the home. Due to Jingle needing her own space from other dogs, apartment living is not appropriate. This girl wants her own backyard to run and hangout with her family. Jingle is ready and willing to jump right into some private training with a qualified trainer who can help her work on her leash reactivity.\n",

            "description": "Andreas \u2013 Earlier in May of this year, Animal Services responded to a call and found a dog \u2018stuck and tied\u2019 under a house with a rope left in place so long it had grown into the 6 month old puppy\u2019s neck and become horribly infected.   The owner, already in custody for unrelated charges, was charged with cruelty to animals and remained in custody.  The pet was removed and treated by SPCA Alliance of North Carolina.   Since SPCA NC does not place any pets, this fellow was pulled by GCCR who also provided financial support for Andreas\u2019 medical.    Andreas continued his medical treatment with Godbey Creek and today has a clean bill of health and well as love, attention and basic training!  \n\nWhile Andreas still sports a few scars from his embedded collar ordeal, you would never know this sweet fellow was abused.  See photos.   From his handsome coat to his healthy attitude to his playful antics, this very good natured 10 month old will make a wonderful companion for an experienced pet owner.    Andreas lives to run like the wind and, while he gets along very well with other dogs, the only thing on his mind is expending his energy and playing.    He has begun to learn some basic manners but needs an experienced pet owner who will maintain his training and provide him plenty of love and exercise.   Andreas is completely crate trained, has gone over two weeks without any accidents indoors and is well on his way to learning basic house manners.   This rambunctious fellow walks beautifully on the leash and is just a great dog.   Andreas has never met a stranger!   \n\nThe successful owner of Andreas will provide this deserving pet an indoor \u2013 outdoor life, have a fenced in yard because you cannot possibly expend Andreas\u2019 energy, have time to play with this handsome fellow AND have experience teaching pets basic commands.   An ideal situation would be that Andreas would have a playmate of equal size to help him release his energy!   Due to his prey drive, a home with cats is not a good fit.  \n\nFor more information about Andreas OR to schedule an appointment to meet this great guy, phone 336.972.4511 OR 828.302.6175.",

Adele is spayed, microchipped, fully vaccinated, heartworm negative and free of parasites.\n\nAdele is still just a (big) puppy!  She is very playful and energetic as you would expect a puppy to be.\nAdele's perfect home would be a home with another young, large to medium sized dog who loves to play as much as she does.  Her favorite pastime is romping and wrestling with her foster brothers.\n\nNo small dogs or kitties, please!\n\nShe is an excellent watch dog and alerts to sounds and people.She will bark at visitors but settles down and is welcoming when she is told that it\u2019s alright. \n\nAdele loves to go on car rides.  She is a good traveler. She is working on leash manners and basic commands but will still need more training. She is housebroken and crate trained.\n\nAdele likes to have her own space to eat in as she does not like to share her food with the other dogs.\n\nBest suited home will have:\nA young, large to medium size playful dog\nNo small dogs or cats\n6 foot privacy fence\n\nFor more information please email asdrescue@gmail.com\n\nTransport: **PLEASE READ CAREFULLY**\n\nIf you are within 1,000 miles, we can usually help with transport using volunteer drivers (depending on the route/availability of volunteers).\n\nIf you live farther than 1,000 miles, we can still assist, however, the adopting party will need to drive any mileage over 1,000 miles.  \n\nFor example, if you live 1200 miles away, you would have to drive 200 miles out.\n\nNot sure how far away you are?

He's fully vetted, graduated from training BOOT CAMP - and ready for a home. Prince is the perfect gentleman and a total LOVE and so VERY SPECIAL - you will fall in love instantly. Won't you come and meet him?\nThis sweet Prince showed up on the doorstep of his foster mom wearing only a pink collar that said 'I'm Prince, I don't bite. Please love me.' He just sat quietly by the back door, hoping someone would let him in. Tragically, his foster mom now has cancer and he must move on quickly.\nPrince is gentle, friendly and relatively calm for a young dog. He approaches in a submissive way and seems to always be wagging his tail. All he needs now is a home to hang his collar in.\nAge: 10 y/o\nWeight: 60 lbs\nTemperament: Good with some dogs (prefers females), cats and kids\nVetting: Neutered, up-to-date on vaccines and heartworm negative\nApply today!\nDog Adoption Application(bit.ly/DH-Adoption)Dog Foster Application(bit.ly/DH-Fosters)\n\nPrince is gentle, friendly and relatively calm for a young dog. He approaches in a submissive way and seems to always be wagging his tail. Prince understands commands like \"sit\", \"down\" and \"stay\" -- though not consistent, with a little training he would be on track. All he needs now is a home to hang his collar, hopefully a new one, message no longer needed. He's even masculine enough to wear pink!\n\nPrince has been vaccinated and neutered, but has received a diagnosis of 'light' heartworms and is currently undergoing treatment. He will soon be 100% healthy but is ready for adoption (or foster) ASAP. Please contact Debbie at deb923@bellsouth.net with questions or if your interested in adopting, complete an application from Doggie Harmony > Forms and send it to deb923@bellsouth.net and jamie@doggieharmony.org.\n2/2/21 12:22 AM",

Lexi is a sweet, lovely lady who is hoping to get the loving home she deserves. Sadly, Lexi has spent most of her life outside along with her daughter. Lexi is looking for an adopter that has a soft pillow, lots of snacks, likes to relax and enjoys laying on the deck to birdwatch. Since Lexi was mostly outside in her past life, Lexi is heartworm positive and will need an adopter that can provide the medical care she requires. She would like nothing more than to finish off her golden years with joy and peace of mind knowing her daughter is going to be cared for as well.

When not found snoozing away as the resident office dog, Tulip loves taking walks and exploring the woods! She also enjoys searching out food in puzzle toys, sunbathing, belly rubs, and a lap to lay in. She is learning her manners and practicing sit and wait, calmly taking treats, and not jumping up on people. Housebroken, crate trained, and medium energy, she is the perfect dog to keep you company while you wait for that next zoom meeting. Tulip needs to be the only pet in the home, but don't worry! she has enough cuddles for everyone. When not playing with staff, Tulip can be found curled up on her dog bed, dreaming of her forever home.",

            "description": "Meet Rex\n\nhttp://4pawsnj.org/adopt\n\nMeet Rex! Rex came to us when his owner was not willing to pay for an emergency surgery. Rex's previous owner made a habit out of giving Rex whole raw chickens. When Rex became so ill, the vet wanted to do surgery, but the owner declined the surgery, hoping that Rex would recover without it. When it was obvious that Rex was not going to recover, the 4Paws Team jumped to action. Rex was surrendered to us and immediately got the life saving surgery he needed. Rex is now fully recovered and putting weight back on. Rex is a super friendly, happy dog. He loves other dogs and regularly plays with his foster brother Hemi. He is great on leash and loves to run around in the yard!\n\nIf interested in adopting Rex, please submit an online adoption application at\nhttp://4pawsnj.org/adopt\nto be considered. Once we receive your application we may contact you to schedule a meet. Due to COVID-19, all animal meetings must be scheduled by appointment, only after we have reviewed and processed your application.",

I came into rescue when my owners that cared for me very much had to move and could not take me with them. I'm an energetic guy and would like an active owner. My foster dad says I'm great on a leash. I love being in the fields with him running with my nose to the ground. When I'm on a long lead I keep my eye on my foster dad and come back to check in. When meeting new people I'm a little nervous at first but I warm up quickly. Then I'll take all the loves and pets I can get. I love to play fetch and will play all day long! I would enjoy playing with another dog in my home after a slow introduction and I am just fine with cats and horses. I will come to you microchipped, neutered, up to date on vaccinations, and up to date on heartworm and flea/tick preventatives. \n\nApplicants must have a secure and visible fence. In order for your application to be approved, you must also pass a home check and a vet check which includes having at least a two year vet history. Children in my home must be at least 10 years of age. I can be adopted in Missouri and surrounding states: Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and Arkansas. My rescue is able to transport me to those states. If you would like to give me a Furever home, please fill out an application on my rescue's website. \n\nBeing fostered in Holden, MO",

            "description": "\"Forever A Southern Gentle Pyr.\" You won't be in better company than with Jingo, a handsome six-year-old Great Pyrenees. He is a popular guy at the dog park and likes to supervise the other dogs to ensure there are no disagreements while he leans on his admirers for pets.\n\nWe don't know much about his life before the Great Pyrenees Rescue Society rescued him from a Texas animal shelter after found as a stray in a country field.\n\nWe know that Jingo is affectionate and can never get tired of being talked to and petted. He will affectionately ask you for a tummy rub by tucking his front paws into your body. Jingo is house trained, crate trained, and trustworthy enough to have the run of the house as he is not destructive. He behaves on car rides by laying down quietly.\n\nOlder Pyrs like to sleep in and take naps throughout the day, and sometimes Jingo won't get up to go potty outside when asked. He will instead roll on his back for tummy rubs or occasionally pretend to be asleep. Pyrs have a sense of humor you gotta love. He has a slight hip dysplasia, a manageable condition with lifestyle modifications, weight control, limited exercise and joint supplements.\n\nJingo would thrive in a home with adults, no small children, no cats, and no stairs. Jingo would benefit from a daily walk or hike in his new home and a fenced yard to play in with a semi active resident canine. If you have a place in your home and your heart for Jingo, please complete an application.\n\nAll dogs and puppies require VISIBLE fencing\n\nAdoption Fee: $300. (Adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm test, rabies, distemper, parvo and health certificate for travel). Northwest adopters pay the cost of transport to independent transport service ($225). Adoption applications can be found on our website at https://www.greatpyreneesrescuesociety.org/.\n\nADOPTION, FOSTERING, AND DONATIONS are just some of the ways you can help a rescued dog. We have worked hard to cultivate a large network of volunteers to save this majestic breed. While monetary donations are always much appreciated, you can also help by donating your time as a GPRS foster or volunteer!",

Owners did not come to reclaim these gals and so now they are awaiting their FOREVER homes. China is 3 years old, current on shots, now spayed, and just a Beautiful girl inside and out! She\u2019s very sweet and laid back after she plays and releases her pinned up energy. She  deserves a loving home to enjoy being cared for and  loved. She needs a home without cats and seems selective with canine friends...tends to prefer male dogs. Just a sweetheart...super beautiful too!  Stop by for a visit today & give her a fabulous life she deserves...a FOREVER home! \nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting another potential new furry member please bring him or her to the shelter and meet on neutral ground before adopting. No need to shuffle the animals around any more than necessary. Please know that 1 mosquito bite can create heart worms and they can be fatal if not treated. It is VERY important to keep your pets healthy and protected by keeping them on a once a month heart worm and flea/tick prevention. These animals are counting on you as their owner to provide them with lots a love and the proper health care so PLEASE make sure you are aware and prepared before adopting. Owning a pet is an extra expense and responsibility but is so worth every minute and penny you invest in them. They will add lots of joy and unconditional love if given a fair chance.\nThe shelter is open Mon.-Fri. 10-1, 2-5 and Sat. 10-4. Adopt a homeless pet and save a life. If you can not adopt right now come out and volunteer and make a difference in the lives of these animals while they await their FOREVER home.",

            "description": "Meet this beautiful senior girl named Asia! She was adopted from our shelter years ago and was brought in as a stray with her sibling China on Sept 7, 2020. Owners did not come to reclaim these gals and so now they are awaiting their FOREVER homes. Asia is now 11 years young, current on shots, and already spayed. She came in missing some hair and with irritated skin which will all heal with medicated baths and antiobiotics. She\u2019s very sweet and laid back yet had a lot of pep in her step. She loves toys and rope toys especially and deserves a loving home to enjoy her golden years being pampered and loved. When she was at our shelter before she was not a fan of other dogs, cats, and small children. THough we have found she really enjoys most male dogs. Such a sweet girl who deserves a loving FOREVER home to call her own. Stop by for a visit today & give her a fabulous life! \nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting another potential new furry member please bring him or her to the shelter and meet on neutral ground before adopting. No need to shuffle the animals around any more than necessary. Please know that 1 mosquito bite can create heart worms and they can be fatal if not treated. It is VERY important to keep your pets healthy and protected by keeping them on a once a month heart worm and flea/tick prevention. These animals are counting on you as their owner to provide them with lots a love and the proper health care so PLEASE make sure you are aware and prepared before adopting. Owning a pet is an extra expense and responsibility but is so worth every minute and penny you invest in them. They will add lots of joy and unconditional love if given a fair chance.\nThe shelter is open Mon.-Fri. 10-1, 2-5 and Sat. 10-4. Adopt a homeless pet and save a life. If you can not adopt right now come out and volunteer and make a difference in the lives of these animals while they await their FOREVER home.",

Barking and carrying on.  He tore blinds down and tore up woodwork at back door.  He is now on prozac once a day and trezodone given 2 hrs b4 you leave and is crated while gone.  Doing much better.  Absolutely loves long walks!     He is approx 5 years old. Has not been around small children. \n His teeth on one side do have tarter.  Other side looks good.  Updated on shots. \n He is fostered with 2 dogs and doing fine with them. But would like to be an only dog to get all the attention. Wants to sleep in bed with you. He would do well with a retired person that can spend time with him. Take for walks and just love on him.  Email purrfectfriendsforadoption@gmail.com\n",

            "description": "You won't find a sweeter dog than Sofee! She wants nothing more than to please her people. Sofee is about 4 years old and has gorgeous brindle markings. We have her listed as a Lab and American Staffordshire Terrier mix but she is likey a mix of many breeds. She is gentle and has done well with all the people she meets. She is a fast learner, but she likes to take her time and think about it first. She needs a household able to set up and maintain boundaries for her but then she quickly fits right in once she knows the rules of the house. She is housetrained, sleeps through the night in her crate, and has done well when left home alone in a room for a few hours. Sofee likes to chase after balls and goes for short walks but is more of a couch potato and prefers to lounge around with her humans. She is happy to get her mental stimulation through toys and puzzles with the occasional burst of zoomies. Those zoomies don't last long though before she switches gears and decides to take a nap by the pool instead. She is still working on her leash manners out and about on walks and would love a patient family able to continue her training. Sofee loves her humans so much that she doesn't like to share attention with other dogs and will need to be the only dog in her home. She's not a dog park or dog beach kind of girl and would much rather play with her people than have anything to do with other dogs. So far, she has been good with the two cats at her current foster home although if they run by her, sometimes she thinks that means they want to play. When she first came to Labs and More, Sofee was missing hair and had angry, red irritated skin. She received the medical care she needed and now her coat is smooth with those brindle tiger stripe markings really showing through and all her fur has grown back. She just needs to be on a special food to maintain her coat, but no longer needs daily medications. If you are looking for a companion who gives hugs and kisses and is all smiles Sofee might be the girl for you. If you are interested in meeting Sofee, your first step would be to submit an adoption application on our website. If you are already approved with an adoption coach or have adopted from us before, reach out to your coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application. If you have any questions email us at doginfo@labsandmore.org or call us at 858-273-5386. Thank you for looking to a rescue group to fulfill your dream of adding a new dog to your life!

            "description": "Dash is a playful boy who can't decide what he loves best - cuddling up on top of his human friends or curling up under his blankets. For sure, he wants to be as close to his people as possible, with lots of snuggling. Then he'll stare at them and paw until they lift a blanket so he can snuggle under it. This rambunctious boy also loves runs in the backyard, and going for the leash walks he does so well. He can have a little anxiety about strange things he sees, but he would like to meet and play with other dogs he sees. And he's done well on playdates with other APA! dogs his size. Back home, he loves playing tug-o-war and playing with his ball and stuffy toy. Then he's ready for his naps, preferably under his blankets. He is a smart boy who comes when called, and answers to sit, stay, down, shake and free. And he does very well in his crate, and also can roam the house nicely, doing fine when home alone. Plus, he's very well house-trained. This loving cuddle bug would thrive in a home with a backyard to run in, preferably with a wooden privacy fence that would keep him from seeing those strange things he sometimes fears. He may do best as the only pet, but has done well with other pups. And he loves all adults and responsible teenagers, especially those who can help him relax. Come meet him - offer him a blanket and he'll follow you home.",

You'll catch her zooming around the yard, romping with her doggie friends, and chasing her tail. She is best with a male companion (large or small) and is way too interested for a cat home. Coco appreciates cuddles with her humans and is a great car buddy. \n\nCoco has a clean bill of health. You may notice the bump on her cheek. Coco has visited multiple veterinarians and they all concur that the bump is from a previous trauma. They also indicated that because it doesn't bother her. They don\u2019t recommend unnecessary cosmetic surgery. She has had a biopsy and confirmation that it is a fatty tumor and not cancer. Though we will never know what Coco experienced before rescue, we know her future forever family will love her just the way she is. \n\nCoco is a courtesy post and all placement decisions will be made by Coco\u2019s guardian. If you are interested in meeting  please fill out an application at our website www.gobeyondrescue.org/adopt and we will forward your information.",

Everything was going along great for him until his family broke apart. He was then moved into an apartment complex, where they do not allow dogs, so the owners thought of the great idea to lock him up in a bathroom while they are at work. As you can imagine that was not a great solution, so luckily a family friend became aware of this solution and brought it to our attention.\n\nSince that time, Blue has lived in foster homes and has been to training.\n\nHe becomes very attached and can be protective.\n\nHe is affectionate, loyal, obedient, moderate temperament and smart.\n\nHe is also a bit stubborn and needs a strong and firm handler to keep him controlled. He is a blue nose with a silver-blue short coat. He is neutered and up to date on all of his shots. He is lovable, playful and will make a great family pet for anyone. He is also gorgeous to boot.

We adopted him as a puppy and things were going great until the owner had a boyfriend move in with her and the dog was afraid of the boyfriend.   So she felt it wasn\u2019t fare to the dog to be miserable around her boyfriend.  Now here at the shelter two of the employees are males and he dies just fine.  Please feel free to call the shelter and ask for Ken at 636-388-1636 .  He can answer most of your questions.  We feel a fenced in yard will be best for this dog.  If you\u2019d like to come and meet the dog call and schedule a appointment because we only show by appointment only.  His adoption fee of $150.00 will cover his shots, neutering, 2 months of flea and tick products, a heartworm preventative, one vet exam with a decal check at Webster Groves Animal Hospital, dog bones, a doggie toothbrush, 2 bags of dog food, a swifter, a hotel night stay, a bath , and a day at. Doggie day camp at Kennelwood which has 8 Missouri  locations and 2 Illinois locations and a great coupon booklet from Petsmart with a free day at doggie day camp, a one night free hotel night stay and a 30 minute dog training consultation .",

Found as a stray and taken to a shelter, ATDR quickly grabbed this handsome little long-haired fellow when contacted! He's now enjoying life as a member of a comfortable foster home, getting to know his camp fire mates and enjoying good grub served regularly by a doting foster mom! Sam is also receiving the veterinary care he's done without as a homeless wanderer on the dusty roads which includes getting on top of a flea allergy and having a good dental. With the help of a few good medicated baths and some TLC he's quickly turning into the stunning boy we knew he was underneath!\nSam's foster mom reports that he's house trained and doesn't hike his leg in the house! He's quickly learned to use the doggy door. He doesn't require crating but isn't upset when crated. He has been staying gated with a few of his housemates while the people are away from home and doing great! His new adoptive home should include another dog. He really would like to play but most of the dogs in his foster home are old and have no interest. However, he's respectful of them and gets along with everyone.\nIf you're looking for an extremely sweet best friend and companion to share life's adventures with and already have a nice doggy who would love a playmate, please submit an adoption application for Sam Houston. He's just waiting to fill that empty spot in your heart and home that only a loving pup can!",

            "description": "Anyone who has met her has used the words \"angel\" and \"lovebug\". Hennessy loves people, pets, belly rubs and treats (like most dogs).\n\nShe's house trained, crate trained, she knows \"sit\", never really barks (unless to play with you or at other dogs), easy to bathe, and walk around the neighborhood.\n\nAfter a walk, Hennessy loves to people watch and admire cars that drive by.  Hennessy lives off of the energy of the people around her - she can be playful in tug-o-war or lowkey in a lazy afternoon. When she gets excited, she will do a little \"aroo\" to get you to play and jump around. In the evening, she'll go to her doggy bed parked next to your bed and sleep for a straight 8 hours.\n\nHennessy does not like other dogs so would need to be the only animal in the household. This queen doesn\u2019t like to share her people. But she does amazing with people and children! \n\nDue to her poorly cropped ears, Hennessy does require some general maintenance to prevent infections. Additionally, as with most meatballs, she has some skin sensitivity and allergies, but nothing that requires any extra care for now.\n\nYou may read more about our adoption policies and procedures at www.truenorthrescue.org. Please submit a complete application on our website - meet and greets are only scheduled with approved applicants. Please be sure to answer every question as thoughtfully as you can, this will help your chances. Incomplete applications will not be reviewed, and we unfortunately can not contact all applicants to inquire about missing information.\n\nDo not email through Petfinder because we won't be able to answer. Please email adopt.truenorthrescue@gmail.com to check on the status of your application. All applications can take anywhere from 24-72 hours to be processed and only approved applicants will be contacted.\n\nIf a dog is listed here on Petfinder, they are still available. Please don't email just to ask if they're available - they are! With the high volume of emails we receive daily, it is not guaranteed that we can reply to every inquiry. As a fully volunteer run rescue, we make every effort to reply in a timely fashion, but please allow 24-48 hours for a response.\n\nWe strive to have accurate and up to date bios, and regularly check in with our fosters to ensure we are providing the most relevant information. If there is no mention of a health or behavioral concern, then it means we have not been informed of one!\nCharacteristics",

            "description": "\"Paris is always a good idea,\" and we happen to agree about our Paris! This pretty girl happens be deaf, and it doesn't seem like she has had the chance to consistently work on hand signals so far. She is a sensitive lady, and can be easily startled and unsure in new places - so she would do best in a quieter, patient home that will take the time to help her learn a language she can understand! So far, this darling girl has been quite demure and sweet. She checks in regularly with her person on walks, which is a great start for learning sign language! She seems to be housebroken, and so far she has walked well on leash. Paris will likely need careful intros with other dogs - being deaf, she can't pick up on vocal cues from other animals. With a little love, patience and learning, Paris will be the good girl we know her to be! Paris is around 3 years old and weighs 56 lbs.\nDue to COVID-19, CITY DOGS is currently doing adoptions by APPOINTMENT ONLY. Please visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog to request a meet and greet! \n\nQuestions? Email: citydogs@city.cleveland.oh.us | Call: (216) 664-3476\nVisit: 9203 Detroit Avenue Cleveland, OH 44102\n\nHours:\n10 AM - 3 PM Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday\n10 AM - 6 pm Tuesday & Thursday\n\nFee: $61 | Includes spay/neuter, shots, microchip, license, 30 days free pet insurance (when registered upon adoption)\n\nThe CITY DOGS mission is to increase adoptions from the City Kennel by changing the image of the pit bulls who make up the majority of the kennel population, by preparing all adoptable dogs in the kennel for lives in loving homes and by creating as many opportunities as possible for the public to meet and get to know our dogs for the terrific pets they are meant to be.\n\nOur Adoption Process...\nHere's a little about how things work:\nAll of the CITY DOGS posted for adoption are available for direct adoption from the kennel, unless noted otherwise. You must schedule a meet with a dog in advance - we are not currently accepting walk-ins. Please look online first to see if there are any dogs you think would be a good fit for your home before scheduling a meet. To get the process started, visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog and fill out the form. One of our adoption counselors will get in touch to schedule and confirm your meet! At the kennel, an adoption counselor will introduce you and your family to the adoptable dogs, share information we know about them, and discuss our suggested ways for successfully integrating a new dog into your home. You are welcome to meet multiple dogs. If the dog you adopt is already fixed, he or she may leave with you that day - otherwise, the dog can go home after receiving the spay or neuter surgery.)\n\nAbout Our Dogs: All available dogs have gone through a behavioral and medical assessment. This assessment is a snapshot of who the dog is at that given time. We cannot make any guarantees with regard to behavior, temperament or health of any City Dog once they are in the home. Most of our dogs are picked up as strays, so we do not know what kind of home environment they were living in (i.e. with kids, other dogs or other cats), nor do we know if most of them are house trained. Everything we know about them is based on volunteer and staff observations. We do have some dogs in foster homes, where they will have more information about how the dog is in a home environment. It is very hard to tell with certainty whether or not a dog will be good with kids, cats or another dog. If you have kids in the home or another dog, we do require that they be present for a meet and greet with the dog you are considering for adoption.\n\nHeath/Vaccinations: Dogs that are adopted directly from the kennel need to go to your personal vet within two weeks of leaving the kennel. All dogs receive their DAPPL, Rabies, and Bordatella vaccines, though you may be required to get follow up boosters. All dogs come microchipped and with a Cuyahoga County license.?  \n\n\n\n \n",

What he will be is a great family companion- loyal and protective to those he loves and trusts.\n\nOreo is (mid September) just finishing heartworm treatment (SO preventable, sigh), and due to this is on strict crate rest until mid October.\n\nOreo's fostered in Baker County; to set up a meet and sniff just email us.\n\nOreo is current on his vaccinations and deworming, is microchipped and neutered.\n\nHis adoption fee, which includes the above-mentioned vetting, is just $250. Home visit and reference checks are required and are NOT negotiable. Note that we cannot adopt to those in apartments or other attached housing. Our apologies for the inconvenience.",

Chatham or Chatham Kent area for foster home to be close to vet clinic.\n\nCarlos is one of our senior dogs who came from a kill shelter in Quebec.  He was placed with a foster home but over time Carlos was having problems with the many stairs in their split level home.  He has pain meds as needed.  He is a very sweet soul who needs a safe, loving home to retire and not have to move any more.  Carlos enjoys laying on his bed, hanging out with his foster family and enjoying life.  He does not do walks, he is quite content to have a yard to do his business and have a little walk.  He needs a one level home with little to no steps to go outside.  \n\nIf you are looking for a good boy to be a companion, please consider being a permanent foster for Carlos.

            "description": "***Zadie is only available through our Foster to Adopt Program***\n\nHi, my name is Zadie! Thanks for taking the time to look at me. \n\nAs you can see I'm a very pretty lady. I'm a sweet girl who came up here from the south. My life down there was far from the best. But some kind people came to save me! I was so scared when got here, to tell you the truth, I am still pretty scared and I need you to understand that but someone great like you, I'm sure you will. It's not my fault I'm scared and my foster mom says I'm a very brave girl. My first few days with her I was too afraid to move at all but now cuddling with her and my foster doggie brother is my favorite! When things get too scary (like loud sounds outside or new people coming over) I love my kennel as it is my safe place, I also love under my foster mom's bed. I'm shy to meeting new people but after a while I'll slowly come out and give some sniffs and kisses. Men kind of scare me and I warm up to women faster. All I want is to give love and to get pets in return. \n\nAnd toys! Do you know what toys are? I'm just learning and wow are they awesome! I love dogs and cats! My foster mom says I play a little too rough with her cat so maybe one wouldn't be best in my house. I'm working on learning commands and my foster mom says I am very smart. I am still working on potty training. Sometimes outside is just so scary still, but I'm close to getting there. \n\nThe vet says I have this thing called heart worm. Don't worry it will go away with treatment and time. I am such a tough girl! I hope this doesn't make you over look me. I would love if you would give me a chance. All I want is a loving forever family. Maybe that's you?\n\nFOSTER TO ADOPT:\nZadie is Heartworm positive and is in the middle of her Heartworm treatment. This treatment takes about 3 months with 3-5 appointments at our vets in Minnetonka. After the treatment series is completed, a heartworm test is done a month later and repeated in the months following until a negative test result is achieved. A negative result can take up to 2-9 months after treatment. During the treatment and until the test result is negative, she will need to make sure her heart rate is not elevated due to high energy play or exercise. Zadie is only available through the Foster to Adopt Program at this time. The foster to adopt commitment will be for an ADOPTION but will be actually fostering until she is cleared with a negative Heartworm test result, which at that time, we will make the adoption official. All of the medical expenses will be paid for by the rescue while she is in a foster to adopt home. Food, kennel, grooming and other supplies will be provided by the foster in the foster to adopt program. \n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nAll our Warrior Dogs will have all age appropriate medical care and vaccines, a microchip, and spay/neuter before adoption unless age is a factor with a puppy younger than 6-12 months at the time of adoption. If that is the case, the spay/neuter will be covered in the adoption fee and the owner will be responsible to have the procedure completed at a Warrior Dog Rescue Veterinarian at the appropriate time.\n\nPlease note that the majority of our dogs in rescue are from shelters where they have been found as strays or abandoned. Their breed description is based on our very best educated guess based on physical characteristics and their dispositions. If they came to our rescue as an owner surrender, the breed description will be listed as provided by the previous owner.\n\nAdoption Fee - $450\n\nTo apply for this pup, please submit an Adoption Application at http://warriordogrescue.com/adopt/adoption-application/",

            "description": "Soulful like the ocean waves!\n\nHey guys, my name is Windansea and I am about 6 years old, male German Shepherd mix. I am a big boy at about 70 lbs and have been neutered already. I was splashing about on the streets of TJ and TAP rescued me to find me my forever home. I have thrived at my foster home and filled up nicely with 3-4 small meals. I am learning house manners and I am a master at going to bathroom now! I always let my fam know and never have any accidents. I am still picking up on leash training and positive reinforcement is working so well! My treat motivation has helped me learn commands too!\n\nI have had some niggle-wiggles while walking and I recently saw a very nice vet. They mentioned that I may have some ibuprofens to take for a long time. I have some delicate joints and supplements will help. A bit of swimming and physiotherapy will also help me stay light on my feet. I don't need surgery, just a bit of joint management to stay happier!\n\nI am a mellow and chilled out guy and I love to be around my family. I am friendly, amicable and totally not jumpy! I have so much sweetness in my heart and I love to give my people all the love in my heart. I enjoy going on walks and I am getting better on the leash. I am an easy-maintenance guy and just company and attention makes me happy. I am friendly with every person I meet, kids or adults. With doggos, I am a lil selective and I prefer slow introductions to figure out how we'll get along. I have a feeling, I will prefer to be the only pet in the home.\n\nI'd love to be with a family that has a lot of love to share! I would like to be the only doggo of the house for ultimate attention. If you think we are a great match, wave at me! My adoption fee is $350 and that includes spaying/neutering, shots, and microchip. If you want to take me home, please fill out the form on the website here https://theanimalpad.org/adoption-application/",

            "description": "Cherry is a beautiful 2 year old Boxer/Rhodesian Ridgeback mix. She was picked up by animal control as a stray & brought to Rosenberg Animal Control & Shelter, where she remained for several months with little adoption interest. She was clearly overbred & not cared for, as she is so young & already heartworm positive. That doesn't hold her back one bit from being the fun loving, sweet red dog, she is. We have started her on slow kill heartworm treatment & she will retest in February. (She would be under a Foster to Adopt agreement while we cover all treatment expenses) We fell in love with her care free spirit & knew she needed another chance at life, to be loved the way she should've been. \n\nCherry is a big girl at about 60lbs & will require a strong leader to stay consistent with training & structure to help her be the best she can be. She truly doesn't know a stranger & bonds heavy to her humans. She loves going for walks & would do best in a home without cats or smaller dogs & with children over the age of 7 as she doesn't always realize how big she is. She does enjoy the company of other dogs, however she's paid her mommy dues with rowdy puppies so she appreciates a more mature & laid back, male housemate to hang with! Cherry has your typical Boxer temperament - constant wiggles, bouncing, lots of affection, never a bad day, & her little nub tail never stops!\n\nCherry is spayed, vaccinated, & microchipped.\nIf you're interested in adopting Cherry, please apply at the link below  :)\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/83106888643163",

            "description": "Meet Panza, a female who we're guessing is Red Heeler mixed with Golden Retriever.   An Australian Cattle Dog, or Heeler , is a breed of herding dog developed in Australia for driving cattle over long distances across rough terrain in all weather.  The breed comes in two main colors, one of which is the Red Heeler, i.e. Panza.  Everyone knows Goldens.  Panza has clearly had someone who cared for her before: she rides very well in a car and she already knows \"sit\", \"shake\", \"down\", \"rollover\" and she'll \"stay\" for the most part.  Whatever situation caused Panza to end up in a shelter has not resulted in her having any ill will toward humans - she loves people and wants to be with them always.  Panza's estimated DOB is 9/1/2017 which means that she is fully grown and out of the \"puppy\" stage.  That does not mean, however, that she is a couch potato.  As the description implies, Heelers are very smart and trainable, obedient, loyal, with a lot of energy.  She is extremely affectionate, has a very playful nature with humans and, being a dog bred to work hard, she can keep up with just about anyone.   Being so smart, Heelers need both mental and physical stimulation to be happy dogs.  They, and presumably Panza, may nip at people and other dogs to guide them.  So, a home with small children may not be the best choice.  She would be best with no children or teenagers. Panza has plenty of energy that she needs to use.  She'll be a good running companion if asked.  From what we've seen, Panza is not a fan of other dogs and would do best as an only dog. Panza seems to have great house manners and does not tear up her bedding or toys.  She's ready for a home!  \n\nIf you are interested in Panza, please fill out an application here:\nhttps://www.parkvilleshelter.com/adoption-application",

I had an owner before, but unfortunately he had to move to Miami and leave our old home. He brought me to PAWS4You so I could have a place to sleep and have fun while he figured out the next step. You see, he never came back for me, I guess I wasn't his priority. I have now moved on and I'm ready to start a new life to live my last years with a special someone. I promise to always be there physically and emotionally, I will make those rainy days full of sunshine and smiles. I require to be the only pet at home and live with only one human, who has lots of dog\nexperience\n.\n\nTo adopt, fill out an application at\n\nwww.paws4you.org/application\n\nTo get our newsletter, text\nPAWS4YOU\nto\n22828\n\nConnect with us:\n\nwww.instagram.com/paws4you\n\nwww.twitter.com/paws4you\n\nwww.facebook.com/paws4you",

He is the best little boy with the greatest personality.\n\n\nThank you so much for your inquiry. Our sweet Hard Knocker is currently available for adoption. Our process in adopting out our dogs begins with an adoption application. Please complete this form on our website using the following link, https://www.hkrtinc.com/adoption-form. \n\nOnce you have submitted your application, please allow up to 72 hours for a response. Once approved, you will be contacted to set up a meet and greet. Submitting an application does not guarantee an adoption. We do not operate on a first come first serve basis. We want our dogs to find the perfect home.

I want to hang out with you (and only you, so no other dogs or kids for me please) and make you happy. What more could you want? I already know how to sit and give paw, which in my opinion are the two best commands to know. I seem to very much like my food to myself, so I think I would do best in a home with firm boundaries with humans when it comes to mealtime and treats. I may be nine years old, but I still have a lot of life, and I sure do love to play. Are you looking for someone to keep a smile on your face all day every day? I just might be your guy!",

We do know that he was a stray in Spencer who had been hit with a car. He is healing up nicely and is ready to find his forever home! He does still have some swelling in one of his paws, which you can see in some of the pictures, but he is on medicine to help with that! Herc doesn't seem to be a big fan of bigger male dogs, but he LOVES female dogs of any size! He does seem interested in cats, but it appears as if he wants to play, so playful cats is a plus!\n\nUpdate: Our boy Hercules has returned to us. He was in a special situation that just wasn't the best fit for him or the family. He is an absolute goofball who would do great with someone who is willing to help him learn! His previous owner, who wants the best for this sweet boy, has written a history from what he had learned from Herc while he was with him. If you are interested in Herky and would like to read that please let us know, it will give you a great look into what Herky is looking for and what he will need in a forever home. The previous owner is also willing to talk about Hercules to anyone who is interested in him and might have a few questions, he truly wants what is best for Hercules! \n\nHercules is up to date on his vaccinations and is neutered. His adoption fee is $350. For any other questions or to request an adoption application please email Donna at djerickson1@hotmail.com.",

All meet and greets will be private and held at an outdoor location in Lake Elmo.\n\nPlease request an application via email or by a Petfinder request. For more information on the rescue, what the fee includes, surgery program, etc please see the home page.\n\nAdoption fee: $450 cash or card only (There is a $10 fee to use a card) NO CHECKS\n\nAge: 8-9 weeks\nDOB Approx. 7-23-20?\nGender: Male\nAltered: NO- surgery is included in the fee, please see information below\nBreed: Mixed breed\nApprox Weight Now:  6-9 pounds\nApprox Weight Grown: 45-65 pounds complete guess as we do not know parents \nDog-friendly: Yes\nCat-friendly: Yes\nKid-friendly: Yes\nHouse Trained: No\nCrate-Trained: No\nBenefit From Formal Training: All puppies benefit from training\nEnergy level: Moderate\nHistory: Surrendered to the shelter- have no info on where they came from or their parents. \n\nNote From the Foster:\nThese are normal healthy typical puppies. They like to run, play, and get into things. They will need training. Do not forget puppies are a lot of work but with work comes great joy.  We do not know their parents so their size is a complete guess for us. Average puppies this size tend to be in the 45-70 pound range. \n\n\nSURGERY INFORMATION:\nI will be getting fixed on 10-8. If you adopt me before this date you will be required to bring me to this appointment. We will not hold them until their surgery date or reschedule any surgery that is already scheduled. This appointment can be changed at the need of the surgery facility with short notice.\n\nThe surgery appointment is in Golden Valley.\nDrop off is 7:30 and pick up can be any time between 1-4. They will contact you when surgery is complete and the dog is ready to be picked up\n\nUniversity of Minnesota @ Animal Humane Society Veterinary Services Building\n845 Meadow Ln. N.\nGolden Valley, MN 55422\n\nCurrently, our surgical programs have opened back up. Since we cannot guarantee that they will not close due to a COVID outbreak we do need to protect ourselves. If this happens and we cannot get your dog in for surgery at our program facility you will have to follow the guidelines of our COVID-19 spay and neuter contract. \n\n If this contract is in place due to a COVID outbreak in the facility.  Adopters will be required to fix on their own, at their own expense, by the age of 6 months old. If they are already 6 months old at the time of adoption then you will have 4 weeks to have them fixed. If proof is provided within 2 weeks of the completed surgery an up to $100 refund for the cost of surgery ONLY will be returned to the adopter. It is not to exceed the cost of the surgery only.  We will also not return any money if your dog is fixed as part of a wellness plan. You must inform us if you have scheduled your dog for surgery at your own vet if under this contract.",

They really want a home with a fenced in yard because they love to lay out in the sunshine during good weather. However, they don't want to be \"outside only\" dogs.  They want to be able sleep inside at night, be inside during bad weather, and of course for cuddles and snuggles.  \nBeau's DOB is 7/13/2011 and he weighs 39 pounds.  He came into rescue after being hit by a car and had paralysis in his back legs. After lots of rest and rehabilitation he recovered and is now walking.  Beau is easygoing and loves to bask in the sunshine.  He takes treats gently and walks nicely on a leash.  He likes to play with Chato and Chato seems to know that Beau can't roughhouse.  Beau is looking for a home with a gentle lifestyle with his best friend Chato.  Beau will also need to stay at a healthy weight.  Beau is current on vaccines, neutered, on heartworm and flea/tick prevention, and microchipped.  If you are interested in Beau and Chato, go to www.tysorvet.net and click on the adoption tab.  There you will find a link to the adoption application. \n Chato's DOB is 7/16/2017 and he weighs 41 pounds.  He was originally rescued by a rescue organization but developed a urinary tract infection and they surrendered him to our adoption program.  Chato is a very sweet low key pup.  If you are lucky he will curl up his top lip to give you a grin.  Chato takes treats gencly and walks nicely on a leash.  He loves his best friend, Beau.   Chato loves being out in the backyard with Beau and will often get \"the zoomies\" when you engage him in play.  His coat is a lovely white with some patches of light brown.  He will benefit from regular brushing.  Chato is current on vaccines, neutered, on heartworm and flea/tick prevention, and microchipped.  If you are interested in Beau and Chato go to www.tysorvet.net and click on the adoption tab.  There you will find a link to the adoption application.  \n",

            "description": "These two guys are the very best of friends and we would love for them to find a home together.  Both have been in our adoption program since 2018.  They really want a home with a fenced in yard because they love to lay out in the sunshine during good weather. However, they don't want to be \"outside only\" dogs.  They want to be able sleep inside at night, be inside during bad weather, and of course for cuddles and snuggles.  \nBeau's DOB is 7/13/2011 and he weighs 39 pounds.  He came into rescue after being hit by a car and had paralysis in his back legs. After lots of rest and rehabilitation he recovered and is now walking.  Beau is easygoing and loves to bask in the sunshine.  He takes treats gently and walks nicely on a leash.  He likes to play with Chato and Chato seems to know that Beau can't roughhouse.  Beau is looking for a home with a gentle lifestyle with his best friend Chato.  Beau will also need to stay at a healthy weight.  Beau is current on vaccines, neutered, on heartworm and flea/tick prevention, and microchipped.  If you are interested in Beau and Chato, go to www.tysorvet.net and click on the adoption tab.  There you will find a link to the adoption application. \n Chato's DOB is 7/16/2017 and he weighs 41 pounds.  He was originally rescued by a rescue organization but developed a urinary tract infection and they surrendered him to our adoption program.  Chato is a very sweet low key pup.  If you are lucky he will curl up his top lip to give you a grin.  Chato takes treats gencly and walks nicely on a leash.  He loves his best friend, Beau.   Chato loves being out in the backyard with Beau and will often get \"the zoomies\" when you engage him in play.  His coat is a lovely white with some patches of light brown.  He will benefit from regular brushing.  Chato is current on vaccines, neutered, on heartworm and flea/tick prevention, and microchipped.  If you are interested in Beau and Chato go to www.tysorvet.net and click on the adoption tab.  There you will find a link to the adoption application.  \n",

I really like to go off-site and get all of the good sniffs in new places, so if you like adventures, I'm down. My body may look a little funny, but it's only because it matches my goofy personality. Did I mention that I have the cutest underbite you've ever seen? My ideal home would be with one human who will be my best friend, no other animals please! \n\nWinnie is considered special needs due to hypothyroidism, as well as a few minor medical issues. We would love to discuss her conditions with you over the phone or by email.\nPhone: (845)452-7722 ext 420\nEmail: adoptions@dcspca.org",

I didn\u2019t have any experience with humans, and I was almost paralyzed with fear over them. I started to learn how to be a dog with help of my foster families dogs. Im still skittish and need lots of patience but ive learned so much. I like my foster siblings the best and would probably do best in a home with another dog. I am a puppy so I like to chew on toys and bones. I like to go for short familiar walks with my harness I copy everything the big dogs do. I love the couch and treats, once I get to know you, I will be your shadow.",

Kiko is safe and she is loved. Her fosters say is very sweet and mellow. She is still fearful. She is slowly learning to trust and we know she will come out of her shell with time and patience.\n\nBut Kiko's story is even more heartbreaking than we initially thought. We knew she had an odd issue with her shoulder, but had no idea what was wrong. She has been to see a vet for consultation at Northridge, which revealed she has a luxating scapula. This is not a common injury for a dog, and we don't know how long she has suffered from this injury. Kiko will need surgery to repair her injured shoulder.",

            "description": "Jepson is a 4 year old, 78 pound Great Pyrenees mix looking for his new home.  Jepson came to us along with 12 other Great Pyrenees mixes from a rather unfortunate hoarding situation. He was riddled with mange on arrival and in an attempt to treat it, someone poured a chemical solvent on his back, permanently scarring the top of his back between his shoulders and above his tail. He is now perfectly healthy and, despite this background, this dog loves people.\n\nJepson is also locally famous as a dog that defended one of our employees who was walking him when someone tried to do a snatch and grab of her into a van. Jepson was not having it and they backed off and drove away. This is what this breed does and he did his job exceedingly well. Jepson is friendly to all unless you threaten someone he loves. \n\nJepson is best as an only dog as he does not want to share with other dogs anymore. He is also a no cat dog.  He is social, happy and friendly with people and he is good with kids over 10. He needs a home with people who understand the Great Pyrenees breed and with a fenced yard. He would love a sofa to crash on and he has zero understanding of why if you have two hands to pet him with, that they could possibly be occupied with anything other than petting him. This dog is going to make a fantastic pet for the right home.\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/ then email mandy@bigfluffydogs.com. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

What does Boulder need you ask... Well let me tell you! \n\n1. Someone that loves to play fetch and will play with him daily! \n2. A fenced in yard to play fetch in! \n3. An all adult home with no other pets that is willing to put him away when unknown people come over. Intros to new people can be done, but they need to be slow and involve lots of treats! \n4. Someone that knows that some deaf dogs have fear based reactivity to unknown stimuli and is willing to keep this boy and everyone else around him safe. \n5.. A strong leader that will set boundaries. No pushovers for this guy!\n6. Someone that will show him the world. He loves to walk in different places and will follow at your heel. He also loves the water! \n7. A patient owner that will start out slow with him while he gets comfortable in a new environment. \n8. Someone that will appreciate all of his quirks! He has lots of adorable habits like nursing on his beds. It is adorable until you have to wash the slobbery bed! \n\nBoulder is currently living at our adoption center where he is beloved by the staff and volunteers that care for him. He gets to go on field trips to parks, lakes, and friends houses to play fetch. As much as we love Boulder and Boulder loves us, he is ready to find his forever home where he can play lots of fetch! Read more about him below: \n\nHi, my name is Boulder and I am the squishiest goof ball in the triangle! I am the kind of dog that would love nothing more than to play fetch with you allllll day in the backyard, then flop over for some belly rubs! If I know you and trust you, we will be the bestest of friends! Because I am deaf, I am in need of a patient foster/adopter that understands that I must have a routine in order to thrive. I do have some fear aggression, but all that goes away when I am introduced to new people/situations properly and systematically. If someone sneaks up on me when I am not expecting it, I get quite spooked. The staff here has compared me to Scooby Doo, but I am much more handsome than he was... They tell me it's because I'm a scaredy cat... I wish I could get all those Scooby snacks like he did! \n\nI love to go for walks, but am quite the strong boy and I do better when on a harness. I also get excited when I see other dogs, so a backyard is preferable so walking is a luxury and not a must. I am searching for a calm, adult only home that will love me and cherish me for the big doof that I am. The Dog Program Manager here has really put emphasis on me being in a structured environment with a clear routine. She has seen the absolute best and the worst of me, and is certain that I will make the right household extremely happy. It is hard to not smile when you look at me goof trotting around and flopping over when I am protesting something. If you are an experienced dog person, that is willing to work with Second Chance to ensure that I am set up to succeed, and you have lots of patience and love to give, then I may be the boy for you! I am currently only available for the foster to adopt since I have some behavioral special needs. In the meantime, I would love to be in a foster home rather than in a room at the adoption center. If you are interested in fostering me, or would like to learn more about me, please contact the Dog Program Manager at laura@secondchancenc.org. Thank you!!!",

WE are a high intake No Kill Shelter ran by a staff of 4 and do not always have time to answer every question asked by so many. If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced. It is never our intention to ignore a request about an adoptable animal in our facility.\n\nSandy Brown, Director, PAW Animal Shelter\n\n319-372-2274",

She is not particularly fond of other dogs, so probably best suited in an only one dog home. She would be perfect for an active man/woman or couple. If you are interested in meeting Ninia, just submit an application.. she is waiting for you:) www.pupsinperil.org/adoption/",

AJ is very friendly with other dogs as long as they don't try to take his things. He doesn't like to share and is a bit possessive when it comes to his valuables. So his adopter will need to be mindful of this resource guarding behavior and work with him on it. This behavior is quite common in dogs who have been in the shelter system for a long time or come from very difficult backgrounds, like not knowing where or when their next meal would be. He's getting much better about it though as he settles in and knows he is safe. \n\nAJ has spent very little time in a home environment and will need some patience and basic training to help him understand how to adapt to home life. After being at our rescue for a few weeks, he did very well during a visit to our head of animal care's home. He got along very well with the other dogs in the home, really loved the kids, and didn't seem to mind the cats at all. It was a fun sleepover for all! We believe AJ would do really well with an active adopter who likes to go for hikes and walks to keep this guy engaged and burn off some of that infectious hound energy.\n\nDoes AJ sound like your next BFF?",

She is afraid of loud noises, such as thunder, motorcycles, traffic, etc. She will need someone in a quiet environment, preferably with a male dog for her to play with. She does like to play outside, but also likes the a/c. She is non destructive, housebroken. She likes children, but we would not recommend young children. She may require someone with a little patience to get her comfortable and secure in her new home. If you would like to meet Opal, please contact, Pups in Peril. Due to covid, we do require an approved application prior to setting up meet and greets. www.pupsinperil.org/adoption/",

But the techs at the Vet clinic said she was just as sweet as can be and friendly to everyone.  She can be aggressive with other dogs so she needs to be the only dog in the home..  We aren't sure about how she is with cats.  \nScout is looking for a forever family to call her own. Her adoption fee is $200, which includes  spay surgery and vaccinations (parvo/distemper and rabies.) If you would like to meet this dog, please email us: scfourpaws@hotmail.com or leave a message @ 435-764-3534.

He loves to have his wrinkles massaged, likes when you talk to him in a gruff voice, and needs someone to teach him inside manners.  He should go to a home with a secure fenced yard and no small children--he is high energy and gets really excited when playing.  He seems to be OK with other dogs, but does not do well with cats. he is a bit skittish in new situations.  He would love an active family.\n\nBubba is looking for a forever family to call his own. His adoption fee is $200, which includes neuter surgery and vaccinations (parvo/distemper and rabies.) If you would like to meet this dog, please email us: scfourpaws@hotmail.com or leave a message @ 435-764-3534. Please be patient with us getting back to you as we are all volunteers with full-time jobs. Thanks for your interest in this wonderful dog!!",

Please read our eligibility requirements and apply on our website: www.ildoberescue.com/adopt.  After an application is submitted, additional inquiries can email dobes@ildoberescue.com.\n\nMojo and Josie Jo are an 8-year-old pair that originally arrived to IDR+ from a shelter in Arkansas. They were recently adopted, but the elderly father later moved in, and he kept tripping over them, so they were reluctantly returned. This beautiful pair of littermates are stuck like glue, and hope to find a home to adopt them together. Mojo and Josie Jo love attention from their people. Both love to get their ears rubbed, and Mojo is learning to enjoy a good massage to help loosen his muscles. He came to us moving very stiffly, and being confined for his heartworm treatment didn\u2019t help. He has since recovered from his treatment and both are ready to go! His mobility is greatly improving now with regular exercise and supplements. He is beginning to run around the yard and stretch his legs! Josie Jo is also on an inexpensive daily supplement to help control very common leaking. They both need to go out often to pee.\u00a0\n\nBoth dogs are a little shy about changes. They are learning to accept new things and gain more confidence every day, but they are pretty set in their ways. Introductions to new dogs make Josie Jo a little nervous, and Mojo does not seem to appreciate high-energy dogs. They are strongly bonded to each other, and while we will continue to take it slow, they would probably be best placed in a household where they were the only two dogs. If you need a reason to be limited to two dogs, they\u2019re the perfect package deal! They have an unknown history with cats and are recommended for children 12 and over, who are respectful and laid back with large breed dogs. We are not requiring an obedience deposit for this pair; however, we are requiring a fence since they love to lounge around in the sun and take it easy. If you have space for this sweet pair of bonded seniors, it would be incredible to find them a retirement home together.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe biographical information provided is correct to the best of our knowledge while the animal is in our care or includes what may have been provided by a previous owner. We strive to be honest and accurate, but animals can change their personalities and behavior when they settle into a new home. IDR+ makes no guarantees based on the information we observe and provide.",

You\u2019ll quickly find that Manny is one of the happiest senior Pitbulls you have ever met in your life. Always a big smile on his face and his tail is forever wagging. He gets his nickname as when he\u2019s walking through the house it\u2019s like a drummer boy walking through as his tail is knocking on walls furnaces refrigerators stoves as he drums his way through! He is dog friendly and loves to muzzle butt kiss others so you have to be careful that dogs he approaches are OK with receiving a muzzle butt kiss. Manny is one of the most resilient seniors we\u2019ve had in our care. Manny is a great eater, gentle when taking food from your hand, loves to receive love and attention, a massage or a hug n a kiss. He is house and crate trained and good in a vehicle. He really is an awesome, easy pup and would love to light up your life! Please contact us to learn more about Manny and/or to set up a meet and greet! No cats please. \n\n",

Gunner will require another dog in the household as he is happiest when he is with other dogs. He wasn't treated well by humans in his previous life so he will need a patient adopter to teach him that not all humans will hurt him. He is very eager to please and learns quickly.\n\nUp to date on vaccinations and flea prevention. Heartworm positive but undergoing treatment provided by his rescue group. To adopt Gunner, please apply at www.hhfrescue.org.The adoption fee includes vaccinations, bordetella, deworming, rabies, spay/neuter, microchip, a lifetime registration of the microchip, and sales tax. If adopting a puppy, the rabies and spay/neuter will be done at the same time by our vet once they are 4 months old and billed to us. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.",

Please read our eligibility requirements and apply on our website: www.ildoberescue.com/adopt.  After an application is submitted, additional inquiries can email dobes@ildoberescue.com.\n\nMojo and Josie Jo are an 8-year-old pair that originally arrived to IDR+ from a shelter in Arkansas. They were recently adopted, but the elderly father later moved in, and he kept tripping over them, so they were reluctantly returned. This beautiful pair of littermates are stuck like glue, and hope to find a home to adopt them together. Mojo and Josie Jo love attention from their people. Both love to get their ears rubbed, and Mojo is learning to enjoy a good massage to help loosen his muscles. He came to us moving very stiffly, and being confined for his heartworm treatment didn\u2019t help. He has since recovered from his treatment and both are ready to go! His mobility is greatly improving now with regular exercise and supplements. He is beginning to run around the yard and stretch his legs! Josie Jo is also on an inexpensive daily supplement to help control very common leaking. They both need to go out often to pee.\n\nBoth dogs are a little shy about changes. They are learning to accept new things and gain more confidence every day, but they are pretty set in their ways. Introductions to new dogs make Josie Jo a little nervous, and Mojo does not seem to appreciate high-energy dogs. They are strongly bonded to each other, and while we will continue to take it slow, they would probably be best placed in a household where they were the only two dogs. If you need a reason to be limited to two dogs, they\u2019re the perfect package deal! They have an unknown history with cats and are recommended for children 12 and over, who are respectful and laid back with large breed dogs. We are not requiring an obedience deposit for this pair; however, we are requiring a fence since they love to lounge around in the sun and take it easy. If you have space for this sweet pair of bonded seniors, it would be incredible to find them a retirement home together.\n\nThe biographical information provided is correct to the best of our knowledge while the animal is in our care or includes what may have been provided by a previous owner. We strive to be honest and accurate, but animals can change their personalities and behavior when they settle into a new home. IDR+ makes no guarantees based on the information we observe and provide.",

Show me some patience and we can probably make this arrangement be one of the best things that ever happened to either of us.  Lisa has assured me that the right person is looking for me.\n\nSo here's the tail of my recent arrival at Blue Lion (the beginning of my life still hurts to think about) ... \n\nMy person has moved and says they can't take me so here I am over at Blue Lion sitting in a big enclosure,  looking out across the prairie and wondering whatever possessed this person I loved and was willing to give my life to protect ... what made them want to move somewhere I can't go ... I\u2019ll never understand it.\n\nOk, so onward and upward, I am a Central Asian Shepherd, 5 years old and serious as a heart attack about my job as the guardian of my person.  For this reason, it really is important that my new person have a love and understanding of guardian breeds and how we think and process info.  Love me and when we bond, I will give you unquestioning personal protection for every day of my life ... right to my last breath.\n\nSo, now you want to know if I like little dogs\u2026  They are ok until they decide to run to me or past me, then they are pretty much a food group. Cats? You probably don\u2019t want to take that chance. Did I mention that I have a tendency not to sugar coat my words?  Oh, maybe Lisa should move this up higher in my bio....  Lisa? \n\nRegarding my interaction with dogs my size and larger ... as long as they don't show aggression to me or my person,  I will tolerate their presence, but you can forget that whole play group/dog park concept.  My person and I don't need any group activities. \n\nI am good on leash and I am respectful of a 6' or higher fence.  I occasionally try to dig if you stick me outside in a yard alone when you leave. I mean, really, how am I supposed to guard the house against burglars? Are you more concerned with your tulips being stolen or do you want to prevent that big beautiful flat screen TV from exiting the building? If you don\u2019t get that concept, you and I are probably not a good match. \n\nOther stuff\u2026I\u2019m spayed, up to date on vaccinations and microchipped. \n\nPlease seriously consider whether you want to make a lifetime commitment to a girl like me and know that I will keep you safe for the rest of my life.  Look over Lisa's adoption application and consider whether you have it takes to be a guardian's guardian.  We are a pretty selective group and Lisa is going to be very picky. \n\n",

            "description": "Bennie is an adorable & friendly senior Beagle mix who is 8+ years old and weighs 51 lbs.  Here's what his foster mom has to say about this charming little dude ...\n\nAre you looking for a constant companion?  This 8+ year old gentleman is the dog for you!  Bennie is truly one fantastic dog!  In addition to being housebroken and crate-trained, he is calm, well-mannered, and adapts well to a routine.  He follows you from room to room, spot to spot.  He enjoys sitting on the couch with you, and in the bed if you'll let him.  He loves to go for walks, but hold on tight because when his beagle nose catches the scent of a woodland creature, he is on it!  He also has a tendency to bark at passing cars. Bennie enjoys plush squeak toys, but expect them to end up in small pieces.  He also enjoys antlers, they last much longer.  Bennie is good in the bath, and the car, but likes to be up front with you unless you have a car gate.  He gets along well people & dogs (he's a little too interested in cats for his own good) and is looking for a family that is home most of the time, or able to take him with them.  He also feels most comfortable being left at home with a canine companion .  Pictures do not do this short stack justice, and when he puts his head between his paws and looks up at you with his big brown eyes, you'll feel so lucky to call him yours!\n\nBennie has just finished heartworm treatment so he is slowly increasing his activity level. He is neutered, fully vaccinated & microchipped.\n\nFor more information about Bennie, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org. If you would like to adopt sweet Bennie, please submit an application for him at https://www.barkvilledogrescue.org/applications",

They are a bonded senior pair (6 -7 years old) not only are they siblings, but they also had a litter of puppies together before they came to our rescue. Both dogs lived on a chain their entire lives and their frail bodies and scars tell a story of their own. They both came into our rescue after their owner and all their fur friends passed away. We were very lucky to find a foster home that allowed them to stay together through heart worm treatment and they really enjoyed their female lab, but now it's time for them to find a home of their own. We know it will not be easy, but these dogs are gentle, well mannered and not too big. We are hopeful that there is an older person or family out there who needs them just as much as these kids need you. Our normal adoption fee is $200 per dog, we are considering Jericho and Annie an inseparable pair which means they will be $200 total. They absolutely must stay together. NO CATS. \nTHEY LOVE CHILDREN! very gentle and would make great support pets for young children. they are dog selective but seem to do better with females. heart worms are not contagious but do require that these 2 are on limited restriction in regards to exercise for the next 30 days as well as remain on heart worm prevention for the reminder of their life. Please help us show the world that it's possible to save 2 senior pits and find a good forever home even when all odds are against them. they are the most deserving of all and will not be high maintenance dogs at ALL.",

All of our dogs and puppies have been examined by a veterinarian, de-wormed,  vaccinated, treated for fleas and ticks, spayed or neutered and  tested for heartworms (If 6 months of age and over) and are on monthly heartworm preventative.  Puppies too young to be spayed/neutered require a refundable $50 deposit which will be returned upon proof of spay/neuter.

Petey can be a little hesitant with some handling and would do well with a family that would give him the time to adjust and become comfortable. He would also need a family that would be willing to work with him on training, to help him become the best version of himself. A family with previous dog experience would be helpful. Petey would also like to be the only pet in the home, so that he can have all of your love He would not do well with resident cats or dogs. We would recommend Petey go home to a family with children at least 13 years old. Petey is also very active and would do well with lots of physical activity. He is obsessed with tennis balls and will play all day with you, if you want!\n\nPlease apply for Petey today at www.ThinkingOutsideTheCage.org/Application",

Hes got a lot of energy to burn and craves vigorous daily activity. He is a solid distance runner (right now a consistent 9.5 min/mile pace) and loves long hikes and walks. When he's not being an athlete he spends most of his day napping on his back with his feet sticking straight up in the air like a goofball and quietly playing with his toys.\n\nDallas gets along with other big dogs and could likely play with them for hours. He's friendly with strangers and loves getting attention from them. Hes got a high prey drive and will try to chase small dogs, cats, or wildlife.\n\nDallas is fully housebroken and generally doesn't pull on the leash.\nHe knows his basic \"sit\", \"paw\", and \"lay down\" commands.\nHes a good eater, fetch player, and car ride buddy. He will come over and put his head on your lap when he wants pets. Belly rubs are his favorite. Sometimes he thinks he's a lap dog and wants to lay on top of you. Hes a large snugglebug that will make your every day perfect. He is intelligent, inquisitive, and always strives to be the best boy.\n\nTo adopt Dallas, please fill out an application at EHRdogs.org",

Pitunia is around 3-4 years old, and came to us completely exhausted and emaciated with her eleven (!!) puppies. We helped while she finished raising her puppies, found them all wonderful homes, and gave Pitunia \"Toonia\" some time to rest and relax, and regain her strength and health. We are still treating a very early case of heart worm disease with oral meds, and are hopeful that's all she'll need. She loves walks, still is a little too excited to meet other dogs and will need some help learning how to slowly and calmly meet new friends; loves a comfy bed or crate, is housebroken and a big cuddler!\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nApply at https://bit.ly/codys_adoption_application",

            "description": "Meet Maude! Maude had a rough start in life. She came to us from the Suwannee County hoarding case where over 100 dogs were found in uninhabitable conditions. Prior to her rescue, she did not have any positive experiences with people. She is extremely nervous and will need a patient person who is willing to give her all of the love and time she needs. Because of her nerves, Maude is considered a flight risk and her adopters must have a securely fenced backyard. Maude has lived with other dogs and cats and done well with them all. She finds comfort in the presence of other dogs and needs to live with a well adjusted, friendly dog to show her the way. She will occasionally wrestle with the other dog in her foster home and play with her crinkly chicken toy. Maude also enjoys chewing on her no-hide bones. Her favorite place to be is curled up in a ball on her foster mom's bed- she looks like a little snowball! Although she isn't yet comfortable with direct attention from people she likes to be around people and gets nervous when she cannot see them. Due to this, we think she would do best with a person who stays home most of the time. When left alone, she may be destructive. She is working on establishing the crate as a safe space to prevent her destructive response. To work on her socialization, Maude completes a series of enrichment games, exposure walks, and hand lure sessions with peanut butter every day. Due to her nervous nature, Maude is looking for a quiet home with calm energy and no kids. \nREQUIREMENTS: No kids, fenced backyard, few hours spent alone, and another friendly dog must live in the home\n\nPlease visit our website at faithfulfriendsrescue.org/adoptable-pets if you are interested in adopting.\n\nI am a mixed breed dog. This means I don't have a specific recognizable breed. The rescue uses the following guide which are guesses based on my current size and age for how big I will be when full grown: Mixed Breed (small) up to 25 pounds - Mixed Breed (medium) between 25-45 pounds - Mixed Breed (large) more than 50 pounds. For more information on, please visit the website https://faithfulfriendsrescue.org/adoptable-pets.\n\nWe are setting up adoptions with approved adopters on an appointment basis. We are no longer hosting adoption events at PetSmart until further notice. We are not arranging meet and greets; but appointments to finalize adoptions to limit exposure for all. Our adoptions come with a one week trial period in which if things are not working out, we will refund your adoption fee if you decide to return your newly adopted Faithful Friend. Our adoptions must be done in person and we do not arrange transport to adopters. Our adoption fees vary and we are only able to accept payments by card* at this time but include spay/neuter, heartworm test (dogs), FeLV/FIV test (cats), age appropriate vaccines and deworming, flea, tick and heartworm medication and microchip.",

            "description": "\nWhy Choose Me?\n\n*$150 in sponsorship funds available to rescue group!*\n\nUpdate 10/7: Chance enjoyed a doggie-day-out at Sandy Creek Park and had the best time. Playing fetch and being with a friend was so much fun! An afternoon away from the pound gave Chance an opportunity to show what a great dog he really is. He rode well in the car, practiced good manners, and didn\u2019t bark when other dogs walked by his play yard. He was just curious and interested in what they were doing. Chance was so good, he got to enjoy some ice cream before going back to the pound. What a great day!\n\nUpdate 9/21: I had so much fun with Chance today! He was thrilled to have someone to play with and even happier that I had treats. I used his love for treats to begin working with him on playing fetch. At first, he\u2019d chase a toy and then run with it, but eventually he learned that if he\u2019d bring it back to me, he\u2019d earn a treat. What a great student! Chance is a smart dog, and I bet he could learn other tricks with patience and treats. He already knows how to sit for them. He\u2019s a good boy who just needs someone to take him home and give him a chance!\n\nChance may look like a tough guy, but he\u2019s inside he\u2019s a scared pup still trying to figure out what\u2019s expected of him. Because he was uncertain how to act when he got to the shelter, he spent some time in the back settling into the shelter routine before he was evaluated and, ultimately, moved to the front. \n\nThe trainer who evaluated him says he\u2019s very responsive to voice corrections (something I saw as well\u2013when he was annoyed with the youngsters in the pen next to him, I was able to call him off easily) but because of his uncertainty he\u2019s a better fit with older children and adults than with small kids. He also has a prey drive so he should not be placed with cats. He\u2019s looking for a home that will boost his confidence and show him the world is a friendly place!\n\nTo learn more about Chance or to meet him, please call the shelter at 706-613-3540.\n\nYou can read more about this dog and check out additional photos here: https://athenspets.net/Adoptables/53810-chance/ OR check out our urgent dogs (http://tinyurl.com/Athenspets-FB-URGENT-Dogs) on Facebook!\n\nThis dog is currently at Athens-Clarke County Animal Control, located at 125 Buddy Christian Way, Athens, GA. For the most timely information on hours, location, availability and how to adopt, call the shelter any day from 10am-4pm at 706-613-3540 or go to https://www.athensclarkecounty.com/133/Animal-Control.\n",

We're rooting for you! <3\n\nEdit 2: We finally found a foster home for drifter while he is being treated for his heart worms!\n\nEdit: Drifter has been neutered!! When we got him neutered, the vet had informed us that he unfortunately has heart worms :(\n\nThis handsome guy is Drifter! He is about 4 years old and we suspect an Anatolian / Great Dane mix. He was quite timid when he got to the shelter and after a week, he still keeps his tail tucked and shies away from a friendly pet. He LOVES treats and we think he'll come around but he will need a home that will give him time to open up. We have no idea what kind of situation he came from but no one came forward as his owner. Drifter is now available for adoption so if you want to give comfort to this lonely boy, please give the Trinity County Animal Shelter a call at 530.623.1370 to make an appointment. \n\nThe shelter is currently closed to walk-ins. To view our available animals, please make an appointment. If you would like more information, please call us at 530.623.1370",

            "description": "!!! AVAILABLE for Adoption from Foster Care !!! \n\n\nREX A-64982 \n\n\nPersonality: Here's a medium dog that would love to just cuddle up with you for a movie marathon! Rex loves taking walks around the neighborhood- even five year olds have to keep their body in shape! He's shy at first, but it only takes a tiny bit of effort, a good home, and a few treats, for him to show how loving he can be! \n\nIntake Type: Stray \n\nWeight: 52 lbs \n\nMedical Observations:\n(2/21) Patient appears healthy, asides from being underweight and having a low grade heart murmur. Heart murmur does not preclude surgery at the shelter, however recommend adoption with medical waiver indicating heart murmur presence. \n\nBehavior Observations:\n(3/6) Volunteer Note -- Leash biting onsite. He doesn't go up the leash but does do that hard tug as he flips his head back and forth. Once we got moving, he dropped the leash and began walking. For the remainder of our walk he would periodically grab the leash and begin to leash bite, before dropping it voluntarily and continuing to walk. He did this several times, the episodes only lasted 10-15 seconds. So he's not a consistent leash biter but when he is doing it, he tugs hard and puts his weight into it. Returning to kennel he became a bit reactive to passing dogs as we walked through the kennels. No issues returning to kennel.\n(2/28) Short Term foster -- Rex is a very sweet and gentle dog. He was shy at first, but showed improvement each day by coming out of his shell when he was with me.\n(2/21) Lifesaving -- Slight hesitation but overall easy to loop. Distracted going back in but no real issues. Pulls on leash and would do best harnessed, but manageable if not. Aroused but allows all over handling. Will come to handler for more pets when stopped. Engages in tag/chase games followed by LOTS of zoomies! Will jump on handler gently. No interest in toys at this time. Suggested Running Team. Evaluated Gold.\n(2/21) Per Vet Staff -- Friendly\n(2/18) Per Finder -- Friendly, well mannered, sweet \n\n\nThis animal is currently available from foster care through ACCT Philly's Adoptions Programs. This animal is not onsite. If the foster has not listed a personal email, contact foster@acctphilly.org to be put in touch with the foster. \n\nWe encourage you to visit our shelter during our adoption hours to view our complete selection of available animals. In preparation for your visit, please make sure to visit http://www.acctphilly.org/adopt/ to review our adoption requirements, hours of operation, upcoming events, and more! \n\nIs this your missing pet? If you believe so, please make sure to follow the instructions listed at http://www.acctphilly.org/lostpet/ so that we can make sure that you are reunited as soon as possible!",

AVAILABLE for Adoption from Foster Care !!! \n\n\nGLINDA - A#42130953 \n\nFoster's Email: frankferra@gmail.com \n\n\nPictures and Video:\nGlinda in foster care - https://photos.app.goo.gl/k5rWxZSiyvsoyEHZ7 \n\nDog meet: \nhttps://youtu.be/u7EzA47nZsQ \n\nPersonality: Glinda is a sweet and gentle soul. She is approximately 7 years old with a lot puppy energy left in her and would thrive in a household that could give her lots of attention. She loves to be goofy in the yard entertaining herself with the ball, rag doll, or bone and adores to cuddle on the couch with you to watch a movie or read a book. Did I mention she enjoys to give kisses in the most gentle manner? And of course, those belly rubs....what dog doesn't enjoy those? \n\nGlinda has some quirks, like us all. I do notice she has a huge prey drive...which means she chases birds that happen to be flying by (yes, even 300 yards in the sky, lol), squirrels, and she is not a fan of moving cars. Although, during the past few walks, she seems to be getting desensitized....which is great! She does not enjoy car rides. We plan to experiment with soft crates in the car to see how she reacts to them. \n\nGlinda is crate trained and obeys some commands. Her recall is actually pretty good too. She will eat any food you give her - she is not picky at all! She recently had bloodwork and a urine analysis which both came back clean. She is currently on Heartguard and Simparica (flea & tick). She is up to date on all her shots. If it were not for our resident dog being a bit too territorial, we would have kept Glinda. If you have any questions about Glinda, feel free to email me directly at frankferra@gmail.com. \n\nIntake Type: (7/5) Stray \n\nWeight: 55 lbs \n\n\nThis animal is currently available from foster care through ACCT Philly's Adoptions Programs.

She isn\u2019t mean to them, she\u2019s just too active for most of them.\nGood with Kids:  Yes\n\nRosie is a sweet girl that was thrown away like trash in a rural part of the county without animal control. She was completely bald when we first got her and terribly underweight. Now though, Rosie has blossomed into the beautiful girl we knew she was. Her hair is back, and her personality is really shining through- and it\u2019s a wonderful one. Rosie is happy about life, ready to play, loves to party and play with her tennis balls. Rosie is a great girl that would make an excellent family companion.\n\n----\nPeach County Animal Rescue is a rescue located in Fort Valley, GA. Our adoption fees range from $250-350+. Although our rescue dogs share a common bond with one another, no rescue story is the same (even when similar). Vetting costs vary depending on their health conditions. All of our dogs are fully vetted: up-to-date on annual shots, spayed/neutered and microchipped with a lifetime registration. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nIf you would like to send in an application for this dog, please use the link below! https://peachcountyanimalrescueandrehabilitation.org/apply-now-2/",

Milly came to our rescue after being dumped unceremoniously and without explanation out of a car on a dirt road along with another dog in our care, and left for dead. Despite this, Milly is a very sweet, mellow, funny house-hippo that loves people. She is a delightful girl that makes the best snuffle and snorting sounds, and likes to snuggle! Milly would be a fantastic family dog.\n\n----\nPeach County Animal Rescue is a rescue located in Fort Valley, GA. Our adoption fees range from $250-350+. Although our rescue dogs share a common bond with one another, no rescue story is the same (even when similar). Vetting costs vary depending on their health conditions. All of our dogs are fully vetted: up-to-date on annual shots, spayed/neutered and microchipped with a lifetime registration. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nIf you would like to send in an application for this dog, please use the link below! https://peachcountyanimalrescueandrehabilitation.org/apply-now-2/",

Russell is active, curious, and always ready to go do something. He has not been around cats or children much. Due to his energy level, he would do best in a home without cats and young children. He has mixed feelings about other dogs. Sometimes he can play too rough for other dog's comfort and it is not a good fit.\n \nRussell is a good boy that would love to go and do things with his human and keep up his love for an active lifestyle.

They are about 1 to1.5 years old and have been together since birth. They are looking for their new furever home together to continue their story. Although timid at first, they are very sweet and affectionate when they feel comfortable. All these sisters are looking for is to be snuggled and loved! Tootsie even has a little heart shape on her side;  if that doesn\u2019t show how loving she is, we don't know what will!\n\nTootsie and Tansey were surrendered by their owner who wasn\u2019t able to provide them a safe, loving living environment. They may have had a rough start, with their previous owner not treating them well BUT since being at STARS they have been showered with love and affection. Will you continue to show these two, sweet sisters the love they deserve?\n\nClick on www.starsrescue.org to complete an application to be pre-approved to adopt this pup. As you can imagine, we get a lot of interest in our rescues and kindly ask that you are patient with us while we review applications as it may take a few days.We will contact you regarding your application, during which you can ask more questions about this specific pup. If pre-approved we will coordinate a date for meet and greet.\n\nOur adoption fee is $500 each. This includes spay/neuter, microchipping, deworming, and all age-appropriate vaccinations.\n",

Akira, has so much potential, and with the right fit of a family, she is going to grow into a great companion.   At her last rescue Akira was in a 6 dog play group.  She seems to be a little more selective with her friends at MAS.  She did not do well on her cat intro, so could not go to a home with cats.  Older children would be best for her as well due to her energy level. \n\nMYM Canine-ality color is: Orange Busy Bee!!\nFor safety's sake, we are looking for homes with physical fenced in areas.\nPlease fill out our online adoption application and survey at www.mackenzies.info",

Yes believe it or not.. our mommy was a pitbull and daddy was a dachshund! We're about 26 lbs each of PURE SUGAR & SPICE!!  We're sweet and friendly, happy go lucky and fun loving clowns!.  We're very playful, active & love to wrestle with each other and do zoomies in the yard. We're not walked so much because we have the yard so we would definitely need leash training.. but we are crate trained and house trained. We are good with the dogs that we live with but have not met alot of other dogs outside of our pack, so we bark at new dogs and would need \"socialization\" training. We do like to bark when we hear noises or folks knocking at the door or if begging for treats!!. We don't like cats so NO CATS for us!. We are fine with kids as long as they are older ages 10 yrs+. We are too strong for younger kids and would definitely knock them over. Our ideal home would be with someone/couple or family (with older kids) that have a fenced in yard (apt in city is NOT good for us) and is active i.e runner, biker, hiker, rollerblader .. because we are very active dogs and need hoomans that can keep up with us and are willing to give us the daily structured exercise and discipline we need. We're still young and very quick to learn, eager to please and are sure to give you lots of \"sh*ts & giggles\"! We're a dynamic duo and are BFFs and cannot be split up!! If you want a pair of Silly, Happy Goofballs... pls come meet us today!\n\nFor more info/application - pls email: INFO@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG",

            "description": "Roscoe was brought to the Galveston shelter by his owner who asked to have him euthanized.  Thankfully, the shelter saw how much life Roscoe still has in him and reached out to see if a rescue would take him, which we did.  He was flown to us in Dallas, TX via pilots n paws.  Unfortunately, Roscoe had been SEVERELY neglected for a long time.  Something happened to him a long time ago and medical intervention was not sought in time.  Now Roscoe is paralyzed forever.  When we got him, he was in AWFUL shape.  Filthy...  he\u2019d been laying in his own feces and urine for a LONG time.  He had urine burns all over his legs and belly and oozing sores, his nails were so long and his teeth were in dreadful shape, we took him to a neurologist who found that he can\u2019t move or feel his right leg, tail or the outside digits and flexor muscles of his left pelvic limb.  He can feel the inside digits.  He may even have some voluntary movement of the flexors of his hip.  However, because he can\u2019t bear weight effectively in the limb, he's unable to use it to walk on three legs.  There are numerous possible causes of his paralysis.  Regardless of the underlying cause, because of the severity of his spinal cord disease (he can\u2019t feel his feet) as well as the chronicity, there is no treatment for any neurologic improvement.  He will remain a paralyzed dog for the rest of his life.  The good news is that Roscoe has a wheelchair, which he's a natural at using.  While we can\u2019t know his long-term prognosis for sure, it\u2019s entirely possible that Roscoe will live for many more years as a happy handicapped dog.  He\u2019s full of energy, has a lot of great spirit and a gregarious nature.  Roscoe doesn\u2019t have bladder or bowel control so his bladder needs to be expressed a few times/day.  It\u2019s not difficult, in return for caring for him, he will reward you with SO much love and devotion and make you smile, he loves to go on walks and get attention from everyone, and he just wants to be part of the action.  He\u2019s feisty, affectionate, cheerful, playful, sensitive, gentle, intelligent, active, alert, faithful, and incredibly sweet.  Please give Roscoe the loving forever home he deserves.  You can meet him at the Plano PetSmart, 6204 West Park Boulevard, Saturdays and Sundays from 1-5.  You can make a donation on our website, https://www.poochsavers.com/donate/, thank you and PS, Roscoe\u2019s adoption fee is reduced thanks to a grant from The Petfinder Foundation",

            "special_needs_notes": "Roscoe was brought to the Galveston shelter by his owner who asked to have him euthanized.  Thankfully, the shelter saw how much life Roscoe still has in him and reached out to see if a rescue would take him, which we did.  He was flown to us in Dallas, TX via pilots n paws.  Unfortunately, Roscoe had been SEVERELY neglected for a long time.  Something happened to him a long time ago and medical intervention was not sought in time.  Now Roscoe is paralyzed forever.  When we got him, he was in AWFUL shape.  Filthy...  he\u2019d been laying in his own feces and urine for a LONG time.  He had urine burns all over his legs and belly and oozing sores, his nails were so long and his teeth were in dreadful shape, we took him to a neurologist who found that he can\u2019t move or feel his right leg, tail or the outside digits and flexor muscles of his left pelvic limb.  He can feel the inside digits.  He may even have some voluntary movement of the flexors of his hip.  However, because he can\u2019t bear weight effectively in the limb, he's unable to use it to walk on three legs.  There are numerous possible causes of his paralysis.  Regardless of the underlying cause, because of the severity of his spinal cord disease (he can\u2019t feel his feet) as well as the chronicity, there is no treatment for any neurologic improvement.  He will remain a paralyzed dog for the rest of his life.  The good news is that Roscoe has a wheelchair, which he's a natural at using.  While we can\u2019t know his long-term prognosis for sure, it\u2019s entirely possible that Roscoe will live for many more years as a happy handicapped dog.  He\u2019s full of energy, has a lot of great spirit and a gregarious nature.  Roscoe doesn\u2019t have bladder or bowel control so his bladder needs to be expressed a few times/day.  It\u2019s not difficult, in return for caring for him, he will reward you with SO much love and devotion and make you smile, he loves to go on walks and get attention from everyone, and he just wants to be part of the action.  He\u2019s feisty, affectionate, cheerful, playful, sensitive, gentle, intelligent, active, alert, faithful, and incredibly sweet.  Please give Roscoe the loving forever home he deserves.  You can meet him at the Plano PetSmart, 6204 West Park Boulevard, Saturdays and Sundays from 1-5.  You can make a donation on our website, https://www.poochsavers.com/donate/, thank you and PS, Roscoe\u2019s adoption fee is reduced thanks to a grant from The Petfinder Foundation",

Do you think so?\n\nI\u2019m not sure where I got my name. Maybe I\u2019m named after Bubba Watson? Although, I don\u2019t golf. Or Bubba Wallace? But, like most dogs, I can\u2019t drive.  Or Bubba Starling? I like to play ball, but my batting skills are lacking without opposable thumbs. Or Bubba Gump? But I don\u2019t know much about the shrimping business. Maybe I could be called Bubba-licious? Frankly, I just want you to call me yours!\n\nI don\u2019t want to toot my own horn, but I\u2019m a pretty sweet guy. I seem to love all people, big and small. And I\u2019m so eager to please!  I want to be your one and only dog, but I promise, I\u2019m all you need!  I have so much love to give all humans.\n\nOn a perfect day, I would spend some time running, rolling in the grass, lounging in the grass, and sitting for some yummy treats. I really like cheese. That stuff is good! (Unless you want to get really fancy with rotisserie chicken. I won\u2019t complain!)  My nub tail really wiggles so fast when I get to do those things. It also wags so fast if you talk silly to me. Humans are so funny with their silly talk, but I love it. I also love to play with stuffies and rope toys\u2014I run and place them where I think they belong in the yard.\n\nBetween you and me, I\u2019ve been bounced around quite a bit, so I really want my next home to be my forever. That\u2019s what I dream about at night. And well, frankly, also during the day! (We dogs can take some naps you know!) Are you my dream come true?\n\nCall or text The Pet Connection at 913-671-7387 for more info on Bubba. He's neutered and up to date on vaccines and is hanging out with us in the Kansas City metro. But transport is available to the right home.\n\n\nINTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS PET? Fill out an Adoption Application now!

From being one of 29 dogs chained up in the country, not very socialized, and with no idea how indoor pet living was to loving the couch, jumping up on the door and ready to bust through just to get inside if there's just a slight rumble of thunder, and finally playing with other dogs and toys. Once she decided she wanted to play fetch, she has done wonderful with it. I will throw it and she will get it and bring it back to me. Still not one peep from her. No bark, no whine, or anything. Look at that happy girl! We would like Tootsy to have a fenced in backyard and you can see she enjoys other dogs, is house and crate trained and does well with children.

Could that be you?\n\nTia is a timid girl who needs someone to build her up so she can be her very best! \n\nTia has lived with other dogs, but can be selective about her doggy friends, so she'd like to get to know them at her own pace. She's also been around kitties, and is curious about them as well! \n\nBecause of her timid nature she would be best in a home without kids. \n\nThis girl would LOVE a fenced back yard, and is probably not suited for apartment living due to all the hustle and bustle.\n\nShe'd love a low-traffic home where she can really get comfortable.\n\nTia is spayed and up to date on shots. She's located in the KC metro but transportation is available to the right home! \n\nShe is available for a no-cost adoption with an encouraged donation.\n\nFor more info on Tia, please contact The Pet Connection by call or text, 913-671-7387.\n\nINTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS PET? Fill out an Adoption Application now! Appointments can also be made to meet a pet by calling us at 913-671-PETS (913-671-7387).  \n\nADOPTION INFORMATION:\nPrior to adoption, our animals are: \n**Tested for diseases \n**Vaccinated \n**Spayed/neutered \n**Microchipped \n\nNO COST adoptions with an encouraged donation are accepted. \n\nThe Pet Connection also offers adopters a FREE veterinary examination and a medical care support plan for 60 days after adoption, as well as lifetime behavioral training, safe sanctuary for pets returned in emergency situations, extensive assistance with lost and found pets, and other expert pet services in a variety of areas, including pet selection, behavioral issues, general training, nutrition, and transition to adoptive homes.\n\nPlease visit our website at www.thepetconnection.org for more information about The Pet Connection and for a full listing of our available pets, \n\nCall or text The Pet Connection at 913-671-7387 if you can foster, adopt, or sponsor a special needs dog or cat! \n\nThe Pet Connection is a membership organization operating a no-kill adoption center in Shawnee Mission, Kansas. \n\n",

While in his home he liked to be in the house and to sleep in his familys bed. He thinks he is a tiny lap dog but really he weighs 84 pounds ! Jamal lived with another dog, and his owner said he should be given time to meet new dog buddies before he lives with them because he can be defensive at first. Jamal has not lived with cats, but he did live with children in the age range of 4 to 13. When asked how he did with house training, the owner said he was so so and would go to the door. Jamal can jump a fence. DOB 3/24/15......All pets have lifetime sanctuary at Haven of the Ozarks. If they cannot remain with their adopter, they must be returned to the Haven.\n\nAdoption fees are as follows: \nPuppies under the age of 6 months - $125\nDogs weighing 30 pounds and less - $125 \nDogs ages 6 months to 5 yrs old - $90\nDogs over the age of 5 yrs old - $75.\nCats under the age of 6 months old - $75\nCats over the age of 6 months old - $65",

            "description": "Rufus T. is a handsome, affectionate 10-year-old male German Shepherd Dog (GSD) who was left at a shelter in Southern California because his family felt that they could no longer provide care for him. Rufus is suffering from severe hip dysplasia and spondylosis. As a result, Rufus loses control of his hind legs when walking or running. This is particularly true when he is excited. He is an enthusiastic dog who loves people and is very active despite his disability. He is well mannered, loves attention and is very food motivated. TSGSR brought Rufus into their care and he is quickly adapting to his new surroundings. Rufus appears to have been very well loved. He is housetrained, walks on leash and gets along with other dogs.\n\nRufus T. Summary:\n- Rufus is a Male, 10 yrs old, weighs 81 lbs, current on shots excluding rabies\n- Good with Adults, dogs, and travel in the car\n\nRufus is a wonderful, sweet dog who really wants to engage his human! He has received care for his ears and skin and will be visiting the TSGSR veterinarian for additional medical evaluation to assess the damage to his hips. The vet determined that his hip issues will continue to progress. Rufus is very interested in everything around him and has adapted to his disability. He accepts help getting into cars, rides well in the car and makes great eye contact . He is in need of a loving home with a family that can love him despite his disability.\n\nRufus passed a set of behavior tests before being accepted into the TSGSR. The tests are not intended to assess how smart the dog is but are important for TSGSR to determine if the dog is expected to be safe in a family home. The tested behaviors check to see if the dog will guard or protect food or toys from people, will tolerate handling all over its body (including ears, nose, lips to check teeth, lifting paws, belly, back, and gently pulling the tail) and the ability to get along with other well behaved dogs. Rufus remained calm during all of these tests and showed no aggressive tendencies. \n\nPlease join us in welcoming sweet Rufus to TSGSR! Rufus is a hospice/adopt dog because of his progressing hip issues.\n\nWhat's Next for Rufus T.:\nThulani Senior German Shepherd Rescue (TSGSR) will continue to see that Rufus is well cared for and receives all medical care needed for his well being while in our care. In addition, TSGSR is beginning a search for an adoptive home that will care for him for the rest of his life. Rufus will come to his new home with a supply of food, a cushy pad if wanted, and other goodies such as toys. \n\nTSGSR will provide limited coverge of Rufus' medical expenses for the rest of his life.\n\nIf you want to learn more about him, or are possibly interested in providing an adoptive or foster home, please send us a message by clicking on the \"Ask About Me\" button. We will often get feedback or \"updates\" from a dog's foster home and as any updates become available they will be included here.\n\nIf you are reading about Rufus on Petfinder.com sometimes an available YouTube video is not listed. If this occurs you can still view the video by pasting its URL into a new browser window or tab.\nAvailable Video URL(s): https://youtu.be/XjI_EFoiDCg\n\n\nSaving one dog wont change the world. It will change the world for that one dog.",

Some of her favorite things are cuddles, walks, and running out her zoomies. Polly loves hugs and is SUCH a mush. She would love a yard so she can run free and roll around in the grass. Polly would love another dog to pal around with and loves everyone she meets - preferably someone bigger than her. She has yet to be introduced to kids or cats, but with her loving and adaptive personality, they would likely soon be best friends. Polly would be an incredible addition to any home. Shes truly special and someone will be very lucky to welcome her into their lives. \n \n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

In her foster home she's free to roam doing great without a crate. Although she doesn't know a lot of commands, she's happy to learn with a little patience. When it comes to others, Geri has a total soft spot for her people. She prefers to be the only animal friend in the home, though. Her people are her world and she loves to hop on the couch to cuddle with you, if you invite her to join. Her walks are also dear to her...she'll talk to you and let you know if you've forgotten about one. The vocalness will crack you up. Geri's ideal home would be quiet and low traffic, where she's the center of your animal world. Her docile and loving attitude are endearing and she deserves a home that needs a Netflix buddy.

Great! We have an adoption process that tries to ensure that our LLR animals have found their forever home. Adopting from LLR isn\u2019t the fastest process. We do not have a paid staff and rely on volunteers-for everything. From animal care, and veterinary appointments to checking emails, answering phone calls and scheduling all meet n greets! Please be patient with us, animals come first around here. We are not in a rush to place any of the animals in LLR. All of our animals live in foster homes comfortably which means that we can take our time to find the best possible home for each animal in our care. \n\nTo learn more about the Little Lotus adoption process, please go to:\nhttps://littlelotusrescueandsanctuary.org/adoption-process/\n\nFor an application to meet this pet, please go to:https://littlelotusrescueandsanctuary.org/adoption-application/\n\nBeing fostered in Sierra Vista, AZ.

He has spent the last few months in his foster home learning how to be a real dog! Despite having spent most of his life outside, he has learned that he loves being an inside dog. Ozzy absolutely loves playing with his doggy friends (although he needs some time to get to know them so he's comfortable) and is learning that toys are pretty great. He is still learning how to trust humans, but has come a very long way since he came to his foster home. He gets nervous and tries to hide when he sees hands reaching for him but he loves being petted when he is in a place where he feels comfortable.\nOzzy has made good progress on leash training, but is still a little nervoys on a leash. He would like to have a fenced yard. We would prefer that he go to a home with another dog so he can learn from them and they can help reinforce that humans are good. Ozzy is mostly housetrained and crate trained (although he has not been staying in a crate lately in his foster home). He would do best in a home with no young children. He would probably spend most of his time trying to hide from them since they won't know to take it slow with him.Ozzy is not a super 'cuddly' dog, but he enjoys spending time around his foster parents and will make a wonderful companion for the right family.",

            "description": "Cammie is 3 years and 60lbs. She came to us on 8/22 from a neighboring county pound.\n\nMy name is Cammie, I'm only 3 years old, but I've already lived a lifetime. I am heartworm positive and a tripod due to severe arthritis from an old untreated injury. I won't go into details about my life so far, but I will share some highlights. I wandered my neighborhood as a stray until they finally took me to my local pound. I was scared and confused, so I made sure I scared everyone away from my kennel while I gathered my thoughts. One of the ladies from FCHS wouldnt leave me alone though and one day she let me come out. I was so excited, I wasnt sure where to go first, but one of my legs hurt so I picked it up to keep it from slowing me down. Even though i was happy to be out of my kennel, she still made me a little uncomfortable and i let her know. She brought me back with her and now I not only have a love for her, but several of the employees at FCHS. I've realized not all people are bad and the same goes for dogs too, but I'm still very uncomfortable at first. I'm sure many of you have seen me barking and growling in my kennels. That's my fear talking, so I need someone willing to turn away from me and let me interact with them before they interact with me. I need someone who understands that I will become more and more loving as time goes on. I just want to be with you, go for walks, lay in your lap, chase a ball that I may or may not bring back. There are so many things for me to enjoy and I just need a confident person familiar with my dog breed to help me do just that. I love car rides, just make sure I'm strapped in or I may want to be in your lap. I also bark at people when in the car and may always bark at people when behind a barrier because I'm so uncertain. I dont want that to stop you from coming to see me, I know it's something I need to work on, and I'm hoping you can help me do just that. I have shown an interest in playing with dogs and met a few, but I'm a bit of a noisy player, so I'm trying to get more comfortable here so I can make a friend or two confidently. My amputation has also stopped me from making a friend so far, because I have to let it heal. Life is hard, but companionship makes it better. Want to be my companion? I cant wait to be yours.\n\nInquiries: adoptions@plannedpethoodrockymount.com\nAdoption Application Link: https://www.plannedpethoodrockymount.com/adoptions\n\nClick here to view our general adoption fees.

As you can see by my professional photo shoot, I am mostly white in color with chocolate brown \"accents\".\n\nLet me enlighten you about my many attributes. I am a very sociable girl with both dogs and people. I am also wonderful with older kids. I am house and crate trained and good on a leash. I do love to cuddle, chill on the couch, and I am a very loyal companion. Don't I sound just perfect? I do get very excited when meeting new people. However, I calm down very quickly.\n\nIf you think I would be a good fit for your family, all you need to do is contact my foster mommy. All the information you need can be found below. Thank you for reading all about me!\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal. However, we have many wonderful homeless pets available.",

We do not know what the situation was  at home that caused this  but he has been very sweet in the shelter. Niko is playful, good on leash, sits when told and takes treats gently. It is said that he is house trained. Niko has also tested well with all other dogs in the shelter. Due to the situation with the child it is recommended that Niko be in a home with no small children.  Niko is current on vaccines, neutered, heartworm tested negative and micro-chipped. You will find him waiting in run 858 and his ID# is 624910.\n\nNiko meets Kobe - https://youtu.be/ftwaG_owpsM\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend.

            "description": "Adoption Fee: $400\nFostered in Longview, Texas\nAge: 5 years\nWeight: 4.7 lbs.\n\n9/28/20 - Daisy Lynn is settling in to her foster home quit nicely.  She has graduated to the big bed with her humans and she LOVES it.   She is eating good and we are pleased as she needs to gain a little.  She will have accidents sometimes, but will always go when brought outside.  When her foster mom has to go out, she will leave her in an area with a potty pad and she seems to find it and use it.  Smarty pants!  She rides ok, but does want to be near her person.  We were letting her get comfortable, but will be setting up her vet appointment for her necessary shots, etc.\n\n9/18/20 - Daisy Lynn loves people.  She loves to be held and loved on and kissed.  She gets attached to her people/person very fast.  She is eating very good.  She does bump into things, but we feel that once settled and learns her way of a house, it will get much better.  Even though she is good around other dogs, since she is blind, she does not like sniffs of the butt or another dog coming up to her quickly.  For now, and this could change with time, we think she would be best in a home with laid back senior dogs, or possibly just cats, or an only dog.  Just somewhere that isn't too active.  As we learn more, we will update.\n\n9/16/20 - Daisy Lynn and her foster mom left the Veterinary Eye Institute in Dallas, Tx around 8:30.  We will be getting a formal report tomorrow and will be in a better position to give a more accurate update, but the short summary is that Daisy Lynn's right eye had an ulcer that ruptured previously.  It has already tried to protect/heal itself and scarred over.  She is not squinting, blinking or trying to avoid light, so they do not believe this eye is uncomfortable at this point.\n\nHer left eye, the one that we referred to as bulging, has a mature cataract and glaucoma.  The doctor said that her pressure in that eye is lower than normal, so there is no scare there of doggy migraines or pain.   \n\nAt this point, we can discontinue the eye medicine that was originally prescribed for the other group and our doctor is starting her on Ketorolac to be administered to both eyes twice daily just to help with any inflammation.\n\nThere isn't a surgery that will help her, she is totally blind in both eyes, but she isn't in any pain and he feels she is quite used to her situation.  We are sure that at some point both eyes truly hurt her and that is sad to think about, so we will focus on the present and just give her all the love and attention she can stand.  We had hoped that there would be something that could help her see, but at least she isn't in pain and is probably already used to her blindness.\n\nWe will update personality after we have had about a week to see her true colors come out.  Thank you to everyone who prayed and everyone who donated.  She won't arrive home until about 10:30 tonight and then will be ready to curl up for a long night's sleep.  \n \n9/16/20 - Daisy Lynn was picked up stray and brought to a shelter in Shreveport, Louisiana.  They knew right away that she needed to be out of the shelter and in a rescue group, so they reached out Carley's Angels, Senior Sanctuary and Hospice who immediately picked her up.  They got her cleaned up and then could really tell the extent of her eye problems.  She has an ulcerated right eye and her left eye is bulging.  Knowing that they would not be able to get the medical attention this little girl needed, they quickly reached out to Yorkie Haven Rescue and one of our foster homes left almost as soon as she got the call.  We are in the process of getting the vet in Shreveport to send over a referral to the eye specialist in Plano, Tx and schedule an appointment as soon as we can get it.\n\nWe are not sure exactly what we are going to be looking at in terms of if she can have surgery and save 1 or both of her eyes or if she is even a candidate, but we do know that we have to do everything we can to give this young girl the comfort and eyes she should have.  The ones she had before whatever happened to them took place.\n\nWe do not know much about her currently in terms of personality right now since foster mom just picked her up tonight, but as soon as she is more comfortable and we can access her, we will update.  Right now, all we are focusing on is getting this appointment set and seeing if we can shed new light on this baby's eyes.  \n\nWe don't even have an estimate right now, but donations would be greatly appreciated.  We know that they way things are right now, not everyone can donate, but please pray for Daisy Lynn as prayers are just as important.\n\nThank you.\n",

She loves ear rubs and has no problems nudging you for more. Will go to her kennel upon request. Likes to go outside in the yard to explore, but prefers company until she's comfortable. Learning sit and leash walk.  Not recommended for a home with small children.  **You must submit an application via our website, www.saveunderdogs.com, if you have questions or are interested in this dog. we cannot respond to phone calls, texts or Petfinder inquiries**",
