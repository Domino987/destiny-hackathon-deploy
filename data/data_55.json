She's trying to sleep and its waking her up. Shhh! ! Don't tell her it's her. No one told this girl about a decompression period. She's made herself right at home with her new foster!\n\nGumdrop is a 3 year old heartworm negative female. She is one of the happiest dogs her foster Mom has met in a long time, despite obvious signs of past abuse. She loves meeting new people of all sizes and is very gentle with kids. She is housebroken and crate trained, walks on a leash like a champ and rides in the car like a proper lady! She is looking for a nice warm home full of love and belly rubs. She loves cuddling and taking couch naps. She is lower energy and greatly enjoys laying next to someone.\n\nGumdrop has visible hip dysplasia of the right hip and will undergo surgical correction in the next few weeks.\n\nShe does have great range of motion and mobility spite\nhow bad her hip looks.\nShe enjoys running in the yard, does stairs well, jumps up on the sofa just fine. But she is definitely in pain. When you touch that hip she turns into it and bumps your hand away. Even the lightest touch makes her wince. She's been started on some medications for pain and we anticipate a successful surgery.\n\nShe does well with all the resident dogs little and big and has meet some cats she likes.\n\nIf you are an approved adopter and are interested in this dog, please let your case worker know. If you are not yet an approved adopter but are interested, please complete an adoption application!\nYou can review our adoption process, www.shenandoahrescue.org/adoption-process if interested. Donations can be made at shenandoahrescue.org/donate or on PayPal to info@shenandoahrescue.org",

He has reportedly done well around children of all ages and is housebroken. He's found himself at PACC once again through no fault of his own, so is hoping to spend as little time at the shelter as possible. Samson is an energetic boy who did well meeting other dogs in PACC playgroup. He was appropriate and tolerant with greetings and was very social. He initiated and engaged in play with the other dogs, and can be a rowdy, rough and tumble player at times. Samson would like to meet any resident dogs before heading home together to make sure it's a good fit. Come meet Samson today!",

Yes Details on training: Apache is very well-trained and obedient. He is fully crate trained and he sits very well. He sits when he waits for food, to be leashed up, and upon command. Affection level: Apache is VERY affectionate! He definitely takes comfort in staying near his people. He loves to snuggle and cuddle and will lean into you and fall directly into your lap. He's a 65-pound lap dog! Play behavior: Apache is so fun and loves to play with his toys! He loves all toys but especially Kongs and tennis balls. He is very playful and will play bow and wag his tail often when playing with you. He loves playing fetch! Apache LOVES water - more than any dog I've ever known! He is happiest when playing with/in water. Activity level: Very active! He has lots of energy and a fun-loving spirit. He also knows when to relax if you're busy and will snooze on the couch! Best adjectives to describe him: Adorable, loyal, sweet, affectionate, gentle, active, fun-loving, happy, obedient, well-trained.",

She will be available for adoption by the end of the month.  Check out her new pictures!\n\nhttps://gofundme.com/f/ethels-surgery-fund?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cf+share=flow-1\n\nAdopt ETHEL our SWEET SENIOR!  She is an absolute MUSH!  More details below.\n\n **During the current health situation**\n\nIf you are interested in ADOPTING from the EDISON ANIMAL SHELTER, please email the shelter manager, Becky Snyder at rsnyder@edisonnj.org and she will send you an application to fill out and discuss potentially setting up a meeting. The subject of the email should be \"Adoption - Pet's Name\". Thank you. Be safe and stay healthy.\n\nADOPT ME!  Say hello to ETHEL our SWEET, GENTLE senior Labrador Retriever mix!  She is about 10 years old and such a FRIENDLY DOLL BABY.  She is such a MUSH who loves attention and affection.  She is so happy and likes to play with toys. She likes to play fetch and tries her best to get the ball back to you (she has so much determination).  And, she loves car rides!\n\nShe came in as a stray and was very underweight with a large tumor on her neck. She had surgery and the tumor was removed successfully. She has been getting extra TLC in her foster home, and she is doing really well.  Please consider giving this sweet girl a chance to live out her golden years in a comfy home.\n\nAll of our shelter dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, microchipped and up to date on their vaccinations prior to adoption. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet, please visit us at the EDISON ANIMAL SHELTER, 125 Municipal Blvd., Edison, NJ 08817.

            "description": "Dasher (Dash) is a 10 month-old Yellow Labrador mix who came to us after being found in South Carolina.  This handsome boy is neutered and chipped.\n\nDash is a great young dog who will make a fantastic, loyal and loving addition for a lucky family!  He learns quickly, having already mastered \"Sit\" and \"Down\" and is working on \"Stay\".  He responds to his name and to the command \"No\".  He is crate trained at night and does a good job when left alone for short periods during the day.  He hasn't been left alone for any longer periods during his stay so far.  He is learning not to jump on his Foster Mom but hasn't had any issues with jumping on other family members or guests.\n\nHe loves a good treat, squeaky toys and bones. The resident 6 year-old and 12 year-old humans refer to him as \"sweet\" and that he \"loves belly rubs\".  He does very well with children and has not had any issues with them. He loves them so much.\n\nHe is currently staying with two resident dogs; a 7 year-old female Yellow Lab and a 2 year-old male Black Lab mix.  Dash likes to tussle with the male resident dog as he is familiar with our young dog.  We have had some meet and greets with other dogs and Dash does not have the best doggie manners yet. So we feel it would be best if Dash was an only dog.\n\nAfter running around, playing with his toys or wrestling he is very happy to curl up next to someone and take a long nap.  \n\nDash would benefit from an active family or fenced yard with space for him to run and explore.  Over the last month he's developed quite a sweet and loving personality so we're sure he'll do great at a new home with the right family!\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  While this Lab may not be available for adoption by the time you complete the adoption process, other great Labs are always finding their way into our Rescue. \n\nFor more information on this Lab, please contact INFO@BROOKLINELABRESCUE.ORG.  \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this Lab or any other Lab from our Rescue, please visit our Web site, www.brooklinelabrescue.org, for more information on our adoption process. If you need additional information about the adoption process or whether you are in our coverage area, please send an e-mail to our Rescue at info@brooklinelabrescue.org\n\nEven if you are not ready to adopt, you can still help us help our Labs!\n\nBrookline Labrador Retriever Rescue is a 501(c)3 non-profit volunteer organization funded entirely by donations.

            "description": "Hi everyone out there, my name is Van Gogh and I am about 3 years old or so.  Do you know why my name is Van Gogh - cause I have a full ear and a half ear.  It makes me unique.  It adds to my character.\n\nI even liked wearing my sweater one day when it was cold out and I went for a walk.\n\nI would do great in an active home where I could be walked several times a day and get some of my energy out.  I think I may have a little Jack Russell in me, so that is why I am so active.  I also think I have some hound DNA.\n\nEveryone who is interested in me must fill out a questionnaire first. All questionnaires are carefully reviewed so that the right home can be found for me. When the shelter has chosen the home they think is the right fit, only then will that person be called for a meet and greet.\n\nFor a questionnaire to be sent to you via email, please contact Sue at\n412-389-2480 or email her at turfg979@verizon.net",

She is a large family-friendly dog that would be perfect for anyone that enjoys an active lifestyle.  Outgoing and affectionate, Lola loves having fun and needs plenty of exercise.  Lola would not be happy if left alone in a crate all day.  She is very bright and needs activity to keep her mind busy.  If you are looking for a running or hiking partner, this is your dog.  Lola is a pretty good ball player too!  She has a blast playing tag outside with several other dogs here at the shelter.  Another dog in the home would be a welcome playmate and help to keep her entertained.  Of course, you can always consider adopting one of her play group pals.  Cats would not be a good fit as Lola has strong herding instincts.  Lola has lived in a home before and been around children.  She seems to be housebroken and will need a fenced in yard to keep her from wandering.  This sweet girl is well mannered and very easy to train.  If you are looking for a fun-loving pup to be your companion, Lola is anxious to meet you.  \n\nTo adopt this pet, Click \"More About Us\" and then \"Adoption Application\" to be directed to our online HSNWGA application form.  You will be contacted by our Adoption Coordinator once your application is reviewed and approved.  Due to high volume of applications, we are only able to contact those applicants that best meet the needs of that individual pet.",

            "description": "HALEY is a happy little circus clown :-) She chases her tail, greets you with a big smile, and wants to play play play. All of this shows the true spirit this smart gorgeous red heeler girl has despite the horrific violent act performed on her. At 8 weeks old she was taken to the top of a two-story building and intentionally thrown to the ground. She has spent the last 3 months healing. She's done a super job and her friend Keanu was with her every step of the way! Her left front leg will most likely forever be a bit shorter due to all the fractures she suffered. Everything else has healed very nicely. She's runs around with her friends great and loves water too! :-)\n\nWe would love Haley and Keanu to be adopted together if you don't have another dog. If you do have another young playful male dog we will consider adopting them seperately. Keanu has been an inspiration for Haley, coaxing her to follow him and play gently during her healing process. Now they know each other very well and run around the yard chasing each other, Haley taking an occasional dip in the water trough. Keanu has his own sad past - as a puppy, he was placed in a sealed box and left on the side of the road until someone found him. So in a way, they've helped each other.\n\nHer adoption fee includes her spaying, vaccine series, rabies, deworming, and microchip. She was born on a reservation we work with August 18, 2020.  \n\nWe have specific ADOPTION and COVID rules listed below.\n\nRevised adoption policy\nDue to Covid -19 pandemic and social distancing requirements, we've revised our adoption policy. \n\nFirst, please email (desertpawsnm@gmail.com) to inquire before you fill out the online application to see if the pet is still available. (Please do not call or text). We'll send you a link to the application.\n\nWe are unable to do multi-dog/cat meetgreets or adoption events at this time or bring multiple animals to your house to choose from, so please only inquire if you're serious about adopting this particular animal. If you're just shopping around with several shelters and rescues, please let us know this. \n\nIf your application is approved (which \"could\" take up to one week) then we will contact you to set up a Zoom chat or ph call to answer questions/clarify anything and set up a day/time to bring the pet to you. \n\nSince we can't come into the home/yard due to Covid-19, we ask that you send us pics /video of your home/yard/living area/current pets. \n\nWe will discuss with you about meeting your other pets. At the meeting/adoption at your house (outside) please wear a mask (as will we), keep to a properly distanced social distance and have hand sanitizer and your own leash.\n\nWe adopt locally to Central Abq, Santa Fe, Los Alamos and Rio Rancho. No out of area adoptions inquiries please. No young children for our adoptions please.\n\nThe animals are fostered and our foster families like to know their fosters are happy, healthy, and cared for during their lifetime. We appreciate staying in touch periodically (just a pic, holiday card, social media, pics/videos  etc will make our work worthwhile :-))\n\nOur volunteers and adoption board are working diligently with an overload of inquiries since Covid to match families and forever pets. Our workload on the reservations has also increased. We're sorry, but if you email us with questions that are already answered here or fill out an application that does not fit the parameters of our procedures we will not be able to reply to you. Thank you for your understanding on this!\n\nThank you - we look forward to hearing from you and having another furbaby united with a furever family!\n",

He was very scared and reactive in the shelter.  But the folks there saw something in him that they knew he was a good dog.    \n\nWhen he first came in he was very kennel reactive but when out of the kennel he was a different dog.    He plays with other dogs but can be a little possessive of his things. \n\nFor a year while he was worked with, he carried around  a painful, non-functioning front leg.   A vet said his leg was savable but we found that not to be true and our vet said he was in great pain (likely contributing to his behavior).  So his leg was amputated and he has not missed a beat!\n\nHe also is reactive to men.   He has never bitten a soul but will growl.   So we think the best home for him is either a female home or one where the male is dog savvy  and will be patient with him. \n\nBubba is a big goofy, happy boy!  He loves to play and he loves to ride in the car!\nWe promise if you meet him you will love him.\n\nBubba is fostered in Windham, CT and his adoption is $400.00\n\nhttps://www.jotform.com/WOFARinc/WOFAR-Adoption-Application",

He definitely deserves a loving home to call his own!! Jackson is good with other dogs. He is energetic and will make a great family pet for an active family or individual looking for a walking, hiking, or running partner. Jackson is fully vetted, up to date on his shots and neutered. He has been living in a kennel with other dogs and doing well additionally he doesn\u2019t seem to have any interest in cats. Jackson is up to date on all his shots, neutered and microchipped. If you would like Jackson to join your family, please visit our website www.peace4paws.org and fill out an adoption application. Thank you very much. \n\nDog Size Guidelines:\nSmall: 25 lbs and under (11 kg)\nMedium: 26\u201360 lbs (12 \u2013 27 kg)\nLarge: 61\u2013100 lbs (28 \u2013 45 kg)\nExtra Large: 101 lbs or more (46 kg)",

            "description": "Jackson is a 10 year old male dachshund. He is a mix of cream and red, so he's a light red/golden color. He is a big boy at 17.5 lb. and is a tweenie or small standard.\n\nJackson is pretty laid back around the house and with people. He's content to follow his brother Riley's lead. He is the opposite of his brother in that he doesn't like walks all that much. He prefers to get his exercise playing with toys. He will punch this with both paws and loves the sound squeakers make. This senior boy and his brother think they are puppies and will bring a smile to your face as you watch them run around.\n\nHe hates riding in the car and will get anxiety. He would love a home where he can sleep in bed with his human. He's not overly cuddly but likes to be near people. Jackson would do best in a home where there are people around most of the time. \n\nHe needs some continuing work on his potty training, although his fosters have begun (He was potty pad trained and is now learning to go outside). He would not do well in a home with young kids (but teens would be ok).\n\nCould rambunctious Jackson and his goofy brother Riley be the perfect pair for you?

We will post more info as we get to know him.\n\nSeattle Foster Update:\n\nHe's a bit barky at new people, especially men, but once he knows it's ok he's wiggly. Still hesitant with men but I'm trying to walk him with some friends and have passed the leash over for a mile or two and he seems to be gaining confidence there.\n\nThe yard part is no big deal, he will go outside to potty but he does not like to spend much time outside, especially if it's raining.\n\nHe's doesn't recognize his own body size, he crashes into stuff in the house but he's just a big sweet pup. He followed foster Kiera straight up the wooden stairs at our neighborhood playground, he loved it. He'll go over the agility jumps in my yard, I think he'd love something like that. And he loves walks.\n\nNoel would do best in a home with a resident dog that is close to our equal in size due to his exuberance and lack of body and handler awareness.\n\nNoel would thrive in a home that can promote training, leadership and structure.\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $500, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, and heartworm test. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue.\n\nApply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org\n\nAnimal History: This dog was rescued from euthanasia at a high-kill shelter in California and will be available for adoption in Seattle, once evaluated in a loving foster home in the greater Seattle area.",

Sherry was rescued from a high kill shelter in TX initially assessed as unable to walk; she was diagnosed with a fractured pelvis and has now started bearing weight on all legs again, yay! She saw the vet here in VA shortly after she arrived for repeat x-rays and a treatment plan. Sherry is a lucky lady and with continued crate rest and pain management she will not need surgery! She also had a much needed spa day and looks like a brand new pup! She is very sweet, loves to lean in for love and will make the most amazing & stunning sidekick. She is very friendly to adults and children, dog and cat test TBD, but non-reactive to passing dogs while on leashed potty breaks and stands nose to nose with my female on opposite sides of the fence nicely. This girl never stops wagging her tail. Sherry takes treats nicely and allows you to touch her and her bowls while eating. She will need some training to refine her manners but she is totally worth it and I can't wait to see her full transformation. If you are an approved adopter and are interested in this dog, please let your case worker know. If you are not yet an approved adopter but are interested, please complete an adoption application!\nYou can review our adoption process, www.shenandoahrescue.org/adoption-process if interested. Donations can be made at shenandoahrescue.org/donate or on PayPal to info@shenandoahrescue.org",

In fact, he loves to walk! He walks twice a day and will remind you if you forget (he's the perfect exercise buddy). Riley and Jackson are still working on their outdoor potty training at their foster home. Previously they were allowed to go on a potty pad indoors, so this is a learning curve for them.\n\nRiley has allergies and wasn't on any medication when he arrived. He has since started hypoallergenic prescription food and will likely need to continue his allergy medicine (so his forever home should be prepared for these additional costs). He does have some fatty tumors and growths that we will biopsy at the time of his dental.\n\nThis is one happy, silly and mischievous boy! He would love to sleep in bed with his human but will tolerate sleeping in your room in his crate/pen with his brother Jackson. Speaking of Jackson, he really loves his brother! They are most definitely a bonded pair who will be adopted out together.\n\nAre you a experienced doxie home that is looking for a goofy, loving and slightly naughty pair to light up your life? These two have so much to offer- you would never know they are seniors based on how they act!",

Malin was able to save  one puppy and she had the wounds to show for it, but she has healed nicely and is ready for a loving home where she won't be in danger ever again. Malin is around 2 years old and 40lbs. She is so sweet and loving, crate trained, does well on a leash, and will make a great yoga partner!!  She would like the following:\nHer person/people to love her unconditionally \nA fenced yard would be nice to help keep her safe\nShe likes kitties that will play with her\nWe can kid test but probably no young kids as their play may scare her\nShe likes dogs just needs slow introduction since the attack\n\nAll of our Wigglers are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, hw tested/treated, and on preventatives. We require proof spanning 2 consistent years of HW preventatives for already owned pets, UTD on shots, and spay/neuter in order to adopt. Please read their description above closely. Our adoption fee is $350. For an application to foster or adopt send us your number and email address in a message. *\n",

WE TAKE EXTRA MEASURES TO PROVIDE YOU WITH DETAILED INFORMATION.\n\nWe adopt only to the Florida counties of Pinellas, Hillsborough, Pasco, Manatee and north Sarasota.\n\nPlease email, including your name and phone number: InquiryForNewHorizonDogRescue@gmail.com, and the foster parent will contact you directly.  This is a proud service we offer.\n\nMicrochipped\nHeartworm Negative (Result of test provided)\nCrate Trained\nLeash Trained  - EXCELLENT\nFully Vaccinated\nKnows Basic Commands\nWeight 47 lbs\nDOB:  On or around March 21, 2020\nA terrific family dog for children above 10 years of age.  A terrific play buddy for an existing family dog.\nCat tested with no reaction.\n\nRequired:  Enclosed, fenced yard.\nRequirement for Adoption:\n1. Work from home, stay at home or part-time employment.\u00a0 This dog is too young to be left alone unsupervised and kenneling for more than 2 hours is unacceptable.\n2. Feed only top quality foods.  We are strict regarding our dog's nutritional needs.\n3. Monthly heartworm prevention.\n\nIf you're looking for a dog that is laid back that is not Jack, since Jack is still   puppy in behavior, energy and curiosity.  This is a dog whose mind is always going, so a home that can offer stimulation is ideal to maintain his overall balance.  When we first received this stunningly handsome dog from a high-kill shelter, Jack would literally bounce off the walls. Why?  Because no one from his past had ever taken the responsible time to simply guide him on how to act.  Jack has come a long, long way with our simple and basic behavioral training.  He wants to learn!  He wants to be guided.  He wants to please.  \n\nNo ice to be broken when meeting other dogs.  Jack's innate demeanor welcomes all dogs and all dogs easily welcome him -- hands down.  He has the type of personality that melds with any person or furry friend.  Great on a leash and a perfect passenger in a car, Jack barks only when alerted and when indoors he is hush-hush quiet. He does not jump up on people.  He does not lift his leg.  He is not a face licker. \nA handsome dog, Jack will melt your heart with eyelashes that adorn his warm and sincere eyes.  Count on Jack to be the most loyal and devoted best friend.\n\nFeed your dog to do more than survive. \u00a0Feed your dog to thrive.\nThere is no\u00a0logical basis to back\u00a0feeding your dog the same dog food bag after bag. \u00a0This alone causes the dog's digestive system to be dependent on one food. \u00a0Rotate manufacturers. \u00a0 No one dog food has it all. \u00a0** No one dog food can satisfy and dog's nutritional needs long term.** \u00a0A dog's biological need is variety. \u00a0Raw diet is a dog's natural diet. \u00a0Our dogs are fed partial dry commercial food after soaked in water to mitigate dehydration within the dog and a raw egg and raw beef or poultry on top.\n\nPlease be fully aware what you are feeding your dog. \u00a0Check out the reviews. \u00a0For example in your search bar: MY DOG FOOD and add the word \"review\": \u00a0MY DOG FOOD REVIEW and websites will avail themselves to assist you.\n\nWe cannot guarantee the breeds of any of our dogs. DNA tests are not fully accurate. The breeds as disclosed are a guestimate based on physical characteristics and behavioral traits.",

I\u2019m 3 years old, a Libra, and about 80lbs. I\u2019m intelligent, friendly, and energetic. My ideal family would like to play fetch, enjoy riding in vehicles with their heads out the windows, go on walks to sniff things, and  exuberantly running through the sprinkler. \n  I don\u2019t bark much and I like to do my business outside. My nickname should be Tigger as when I\u2019m excited I tend to bounce up and down. Because of my size and energy level I would do best with older kids 10+  I am used to having a fenced in yard. I\u2019m still in training but will work hard for treats. I'd love to meet and get to know you and your family!",

            "description": "Blondie is a loving 3 year old lab/boxer mix! \n\nBlondie was found wondering the streets of Houston, Tx. Her finder noticed she had a collar so she brought her to a local shelter to scan for a microchip. Blondie was very sweet, and willingly jumped in the car. She was tail wags the whole time! \nShelter staff did find her past owners contact information, however when they called he said \"\"If I wanted this dog, she wouldn't be on the streets right now. Don't contact me again.\"\" Poor Blondie does not deserve a cold hearted owner. We are on a mission to find Blondie the loving home she deserves. This girl is so sweet! \n\nFrom the foster: Blondie is a sweet sweet girl who will make a wonderful colorado adventure dog! She is so gentle and loving, and shy and timid at first! She seems to be happy snuggling on the couch or doing her own thing. She LOVES being outside! She is timid now and seems to come from a rough past, but is quickly building trust and coming more and more out of her shell and building confidence! Will some extra love and care, and learning that she is safe, Blondie will be embodying her doggie confidence in no time! She is a smart girl who know how to sit, shake, and come. She is pretty good on a leash and is fully crate trained and potty trained! She goes to the door when she has to go out. Because Blondie seems to LOVE being outside, she would do great in a home with a backyard to play!\n\nBlondie making friends: \nhttps://youtu.be/FqHySSn34Zw\n\nIf you are interested in adopting the first step is to fill out an adoption application on our website aaanimalrescue.org. We are currently very busy! Please reach out to allaboardanimalrescue@gmail.com if you have an approved application on file! Please fill out an adoption application on our website if you are ready to adopt! \n\nThank you for your patience and understanding during this difficult time! We are on a mission to find everyone companions, we will continue to rescue dogs weekly! We update our page every Monday evening. We are not currently hosting any Petco adoption events for the public. We will be hosting meet/greet adoption appointments!\n\n\nBreed and size disclosure: As a rescue all of our dogs come to us from high-kill shelters or other rescues, so we do not get a lot of background or information on these dogs. We occasionally receive the mother with the puppies, but in most cases both parents are unknown. Because of this we do not know the full breeding of the dogs. We are required to list the dogs based on the breeds provided to us on their records, but they are all mixed breeds as far as we know, and we cannot guarantee the actual breeds of any of these dogs. Since the full breeding of the dogs is unknown we can also only give you an educated guess on the full-grown size of the dogs. All of the current information we have on the dogs is listed in their bio above. More information may be available at our adoption event, since a lot of the fosters turn in report cards on how the dog has done in their care when they drop them off. \n\nAdoption Process: If you are interested in adopting from us, the first step of our adoption process is to fill out an application online at http://aaanimalrescue.org/adoption_app.html. It takes us 24-48 hours to process your application and get back to you, via email. Applications turned in Friday afternoon or Saturday morning will not be processed since we are preparing for or at our adoption event. We do have applications on site at our events, but are not always able to approve them at that time and many of the dogs will already have holds on them, so we suggest you fill out an application prior to attending an adoption event. We can place a hold on one dog per approved applicant after a deposit fee has been received, please do not ask to hold a dog if you have not turned in an application and been approved, for the first hour of our adoption event, so that they can get the first chance to meet and hopefully adopt that dog. After the first hour of the event all dogs are available on a first come, first serve basis. If you already have an approved application on file, there will just be more paperwork and the adoption fee at the event, but you will be able to take home the dog/puppy that day. Since we are foster based and do not have a location, our dogs are only available to meet at our events, unless otherwise noted.",

I love getting pets and hanging out with my people friends. I\u2019m not a huge fan of treats, so no need to spend extra on me there.  However, fun toys would be great instead! \n\nI do pull on my leash so a training collar would work well for me.  With that, I\u2019d make a great walking buddy!   I\u2019m potty trained, sit on command and I\u2019m good with other dogs that have a submissive personality and match my sweet demeanor. I would prefer not to share my home with kitties but wouldn\u2019t mind some older kids to play with! \n\nDo I sound like the perfect dog for your family?  I\u2019m ready to meet you and start loving our new life together! You can set up a time to meet me by contacting the shelter at 972-382-3647 ext 4 or adoptionsmoh@gmail.com.\n\nI\u2019m fully vetted and ready for my forever home.",

            "description": "Aviana ACCT-A-82253\n\nThis little one is the sweetest, most snuggly and calm girl around!! Aviana walks perfect on a leash - no bunny chasing ever. She is a social butterfly to the extreme, who loves to greet everyone she meets with tail wags and a happy face. She is always up for belly rubs or butt scratches and is the best snuggle couch potato partner around! She definitely does not believe in personal space and is a 50 pound velcro lap dog for sure. Aviana loved the little kids she has met, though she is not a fan of smaller dogs or cats. So a home without smaller animals is best. She was non reactive to larger dogs on our walks. Aviana also loves to go for car rides, and prefers to be in the passenger seat :)\n\nInterested in meeting this sweet girl? Email her foster mom at stantonchris@comcast.net\n\nIntake Reason: Stray (APO Pickup)\nSex: Female \nAge: 4Y\nAltered: no\n\nVideos: \nAviana and Wheezy dog meet -- https://youtu.be/gRidtWVyiCU\n\nMedical Observation: \n1/10 (Per Vet)-- Bloody stool in kennel\n1/8 (Vet Check) -- Lesions on carpus and tarsus appear to be pressure sores likely due to extended exposure to hard surfaces, suspect from being caged. They appear non-infectious but will likely remain unchanged in appearance. Patient presents with moderate periodontal disease (devitalized canines) and would benefit from dental surgery. Saliva staining likely secondary to allergies - food v. atopy. She appears nonpruritic at this time. Patient's friendly demeanor makes her a very good candidate for adoption. \n1/7 (Intake Exam) -- Underweight; sores and lesions all over body; pressure sores on forearms and hind legs; muscle wasting all over body; open lesions on paws; dirty ears; underbite\n\nBehavior Observation: \n1/11 (Per Foster Staff)-- Details from dog meet - Aviana and Agatha were walking towards each other in the parking lot so we conducted a brief meet with them. Both dogs were very polite and tolerant, tails flagging, and took turns sniffing each other. The meet went very well and both Aviana and Agatha appear to be dog-friendly.\n1/10 (Per Volunteer)-- Kennel Presentation: Easy to leash/social. Does try to head butt out of the door\nLeash Skills: Pulls Minimally On Leash. Very nice leash walker\nHandleability: Tense/Allows all handling. Started off with some mild crouching when I tried to pet her. She overcame that quickly and was OK w/ most handling.\nTag: Engages in play\nToys: Accepts a trade. She got a little obsessed with a ball but easily traded for a treat. A little grabby with treats. I just tossed them.\nColor Level: Gold\n1/9 (Per Foster Staff) -- Dog approached handler as soon as she was greeted in kennel. Easy to leash and lead out of kennel. Very minimal pulling on leash - walks pretty much in pace with handler. Once in eval room, solicited attention from handler, sat for treats, engaged in tag, allowed all over handling and petting. Did get a little stiff when body was first pet, but loosened up and leaned into the pets. Very social and followed handler around. Very easy to return to kennel. Enjoys treats!\n1/8 (Per Vet) -- very friendly and affectionate; seeks attention; tolerates handling and examination \n1/8 (Per Lifesaving) -- During dog meet with Wheezy, Aviana seemed fine with Wheezy up until Wheezy tried to mount Aviana (See video \"Aviana and Wheezy dog meet\")\n1/7 (Per Staff) -- Super super sweet docile friendly as can be young lady.. Leashes up no issue walks well on leash allows all handling let me pick her up.. Loves to give kisses and won't stop she's a big lap dog\n\nThis animal is currently available from foster care through ACCT Philly's Adoptions Programs. This animal is not onsite.

            "description": "Oberon \u201cOby\u201d is a 10 year old male Yorkshire Terrier rescued as a surrender. His owner passed away and his family was unable to care for him.\nOby is just shy of 5 lbs and would do best in a quiet home where he can snuggle. He has no teeth but he\u2019s a great eater of very small kibble mixed with a little bit of soft canned food. Very sweet boy who wants all the attention from his person. \n\nIf you think you would be interested, please complete our no obligation application and we can start the process at www.luv4k9s.org. Select Available Dogs then scroll down to application, complete and submit. \n\nA physical secure fence attached to the residence is a requirement to adopt a dog from our rescue. Invisible fence doesn't meet this requirement. No exceptions.\n\nOur adoption area is primarily OHIO. We will consider KENTUCKY, AND INDIANA AND CERTAIN AREAS OF MICHIGAN, WEST VIRGINIA, AND PENNSYLVANIA if it\u2019s the best fit for the dog.\n\nWE DO NOT SHIP NOR ARRANGE TRANSPORTS.\n\nTHE APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED BEFORE WE CAN START THE PROCESS. \n\nIT CAN TAKE AT LEAST 2 WEEKS TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION SOMETIMES LONGER DEPENDING ON VOLUNTEER AVAILABILITY AND NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS RECEIVED SO PLEASE BE PATIENT. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different, and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. \nHomes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for:\n1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (ex. a 4 month old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break) \n2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old, to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise.\n3.) Socialization: The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home.\n4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded tenfold, for years to come.\nPlease do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy. Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time consuming and can be expensive. All Dogs Require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well-trained, well socialized dog is more than worth the effort put in to get them there. \n\nOur adoption fee includes spay/neuter, routine shots, rabies, worming, microchipped, heartworm testing and they are on monthly preventative. Visit our website www.luv4k9s.org for more information and to complete an application.\n",

He came from a horrible hoarding situation in Missouri and has been learning what it is like to be an inside dog and learning that being loved by humans is pretty awesome! He does well with other dogs with slower introductions, or more calm dogs. He is potty trained and working on building his confidence more. He will need a patient adopter willing to give him the time he needs to completely come out of his shell. A fence is required. He has been accepting lots of affection from his foster Mom, and is making great progress! He is still shy around men and warms up to women much quicker. \n\n",

I just love people of all ages and am super loving and affectionate.  I love to run and play, I\u2019m potty and crate trained and would make a great workout buddy.\n\nWhile many of my fellow canines like to have other 4-legged friends to run and play with, I will be perfectly content being the only doggie in my new home.  To be honest, I\u2019d actually prefer it that way.   You won\u2019t have to decide which doggie to pet, who gets the leftover steak bone, or who to take with you on your daily walk. It\u2019s a win-win for both of us!\n\nI\u2019ll be waiting here patiently for my new family or come.  Set up a time to meet me by calling 972-382-3647 ext 4 or emailing adoptionsmoh@gmail.com.\n\nI\u2019m fully vetted and ready for my forever home.",

He's currently a happy and healthy hound mix around 2 years old. Roark came to the farm recently he's making the round and meeting all sorts of new friends since he's been here. When he looks at you and perks up his ears, you won't be able to help but smile at his cuteness. Roark is an active boy, so he would certainly enjoy an active family life and time to be outdoors each day to stretch his legs before cuddling up close to his favorite humans. Curious and watchful, Roark keeps track of the volunteers during play time to make sure he gets his share of love and ear scratching. Roark would equally love a canine sibling as he would be your one and only. Don't miss out on this fun-loving boy!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time.

This girl is just a dream and has our volunteers just gushing over her. Gentle, quiet and still not quite sure how she ended up at Saving Grace, she is good in her crate but likes to sleep snuggled in a blanket on the couch. She loves being outdoors and is more of an observer than engaging in any shenanigans going on in her playgroup. Prue is happy to go on short walks, and knows outdoors is where to do her business. She's a one on one kind of girl that prefers a kind hand and a gentle rub. She is excellent with kids of all ages. Prue would love to learn how to enjoy playing with a toy and the comfort of a nice soft bed. She may need a little time to warm up, but the reward is worth the wait! No need to keep looking for your new best friend, send in your application today to meet Prue.\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time.

Jarvis would do well in a home with another dog so long as the dog is lower energy, as high energy dogs are very intimidating to him,  He is terrified of cats as well, so no cats unfortunately. Jarvis will need a home with a fenced in yard so he can safely run around as much as he would like. \n\nSince he needs some help learning to not jump and climb on people, and can be mouthy when he plays, it would be best that he not be in a home with small children under the age of 12. If you have a fenced in yard, a dog looking for a playmate, and no young children, then please apply today!! To apply, please go to your website www.SWCHS.com \n",

She would not be content just playing in the yard, but would do best on outings, hikes, swimming at the river, camping, and SO much more! We are looking to place her in a home where she has another young companion to play the day away with! Harper is missing half of her left ear, it looks to be an old injury that's already healed and causes her no problems at all, unless you count how extra adorable it makes her head tilts! \n\nHarper is a young medium sized mixed breed. We are currently accepting applications for Harper, applications are available on our website www.hillcountryspca.com",

She is the mom of the O litter and also Lucky who has been adopted a while ago.\n?Ocean is a sweetheart who wants nothing more then to be loved by her people. She is slowly getting used to being in a home environment but the world is still a scary place for her. Every day is a new experience for Ocean whether it's going outside, going on a 2 minute walk, loud vehicles and city sounds. She is getting used to things way faster then her foster expected and with time a patience she will become a great dog. Ocean has been showing some signs of separation anxiety however we have been working on that and she is starting to get better. Her foster has a camera that allows her to speak to Ocean while in her crate so when she starts to get anxious she can just reassure her and Ocean settles again quickly. Ocean loves to be cuddling up with you on the couch or laying beside you on the ground while you complete office work.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n\nName: Bronson\n\nDOB: 10/24/2017\n\nWeight: 80 Pounds\n\nAdoption Fee: 375.00\n\n*Currently receiving veterinary care in St. Cloud - he will need continued follow up appointments and any applicant should be prepared to drive to St. Cloud*\n\nBronson is a 3-year-old loving dog with advanced hip dysplasia looking for a FTA (Foster to Adopt home). Ruff Start is currently exploring options for long-term care and will likely need to fundraise before any major treatments. No matter what treatment Bronson receives, he should be on fish oils, anti-inflammatories (carprofen) and veterinary formulated joint supplements daily for the rest of his life, so his people will need to be prepared to take him to appointments and provide him his medications, currently twice daily. A home with fewer flights of stairs may also be beneficial, but would depend on the treatment decisions. Currently, Bronson is on pain medications and does well on the stairs most of the time, but at 80 pounds, help could be tough to provide as he gets older. He also has accidents in the house and wears a belly-band to help. He seems to do fine for a few days, then have a really bad day with multiple accidents. His signals are subtle, but I'd bet he would do well with bell-training as he is a fast learner and wants to please his people.\n\nBronson is a loving dog who loves to lay in bed and do his adorable wiggle-bite routine where he lays on his back and throws his head and butt around, wiggling while biting the air and smiling. Bronson gives lots of side-eye. If you talk about him: side-eye, look at him: side-eye, give him a direction: side-eye. He is goofy and silly, always making his fosters laugh. He has done extremely well with all visitors, dogs, and humans, and met some kids around 6-8 years-old on the street and did well, though he hasn't met any in the home. I have no concerns with him meeting any dogs or children; he has not had any cat intros and does loose his mind when he sees squirrels so he might not be ideal for a home with cats, but may be fine with slow intros and a dog-savvy cat. He can be vocal when he sees squirrels or other dogs from a window, though he is learning that we don't like barking and is starting to learn \"go chill\" when he gets too excited, which means he has to walk away from the door and go somewhere else, usually our bedroom, his safe-space, for awhile. Bronson does need to be fed separately from other animals - he likes to keep all his food for himself!\n\nWe have been teaching Bronson fetch. He is learning to play, but clearly never had the chance to play in his old life. We had another foster for a few weeks who helpfully taught Bronson to play with toys with other dogs and he is starting to try playing on his own. He has some hoarding tendencies that lead him to giving anyone who has a toy side-eye. He then walks over and VERRRY gently takes the toy, walks away, and puts it away for you. He will then gather all his toys and put them in his pile. He does not guard the pile and you can stick your hand in and take things out of it for him to remove and return. He is actually a pretty good organizer. Before the world froze over, we discovered that Bronson does want to bury bones in the yard and may dig a bit. He loves chewy bones, but not those fake bone things- those are for the toy pile.\n\nBronson is a food motivated learner. He knows \"sit\", \"lay down\" (when he feels like it and only after sitting), \"leave it\", \"go bed\", \"ugh-ugh\" (no), and \"out\" and is working on \"look\" for times he is distracted out walking. Bronson really wants to play with other dogs and gets very excited when he sees them. His gentle leader gives us lots of control and he is doing great, rarely even barking anymore, though he will cry the entire walk after seeing or hearing another dog. He just wants to love everyone. After a few months with Bronson, I am very confident in his ability to adapt and do well in a loving home. The only time he ever gets upset by anything is if his back legs get caught on something while moving around or after he plays too much with another dog and is hurting. Even then, being upset means he might cry and give you side-eye or mope a bit- he is a very sensitive boy who wants a home where he can live with lots of love (and food!) and comfort, get all the pets and bones, and maybe even have another dog to hang with- no puppies though! Puppies have too much energy and hurt his poor hips.\n\nIn the meantime if you have questions or are interested in me, please fill out an adoption application at www.ruffstartrescue.org.\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal. Please check out our website, www.ruffstartrescue.org for more details and additional pictures on any of our animals! All Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs). Ruff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue. Animals are located in homes throughout Minnesota. We do not have a facility where animals are kept.

            "description": "NOTE: This is a courtesy posting for another rescuer. Please do not contact ARRF, as we do not know this pet personally. To meet LLOYD, see the contact information below.\n\nLloyd is a handsome neutered male Belgian Malinois. His coloring is called fawn. He is 7 years old and weighs a bit over 85 lbs. This boy came to the county shelter as an underweight stray who had bad skin and an untreated injury to one of his front legs. The shelter x-ray\u2019d his leg and found an old injury that causes a bit of a hitch in his step. But it doesn\u2019t slow him down! A little Rimadyl seems to be just what he needs.\n\nLloyd has a rough style of play, so if he goes to a home with another dog, they should be large, energetic breeds who can match his playfulness. If you have kids, they would need to be older if they will be playing with Lloyd.\n\nHe is up to date on all of his vaccinations and wants to find his forever home. If you want to meet Lloyd, you will need to schedule an appointment. Call the San Diego County Department of Animal Services \u2013 South Region at 619.767.2675 and be sure to have his ID information available: ID#: A1879628; Tag#: S213.\n\nDid you know you can sponsor a pet on the ARRF Petfinder site? When you click an animal's information, there is a box in the upper-righthand corner where you can ask about the pet, mark it as a favorite, or select \"Sponsor\" or \"Share.\" It's a great way to help with just the click of a button!\n",

Paisley is a big girl that is pretty strong and needs a little work on not being so excited on leash. She would do best in a home without young or small children and has previously lived in a home with other dogs.

She is heartworm negative, fully vetted, spayed, microchipped.

They are all checked by a veterinarian, current on their vaccinations, spayed/neutered are micro-chipped. Our fosters know the animals best and will give you an honest assessment of their traits and training. \n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting a pet from Saving The Animals Together, please submit an application by clicking on the Adopt tab at www.savingtheanimalstogether.org or email us at statadoptions@savingtheanimalstogether.org \n\n\nAs soon as we receive your application back, we will check your references and then contact you for a telephone interview.

In the world we live in today, we do not blame him for taking his time when letting people into his circle of trust. Tank did previously live with children but due to the fact that he can be a bit of a nervous nelly at first, all children in the home should be 12 years and older. He has also lived other dogs. If you have a mild mannered pup or two that wouldn't mind a new friend that would be great. Tank is crate, leash and potty trained. He is treat motivated, taking treats very nicely. He already knows sit, down, stay, come and paw. If you have time to get to know Tank and you can afford him the time to blossom into the loving pup we all know then ask to meet Tank today.",

I love all sorts of treats and will do about any trick I know (sit, down, paw), for a good snack. I do love people, but I would like a home with older children as I get spooked and paranoid easily with younger children. I will also need to be the only fur child as I would like ALL of the attention on me, myself and I. I have tons of energy, but I would also be down to vege out with my favorite humans so please come and adopt me today!!

            "description": "Meet Biggie! This big, sweet, 1 year old boy is looking for a new home to call his own! He was turned over to the shelter by his owner on 1/09. The owner said he traveled too much; his family did not like Biggie and wanted him gone as well. Biggie is good with the kids and house trained. The owner, who has had this sweet, 57 pound boy since he was 4 weeks old, said that Biggie has not been around other pets, but also said Biggie needed to be an only pet. Biggie and his adorable smile have so much love and joy still to give! With a little TLC, bonding time, and plenty of playtime, Biggie will become a wonderful and loving member of the family! Get to know and love this sweetheart in run 881. His ID number is 626789. Biggie is up-to-date on vaccines, now neutered, and will be microchipped, and heartworm tested upon adoption. Biggie can't wait to start loving his new family!\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

She is crate trained, house broken, and loves to play with the other chows. Holly follows her foster mom around everywhere and likes to be petted and loved. She is timid and shy at first but warms up to and bonds better with women at first. She is getting better with men and older children as she socializes more.  \n\nPlease consider adding this puppy chow to your chow experienced home!  Prefer to adopt locally or within driving distance to St. Louis to a female or couple who are home often and have another playful dog.  Fenced yard required for zoomies.  Bonus and discount if you can also adopt Holly\u2019s best friend Maci. \n\nThe adoption fee is $350 and includes a general vet exam, heartworm testing and/or treatment (as necessary), spay/neuter surgery, shots, microchip, worming, grooming and foster care. Experienced chow ownership and credible vet references are required.\n\nIf you meet this criteria, please email to set up a meet and greet, request an adoption application to fill out and return to us. If it is a good fit, then we will have a home visit done. Then pay the adoption fee and pick up your new fur baby!  \n\nPlease email deniserahjes@aol.com or woof3x@swbell.net for more information.

Foster mom and I are working on the potty and crate training situation but I love being told I'm a good boy so I'm trying really hard. I was rescued off the streets so I'm still getting used to this indoor life, apparently everything isn't mine (or so they say). I would do best in a family that has time to keep up with my training and has another dog to show me the ropes. I was Born in Oct 2020.\n\n If you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry\n\n",

I don't quite look like the other weiner dogs in my foster home, but that's ok, I do get along with them. I don't really play with them much yet.. maybe that will happen with time.

He was rescued him from the shelter a few months ago. Didnt do well at the shelter\u2014wouldn\u2019t look up at me, very sad, etc.  Seems to be friendly toward dogs. I\u2019d say bigger and submissive dogs. Most likely females would be ok. Better yet, only dog. He LOVES to run. He can outrun even my son who\u2019s in the military & runs a lot. Does have a prey drive....wants the bunnies on walks pretty badly. He\u2019s very friendly and loves people. But about 60 lbs so no small kids. He needs someone who realizes he needs exercise, a good sized yard and is firm. He also Loves to cuddle on the couch (thinks he\u2019s a lap dog ?). Great in the car. Housebroken. Will run tho if you leave a door open....thinks that\u2019s a big game so he needs a secure yard and home.\n\nI can be reached if you have any other questions thru email or more preferably text/call.\n\nTamra DeMartini\n760-715-4703 cell",

She is slowly putting on weight, learning commands and having fun with toys and people big and small. We are so grateful that foster mom Susan welcomed this 1 year old sweet girl into her home. Cookie is a husky shepherd mix who will likely be just under 40 lbs at her ideal weight. She is now fully vaccinated and will be spayed soon. Interested in meeting her to see if she is a good fit for your family? Fill out our non binding adoption application on our website.

If pre-approved, you have first priority & can usually take home your new best friend the same day!  \n\n*Please note that there is no obligation to adopt by completing an application.*\n\n**All dogs are required to have complete vet services, including shots, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip, which are included in the Adoption Fee. Some dogs may still require completion of these services due to current age, size, breed and/or health. All vet services must be done at the vet clinic used by Once Upon a Tail Rescue.",

            "description": "Beya is 5 years old and about 10 lbs. Almost all black chihuahua mix. She comes to us from Tijuana and knows Spanish.\nShe is a very loving, well behaved, and calm girl. She does a happy wiggle when she sees her people! She also gets along well with other dogs.\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

            "description": "Don't judge a book by it's cover and definitely don't judge Alfred by his legs! \n\nAlfred was an owner surrender due to the owner not being able to afford to feed or care for him. Alfred appears to have suffered injuries to both of his left legs due to a car accident. He did not receive vet care and they healed poorly. His legs do not seem to bother him or slow him down. He runs and jumps like any other dog. Alfred had waited in the shelter for a really long time, when PAWS gave him a chance. He does need his legs wiped down after bathroom breaks as he has the tendency to accidentally get them dirty when going the bathroom. \n\nHe is the happiest dog and has plenty of energy to play and run. He is great with other dogs and loves to be around humans. He would do well with a large yard to burn some energy in or someone who will take him for good walks or a run. He is crate trained and sleeps in the crate all night without an accident! He is also mostly house trained. \n\nAlfred would do best in a home with an active lifestyle! A home with small children may not be a good fit, as he has energy and likes to jump. He needs a home where his humans can give him the time to exercise and burn energy. He is well mannered once he gets his initial energy out. He is still young and would love to have a yard to play in. Alfred loves other dogs and would do best with a home with other dogs. He loves to play! Alfred pulls on the leash some but responds well to correction. When on walks he does demonstrate some fear of cars- which makes sense with his leg issues. He will need a family committed to giving him basic obedience training and he will flourish. \n\nHe's a goofy boy - see here - https://youtu.be/CXoov0ZZQZs\n\nName: Alfred Major\nBreed: Hound Mix\nSex: Male\nAge: 2 years\nWeight: 45 pounds\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\nVaccinations: Up to date\nHeartworm: Neg\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nBASED ON OUR OBSERVATIONS:\nGood with Children: Older children only due to his energy level and tendency to jump up.\nGood with Dogs: Yes- loves other dogs! \nGood with Cats: Unknown\n\nAdoption Fee: $475.00\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION:\nInterested in a specific dog, please fill out an application if you are interested in a dog. The number of individual inquiries is overwhelming and we are finding it difficult to respond to each one. We cannot guarantee you will receive a timely response.\n\nPaws New England is a rescue, not a shelter, and as such we do not have our dogs housed in one location - they are in foster homes both in New England and in our southern foster homes. If you're interested in a specific dog, please complete a short online application and you will receive a reply within 48 hours so you can ask questions.\n\nAt present, if a dog is listed on our website, the dog is considered still available HOWEVER, may have applications that have come in before yours but it's still too early to know if any are a good match; therefore we encourage you to apply.\n\nNOTICE WITH REGARD TO LOCATION OF DOGS: Please note: Paws New England is a foster-based rescue. We do not have a brick and mortar building to house the dogs we rescue. We have found that dogs in foster homes are much more adoptable because they have been observed in a home setting. Dogs listed with Paws New England typically reside in various locations throughout the south (primarily Tennessee, Texas, and Arkansas) and New England (not necessarily in the state of Rhode Island). You will be notified by the adoption coordinator of the location of the dog you are interested in so you have the ability to decide whether to pursue adoption or not.\n\nDogs transported to New England are done so at a fee of $150.00 paid directly to the transporting company by Paws New England; no additional transport costs are responsibility of adopter. This fee is included in the adoption donation.\n\nAdoption donations cover pre-adoption vet costs (including vaccinations, spay/neuter when age appropriate, and heartworm testing/treatment when necessary), a microchip, and transportation to New England if necessary.\n\nDonations for our young, healthy puppies and dogs support their fellow canines of advanced age or suffering from injuries and abuse whose donations are reduced but whose veterinary costs are typically much higher. We appreciate your understanding that your dog will help others in need.\n\nAll known information about the animal is listed above. We do our best to give accurate information, but most of our dogs are rescues and do not come with a known history.\n\nPaws New England abides by the dog importation regulations set forth in the states of MA, CT, NH and RI.",

She is small at only 35 lbs, 14 months old, crate trained, playful and friendly. Maci is great with everyone once she warms up, but she bonds more with one person. She does well with older children, other dogs and doesn\u2019t seem to mind a friend\u2019s cat whom she was introduced to once.  \n\nWe prefer to adopt within driving distance of St. Louis to someone who works from home or is home often. Requires fenced in yard for zoomies. Bonus and discount if you can also adopt Maci\u2019s best friend Holly. \n\nThe adoption fee is $325 and includes a general vet exam, heartworm testing and/or treatment (as necessary), spay/neuter surgery, shots, microchip, worming, grooming and foster care. \n\nIf you meet this criteria, please email to set up a meet and greet, request an adoption application to fill out and return to us. If it is a good fit, then we will have a home visit done. Then pay the adoption fee and pick up your new fur baby!  \n\nPlease email deniserahjes@ail.com or woof3x@swbell.net for more information.

If pre-approved, you have first priority & can usually take home your new best friend the same day!  \n\n*Please note that there is no obligation to adopt by completing an application.*\n\n**All dogs are required to have complete vet services, including shots, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip, which are included in the Adoption Fee.

            "description": "Looking for a laid back, super sweet girl to welcome into your home? Well, Sabine is looking to move into her retirement years with a quiet family or couple. She has excellent house manners, and her potty training days are long behind her. A large, fenced yard, or perhaps a farm, would be like heaven on earth for this older gal to roam and sniff out all there is to sniff. She will follow her nose to her heart's content. Sabine is around 5 years old and about 73 pounds. She isn't needy as far as seeking out attention but if you give it, you will get it right back with a happy tail wag and a chin in your lap. Since Sabine likes to roam, a leisurely walk around the neighborhood would be enjoyable for her. She would love to snooze at your feet or in front of the fire while you chill on the couch. Sabine gets along with her four-legged friends and loves belly rubs from her two-legged ones. She may even join you up there!\nIf you're searching for a loving, low-key, and loyal companion come\nmeet Sabine and be prepared to fall in love.\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

Please find info below on how to adopt her, thanks.\n\n\n\n**Check out my Facebook page - www.facebook.com/maria.braganza.1 **\n\n\n\nHi, I'm Kit Kat, and I'd like to be your new best friend. I'm a curious, alert, attentive, young dog ready to experience each day to the fullest! In the morning, I enjoy a good stretch and thumping my tail, before going out for a walk. During the day, I love to spend as much time near you as possible. If you're willing to play with me, even better: I love to play fetch and with squeaky toys, or a good chewy bone can keep me busy for a while. When I tire, I'll take a good nap before I'm ready for more action! My foster family has occasionally left me home alone between 2-8 hours and it's gone well, but if you work outside the home be aware that I'll be eager for lots of attention when you come back. I'm good in my crate at night and in the car when we go for rides. \n\n\n\nI am looking for a family interested in training me to be all that I can be. My foster mom would be happy to tell you about all our training together. I need an adult-only home where I'm the only kid around - animal or human - (but who could want more?). Given that other dogs aren't my thing, I'd prefer a home with its own entrance, no apartment buildings please. A bonus would be a safely fenced yard where I can run and run to my heart's content! My foster mom says I have a heart of gold and eyes to match! She's happy to tell you lots more about me.\n\n\n\nHOW TO ADOPT - Please fill out a Dog Adoption Application, available at http://www.seattle.gov/animalshelter/forms.htm and email it to the Seattle Animal Shelter Foster Dog Program at adoptionreview@gmail.com.\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Many of our dogs will receive numerous applications, and the Seattle Animal Shelter asks for your patience during the process of finding the very best match. If you have questions about this dog that have not been answered above, please contact us at sasfosterdogs@gmail.com. If you would like to arrange to meet this dog, you must submit an adoption application. Thank you!",

            "description": "Lily is in a foster home, and is currently not at the shelter. Please find info below on how to adopt her, thanks. \n\n\n\nMeet Lily the Wonder Dog. On my foster mom's Instagram page I'm known as Lily the Llama Unicorn Slayer because I'm a huge fan of cuddling AND destroying stuffed animals. Also a huge fan of Frisbees, playing ball, burrowing into wool and fleece blankets, long brisk walks, and people. I've been told that I'm wickedly smart and graceful at home. Once settled, I am an affectionate dog who loves to spend my days cuddling with my people, sleeping, playing, training, eating, long walks, running through puddles and in the rain.\n\n\n\nWhat my friends at Seattle Animal Shelter say about me:\n\n\tI am a good girl who gets nervous around other dogs.\n\n\tOnce in a home and away from other dogs, I am able to relax and show my true personality. \n\n\tGet to know me. Watch my video.\n\n\tI need a safe home without other dogs. I can hear them but if I see them I get uncomfortable and will start barking to make them go away. \n\n\tIf you are a human, I love you instantly and want to show you love. \n\n\tI am house and crate trained (and use my crate when the vacuum is running). \n\n\tI am very smart and active. I will need a family ready to establish a routine full of fun physical and mental activities.\n\n\n\nThe type of home I am looking for:\n\n\tI need to be the only pet in the home (no cats, small animals, or other dogs).\n\n\tI will need a yard with a secure 6 ft. privacy fence to run and zoom around. Currently, I am walking with my foster around 5 miles/day and loving it! \n\n\tWhen we get home, we'll play tug, destroy my stuffy, and/or ball. It takes a lot to tire me out but it is fun to play with me. If my family has more than one person, y' all could take turns. \n\n\tMy reactivity makes it difficult to be near other animals, so I cannot live in apartment buildings or other densely populated areas. \n\n\tWhen out on a walk I need a person who will stay attentive while I am sniffing my way down the street and who has the ability to help me stay safe and calm down if we run into another dog. I am not being a jerk. I am just scared and need your help to be the best dog that I can be. \n\n\n\nHealth and Behavior Considerations:\n\nOn walks, Lily reacts to other dogs by barking and lunging (\"reactivity\"). She's easily directed but needs someone who has experience with dogs. She is 67lbs and needs a family who is ready to give her the time and extra training she needs. She's a great dog who loves her people completely and wants to be a good girl. She will need jobs that uses her smarts or she will get bored and frustrated. She's graceful in the house and loves to snuggle. \n\n\n\nHOW TO ADOPT - Please fill out a Dog Adoption Application, available at http://www.seattle.gov/animalshelter/forms.htm and email it to the Seattle Animal Shelter Foster Dog Program at adoptionreview@gmail.com.\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Many of our dogs will receive numerous applications, and the Seattle Animal Shelter asks for your patience during the process of finding the very best match.

She'd prefer a home with no cats, and to have a family that understands positive reinforcement training to help her learn and have fun at the same time.\n\nThis pretty girl has a seemingly permanent grin on her face, and you'll fall in love with her when you meet her.

            "description": "Molly is everything you could ever dream up in a dog. She is so cute and squishy you'll barely be able to stop petting her. Molly is a young adult hound mix. If you like larger dogs, she is for you! In typical hound fashion, she has the best floppy big ears that make her all the more adorable. She is very sweet but a bit shy right now. Though we are confident with a little bit of time she will come out of her shell. She adores our volunteers and loves any level of attention and cuddles she gets. Molly is a gem and we know you'll love her just as much as we do. To meet her visit\nsavinggracenc.org\nand submit an application.\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

            "description": "Murphy is very good natured and has managed to get all three of my dogs to play with him. He is friendly to all people and loves to meet new people. Before being rescued, I don't think he had been taught any manners but he learns very fast. He wants to please and he enjoys people very much.\n\nMurphy loves to play. He is just a youngster at around 1 year old. He weighs about 72 pounds. He is house trained and crate trained. Older children would be a better fit for him due to his enthusiasm. Murphy would not be good in a home with cats. \n\nMurphy can be a bit too friendly to new people and will jump sometimes. He has learned not to jump up on us and I believe with continued training he will learn quickly to meet people politely. \n\nHe has not chewed up anything inappropriate but he does like to drag clothes or blankets around. He enjoys chewing bones and we keep a lot around and I think it helps keep him from chewing the wrong things. \n\nHe does well in his crate if I put a kong stuffed or something in the crate with him. He sleeps quietly through the night. He should be crated when left alone.\n\nMurphy is looking for an active home. He loves people and truly wants to please. He is an athletic dog who would love going for daily runs - he is good on a leash but he does love to chase squirrels and any other small critter he might see.\n\nMurphy will make a wonderful addition to the right family. He needs someone committed to daily exercise and continued training. He has only been with us a short while but has learned so much about proper behavior. He wants to please and is very treat motivated. He has a big heart and is so good natured. He gets along with my dogs beautifully. I think he probably needs another playful dog in the home as well.\n\nIf you are interested in Murphy and are an approved adopter, please contact your Adoption Coordinator to be added to Murphy\u2019s list. If you are not yet approved you can find our adoption guidelines and application at:  www.savealabrescue.org\n\nMurphy is fostered in RI",

He is a quick learner with a happy personality who loves to play with toys and eat, eat, eat!\n\nPignoli is good with other dogs and small children. He really likes to engage with dogs to play and run; he is still learning to listen to other dogs and learn from them. He is great with younger children, but is learning his manners around them to not jump! He calms down quickly and enjoys being around kids.\n\nPignoli is crate trained and learning that it is a safe place to be in. Overall, he is a great companion! He is still learning some commands but so far has mastered \u2018sit\u2019, \u2018paw\u2019, and \u2018down\u2019. He would thrive in an active household, but enjoys snuggling on your lap as well!

He was the man's companion and true Amigo. He was loved and cared for for almost 3 years and then his owner passed away recently. Amigo has had a simple life, mostly staying along side of his owner, going out into fenced yard. He was taken in vehicles and he does well on rides. He is not a dominant personality, just wants to get along with everyone. He did have an older cat that lived in the home, but they didn't really interact, each knowing their own territory. Not sure how he will get along with other dogs yet.Amigo has not been around children of any ages but he has been very open and friendly with all the volunteers at the shelter. Children would need to be introduced safely.Micro-chippedAdoption Fee $150",

I like to play with other small dogs like myself but I do think that I would prefer to be in an adult-only home. I struggle to feel comfortable around people and am often very timid and scared. When I'm scared, I often like to spend my time in a small and enclosed space to help make me feel better. I may even be able to live happily with a feline companion. I'd benefit most from an experienced dog owner who can help me learn to come out of my shell a little bit and I would be perfect for apartment living, as I am quite small and don't require a large open space to run around in. I can be fearful of loud noises and sudden movements and sometimes when I'm really afraid, I don't have much of an appetite. I think I'd be happiest living in a quieter home environment, but I do love to receive visitors and will always welcome them with a wagging tail. I may even be the type of pup that you can bring out and about with you on your daily activities! I do appear to have some training, but could still use some additional work, particularly as it relates to potty-training. I'm learning to love to go on leashed walks here at the ranch but my absolute favorite activity is always going to be snuggling up on the couch next to you!",

She came to ARF from 405 rescue with seven siblings. Joplin is available for pre-adoption and has a $180.00 adoption fee plus the cost of 6 months of heartworm prevention. Pre-adoption means approved adopters selected may do a meet and greet, complete the adoption and put a \"hold\" on their puppy, then take them home when old enough. Puppies will be available to go home as soon as they are at least 8 weeks old, healthy and have finished their vaccinations. PUPPIES UNDER THE AGE OF 6 MONTHS CANNOT BE ADOPTED OUTSIDE OF THE IMMEDIATE TULSA AREA. NO EXCEPTIONS.\n\nNote: ARF reserves the right to deny any application that is deemed unsuitable for the animal. Please be aware that our animal adoptions are NOT on a first come- first serve basis. Our sole purpose is to find the best possible home for the animals that fall under our care. We do not ship our animals. All adopters are expected to come to Tulsa if approved.\n\nFor details on how to adopt please visit http://www.arftulsa.org/adopt.",

Tink does well with other dogs but does play rough. She also likes to mouth (put your hand in her mouth) when she wants attention so will need to watched when around children.

I only really jump up when I'm super excited or when my sisters are jumping up,  too. I do really good on walks and I'm super sweet.  I love to give kisses and I'm a sweetheart.  I'm also quiet and calm. My foster mom thinks I would make a great pet for anyone.  \n\nI am eligible for the rescues foster to adopt program.  This is where you have to live in Lubbock county to adopt me and agree to take me back to the rescue for my remaining vaccinations and to the vet for my scheduled spay appointment.  If you would like to meet me, please email adoptions.spspca@gmail.com.  My adoption fee is $150.",

            "description": "Mariah is a female, 10 lb., black and white Labrador/Terrier mix puppy . Mariah's estimated date of birth is November 15, 2020. She came to ARF from 405 rescue with seven siblings. Miss Mariah is adventurous and talkative. She loves to cuddle with her brother Henley and also in the lap of her human foster parents.  She also loves to play and run.  Mariah is VERY smart. She indicates when she wants to go potty outside by sitting next to the door, is using a leash and responds to  \"sit\", \"good girl\", \"leave it\", \"out\" and \" go potty\".  Mariah is a very curious, agile climber, thus she would do best in a privacy fence yard vs a chain link fence yard.\n\n\nMariah is available for pre-adoption and has a $180.00 adoption fee plus the cost of 6 months of heartworm prevention. Pre-adoption means approved adopters selected may do a meet and greet, complete the adoption and put a \"hold\" on their puppy, then take them home when old enough. Puppies will be available to go home as soon as they are at least 8 weeks old, healthy and have finished their vaccinations. PUPPIES UNDER THE AGE OF 6 MONTHS CANNOT BE ADOPTED OUTSIDE OF THE IMMEDIATE TULSA AREA. NO EXCEPTIONS.\n\nNote: ARF reserves the right to deny any application that is deemed unsuitable for the animal. Please be aware that our animal adoptions are NOT on a first come- first serve basis. Our sole purpose is to find the best possible home for the animals that fall under our care. We do not ship our animals. All adopters are expected to come to Tulsa if approved.\n\nFor details on how to adopt please visit http://www.arftulsa.org/adopt.",

Rex was housetrained and in a former home and slept in bed with the kids or in his own cozy dog bed. While Rex is a lover of people, he's a little selective when it comes to other dogs. For that reason, we recommend an only dog home and that Rex not visit dog parks. Rex is easy to leash up and loves to be petted all over. Rex's former owners say that he was a great addition to their family. If you're looking to expand your family, make an appointment today to meet Rex! Today was my first time walking Rex- he was very excited to get out! We exited the kennel and Rex settled into a loose leash walk and seemed to enjoy exploring his surroundings. We walked to the grassy field and saw several dogs go by. Rex watched them with interest but with relaxed body language. He knows sit, and took chicken treats gently. He was enjoyed me petting him when we sat briefly in the park. - PACC volunteer Text Rex' volunteer advocate, Ursula, about him: 520-743-0280 REX IS ENROLLED IN THE GOOD DOG PROJECT AT PACC - Read a message from his case manager here: tinyurl.com/gdpmessage - Ask his case manager about him: rachel.jones@pima.gov",

She came to ARF from 405 rescue with seven siblings. Shania is available for pre-adoption and has a $180.00 adoption fee plus the cost of 6 months of heartworm prevention. Pre-adoption means approved adopters selected may do a meet and greet, complete the adoption and put a \"hold\" on their puppy, then take them home when old enough. Puppies will be available to go home as soon as they are at least 8 weeks old, healthy and have finished their vaccinations. PUPPIES UNDER THE AGE OF 6 MONTHS CANNOT BE ADOPTED OUTSIDE OF THE IMMEDIATE TULSA AREA. NO EXCEPTIONS.\n\nNote: ARF reserves the right to deny any application that is deemed unsuitable for the animal. Please be aware that our animal adoptions are NOT on a first come- first serve basis. Our sole purpose is to find the best possible home for the animals that fall under our care. We do not ship our animals. All adopters are expected to come to Tulsa if approved.\n\nFor details on how to adopt please visit http://www.arftulsa.org/adopt.",

He does have cataracts in both eyes and is blind, he is also deaf, but it doesn't stop him one bit! He came to TNT after he and 4 other chihuahuas were found in their deceased owners home. They all had very bad flea dermatitis, ear infections, and just poorly cared for. After coming to us, he has had all medical needs taken care of. Frost has had 11 infected teeth removed, been neutered, received antibiotics for his skin, and is starting feel and look much healthier! \n His schedule consists of: Eat, sleep, snuggle, repeat. He's happiest with his human, especially males.  He will need slower paced home with a family that will shower him with cuddles and belly rubs. He doesn't wander off but does get lost easily, and with being blind & deaf, a fenced in yard is required. Having another senior dog in his future home to keep him company when the humans aren't isn't a must, but we are sure he would love it!\n\n He's just as sweet as can be, even with all his issues. His tail wags as soon as he realized you are near, and can't wait to snuggle. He is a major cuddle bug that deserves a home that will give him all the cuddles he wants! Frost's adoption fee is $300. \n",

She is a sensitive little gal who will probably need some time in a home to get comfortable with new surroundings and people. She LOVES affection and once she is comfortable with you, she will dish out the sweetest kisses! When Rosie gets excited she has non stop wiggle butts and makes adorable grunting noises. Rosie is VERY food motivated and training will probably be easy with her (or at least food clean up time). Her last home didn't really help her learn what it means to be a dog and we are hoping that a new home will. Rosie is a great shhh-medium size and would be a perfect couch companion. If you think that Rosie is the gal for you then consider applying to adopt her today!",

She absolutely loves kids and would be a fantastic addition to a family. She currently lives with another large dog and has met quite a few others going to work with her foster mom. Sadly in her former life she spent all of her time outside and when she arrived she had a big black mark on her neck from being tethered outside. She has adjusted quickly to indoor life and the comforts of being in the house lounging on dog beds. Miss Piggy got her name because she has that cute little nose that looks like a pigs snout.... ??\n\nIf you would like to meet Miss Piggy, the first step in the process is to complete an application.

You can also watch for stories, pictures and videos about Harvey on our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/groups/40103261297/\n\n Adoption fee: $350\n\nAdoption fees for all dogs/puppies include a $50 refundable training deposit. Complete your basic training program and provide a copy of the certificate within 4 months (120 days) of adoption and we will refund $50 of the original adoption fee.\n\nAll dogs/puppies have been fully vetted including spay/neuter, micro-chipping, worming, heartworm testing and preventative treatment, flea/tick preventative, and all required age appropriate vaccinations. As required by Wisconsin Act 90, all dogs will have received a veterinarian exam (CVI) within the past 30 days.\n\nOur adoption process requires the submission of an application. Applications and Adoption Rules can be found on our website, on the \"HOW TO ADOPT\" tab. Upon receipt of the completed application, we will process the application including: contact with your veterinarian and completion of a home visit.

Charlie is a gorgeous 18 month old medium-sized German Shepherd mix (his DNA test says he also has Australian Cattle Dog and Dachshund among several other breeds!) who originally came to CCR from a shelter in Texas. Charlie was adopted and well loved, but unfortunately his adopter didn't feel he would be the right dog for his lifestyle after quarantine ended. Now he's back and looking for the exact right fit! Charlie can take a minute to cut loose in new environments, but if you give him a minute to observe and adjust at his own pace, he'll love you as much as he's ever loved anyone! Then he's a goofy, athletic, affectionate dog who loves to go for long walks, runs, and then snuggle on the couch. He loves belly rubs, snuggles, and lots of praise - this guy is a ham for your attention! Charlie is good with other dogs off leash at daycare and the dog park, though he prefers the company of his people at home even more. Because he's a little high-strung, Charlie will thrive with a confident, easygoing handler who makes him feel safe and lets him fly his fun flag! Charlie is looking for adult only homes, and he respectfully requests no kitties please.\n\nTo meet Charlie, please submit an application at chicagocaninerescue.org!",

            "description": "Sly...that's how he sneaks into your heart! This boy is the absolute definition of \"don't judge a book by its cover\" - though he starts off terrified, he soon reveals the goofy pup underneath! Sly is an 11 month old retriever mutt who came to CCR with his brother from a shelter in Arkansas. Unfortunately, Sly was done a huge disservice in Arkansas - he was kept from 1 month old to 9 months old in a rural shelter with only his brother, receiving very little of the socialization young puppies need to feel safe in the world. Because of that, Sly has been initially freaked out by all of the things that a normal dog should be comfortable with. The good news is that Sly is a friendly, playful, goofy boy - you just have to give him time to adjust. He's been living happily in foster care where his foster parents have seen first hand how a super petrified dog can bloom into a nutty teenage puppy who loves to play play play! Sly will likely always be a slow adjuster to new things, but he's grown leaps and bounds in his confidence and bravery. His new home will need to continue working on exposing him slowly to new things, but if the past two months are any indication - slow and steady wins the race for Sly! When he's comfortable, he's all knucklehead - he can jump high, run fast, and he LOVES to play with toys! Sly loves other dogs and may do well with a dog friend, though he does have trouble sharing his special things with other dogs in the home (especially his toys). That's likely because he grew up competing with his brother for everything. Sly has no guarding issues with people, though. He'll do best in a home that has access to a fenced yard while he adapts to a new environment, and to a home that is happy to be more routine-oriented and predictable while Sly adapts. For now, older kids 12 and up and adults are preferred. Sly may do fine with cats since he's skittish and open to learning new things!\n\nTo meet Sly, please submit an application at chicagocaninerescue.org!",

We have been nursing her back to health with wound care and TLC, and while she has a weakly functioning foreleg as a result of the incident, the veterinarian expects rest will help her to recover and regain use of that leg, with surgery being a distant possibility .  Despite a hefty bump on her noggin, a bum foreleg that is on the mend, and testing positive for heartworms, she smiles always and shows no signs of any of her issues keeping her down!  She can run as fast, jump as high and chase all the balls as if she had all four good legs, so once she regains full use of her leg, she will be full speed ahead!  If Valora has captured your heart, we feel she would do best in a home with older children who can keep up with her energy level, and a fence would be a definite plus!  Give us a shout at 979-337-7351 and we can schedule a meet and greet to give this deserving girl a second chance at a good life.",

            "description": "Say Hello to Scout! This handsome dude is a 3 year old Golden Retriever Mix who weighs about 65lbs.  Scout is a friendly guy and would love to be the center of your world.  He likes other dogs with slow introductions but really doesn't want to share his stuff, so he would prefer to be an only pet in the home.  He would also do best with older children & no cats since fast movements aren't his favorite thing.  Scout loves being outside and enjoys attention.  He would prefer to be with his people all the time, but doesn't need to be crated when left alone.  Scout needs an experienced dog owner, who will be his leader.  If Scout sounds like a good fit, apply today!  His adoption fee is $250.00.\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

This blue pit all dressed up with the snazzy, short white socks,  is friendly, playful and truly adores being near her person.

            "description": "Jul (pronounced Yule) is the definition of a \"working dog\". This young boy (1 - 2 yrs old) is all drive. He is focused, has recall, snap to heel (after only two weeks of training!!!) and autosit . He is food and toy motivated so training is his thing! He has a good nose also. He get along well with female dogs. He is currently living with a small breed dog (10 pds) and is nonreactive to it. He smells the foster cats but has not tried to hurt them. We do not know if he is truly cat safe. He has not been child tested but we feel he would do fine with a child older than 5. Jul will be neutered prior to placement. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please complete an application at this link https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/24689/generic . \n\nWe are an official 501C3 organziation that does not have a physical location. Our home address is in Michigan, however, the majority of our dogs are not located in Michigan. The physical location of each our our dogs is posted with the name of the pet or in the title area. If you are within 4 hours of the pet, please be prepared to pick the pet up. We do provide transport assistance, however, the applicant must drive 50% of the total distance of the transport. \n\nThe information that we have available is in our posting. If you would like to discuss this animal additionally please fill out this application. Applications that are completed in our process and being considered as a match will speak to the foster home to gain more information about our adoptable dog.",

            "description": "Hi, I'm Cedric. I'm a snuggly, super-handsome, neutered 5 year old lab mix who reminds my foster family of a baby polar bear. I weigh 48 lbs, and I was brought to the Humane Society of Central Texas as a stray who was very scared in the shelter. I'm crate trained and doing well working on my potty manners in the house with occasional accidents. I'm dog friendly, gentle and kid friendly, and I love to be near my people. Since I'm not a puppy, I don't get into much trouble with chewing or destructive behaviors, and I'm a good boy who sleeps all night. I love to go for walks and runs, play outside with toys or puppy wrestle with the other dog in my foster home, but I'm also content to lay around and cuddle for most of the day as long as I get some exercise. I must have been mistreated sometime in my past, because I'm still very fearful of most men until I get to know them and often cower or growl at sudden movements or things that catch me off guard. I might be a great fit for a home with a single mom or a young women that would enjoy having a loyal, loving companion that could intimidate strangers with my growl or bark- even though I'm really just a big baby. If you're interested in giving me a home where I can continue to overcome my fears in a loving, secure place, let's set up a meet and greet!",

While Alfie does all the normal dog things like chasing his tail, running zoomies in the yard, working for treats (and so much more) there is one thing that makes him a little more special. Alfie is deaf and he is working really hard on communicating with us utilizing our hands. Although I am convinced he loves to be talked to, so I talk to him. Alfie is young, maybe 2 years old and about 60lbs. He is athletic but he also loves to cuddle with you on the couch. He is housed trained, walks well on a leash, does a great job at watching you and looking at you for direction. We are working on being able to be in a crate and building up that duration. We are also working on being able to leave him in a safe space while we are at work and he is doing great! He is currently living with a dog savy cat. Alfie has never shown that he is going to hurt our cat however he really wants to play with her and struggles with understanding that her claws mean no. He just needs some redirection or a cat who isn't 18yrs old and wants to play with him. Alfie may be deaf, but he lives just like a hearing dog except you have to communicate with your hands and ensure he is looking at you. Training may take a little more persistence than a hearing dog but he still learns the same way. Due to the ability of being startled/surprised, he is recommend with older children. Alfie is also nervous outside of his safe space (home) with people he doesn't know. He needs a strong leader who has experience that he can count on to keep him safe and continue to build his confidence.",

When I'm all tired out, I'll happily snuggle up with you on my blanket! I love car rides, I am good for baths, and I am potty trained! I will need a home with no other animals, including livestock. I would love a large, secure yard for me to do zoomies in!\n\n*Please Note, If you have other dogs or children living in the home, you will need to bring them down to meet at the shelter before the adoption process continues.\n\nFor more information please call the Humane Society of Cowlitz County at 360-577-0151 and ask to speak with a staff member.

            "description": "Clipper is a very sweet and timid dog! He would do best with a slow household and being the only dog. He does like dogs but he shows no interest really in other dogs and he does not do well with cats. Clipper is a very loyal dog and can be very protective over his family when in the house which means he needs slow introductions to new people and needs to be allowed time to warm up to them. For the first week of living in your home, he will be very nervous because of switching environments but when he warms up, Clipper is the best companion! Clipper is good on a leash and loves to run and loves playing with toys! He is house trained and is just a loving companion. Clipper has a heart of gold and really just wants to spend his days with you! \n\nIf interested in adopting Clipper, kindly fill out the application found here:  \n\nhttps://www.ozzieandfriendsrescue.org/adoptions\n\nIn filling out this adoption application, I understand that Ozzie and Friends Rescue cannot guarantee that the dog applied for is yours to adopt upon completion of application. \nWe also want to disclaim that all dogs are rescued so we cannot 100% know the exact breed.",

Cowboy is a pooch that loves to relax and watch his humans go about their day. He loves to snuggle and is a very lovable guy who is looking for his forever humans. He is a great partner to work from home with, or to watch the kids as they school virtually. Has good house manners and very calm. Does great on a leash and enjoys his walks outside. Cowboy loves other dogs and does well with kids.\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete an adoption application at www.sadiesrescue.orgCowboy is sceduled to be neutered and microchipped later in January is HW negative, and up to date with his vaccines. Please keep in mind there are many factors to consider when choosing the right match for a dog, so an application cannot guarantee adoption. Nor do we work on a 'first come first served' basis, but rather strive to find the best match for the personality of each dog.\nAs part of our adoption process, references both personal and veterinarian will be checked. Sadie's also requires a home visit before we adopt any of our dogs out; therefore we only adopt to our local WNY region. Please only apply if you are serious about adopting as placing each foster dog in the best home takes time and effort by our volunteers.",

Persephone can be selective when meeting other dogs. So a meet and greet would be required if you already have a dog at home. We don't know how she would do with cats.\n\nWhile the shelter is currently closed due to COVID-19, we are setting appointments for adoptions. Please call 812-376-2505 or email animalcareservices@columbus.in.gov.\n\nThe adoption fee for a dog is $100.

She will follow you around the house and sit near you on the couch. She is good with other dogs and cats. She is very sweet and loves to be petted. She is startled by loud noises and when walking outside on a leash she is afraid of young children, so she would do best in a home with no small children under 10.\n\nWhen Winter arrived she did have several masses that were removed, but they were not cancerous. She has been spayed, she is up to date on shots, micro-chipped and negative for heartworm.\n\nShe is housebroken. She would do great in a house with another dog but if someone was home most of the day she would be fine as the only dog. She would prefer a fenced yard so she can go out and sniff like all beagles love to do.\n\nWinter is located in Williamsburg, Va. For an application go to www.homesfurhounds.com.",

This girl will require an experienced dog owner and HAS to have another dog in the home.*\n\nLet me reintroduce myself. I am Doris, but my foster momma calls me Dori. You see, I was up for adoption over 3 months ago, but I was a bit of a wild child. I'm still skittish and unsure about all the pets and humans. I'll require a very patient human that will let me come out of my shell on my own time. \n\nI have the softest fur now that you'll ever touch. I'm really a sweet girl and love to run on the grass in the park. I love going on walks, soft beds, tasty food and follow my foster momma everywhere. Oh and don't forget my foster mom's doggy children, they've really been teaching me how to dog. I would make the greatest companion as I really don't like to be alone. Will you be the one to show me that this world isn't as scary as I think?\n\nNotes from her foster mom:\nDori is a very special pup that will require someone VERY patient, no young kids, chasing her in any way freaks her out. She's still very much learning the world and to trust. Dori NEEDS to be in a home with a calm, sweet and playful dog. She's learning how to play with toys and other dogs, and she gets her confidence from other dogs. She's house trained, she'll go out on her own (if you open the door) in the backyard and come back in. She definitely CANNOT be left unattended until trustworthy outside though. She's not fond of crates, but will stay if needed. She sleeps quietly through the night in her bed next to ours. She's really a little shadow and does not like being left alone. P.S. the hair on her leg will grow back, it's from having a short visit to ER. \n\nDori is a Yorkie/Poodle mix that we estimate to be around 4 yrs old. She's about 7.5 pounds.",

I really love being near the people who love me and I will always be so excited when you come home. I can be nervous when I'm alone, though, as I never learned how to self soothe. Because of that, I have been known to chew up some things when by myself and will need some extra training around being alone. I also like to chase cats and other small animals, so I could benefit from some more training in that area too. I am house-trained, I love camping and running outside, and I know the command \"sit\" and how to come back if you call my name. If I look like the perfect buddy for you, you can fill out an adoption application on the BMHS website and an employee will reach out to you to schedule an appointment. I can't wait to meet you!",

            "description": "Hello, my name is Orion!\n\nI'm named after Orion, a prominent constellation named after Greek Mythology - basically, I'm super cool. I would prefer to be the only pet in the home but love to give attention to my person. I prefer to have just one person - I will be man or woman's best friend! My previous owner noted that I am potty trained and know basic commands, however Pawmetto Lifeline can never promise any traits due to being a rescue environment. I like to have a toy in my mouth at all times - like a baby blanket. It comforts me. I would do best in a home without small children or teenagers due to the fact that I prefer having 1 owner and loving them with my whole heart. I don't like to share my person so would like to be their whole world too. \n\n My adoption fee of $350 includes my up-to-date vaccinations, microchip, deworming, and I come home spayed/neutered. I even started on my monthly flea and heartworm preventatives - what more could you ask for?\n\nIf you'd like to adopt me, please fill out an application on our website, PawmettoLifeline.org, and an adoption advocate will be with you shortly. Feel free to check out more of my friends or more information on PawmettoLifeline.org. I can't wait to meet you!",

Even though I'm playful, I have a gentle spirit and am very well behaved. I love walks and I like to walk right next to you so you can pet me while we walk. Meeting people is fun because I know I'll get attention and pets. I am a smart boy and am eager to please! I know sit and will come when called. Another dog in my new home would be awesome because I love the companionship. Cats are ok too. Sometimes I greet dogs with my deep bark but that just means I want to play. I will come to you neutered, up to date on vaccines, microchipped and up to date on heartworm and flea/tick preventatives.\n\nApplicants must have a secure and visible fence. In order for your application to be approved, you must also pass a home check and a vet check which includes having at least a two year vet history. I can be adopted in Missouri and surrounding states: Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Arkansas, and Nebraska. My rescue is able to transport me to those states. if you would like to give me a furever home, please fill out an application on our website. \n\nBeing fostered in Holden, MO",

She is approximately 5-6 years old. She came to us after being found as a stray. She was in pretty bad shape with skin issues and a variety of other issues caused by years of neglect. She has spend months in one of our foster homes and is now ready for adoption.\n\nPolly is a sweet girl with people. She is affectionate and calm in the home. She loves suckling on blankets. Polly loves to go for walks and is learning not to pull on the leash.\n\nPolly is not good with other dogs and can be reactive to them on leash. An experienced handler will be able to manage her well but she is strong and you will need some physical strength to handle her. She is not suitable for a home with cats or young kids.\n\nPolly still needs a special diet to control her skin issues, which are mainly caused by allergies to certain foods. Polly's physical build is powerful and she is a bit bow-legged.\n\nShe is a wonderful girl who deserves a great life after the years of neglect she has suffered. We hope to find Polly her very own special person who will love her just as she is.\n\nPolly is vaccinated, chipped and spayed. Her adoption fee is $395.\n\nWe cover the medical to prepare the pet for adoption and the adopt donations go directly to cover those costs and range from $295-$495. Thank you for stepping up to save a life!\n\nTo expedite to meet with this dog, please go to our site at www.savinggreatanimals.org and fill out an application. We look at the first applications to arrive, so we hope to hear from you soon!",

He loves attention and is willing to please. His personality is pretty laid back and gentle and he has a pretty low energy level. Rudolph is not great with other dogs, so he would need to be your one and only. An apartment is not an option for him. Rudolph needs some leash work and is very strong. If you are looking for a guy that just wants to be with you then Rudolph is your guy!\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

            "description": "Titus is a 3-5 year old bully breed mix who weighs about 65lbs. His owner had a baby and unfortunately no longer had time for him or his sister. He got along well with the baby. He loves to have his head rubbed and go on walks. He is an absolute sweetheart who gets along welll with everyone he meets - he LOVES affection and is so happy when a staff member is able to give him some one on one time. Titus also loves toys! He is housebroken and knows commands. Titus gets along great with his sibling Luna, but has not really liked other dogs here at the shelter. His previous owner said he gets along well with other dogs, but he has been selective about his K9 friends here so far. He is mostly scared of cats and could live in a home with them. He is heartworm positive (not contagious to other dogs) and will recieve treatment for this at our shelter. He is neutered, up to date on vaccinations and microchipped. If you think Titus could be a good fit for your family, please call us at (985) 809-0183 to ask more questions or schedule a private adoption meeting in one of our meet and greet rooms. YES you can bring your dogs to meet him, YES you can adopt if you live out of state although you must come in person so Titus and our staff can meet you. His adoption fee is $65.

I guess you can call me a little different, but what's normal anymore? I personally think in a past life I was a quirky tennis player. I still love tennis balls and any toy, for that matter! I have an exquisite taste for lightly charred hot dogs and warm cheese are perfect- but any treat will do. I love long walks and time to run and play( ya know, those cheesy dating headliners). Hmmm- what else can I say. I don't really like cats, they are weird in my book. I would enjoy a calmer environment with people who can spend lots of time with me. I'd say I am a sophisticated soul, who just needs a little reassurance along the way. I've got the basics down, shake, stay and sit. New things freak me out still, but with patience and some work I will be an amazing companion. \n\nWe are located at 8172 Washington Church Road, Washington Township, Ohio 45458 and are open Monday-Saturday, noon-7pm and Sunday, noon-6pm. To schedule an appointment, you can reach us during our open hours at 937-294-6505.",

The adoption fee includes the following: OH license good for this calendar year, DA2PP, Bordetella vaccine, Heartworm testing, dewormer, and spay/neuter.  Flea treatment will be provided if fleas are noticed.  All dogs will be spayed/neutered and microchipped before leaving the facility.  An e-collar may be purchased for $15.00.  Because most of our dogs were picked up as strays, we have no knowledge of any behavior or health issues.  Stray dogs are held for 72 hours so that the owners have a chance to redeem them. After that time they are vetted and placed up for adoption. We welcome and encourage the cross posting of our dog's pictures to increase adoptions.",

Nichi looks like a cute little piglet.  She came to the shelter as a stray in rough shape.  She was underweight and had a large wound on her front leg.  Fortunately she found to have no broken bones and began picking up weight quickly.  Nichi is on the mend and feeling much better.  She is an outgoing and fun petite Pittie.  Nichi loves attention and loves to snuggle.  She would make a great addition to a loving family but must find a home without cats or other small animals.  Nichi seems to get along well with some dogs but doesn't like ones that are too active or overbearing.  She would do best in a home without other dogs or with a laid-back dog.  If this sounds like a match for your family, come meet Nichi.\n\nAdoption Fee:  $180.00\n",

            "description": "Zuko (zoo-koh) is a 5-year-old pitty mix. He's a big beefcake, weighing about 65lb. He's the perfect dog for someone looking for a lowkey, funny snuggle bug. He is is house and crate trained, walks fine on a leash, and gets along well with humans and dogs. He was adopted from the humane society at 8 weeks old and has lived a comfortable suburban life! Big Zuk is about as easy-going as they come, he gets along with everyone he meets and is pretty happy doing whatever his family is up to! He will go for long walks and run around at the dog park but he also loves to snuggle and won't mind relaxing on the couch all day watching Netflix. Zuko is a bit of a nervous guy. He's rather shy and doesn't love stormy weather. He will do best in a home with someone who can help to comfort him when he is feeling nervous and help to boost his confidence. Zuko is fine with children and other pets and has no social issues whatsoever. When it comes down to it, Zuko is a big lovable goof who will bring lots of smiles and laughs to his forever home. Zuko was in a home with Nala and they were surrendered together.\n\nNala is a sweet and spicy 8-year-old boxer mix, she is medium-sized and weighs about 55lb. She is house and crate trained, walks fine on a leash, and gets along well with humans and dogs. If you are looking for a life long snuggle buddy with a heart of gold, Nala is your girl! She was adopted from the humane society when she was about 1 year old and has won the hearts of everyone she's met ever since! Nala has lots of energy and loves to run around outside and go on adventures, but she is also a big snuggle bug and loves to cuddle on the couch with her family. She will get about as close as she can to you before curling up into a ball and settling in for a long nap. She has never lived in a home with children, but she gets along great with all humans. Nala has lived in a multiple dog home for her entire life and would love to have some four-legged friends to play with, but she is just fine on her own as well. She has struggled with \"happy tail\" and would do best in a home where she would not need to be crated, as this is what aggravates her skin the most. She is also very vocal and makes low rumbling noises when she is excited or looking for attention. This could be perceived as aggressive, but she truly doesn't have an aggressive bone in her body and that is just her way of saying \"hello!\" Nala was in a home with Zuko and they were surrendered together.\n\nIf you would like to be considered as a potential adopter for one of our great dogs, please go to our website- www.luckymuttsrescue.org and submit an application. Our application process includes landlord approval and vet checks. Please make sure all of your information is current and accurate, including a valid email address and phone numbers. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and/or cancel your application.  We strive to process all applications in a timely manner, but with the high volume of applications we are receiving, it is taking anywhere from 1-3 weeks.  You may be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions.  Once all of your information is reviewed and if your application is approved, you will be notified via email.  Submitting an application and receiving an approval does not guarantee you will be adopting the dog you applied for.  Once you move to the meet and greet process, you will be contacted by the foster family to further discuss the dog, and answer questions you may have, and if applicable, a meet and greet will be set up at our adoption center.   Meet and greets are only set up with approved applicants, and we require all members in the household to be present, as well as any current dogs in the home. \n\nCurrent Adoption Fees Are:\n$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nBonded pairs vary\n\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test, (if over 6  months) and a certified veterinary inspection. Please be aware, listed dog breeds are based on information provided and cannot be guaranteed.  Submitting an application for a particular dog does not guarantee that you will be the applicant chosen, we receive several applications for each dog. Our adopters are picked based on the needs of the dog, and the home we feel with best fit based on your responses to our application, vet information and landlord requirements.   Approved applicants not chosen for the dog you applied for, will be in active status for a period of six months.  We encourage you to watch Petfinder, Facebook and our website for upcoming dogs.  Should you see a dog that interests you, please send us a Facebook message or an email with your approval number.  Please be patient with us, as Lucky Mutts Rescue is run strictly by volunteers and many of us work full time jobs, have families and also foster dogs. Thank you for considering Lucky Mutts Rescue for your next furry family member!",

If given the proper time I adjust quickly and will seek out attention.\n\nI am recommended with children 8+, pending observed interaction. I should match with another dog pending meet and greet. I may chase cats, but trainable using a slow positive introduction. Having a fenced in yard would be helpful with that training.\n\nI may require a physically fenced in yard pending your previous experience, location, and other plans for containment. I am not a fit for an apartment.\n\nBefore applying to adopt, please do research on both of my breeds characteristics. I could be great with many families but may have more energy than many bargains for.\n\nWe are open by appointment only for approved applicants.

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please download and complete an Adoption Questionnaire from our website and email US at debbied@k-9lifesavers.org\n\nYou can learn about the adoption process and find a Word, PDF and ONLINE version of the questionnaire by visiting: http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/howtoadopt/.\n\nDog's Name: Oden\n\nEstimated Breed : Staffordshire Terrier Mix\n\nApproximate Age: 2 years\n\nApproximate Weight: approx. 56 lbs\n\nCurrently Living at: Boarding\n\nAdoption Fee: $300\n\nDOG'S DESCRIPTION\n\nOden is a big baby that loves affection. He seems to think he is a lap dog since he adores cuddling! Oden gets along well with other dogs. He is strong but obedient. Due to his size and activity level, Oden is recommended for a family with older kids. Oden is hoping one special family will ask about him and give him a loving forever home.\n\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\n\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\n\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\n\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\n\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\n\nPlease \"like\" our\nFacebook Page\nfor the most current events and new dogs.\n\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

Bandit  was adopted from another shelter as a puppy but sadly proved to be too much for his family and landed himself back in a shelter.  He is energetic, outgoing and looking for something to do.  He loves going for walks and loves playing fetch.  Bandit is a smart and tented dog but has not had enough structure and activity to keep him healthy and happy.  As a result, he is looking for a knowledgeable new owner that will help him learn new things and lose weight.  Bandit is social with people but would do best in a home without children.  He is also overbearing with other animals so he would do best in a home without cats or dogs.  If you are looking for a dog to keep you on your toes and be an activity partner, come meet Bandit.\n\nAdoption Fee:  $180.00\n",

He gets along fine with other dogs and has no experience with cats. He loves people and fuzzy dog toys. He weighs approx 60# and is believed to be an American Bully / French Bulldog mix.\n\nIt is possible that Chance has cancer which will limit his time.. He is hoping to find someone that will share the last part of his journey and help him create a beautiful ending.  \n\nDo you have room in your heart and home for this amazing boy?

            "description": "I'm so sweet!Snowball was born around January 7, 2017, and weighs about 12 pounds. Snowball was surrender to us by people who have surrendered several dogs in the past. Snowball is an absolute love bug! He does wonderfully with other dogs and doesn't mind cats. Snowball rides beautifully in the car and walks ok on a leash. He is fine with children and should fit into just about any home. We do want to mention that we are working on house training and he is doing well but you may have more work to do in that department if you choose to adopt this amazing guy. Here is an update from his foster mom: I am so happy to be fostering Snowball.He is just a precious 8 lb love bug.He's a little guy with a big, wonderful personality.He loves everyone he meets,including dogs and greets them with hugs and kisses. Snowball loves to play with his toys and will frequently try to carry 2-3 in his little mouth at a time! He needs them all!He likes to play fetch with a ball too.Bringing the ball back, but not really wanting to let it go but then will so I can throw it again and he can chase it. When he is done playing he loves to snuggle and have his belly rubbed.And he will sleep in bed right next to you also.All night.He will follow you around the house to keep you company, but will also lay down for a little nap so you can get chores done.He is not loud and barky.We have a fenced yard but I take him outside on a leash because he is so tiny and he does good on it. Walking very nicely.He pees every time we go outside but is not completely house trained yet.He goes nicely into his crate when I have to go out, but I am also allowing him to be in the gated kitchen for short periods of time when i am gone and he does well. There has been no inappropriate chewing.He rides happily in the car, but wasn't happy getting a bath! When the treats come out he is so cute trying to be the best at sitting. Snowball is going to make someone's family very, very happy. The Adoption Fee for this dog is $650.00\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.\n\nJoyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations.

Tojo is overweight at 35 lbs and will be put on a diet in his foster home. Tojo is a super sweet little guy. A total gentleman and people pup. He loves to be with his people at all times. He\u2019s been an only dog his whole life. He\u2019s adjusting well to all the dogs in his foster home and does great he just doesn\u2019t like them in his face and will give a warning to that. Tojo is house trained. He does have meds for his thyroid which is also contributes to him being overweight. He also has meds for anxiety. Tojo would be the perfect companion for a laid back household. He will be fully utd, hw tested and altered before placement. \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159",

            "description": "Beautiful brindled Cheza is an approximately 3 year old, 55-pound Pitbull/Boxer/Cattle Dog mix who has not been treated well by humans in the past.\u00a0Her foster reports that she can be a spastic love bug, but will need an experienced dog owner who is willing to help her continue to build her trust of other people.\n\nSmart and eager to please, Cheza is a fast learner and\u00a0already knows the commands for sit, stay, lay down, paw, and kiss. She also knows \u201cwho\u2019s that,\u201d which is a training tool to help her deal with her fear of strangers on walks. She is housebroken as long as she remains on her schedule. Cheza will get excited and run to the door if she needs to go outside. Her crate is her safe space and she does well when left alone in it, sleeping in the crate overnight and napping in an area close to her person during the day. Cheza even eats her meals in her crate as that is where she feels safest. While Cheza can be fearful of people, she is great with other dogs and\u00a0respects her foster's old Chihuahua and her two pocket Pitties who aren\u2019t very sure of her.\u00a0Due to a strong prey drive, cats are not a good idea.\n\nIf she has bones and toys to chew\u00a0on, she will leave human stuff alone. If she does not have toys she will make her own toys from human stuff (blankets being her personal favorite).\u00a0She loves to explore her foster's fenced yard; she enjoys fetch and is very good at it. As a bonus, Cheza will keep pesky\u00a0squirrels out of your yard.\u00a0While she likes walks, Cheza's \"stranger danger\"\u00a0tendencies can lead to reactive pulling, growling, and barking if she is really fearful \u2014 hence her need for an experienced\u00a0adopter who is willing to work with her.\u00a0A freedom harness has proven to be a valuable tool for walks.\u00a0She does very well in the car and enjoys the ride.\u00a0\n\nCheza needs a single family home of dog-savvy adults with a 6-foot privacy fence. The fewer new people she sees, the less stressed she is. Cheza is the best of both worlds \u2014 she will play fetch and have zoomies in the yard but will be a total love bug in the house. Her new family will be richly rewarded with devotion!\n\nInterested in adopting this dog? Visit our website (http://www.SecondCityCanineRescue.org) to fill out an application and to find out where this dog may be shown this weekend.\n\nWe love our dogs. We want happy lives for all of them and are looking for the home that provides the best fit for each dog\u2019s individual needs. Please understand that there may be multiple families interested in this dog. \n\nAlso, please know that the breed mix listed is simply a guess. In most cases, we don\u2019t know their background. We encourage you to base your decision on individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on our guess.\n\nPlease understand, we only adopt our animals out near the Chicagoland area. Questions? Email us at adoptions@sccrescue.org. Hope to see you become part of the SCCR family!",

We apologize in advance, but we just don\u2019t have the resources to get back to every single person that inquires to adopt from us during COVID-19, but know that we do try.

Kimber's DOB is estimated to be December 2019 so she just turned a year old.\n\nKimber's family had a critical illness in the family and was no longer able to care for her.  Kimber gave birth to a litter of puppies in October, right after she came into foster care with us and she is just now getting to the point where she will soon be ready for adoption.   She still needs to be spayed  but she will be ready for a new home very soon.\n\nKimber is a very sweet and friendly girl.  She is good with other dogs and is also good with children.  \n\nKimber is housebroken and knows some basic commands.  She is still very much a puppy, herself, and will benefit greatly from obedience classes.\n\nTransport: **PLEASE READ CAREFULLY**\n\nIf you are within 1,000 miles, we can usually help with transport using volunteer drivers (depending on the route/availability of volunteers).\n\nIf you live farther than 1,000 miles, we can still assist, however, the adopting party will need to drive any mileage over 1,000 miles.\n\nFor example, if you live 1200 miles away, you would have to drive 200 miles out.\n\nNot sure how far away you are? Please ask google, she will tell you!\n\n",

            "description": "***Note - Licorice has tested positive for ringworm. He is being treated. He is available for adoption now but adopters will have to continue his treatment - Almost Home is covering the cost for meds, shampoo and a vet recheck in 4 weeks. (as of 1/13) https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/dog-ringworm-remedies#1\n\nLicorice is so sweet, loves to snuggle and run around in the yard. He has a kink in his tail and an adorable little underbite. He is happy and loves to be around people. Dislikes, the cold weather. Licorice is about 3 months old and 15 lbs now.\n\nPlease email us at AlmostHome4Dogs@yahoo.com to find out if Licorice is the right pup for you! (Local adoptions preferred - Philadelphia and tri-state area [South Jersey and northern Delaware] only.)\n\nNOTE: Most puppies do best in the company of an older dog who can teach them \"doggy manners,\" so homes with at least one other dog usually will be given preference in puppy adoptions. Please read Suzanne Clothier's wonderful article, \"It Takes a Pack to Raise a Puppy!\"\n\nPLEASE READ BEFORE CONTACTING US! We are NOT a shelter: All of our dogs live in private homes with foster families. Come and meet the Almost Home dogs and their fosters at our Meet & Greet events, where you can learn more about our wonderful dogs from the people who live with them, find out which dogs are on their way and when they'll arrive, and fill out an application to adopt or foster.\n\nWe cannot adopt to homes where electric-shock fencing systems or training collars are used. For more information on the dangers of electric-shock collars, please visit banshockcollars.ca/studies.php and http://www.hollysden.com/say_no_to_shock.htm (scroll down and click on the \"Invisible Fencing Systems\" link).\n\nWe do not have an online adoption application; to request an application, e-mail us atAlmostHome4Dogs@yahoo.com. To speed e-mail processing time, be sure to note the name of the dog you are inquiring about in the Subject line. For Meet & Greet times and locations, visit our home page, where you also will find information on our adoption process and fees.\n\nFOSTER FAMILIES ARE LIFESAVERS!! Can you open your heart and home for a few weeks to homeless shelter dog? Remember, by fostering a dog, you save TWO lives - that of your foster dog, and that of the dog who takes his place in the shelter! Come to a Meet & Greet and find out if fostering is for you - there's no reward quite like the feeling that you've saved a life ... or two!",

My ID number is 332930\n\nI am available for adoption; however due to my breed my adoption will have to be facilitated through a rescue organization. Please see the front desk staff or contact the Shelter at (248) 858-1070 for more information. \n\nNO OTHER DOGS PLEASE. KNOWS COMMANDS SIT, STAY 1/11/2021\n\nMeet Thelma Lou! There is none more adorable than this smooth velvet hippo! Thelma Lou is such a sweet girl, who's only desire, is to have a special person in her life! Thelma does great on leash and really enjoys being outside, whether it's playing or going for meandering walks! Often times, you will find Thelma leaning into you...she likes to show her affection and patiently waits for someone to pet her! In her former home, she did well with the cat, but would rather prefer to be the only dog! Thelma Lou has endless love to share!\n\nThe following descriptions describe behaviors that were observed during testing and/or veterinary examination: 7/10/2020 - Temperament test - 333306(female) - Did well. Appears interested in socializing - NAK LVT\n\nAmerican Pit Bulls are a misunderstood breed; for this reason, we implore adopters to these beautiful dogs to be very vigilant in training and socialization. This breed is very energetic and will need daily exercise. Because of their strength and energy, apartment living may not be the best fit. This breed can be loving, loyal and very smart. \n\nThe above behaviors and personality traits have been observed while at the Shelter. If this animal was relinquished, information is gathered from the owner regarding behavior. Our wonderful volunteers spend time with these animals and give input on behaviors and traits. However, this description may not be all inclusive to how this animal will act in a loving forever home. Introduction to established family pets should be slow and monitored always. The same goes for children and other family members. Adopting a pet is a big decision and should be thoughtful. We suggest researching different breeds to match traits and personalities to your lifestyle. When adopting a pet, please know that this pet will be with you for their lifetime; patience and consistency will make for a successful adoption.

She might be too much for someone who just wants a dog to hang around the house, but if you want a dog that likes to go, go, go she might be your speed. She would be a great dog to take agility classes for Fun Nose Work with. She is not a very cuddly dog but she does like to work. If you have ever had a Kelpie or Cattle Dog then you might be familiar with her personality. Please call our Lahaska shelter at 215-794-7425 to schedule an appointment to meet her!",

Starfish pays for all supplies and medical care while the puppies are growing. You provide the home and love once they are adopted!**\n\nHi, My name is Violet . I am a 1 yr old, 50 lb Shepherd mix girl. My days are spent running around waterfall glen forest preserve chasing tennis balls with my friend Dawid. I know that I'm not allowed to use the bathroom in the house. I do enjoy playing in the snow, and I do like being given a lot of attention . I'm super nice to kiddo's and spend lots of time with them in my foster home. I usually sleep on the couch when Dawid is at work . I love playing fetch but I won't give you the ball back . Dawid keeps telling me how I am the sweetest and calmest dog he has ever seen .\n\nViolet is wonderful with people once she warms up. If the adoptive family has a fenced in yard, it MUST be a 6 ft fence as she can jump a 4 ft one. Lots of walks are a requirement. Violet can be protective and therefore we are unsure if she should be placed with another dog. If another dog is in the family, the family must be familiar with resource guarding and prepared to work with both dogs until both are comfortable. \n\n\nIMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: Although we do our best to describe breed, since our pups all come from shelters we can not and will not make any guarantee on breed or size. We can tell you that they are 100% RESCUED! And that is the BEST breed!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting/meeting , please visit our website at www.starfishanimalrescue.com or you may complete the online adoption application on our Facebook Page https://www.facebook.com/starfishanimalrescue/app/134425496630143/?ref=page_internal Once you complete and submit your dog adoption application we will set up an appointment to meet this pup!",

            "description": "HUGO is not in the shelter; he is in a foster home in our Rescue Program, so use the contact info at the bottom of his description. Hugo is an approx 1 year old neutered male Mastiff mix who would love to be your new best friend! Hugo is super sweet and loves attention. He has a slight bone defect of his skull that gives him a bit of a wobbly gait, and causes his tongue to hang out rather adorably. Hugo has had an MRI and been evaluated by a neurologist who feels Hugo's condition is stable and does not require intervention. Hugo is in a foster home with two rabbits and has done well with a cat he met. He basically loves everyone he meets, including other dogs. Because of Hugo's condition, he cannot always stop himself once he gets going. As his foster mom put it - 'when he plays he cannonballs his body in to people, pets and things like a reckless barrel of joy' - so Hugo will do well with a fenced yard where he can burn off energy, and a home without tight spaces. While Hugo would love a canince playmate, because he does not have good control of his movements, care will need to be taken in choosing his friends as not all dogs will appreciate having their space invaded. He is a large but compact 94 pounds. Hugo's front paws tend to turn under when he walks, so he should be walked mainly on grass or other soft surfaces. Hugo is a joy to be around and will be a wonderful companion for the right person or family! He has been neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, heartworm tested, and microchipped. Please contact AdoptADog@animal-advocates.org or 410 880 2488 option 3.",

He is part of the 7 dog pack that came into the shelter from the same house, but with his older age has come better behavior. He is usually pretty good about keeping his kennel clean and he tolerates being jumped on and played with by the younger pups. Not very demanding, Spud does know when to ask for more and it is usually more treats before he is kenneled. Spud would fit in well in most home situations, but probably wouldn't mind the attention he would get in a single dog home.",

            "description": "Ginger\nI am a 3 year old Heeler mix and is approximately 62 pounds. Her foster mom says she is a very loving, cuddly girl who loves attention. Ginger would do best in a home that has lots of room to run around and play. She  loves to play with her toys and chew on hard bones that smell good. She is not real adept on signaling when she needs to go outside yet, so she may have an accident occasionally. Ginger loves her crate. She does not bark while in there and she will even go in there sometimes just to relax. She loves to go on walks and knows some commands like sit, down and stay . She is very treat motivated. She does good with other dogs and cats, although, she might sometimes get excited about the cat. All my foster mom tells her is  to leave it and she will listen . Her furever family will be very happy to have her in their home.\n\n\n\nIf you would like to be considered as a potential adopter for one of our great dogs, please go to our website- www.luckymuttsrescue.org and submit an application. Our application process includes landlord approval and vet checks. Please make sure all of your information is current and accurate, including a valid email address and phone numbers. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and/or cancel your application.  We strive to process all applications in a timely manner, but with the high volume of applications we are receiving, it is taking anywhere from 1-3 weeks.  You may be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions.  Once all of your information is reviewed and if your application is approved, you will be notified via email.  Submitting an application and receiving an approval does not guarantee you will be adopting the dog you applied for.  Once you move to the meet and greet process, you will be contacted by the foster family to further discuss the dog, and answer questions you may have, and if applicable, a meet and greet will be set up at our adoption center.   Meet and greets are only set up with approved applicants, and we require all members in the household to be present, as well as any current dogs in the home. \n\nCurrent Adoption Fees Are:\n$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nBonded pairs vary\n\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test, (if over 6  months) and a certified veterinary inspection. Please be aware, listed dog breeds are based on information provided and cannot be guaranteed.  Submitting an application for a particular dog does not guarantee that you will be the applicant chosen, we receive several applications for each dog. Our adopters are picked based on the needs of the dog, and the home we feel with best fit based on your responses to our application, vet information and landlord requirements.   Approved applicants not chosen for the dog you applied for, will be in active status for a period of six months.  We encourage you to watch Petfinder, Facebook and our website for upcoming dogs.  Should you see a dog that interests you, please send us a Facebook message or an email with your approval number.  Please be patient with us, as Lucky Mutts Rescue is run strictly by volunteers and many of us work full time jobs, have families and also foster dogs. Thank you for considering Lucky Mutts Rescue for your next furry family member!",

Oscar's adoption fee is $275 which covers his neuter, vaccinations, microchip and any additional medical care he may have needed while in the rescues care. We are a foster based rescue, we do not house dogs at a facility. Age and breed, is NLR's best guess as we often don't know who or what mom and dad are.

Shes not one to play but loves attention, including belly and ear rubs, and is very happy just being by your side but does well when left alone. She is content being in her crate and enters it willingly at night to sleep. When we are away she is left to roam the house and does fine if trash is secured. Shes okay in her crate when were away but happier being out of it. She is very calm and well-behaved but she does like to eat tissue. Be sure to secure the trash and not leave tissue where she can get to it. She barks and jumps on reflections and shadows at times but it seems to be more of a curiosity and not a concern. Medications: For her heart, she is on Vetmedin and Enalapril, easily taken with her food.",

You need a person all your own.\" So I sat down to write my bio for the nice people here at the Potter League, because apparently that's the kind of thing they do - find nice people for extremely intelligent and lovable, slightly goofy, playful and remarkably handsome dogs who are...I shudder to type this...couchless. That's right: I have no couch to call my own. Could you be persuaded to volunteer yours?\n\nAll kidding aside, Rhett is one happy and playful dude. His tail never stops wagging and he is hoping to land himself in home that will include both lots of adventures and lots of snuggly couch time for naps. Older kids? Rhett says bring 'em on! He is an outgoing guy who just loves every person he meets and will flourish in a home where he can shine as your ONLY pet. \n\nHe can't wait to meet you, so fill out an application at www.potterleague.org and then give our Animal Care & Adoption Center a call at 401-846-8276 to set up an appointment today.",

I am a little shy to new people but with treats and soft coaxing I can be very affectionate. Although I am very energetic, I am recommended with older calmer children.\n\nI may match with another dog, pending a meet and greet (preferably males). I may chase cats and will need a slow positive introduction.\n\nI am strongly recommended with a physically fenced in yard. I may require it, pending your previous experience, location, and other plans for containment. I am not a fit for an apartment.\n\nI will make a very nice companion for the right situation. .\n\nBefore applying for me, please research both of my breed mixtures characteristics. I may be perfect for some adopter's lifestyle but may be more than some are ready for\n\nWe are open by appointment only for approved applicants.

He has a very sweet disposition and is a model of tranquility.  \n\nFlaco lived on the streets with a homeless drug addict, but when the man was arrested and taken away for drug rehab, our rescuer brought Flaco home with her. He was a really scared and defenseless dog but is now recovering from all of his trauma. \n\nHe now has all of his shots and has been fixed as well as having his teeth cleaned.  He certainly deserves all the love that you can give him, since he suffered so much in his life.  We are looking for a forever home for him where he will be adored and cherished for the wonderful little guy that he is.\n",

He was dumped in a NY Kill shelter. He is shy at first but warms up once he gets comfortable. He needs someone that can give him patience and approach him slowly until he gets to know them. He is good with other dogs and is okay with cats too. He will need some time to adjust in a home as he does have some fear issues.\n\nBentley has some quirks and we have hired a trainer, so his adopter will need to follow and continue with his training. He feel he should be in an adult only home based on his fear.\n\nBentley was rescued from Staten Island AC, he did have some fear aggression issues when we took him in. He is a corgi pit mix, and with his foster home he is wonderful. We hired a trainer where he stayed for over a month. He has learned commands and does not show fear aggression with us anymore, but he needs an experienced adopter who will continue to work with him, and when going into a new home he will need to overcome his fear again. His trainer can work with the adopter, phone calls, zoom, whatever and will always help throughout his whole life. We have a list of commands for Bentley that we want the new adopter to work with him so he does not forget what he has learned. We do not want Bentley to fail. In his foster home Bentley is housebroken, loving, and good with other dogs but does need time to get to know the other dogs. He is good with cats also. Initially it takes him time to get to know bigger dogs as he may be a little fearful with them in the beginning. But his foster home has 10 dogs big and small and he is good with all of them and the Cats too. He is very good in a crate, and lots of his commands revolve around the crate. He loves being walked and going out in the yard. Bentley is up to date on shots, neutered and microchipped. He loves snuggling with his person on the couch and is well behaved when left alone. He deserved to be saved, and he deserves a home that will love and give him the time to overcome his fears.",

I like to observe my surroundings and ask for attention calmly. I do have energy, just not wiggly as my siblings. I am recommended with children 8+, possibly younger pending approved application.\n\nI may require a physically fenced in yard pending your previous experience, location, and other plans for containment. I am not a fit for an apartment.\n\nI may match with another dog pending a meet and greet. I should be trainable with a dog friendly cat, using a slow positive introduction.\n\nI am a sweet boy with lots of love and potential. Before applying for me, please research both of my breed mixtures characteristics. I may be perfect for some adopter's lifestyle but may be more than some are ready for.\n\nWe are open by appointment only for approved applicants.

Max is a very sweet and loving, good natured boy that does great with other dogs and is fine with cats.  He is very playful and enjoys chasing balls, belly rubs, walks, and LOVES to play tug.  Max has good leash manners and does know some basic commands but could use continued work and training which will be an easy task given his motivation for treats.  Max is still very young and does have his bouts of playful, mischievous energy but with regular exercise he settles down quickly.  He is house trained and crate trained but doesn particulary enjoy the crate.  He gets a bit of separation anxiety so he will do best in a home where his humans are home more than gone.\n\nSoyer 'Max' Ferdinand is up to date on shots and preventatives and is microchipped.   His adoption fee is $250 plus any additional donation you feel appropriate.  Our adoption fee is set to a level to make adoptions happen.  They do not cover our costs. Thank you for your generosity and interest in our dogs!   \n\nAll dogs adopted locally through SGDR receive a free six-week session of obedience classes and a lifetime of behavior support through our Project REWARD program with trainer Charlotte Blake.\n\nYou must have an approved application before being able to visit a dog. Visit our website below for an adoption application https://www.snootygiggles.com/dog-application/\n\nIf you expect to leave the dog alone for long periods of time, please do not consider adopting a puppy.  Puppies need lots of attention and companionship.  Thanks.\n\nAll known information about the animal is listed above. We do our best to give accurate information, but most of our dogs are rescues and do not come with a known history.",

            "description": "Hi I\u2019m Darby! I\u2019m a one year old, 41lb, black lab mix. I\u2019m an energetic pup with lots of love to give. I want to love everyone, humans, dogs and cats. My foster sister cat doesn\u2019t want to play with me though. She tries to avoid me whenever I want to play. Sometimes I think it\u2019s because I still haven\u2019t realized how big I am. I have two favorite things. My first favorite is toys. I will chew apart any toy you put in front of me. My foster mom is glad that I only chew toys and not anything in the house. My second favorite thing is hills!!! Yes, hills! I have to stop and look at every hill I walk past. I always want to run up and down them. Speaking of walks, I walk really well on a leash. I stay pretty close unless I stop to sniff something. I also take my time to go to the bathroom. But make sure I go before we go back inside! I\u2019m notorious for not going to the bathroom on a walk and wanting to go out again after. I\u2019m pretty good at pawing at the door to let you know I have to go, but sometimes I\u2019m not so good at telling you in time. A regular potty schedule helps me not have any accidents! I\u2019m excited to find a furever family who will run, play, cuddle and love me.\n\nIf you would like to be considered as a potential adopter for one of our great dogs, please go to our website- www.luckymuttsrescue.org and submit an application. Our application process includes landlord approval and vet checks. Please make sure all of your information is current and accurate, including a valid email address and phone numbers. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and/or cancel your application.  We strive to process all applications in a timely manner, but with the high volume of applications we are receiving, it is taking anywhere from 1-3 weeks.  You may be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions.  Once all of your information is reviewed and if your application is approved, you will be notified via email.  Submitting an application and receiving an approval does not guarantee you will be adopting the dog you applied for.  Once you move to the meet and greet process, you will be contacted by the foster family to further discuss the dog, and answer questions you may have, and if applicable, a meet and greet will be set up at our adoption center.   Meet and greets are only set up with approved applicants, and we require all members in the household to be present, as well as any current dogs in the home. \n\nCurrent Adoption Fees Are:\n$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nBonded pairs vary\n\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test, (if over 6  months) and a certified veterinary inspection. Please be aware, listed dog breeds are based on information provided and cannot be guaranteed.  Submitting an application for a particular dog does not guarantee that you will be the applicant chosen, we receive several applications for each dog. Our adopters are picked based on the needs of the dog, and the home we feel with best fit based on your responses to our application, vet information and landlord requirements.   Approved applicants not chosen for the dog you applied for, will be in active status for a period of six months.  We encourage you to watch Petfinder, Facebook and our website for upcoming dogs.  Should you see a dog that interests you, please send us a Facebook message or an email with your approval number.  Please be patient with us, as Lucky Mutts Rescue is run strictly by volunteers and many of us work full time jobs, have families and also foster dogs. Thank you for considering Lucky Mutts Rescue for your next furry family member!",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Elizabeth, but some call me Lizzie. I'm a sweet and loving 3 year old, 53lb lab mix looking for a place to call my forever home. \nI spent most of my life as an outdoor dog in the South, so it's taking me a while to get used to the good life of a house pet. I'm a little bit skittish and nervous around sudden movements and loud or weird noises, but I get better and better every day. \nI'm working on learning to go outside to do my business and to get in my kennel nicely. Like I said, I didn't live in a house before so all of this is pretty new to me. But I'm a smart girl and I know I can quickly learn if I'm guided gently and taught what to do. I'm already getting a lot better! I'm also not a huge barker and I love to destroy fluffy toys. I like to run around and play, but I also enjoy relaxing next to my person at night after I got some exercise.\nI love walks! I walk nicely and pull very little, mostly just when something startles me. I think that'll get better as I get used to the hustle and bustle of the city and realize that I'm safe with my person by my side.\nMy foster parents believe that I will do best in a home that is relatively quiet, with not a lot of people coming in and out and with no small children since they can be a little unpredictable and that's a little scary for me. This might all get better in the future, but right now I need to ease into all of these new experiences. I like dogs that are nice and chill! Right now I live with a girl dog that's a couple years older than me and I like to follow her around and follow her lead. She makes me feel safe. My ideal home would have another dog that is confident, gentle, and laid back so I can learn from them.\nI know that not everyone might be up for loving a dog that requires a little bit more patience and a gentle guiding hand, but if you open up your heart and your home to me, get ready... because I have soo much love and loyalty to give! You will become my whole world!\n\nIf you would like to be considered as a potential adopter for one of our great dogs, please go to our website- www.luckymuttsrescue.org and submit an application. Our application process includes landlord approval and vet checks. Please make sure all of your information is current and accurate, including a valid email address and phone numbers. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and/or cancel your application.  We strive to process all applications in a timely manner, but with the high volume of applications we are receiving, it is taking anywhere from 1-3 weeks.  You may be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions.  Once all of your information is reviewed and if your application is approved, you will be notified via email.  Submitting an application and receiving an approval does not guarantee you will be adopting the dog you applied for.  Once you move to the meet and greet process, you will be contacted by the foster family to further discuss the dog, and answer questions you may have, and if applicable, a meet and greet will be set up at our adoption center.   Meet and greets are only set up with approved applicants, and we require all members in the household to be present, as well as any current dogs in the home. \n\nCurrent Adoption Fees Are:\n$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nBonded pairs vary\n\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test, (if over 6  months) and a certified veterinary inspection. Please be aware, listed dog breeds are based on information provided and cannot be guaranteed.  Submitting an application for a particular dog does not guarantee that you will be the applicant chosen, we receive several applications for each dog. Our adopters are picked based on the needs of the dog, and the home we feel with best fit based on your responses to our application, vet information and landlord requirements.   Approved applicants not chosen for the dog you applied for, will be in active status for a period of six months.  We encourage you to watch Petfinder, Facebook and our website for upcoming dogs.  Should you see a dog that interests you, please send us a Facebook message or an email with your approval number.  Please be patient with us, as Lucky Mutts Rescue is run strictly by volunteers and many of us work full time jobs, have families and also foster dogs. Thank you for considering Lucky Mutts Rescue for your next furry family member!",

He is a friendly dog.  hw-; lab mix; 1/11; 1 yr old; 51 lbs\n\n\nRichard has no idea just how much fun he is!  This sunny faced, athletic framed fellow takes running and playing to that next level!   A free spirit with his book wide open,  Richard has lots of love and energy to spare and found an excellent outlet for both in nicely playing, running around and wrestling with a male and female dog.  Never meeting a stranger, Richard can be stronger on the leash but it's all in good faith...to find that next friend and or activity to engage in!  Richard enjoys playing a mild game of fetch,  is huggy and kissy and loves to be the center of attention.  If having a slow moving couch potato kind of dog is the ideal match for you then Richard would politely ask you to consider another dog!  He is all about fun and games and going and doing!  Let the party begin with Richard! \n\nhttps://youtu.be/oaZzqs3vodE\n",

            "description": "Please contact Laura (laura@pawsandprayers.org) for more information about this pet. My name is Biscuit and my favorite pastime is peeing on any tree or bush that looks like it needs it. I can't help myself. Don't judge me. I like what I like. Other things I like is having my head rubbed, snuggling on the couch with you and taking a nice walk. Oh and I do love my sweater! You see, I went undercover for a while and you couldn't recognize me. My coat made me look like I could be on the welcome to Jamaica poster. I had dreadlocks all over-even coming from my ears! My behind hurt because it didn't have the regular maintenance I needed. I constantly ran in circles trying to help it but I couldn't reach it. This was very frustrating. I was kept in a garage away from the family I knew. I was jealous of the new baby they had and I wasn't being treated like their baby anymore. I was sad, frustrated, alone and in pain. My foster mom didn't like this so she whisked me away to a doctor who gave me my much overdue vaccines and a wonderful spa day. I feel SO much better now that you can tell what I am! I'm a 30lb Spaniel and am about 6yrs old. I like to meet new people and say hello but can tend to change my mind after a few minutes and growl. I need them to think that I can protect myself even though I'm small. I've just been through so much and it will take a few weeks for me to fully trust you. I'm not good with kids because, hey, I just don't like sharing with those loud and crazy acting mini people. I live with 4 large foster brothers and sisters. They made me nervous at first because they're HUGE compared to me so I just steered clear of them. After my spa day, I wasn't tired at all! I felt so amazing that I decided to start seeing what this toy box was about that all these dogs thought was so great. I grabbed the biggest bone I could find so everyone knew how bad to the bone I really am. I think I fooled them. I even acted like I may be interested in playing with the smallest one but the whole crew came my way and I ducked out. Don't get me wrong, I am now running with the pack all day but they just get so crazy when they play. I'd prefer a home with no children and not too much chaos. I'm middle aged and don't have time for drama or craziness anymore. I'd rather spend my time getting love. I can get growly from time to time if you're rubbing near my butt. Sometimes I seem to like the booty scratch but sometimes I just don't. When you hear me growl, please stop what you're doing. This is the only way I can tell you I don't like it. I was also nicked on my ear by some groomer lady who was hurrying with me and I now really hate grooming appointments. This is a necessity for me but I will need muzzled and possibly a pill to help me not want to groom her fingers! If you think you have everything I need, then put an application in and email my foster mom. She is busy trying to keep up with making me feel loved. Thanks for reading my story. She actually says I'm a very easy houseguest. I go into my crate with ease but would prefer someone who is home more than not. My adoption fee is $300 which includes my neuter, vaccines, microchip and heartworm, flea and tick prevention.",

(Or Ruge, or Rugey-baby). I am now super confident in my foster home. I am FINALLY starting to play with toys, I can roam the house freely even when my foster parents leave. I was panicking in my crate so they decided to trust me, and I proved them right. I spent most of the time lounging on the couch, chewing on a bone and sleeping while they were gone. #bigboy\n\nWith my newfound confidence, I also like to pull on the leash now. It\u2019s a work in progress they say, but I\u2019m just soooo excited to see the world outside the backyard that I just want to go, go, go. Aside from the leash thing I am still a perfectly sweet boy. I like to chase my foster sister around the backyard, chase the bunnies out, and I\u2019m starting to work on fetch too!\n\nFENCED YARD 100% required \n\nWe would recommend that he be adopted into a home with another playful dog his size and everything level.\n\nNot eligible to be only dog in home \n\nNO APARTMENTS  \n\nInterested in adopting me? \nApply at: www.CompassRoseRescue.org\n\nADOPTION FEE:\n$450",

Kermit was transferred into us from a rescue partner if northern ND where he did spend some time in a foster home. In that home he lived with a female dog that he did well with and since coming to the shelter he has found some other canine friends as well. He has been in to meet a few kitties and was good but has never lived with them so we can never guarantee behaviors in the home. Kermit is working on his basic manners (he is trying hard not to jump)and does well on leash walks. He keeps his kennel tidy and has proven to be accident free in a home. His perfect day would be some playtime with a friend in the yard and some night time cuddles on the couch.

            "description": "Rogan's zest for life is as big as his smile (which is pretty stinking big when he's having a good time)! While a little hand-shy and hesitant with new people, once he's comfortable around you, you can pretty much fold him up, wrestle him, flip him over for belly rubs, and he loves all of it. He's got personality for miles and has a definite zest for life - he balances play with snuggles and sometimes mixes them both together in zoomies that end full-speed in your lap where he'll curl into you while chewing on his toy. He also has a bubbly enthusiasm for other dogs - he enjoys watching them from afar but also loves to play with them in the yard. He is an adorable little watermelon and you're going to wish you could just nibble on because he's that stinking cute! Rogan is around 5 years old and weighs 44 lbs.\n\nVisit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog to set up a meet!\nDue to COVID-19, CITY DOGS is currently doing adoptions by APPOINTMENT ONLY. Please visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog to request a meet and greet! \n\nQuestions? Email: citydogs@city.cleveland.oh.us | Call: (216) 664-3476\nVisit: 9203 Detroit Avenue Cleveland, OH 44102\n\nHours:\n10 AM - 3 PM Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday\n10 AM - 6 pm Tuesday & Thursday\n\nFee: $61 | Includes spay/neuter, shots, microchip, license, 30 days free pet insurance (when registered upon adoption)\n\nThe CITY DOGS mission is to increase adoptions from the City Kennel by changing the image of the pit bulls who make up the majority of the kennel population, by preparing all adoptable dogs in the kennel for lives in loving homes and by creating as many opportunities as possible for the public to meet and get to know our dogs for the terrific pets they are meant to be.\n\nOur Adoption Process...\nHere's a little about how things work:\nAll of the CITY DOGS posted for adoption are available for direct adoption from the kennel, unless noted otherwise. You must schedule a meet with a dog in advance - we are not currently accepting walk-ins. Please look online first to see if there are any dogs you think would be a good fit for your home before scheduling a meet. To get the process started, visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog and fill out the form. One of our adoption counselors will get in touch to schedule and confirm your meet! At the kennel, an adoption counselor will introduce you and your family to the adoptable dogs, share information we know about them, and discuss our suggested ways for successfully integrating a new dog into your home. You are welcome to meet multiple dogs. If the dog you adopt is already fixed, he or she may leave with you that day - otherwise, the dog can go home after receiving the spay or neuter surgery.)\n\nAbout Our Dogs: All available dogs have gone through a behavioral and medical assessment. This assessment is a snapshot of who the dog is at that given time. We cannot make any guarantees with regard to behavior, temperament or health of any City Dog once they are in the home. Most of our dogs are picked up as strays, so we do not know what kind of home environment they were living in (i.e. with kids, other dogs or other cats), nor do we know if most of them are house trained. Everything we know about them is based on volunteer and staff observations. We do have some dogs in foster homes, where they will have more information about how the dog is in a home environment. It is very hard to tell with certainty whether or not a dog will be good with kids, cats or another dog. If you have kids in the home or another dog, we do require that they be present for a meet and greet with the dog you are considering for adoption.\n\nHeath/Vaccinations: Dogs that are adopted directly from the kennel need to go to your personal vet within two weeks of leaving the kennel. All dogs receive their DAPPL, Rabies, and Bordatella vaccines, though you may be required to get follow up boosters. All dogs come microchipped and with a Cuyahoga County license.?  \n\n\n\n \n",

He is a model passenger in the car, loves to catch snackies you toss to him, and has a fun loving personality once he gets to know you. \n\nHis simple pleasure are: \n- Fetch \n- Snackies \n- Couch time \n\nHe'll even dance in circles when he is excited about any of these things. He is such a sweet little companion. \n\nHe has a kind, gentle soul and enjoys snuggling up with a soft blanket on the couch. He likes to chew on his tennis ball and dog toys, but he'll occasionally grab one to use as a pillow. Not only does he love chewing on tennis balls, he's a rockstar when it comes to playing fetch. All in all, Spark is a sweet and trusting dog that would make a great companion. Between his naps, he'll come up and rest his head on you for pets and snuggles. He's a perfect balance of wanting to be by your side and content doing his own thing (which usually entails finding the perfect napping spot).\n\nSo, if you're looking for a balance between couch buddy and walking partner, reach out to the CASPCA today!\n\n\n Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: White Weight: 37.5lbs Age: 10yrs 5mths 0wks Animal has been Neutered",

            "description": "Como is an adult chihuahua mix who came to the rescue from a rural shelter. It\u2019s clear he was well loved prior to landing in the foster system. He is very cuddly and loves nothing more than being in the laps of his foster parents. He enjoys following around the young dog in the home but is not too interested in playing with her. He has learned to leave the cat alone as well as how to use the dog door. Como is a loving gentleman who would do best in a home with attentive owners, other small mature dogs, dog savvy cats, and/or older children.\u00a0\n\nFlagstaff adopters preferred. \n\nWE DO NOT ADOPT OUT OF STATE\n\nPLEASE NO PHONE CALLS \nWe are an all volunteer organization.

She gave me up because she couldn\u2019t give me the exercise and training I need, and said I should really belong to someone with a fenced in yard where I can run around and play. I have a very sweet personality and love to cuddle with my humans, but I have been through a lot of change, so I sometimes get scared in new or unknown situations. The humans call this \u201cfear reactivity.\u201d I have been in training to work on my behavior, but I still need someone who can spend time working with me on my reactivity and confidence, and give me lots of exercise and love! I am happiest zooming around outside, I love to play in puddles, and I am great at learning new tricks! Once I am comfortable in my new home, I will make a super loyal and loving companion.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pooch, please download the Adoption Questionnaire (farescue.org/pdf_files/questionnaire_canine.pdf), fill it out and email it back to us at info@farescue.org or fax (310) 362-0321.

I am spayed, UTD on vaccines, HW negative, dewormed, current on flea/HW preventative, and microchipped. I am house broken and crate trained and good with other dogs, cats, and children. Won't you please give me my forever home?Thank you for your interest in our adoptable pet. Please note that while we do our best to describe the pet in detail, some items such as breed and age can be \"\"best guesses\"\" since many of our animals come in without previous records.

APPLICATIONS ARE CONSIDERED IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY ARE RECEIVED. http://www.redbarnrescue.com/adoption-application.html\n___________\n\nDaisy is an adorable little chihuahua/whippet mix around 4 years old and 10 pounds. This tiny girl is very sweet, but like many dogs her size she can be skittish when it comes to the big world around her.  We will require a home with a secure, fenced yard for Daisy. A nice quiet home without children would be best.  She does like other dogs (who can play appropriately for her size) and her foster believes that she would be indifferent with cats. \n\nIt has taken Daisy some time to be comfortable in her foster home, so we expect that she will need a patient adopter who will give her time to get comfortable. That's when her inner goofball comes out and she likes to play!  As you can see, she is very photogenic and has her Snapchat game on point. :-)\n\nDaisy is mostly housetrained but still has some accidents and nervous/excited urination. That may resolve itself when she gets home in a routine and feels secure. Her foster mom said she is a very special little girl and we are excited to be part of her journey and look forward to heling her find her people!\n\nDaisy is spayed, microchipped, vaccinated and up to date on heartworm and flea/tick preventative.  Our $300 adoption fee helps to cover these expenses.\n\n",

            "description": "Dog Name: Anderson\n\nSex: Neutered Male\n\nBreed: Black lab mix\n\nAge: Estimated about 8 years\n\nWeight: 63 lbs\n\nMedical Needs: Heartworm +, will receive treatment 2/8 and 2/9 at 9:40 through Grass Roots Rescue. It will consist of getting an injection 2 days in a row, followed by 30 days of keeping him calm/limiting activity. He'll also get blood work that day as we are keeping an eye on his kidney function\n\nHousebroken: Yes. He doesn't alert you to go out, so keeping him a schedule is best\n\nCrate trained: Yes. Toss a treat in he will go in with no problem. He's quiet while he's in there.\n\nGood in the car: Yes. He will initially try to be up front with you, but takes correction well and will just chill in the back once you set the boundary.\n\nGood on a leash: He's a bit \"hot out of the gate\" bc he gets real excited to be walked, but less than a minute later he just trots along with minimal/no pulling.\n\nEnergy level: Medium\n\nNeed a fenced in yard: No\n\nDog Friendly: Yes\n\nIf yes, does your foster need another dog in its adoptive home? No.\n\nCat Friendly? The shelter he was at previously said yes; current foster does not have cats\n\nKid Friendly: Unsure, but likely\n\nIf yes, what's the youngest child you'd recommend they be placed with? 10 and up due to size and sharp teeth. He's not an incessant jumper, but will jump if excited. He's also likely lived outside most of his life and had to eat whatever was available. As a result, he's missing some teeth and his bottom canines are filed to a VERY sharp point. He's NOT any type of aggressive, but giving treats can be tricky as it's easy to scratch your hand on his tooth in the exchange. He's a good catcher, so we've been throwing them to him during training instead of hand feeding.\n\nSpecial traits that make your foster special or that we need to know about them?\n\nAnderson is an all around great dog. He's a very friendly, happy boy. He seeks out attention and pets, and loves to be around people. He's shown minimal interest in toys and hasn't been destructive of household items. As previously mentioned, he's likely been an outside dog most his life. He will need continued basic boundary work (get your head out of the trash can, keep your nose away from the oven), but takes direction very well. He understands \"no\" and will stop when told. He's very food motivated, and has already learned to sit on command. He pays attention to his handlers and looks for instruction. He wants to be a lap dog so badly; he'll lay on top of you if you'll let him. He makes a fantastic weighted blanket",

Well, if I lived with people who had a yard and time to play with me, I\u2019d probably run from corner to corner then rollover for tummy rubs. I lived in a small apartment with a very busy parent and I had too much pent-up puppy energy.  I\u2019m housetrained and know basic commands. I do need help learning not to guard my food, water and toys. If you have the love, patience, and energy it takes to love and help me grow, I will be the most amazing Pyr ever. I just need the right place and owner to blossom. If you think you\u2019re the one, please email info@greatpyratlanta.com",

            "description": "Take this Houston husky on your mountain adventures! Scully is a truly good boy who wants to please at his core. He's very smart and learned to \"sit\" very quickly without any prior training. He likes walks and I'm sure he could go even further if it weren't 70 degrees in December here. We had to take breaks to give him pets and love to keep going. Scully is a very excited boy and can be a bit mouthy when he wants affection. He will nip at heels and pants and will need redirection to stop this behavior. He has a lot of energy and while he is dog friendly, he sometimes doesn't realize when he's being rude or getting in their face too much. He is good about alerting when he needs to go outside. GSD experience needed...Scully needs alot of mental and physical stimulation and we recommend a home with older children if any. \n\nHW+ simply means the dog has tested positive for heart worms in our screening process. We utilize what is called the fast-kill method which means we place the dog on antibiotics for 30 days and then administer 3 injections in increments afterward. The cost to treat heart worms is rather steep. However, thanks to our generous donors, we are able to cover that cost for our adopters so long as they go to our veterinarian, Red Rocks Animal Center in Lakewood.\n\n\n\tApproved Applicants may make the adoption fee payment by clicking donate above. Partial adoption fees will not hold a dog.\n\tDogs adopted with our rescue come with FREE training from #GoodPup to help you build strong bonds from the start!\n\tIf upon meeting the dog of your choosing at an adoption event you find that you aren't a good match, your deposit will be refunded minus a 10% administration fee.\n\tAdoption fees include vaccines up until time of adoption, microchip, spay/neuter and 1st 30 days of free Pet insurance. We are not affiliated with Pet First pet insurance. (you have to sign up for the insurance or it will not go into effect). \n\tAdopters can go to our vet for medical issues that may arise in 1st 3 days of adoption. \n\tThe dogs in our care are fostered in Colorado, Texas, and New Mexico. While all dogs are picked up during our scheduled times, sometimes transport dates change due to unforeseen circumstances.",

            "description": "PUPDATE JAN-30-2021: Since the last pupdate Viggo's adoption fell through but I have learned a few more things about him. He is not great with cats. He will chase them so I've been using a squirt bottle when he does that and he's learning to leave them alone. He really only wants to play but Viggo is a very strong boy, even with a bum leg. He tries to play with his foster Mom's kids but they're mostly older so it doesn't work so well. His leg is doing better but he still has Dogtor visits that need to be made (which are covered by the rescue). It looks like surgery won't be needed but he night have a limp. He LOVES to go outside and run like the wind. He's really good about doing his business outside and will bark if he needs to do so. His favorite place is still on his foster Mom's bed under a fleece next to her leg or on her lap. He's a very loving boy.\n\nPUPDATE JAN-13-2021: Well, Viggo went to the Dogtor and it looks like he's going to need a few more visits to him before he's ready to go to his forever home. We will be updating when that time gets closer. Since then, however, we found that Viggo tolerates some cats and other he snips at and chases, which has landed him in hot water with his foster mom. She's found out that he doesn't like to be squirted and he instantly stops. He's starting to play even with his splint on but hasn't quite mastered the steps to the bed yet. We will be updating on his health as we find out more and when he will be ready for his new home.\n\nPUPDATE JAN-10-2021: Viggo is a very sweet, 21 pound, 7 yr.young, brown Min Pin mix. He came to us with a broken leg so he has to get that fixed before he can go to his new forever home. He gets along great with other dogs or cats. He likes to sleep on the bed close to his foster Mom and burrow under the covers. Stay tuned for more information to come.\n\n\nVisit me, Jordan, Boss of EveryPuppy of the Universe, by going to the FluffyButts Rescue Resort link above.\n\nFill out an application on our website (www.fluffybutts.com) if you're interested in being adopted by this cute kid. It's the first step in the pawcess. \n\nADOPTIONS: We don't let the fact that you might live out of state stop any adoption that's meant to be, but you MUST be willing to drive, or fly, all the way to pick up your new family member. We do not ship these kids on airplanes by themselves - we think they'd have a hard time getting through security without their rabies tag setting off the metal detectors. If the kid needs a health certificate because they're flying home, that will be an expense for the new family.\n\nADOPTION DONATIONS: When you see the adoption donation amounts, we'd like you to know that 90% of the time the donation amount doesn't even come close to covering that kid's dogtor bills. This is definitely not a money-making venture. We're usually so far in the hole but the impawtant thing is to get these kids the medical care they need and help them find the pawfect family. That's our top pawority. (I just can't resist using \"paw\" whenever I can!) \n\nPOTTY TRAINING: Please note that we NEVER say our kids are 100% potty-trained. How stupid would we be to say something like that? If you're willing to be trained by your new family member, please fill out an application. If you're looking for a totally potty-trained kid, you may as well stop at the toy store on your way home from work and buy a stuffed toy because those are the only reliable ones to NOT potty in your home. There is a period of adjustment, not just for the new family member but for everyone in the house. You must be patient, understanding, and willing to work with your new family member. It can take anywhere from several days to several months. You must be 100% committed to this, it's a lifetime commitment. \n\nHUG AND KISS YOUR KIDLETS LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW. \n\nPlease be patient with us - we're taking care of a lot of kids - our own and the foster kids - and we have families, homes and full time jobs. We're giving meds to the sick kids, playing with the healthy kids, and loving on all the kids. We're doing their laundry, trying to teach them manners and where to do their business, and cleaning up their accidents. In other words, we're just a little busy but we'll return email inquiries just as fast as we pawssibly can. Thanks!",

You can also find\n\na description of our process on that same page. Puppies will not be available to be seen until their 10 day quarantine has passed. Our adoption fee is $200 for adults and $275 for puppies, which covers the cost of the spay/neuter, age appropriate shots and tests, medications to bring the dog to full health, and a free visit with one of our approved vets after adoption. The majority of dogs at CCRC are obtained from animal control centers, so there is often very little known about their history or even current habits. You can always expect to do some training, regardless of whether you adopt a dog or a puppy, including crate training, house training, and basic manners. CCRC provides a variety of materials and resources to assist you with this, as well as telephone support.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Lucy is a lean, mean agile machine! She has legs for miles! We believe she is a 1-2 year old Manchester terrier/ chihuahua mix. She can jump a 3.5 foot gate from a sitting position. Who knows what she can clear with a running start! This dog is so athletic she would do extremely well with an active family! Hiking, agility, running would all be perfect for Lucy! She is super smart and would excel at anything put in front of her!\n\nLucy came to us from Texas as an owner surrender. She was about to get spayed when her foster mom thought she might be pregnant. Sure enough Lucy gave birth to 3 little boys on 10/01/2020! The boys are ready to find their forever homes and Lucy is to! She was an amazing mom and so much fun. She made the foster moms job easy for sure.\n\nLucy is the funniest little dog. She gets along with most of the dogs in her foster home but can be a rough, dominant player. Some dogs love it and others don't so if you have another dog please take this into consideration. Lucy appears to be housebroken with a doggy door and fully fenced yard but we always say please expect accidents while she acclimates to a new home and routine. We would like to place Lucy in a home with a fully fenced yard (no invisible or electric fences) and no chain link.\n\nLucy walks pretty well on a leash and is good in the car. She loves her family and truly wants to do anything to please you. She can be shy initially when new people come over and sometimes will even bark at them but she recovers pretty quickly especially for a treat.

            "description": "Meet Mishti & Chutki, a sweet, friendly and loving bonded pair rescued from the streets of Haryana, near New Dehli, India and coming to America very soon. Like many dogs in India, their mom was homeless, living behind an office building in large office complex when she gave birth to 5 puppies. Their guardians discovered them when they were a month old and took mom and all her pups in to their office center so they wouldn't be killed by traffic. They took them in and cared for and doted on them as a member of the family. As you see in their video, they are two friendly, loving and happy girls. All the dogs have been rehomed except for Mishti & Chutki and their primary guardian wants our help in find them a great forever home together here in America.\n\nTheir guardian shares the following: Mishti & Chutki are approximately 1 year old and weigh about 35lbs, They look like hound dog mix but in India most strays are Indian Pariah or Pye mix. Mishti (Means full of Sweetness) is the golden girl & the brown is Chutki (Means Youngest). Chutki has a slight defect in her left front paw, but this doesn't stop her activities. Both pups are adorable, friendly, housebroken, good with people and very smart and eager to learn.\n\nChutki is bit shy, calm & laid back. She needs a little more effort then Mishti due to her shy nature. She follows Mishti's lead. She loves walks, playing with her toys,going up and down stairs, getting treats, and cuddling and being petted and told how lovely she is once she's settled in. She doesn't like to share her bed, however (go figure). She is so very cute and loveable. She is a happy girl and she doesn't let her deformed foot stop her from enjoying life.\n\nMishti is more energetic than Chutki and would be a great companion for those who like to do running or hiking as she is always full of energy and up for an adventure. She likes to play with toys and eats almost everything she's given, and loves dog cookies & treats. She is the braver of the two girls. She is curious and friendly but can be aloof and independent. Like Chutki, she needs a little time to get to know you and settle into her surroundings.\n\nMishti & Chutki are spayed and up to date on core vaccines. The adoption fee is $425 for each pup. Please note that training is highly recommended for all young dogs. As with all rescue animals, breed determination cannot be validated without genetic testing.\n\nVisit WWW.LULUSRESCUE.ORG and click on the ADOPT tab for an overview of Lulu's Rescue adoption process.\n\nThanks for adopting and saving a life!",

            "description": "Meet Vlad! Poor Vlad was surrendered by his owners in South Carolina, but luckily for him he went to one of our partner shelters who took the very best care of him before sending him up to us.  Vlad has been neutered and is up to date on all shots.  He is a shy boy and takes a bit to warm up, but just needs a family to show him that the world is not such a scary place and he can trust people.\nVlad gets along well with other dogs and children and once he warms up all he wants to do is snuggle. He is about 2 years old and a VERY handsome boy.\n\n**PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING**\n\nIf you are interested in adopting any of the puppies, our adoption fee is $495 ( puppies) $375 (adults) which includes transportation from the South and we do suggest putting a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several littermates.\n\n**Please understand that we are a volunteer based organization. While our volunteers try to answer all emails/questions as quickly as possible, below please find answers to some of our most frequently asked questions. We ask that you please read these FAQ's to see if your question has already been answered before emailing additional questions:\n\n- If a dog or puppy is listed on Petfinder, they are still available. Please do not email asking if they are still available. If a dog or puppy is still listed, then we are still accepting applications :-) We do not go on a first come first serve basis, but on best fit for the family and most importantly, the puppy or dog.\n\n- We are taking our best guess on breed and size when fully-grown (or already an adult), based on the puppy's/dog\u2019s physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. We rarely are able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. \n\n- Our dogs/puppies are either at our Adoption Center in Brewster, NY, in foster care, or are adopted straight from transport. An application is necessary to meet any dog/puppy. Often, dogs and puppies are spoken for before they arrive. Many people feel more comfortable with a meet and greet which we completely understand and respect, however please know you are taking a chance of that puppy/dog getting adopted by someone else before hand.\n\n- The way to start the process for any dog or puppy is by filling out an application. Applications for foster or adoption can be found at www.snarrnortheast.org and by clicking either adopt or foster from the main menu. If you fill out an application, please make sure you answer all the questions in as much detail as possible and that you receive a confirmation email, otherwise we did NOT receive it.",

            "description": "Sweet Baby Mindy is still looking for her forever ho- ho-home!\n\nMindy is a 3-5yo medium sized Heinz 57 who is full of life & love. She\u2019s maybe 32lb at most.\n\nShe is EXTREMELY FRIENDLY & loves everyone she meets! Mindy is also good with other dogs & has been around cats before & hasn\u2019t seemed phased by them. \n\nMindy is special needs but her handicap certainly does NOT slow her down one bit. Mindy is a Tri paw (yes we may have just made that word up) she has all 4 of her legs but is missing her right rear paw. Again.... this doesn\u2019t slow her down at all.\nShe is presently in foster with five other dogs and out runs every single one of them. She is like lightening zipping around the backyard!\n\nShe is overall a pretty laid back & lazy dog around the house all day long but once it\u2019s time to go outside she does her zoomies & then she done. \n\nShe is housebroken & dosent require a crate when left home alone. She is overall non destructive (but warning she does like playing with shoes) & loves to sleep on the couch or bed. She is also a GREAT SNUGGLER & loves to have human contact!\n\nDue to Mindy\u2019s handicap she would do BEST in a home without tons of stairs & a fenced in yard. She can absolutely go up/down stairs & walk on a leash with no problem we just Recommend this type of home environment just to make things easier for her overall. \n\nMindy absolutely will take advantage of wide open doors or windows and can be a little escape artist we are chalking it up to her having an adventurous side but for her safety doors and windows must be locked and if there are children in the home it is important to make them aware  that she can be an escape artist.\n\n\n\u2022Presently in foster in Northern Delaware \n\nInterested in adopting?\nCONTACT US TODAY! \n\nApplications can be found, completed, and submitted at Www.compassroserescue.org \n\n",

            "description": "Ginger is a gentle, loving 7 year old Australian Cattle dog, husky mix looking for a calm home, with a single person or adult couple who will be home the majority of the time. \n\nShe is a very smart girl who picks up training and routines very quickly.\n\nLikes to be near her people all the time, like a shadow. \n\nWhen left alone, she will look for her person's shoe to bring near her for comfort - will not chew on or damage the shoe though.\n\nEnjoys daily walks and short hikes.\n\nLower to medium energy girl, happy to lay and nap at your feet while you work on the computer, cuddle up with you to watch TV or hangout with you while gardening.\n\nLoves belly rubs and affection from her humans.\n\nLikes going to the beach and staying on the sand, but does not like any kind of water.   \n\nShe's not an incessant barker, but will bark at other dogs and unfamiliar people who come to the door.\n\nSleeps through the night in her bed, your bed or her crate. \n\nNot at all destructive inside or outside, even when left alone for short periods of time.\n\nGinger will only play with toys that you give her, especially her favorite blue octopus.\n\nDog selective and would be best as the only dog in your life. (lived in a foster home with non dominant male dogs her size)\n\nCats are unknown, but not recommended. \n\nWalks well on leash, but will react by barking and pulling if she gets too close to other dogs. This has greatly reduced with focused training. \n\nKnows commands 'sit, stay, paw, leave it, come.\n\nNot a fan of strangers coming to the house or people stepping over her. So would be best if she was crated or put in another room when visitors come to the home. \n\nShe has been very child friendly in her foster home, and loved to cuddle with the kids in bed or on the couch, but we are recommending a home without children.\n\nDue to several moves this last year, since her owner passed away, she has anxiety on long car rides. A doggie seat belt or riding in a crate in the back is best or she will try to join you in the driver's seat. She has shown improvement and we expect that to continue with more positive car ride experiences.\n\nShe is very loyal and protective of her people. \n\nDue to that fear based, protection/guarding issue, she will need a dog experienced adopter willing to help her feel safe.\n\nGinger is 68 lbs. spayed, microchipped, up to date on vaccines, including rabies, heartworm negative and current on prevention. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Ginger, please complete an adoption application on https://www.westernaustralianshepherdrescue.com/.",

I included a picture of her so you can see. She says my papa was a traveling salesman.  Paw brought us to Marley's World Dog Sanctuary because he needed some puppies to love and we have done a great job of taking care of him. ( Actually the owner of the mama was in quarantine and desperate for help,)Through all the baths and shots and icky wormer stuff and drives in the car to the vet, we never fussed any more than necessary. We got neutered last week and a couple of us have already been adopted. There are just three of us left and we are so totally ready to have a family of our own. Paw said the hardest part of having us was trying to get a picture that showed our color. If you watch my whole video you will see that sometimes I look red and sometimes chocolate and sometimes a little silver and sometimes shiny jet black. I can hardly wait to meet you!\nFor more information about me and Marley's World you can go to Marley's World Dog Sanctuary on Facebook, Visit our web page at https://marleyworld.net       Email us at marleysworld@tutanota.com or as a last resort call 870-373-6669.",

She is roughly 5 months old and some variety of pointer mix. \n\nShe was so scared coming to us that her foster mom Ms. Donna worked with her to show her that the world is not so scary... and she can trust her humans. \n\nStill ready to find her forever home she would do best in a home with other confident dogs as well as with owners who have previously had dogs before. \n\nStella may be a little shy coming into your home but will absolutely warm up quickly as long as you give her patience, and understand that she may need some time to settle. \n\nPresently in foster near Centerville Maryland\n\nGood with Dogs, Cats, & Kids\nFenced yard required\nHome with other dogs required\n\nNO APARTMENTS \n\nADOPTION FEE: $500\n\nInterested in fostering or adopting?\nCONTACT US TODAY! \n\n\nApplications can be found, completed, and submitted at Www.compassroserescue.org \n\n",

            "description": "Mea is a 2 year old Canadian dog that found herself in an Ontario shelter after an incident with another dog.  \n\nShe is about 80 pounds and a really nice girl, but lacks training.\n\nShe is powerful, so will need an adopter that can handle the strength of a large breed dog and you must come with large dog breed experience.\n\nMea arrived to the shelter without anything being said about puppies, but when she went in for her spay, she was noted to still be lactating, so she did have a recent litter, likely just being weaned from her.\n\nShe also had some lumps and masses that we had to remove, and sent out for testing, that came back as benign lumps.\n\nMea is great with kids and a super kind girl, and is being fostered with dog savvy kids currently.\n\nShe isn't great however with other dogs.\n\nWhen she was surrendered, it was noted she lived with 2 other medium sized dogs.  However, she did have a serious issue, which led to her being surrendered to the shelter and quarantined.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nFROM THE SENDING SHELTER:\n\nMea was brought to us due to a bite quarantine. \n\nMea broke out of the front screen door, rushed up to someone walking a Cairn Terrier and shook it in her mouth. \n\nOne person was bit trying to get the dog out of her mouth and another person broke their hand from punching her (she now flinches and kind of melts to the ground when hands are raised over her). \n\nThe victims dog is okay. \n\nAfter her quarantine was completed we tested her with cats and dogs \u2013 she is quite typical of a boxer when it comes to introductions and playing. She got along okay with a Chihuahua and confident cat, but she does play quite rough and tends to box and stomp so currently I wouldn\u2019t leave her unattended or off-leash with either. \n\nMedium-large dogs she gets along with great, just very playful and the other dogs need to be tolerant. \n\nAside from that her personality is absolutely hysterical. She gets the zoomies quite often and runs around the room with her butt tucked hilariously. \n\nShe POUNCES on squeaky toys, throws treats in the air for herself and LIVES for cuddles. She will climb onto your lap whether you\u2019re on the floor with her or trying to get your work done in an office chair. \n\nShe loves to rest her head on your shoulder and melt into you. \n\nShe has ZERO food/toy/treat aggression and passed her SAFER test with flying colours. \n\nMea is an absolute sweetheart and I don\u2019t believe that she deserves to be euthanized over this incident.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHowever, in foster care, we have seen her reactive with other dogs.  We have not and will not thoroughly test her, for liability purposes and because she's post op from quite a few big surgeries with her mature spay, mass removals and some post op complications, but she gets very excited, wants to lunge, intense vocalization when she sees other dogs.\n\nAt this time, we will not place her in a home with other dogs (or cats) and are looking for an adopter that doesn't have a highly populated dog community.  We believe, given her shelter experience, that she can transition in time to get along with other dogs if she's given ongoing training and behaviour modification. \n\nWe will expect adopters to have a training plan in place, to get Mea bettered mannered, so please have that available if you are applying to adopt.\n\nMea is a very affectionate dog and loves, loves, loves being with her people.  \n\nShe has no guarding issues and is a well rounded, kind dog with every human she meets.\n\nFROM HER FOSTER DAD:\n\nShe\u2019s cuddly. Playful. \n\nVery gentle and no guarding of food or toys at all.\n\nI haven\u2019t introduced her to many dogs. Like Tasha she\u2019s excited to go see them but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s had many interactions.  Meeting with my smaller dog did not go well and my dog will stay elsewhere while I'm fostering.\n\nWhen there\u2019s no other dogs around she walks well but as soon as I see another dog I shorten the leash and have been working on keeping her calm\n\nShe\u2019s interacted with my sister\u2018s dog a few times (medium sized dogs). The first time she growled quite a bit trying to establish dominance etc.\n\nShe has been getting better as there\u2019s a lot of dogs in the area as I walk but like I said I\u2019ve been keeping her away from interacting with other dogs for obvious reasons for now\n\nShe\u2019s super friendly and gentle with all adults and children\n\nStill has playful puppy tendencies. Obviously does not know her own strength yet.\n\n-----------------------\n\nAs of today, though our protocols could change tomorrow, we are still moving forward with adoptions. Our process has changed from some of the previous elements: We are a registered animal welfare organization, so we are deemed an essential service.\n\nAll paperwork completed online, video home visits, meet and greets outside respecting social distancing, leashes/collars/supplies wiped down and disinfected (GermiCide 3 wipes), disinfectant on the dog prior to handoff (Aqueos wipes for dogs)\n\n-----------------------\n\nTo note: the above description is relevant to this dog in his current setting. Home changes & adopter personalities can bring out different behaviours not previously seen.\n\nWe do not specifically kid/cat test our dogs when they arrive at Mattie's Place. That just wouldn't be fair to the dog or child/cat.\n\nWe also do not claim, endorse, suggest or hint at, that any of our dogs are hypoallergenic, low shed or no-shed.\n\nAdoption fee includes: spay/neuter, deworming, defleaing, vaccinations, nose to tail health exam, leash|collar, 6 months of preventative based on season/need, DNA test for entertainment purposes, dishes, poop bags, food and any extras she has accumulated in foster care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We are getting him re acclimated to life outside of the shelter & life after living with people who had him prior to the shelter. Unfortunately due to improper exercise , lack of mental stimulation, & not proper training practices Prax developed anxiety from not being able to find an \u201coutlet\u201d? that he desperately needed.\n?\nPrax will need a dedicated owner who is firm & patient who has an active \u201cworking\u201d household routine & experienced handing / training dogs of working caliber or mindset. \n\nWe would not recommend homes who have a ton of strangers visit or homes with young children (16yo+only)?\n\nNo apartments \n*Rural or more quiet suburban environments? only*\n\nPresently in foster near southern Maryland \n\n?Interested in adopting??\nCONTACT US TODAY! \n\nApplications can be found, completed, and submitted at Www.compassroserescue.org \n\n",

I am a very happy and very excitable pup that loves to be outside and explore my surroundings. I can be very strong-willed but also enormously loving. Due to my energy and strength I would do best in a home with older children. I am known for my tracking skills and can sometimes be difficult to walk on a leash because I'm always following my nose and I'm a pretty strong little girl! I am house-broken and know my basic commands. I do suffer from food allergies to grain, peanut butter, and raw meat. I would make an excellent pet for an active family that loves to spend time outdoors exploring the world!",

I like to play with other dogs, but can be selective with who I choose to engage with at times. I think the best place for me would be a home where I can be the queen of my castle, as I would do best without children . I would benefit from an experienced dog owner who can help me learn to be more confident in myself and my surroundings. I don't take up much space and I think that I could be very happy living in a smaller environment, like an apartment. I definitely would prefer a quiet lifestyle if possible, and while I can be friendly when meeting new people, I can also be protective at times of my space and my people. I could absolutely benefit from continued training, but I do seem to have a good understanding of potty-training. I am still working on being leash-trained but I know with a little time and effort on your end I will be able to master it in no time!",

I like to play with other small dogs, like myself. I think that I could make a good family pet, but for a family with older children who can respect my space and boundaries. I think that I would be a great pick for a first-time adopter looking for a great pocket-sized companion. I would be perfect for a smaller home or apartment because of my size and the fact that I don't require much space to keep myself entertained. I think I'd enjoy a busy lifestyle the most, particularly if it involves meeting lots of new visitors who I can get attention from! I may even be the type of pup that you can bring out and about with you on your daily activities if you wanted to. I appear to be well-trained, but could still use some work on my potty-training. Since arriving at the ranch I have learned to love going on leashed walks and I can't wait to join you for a walk around the block when I join your family!",

His cute antics keep his foster family entertained daily! He is great on a leash, and walks by his person's side. He does well with other dogs too! Lenny is a great mix of active and couch potato. He loves a good game of fetch and enjoys a good snooze on the sofa, too!\n\nLenny is potty trained and knows lots of tricks like sit, high five, and more! He is learning to love his crate & that counters are not a good place for him to use as a lookout :) He is looking for a home without cats or young children (they just don't understand his humor he says).\n\nLenny is 2 years old and weighs around 25 pounds. He is vaccinated, microchipped, neutered, heartworm negative, and his adoption fee is $200. To Apply to adopt Lenny, fill out an application on our website! http://mhrindy.org/adoption-inquiry/***Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.***",

She is careful but trusting, and takes her time to get close to people. Hart will be better suited for a quieter environment; she is sensitive to loud noises, but does not run. Enthusiastic to spin around outside, she would do well with some leash training. Hart is a very pretty girly girl, and may be best in a home without small children. Available for adoption through Greyhounds Only, Inc., Adoption and Rescue. We consider applicants who live in Illinois within the area that our volunteers can service, which extends approximately 75 miles from Carol Stream, IL. <b>Please visit http://www.greyhoundsonly.com/hounds/adoption/greyhounds-only-adoption-process to learn about our adoption process and fill out an application for adoption.

Ill do anything for a treat, even sit and lay down, I hear thats an accomplishment. My birthday is 10/1/20 so I'm not very old. Im told Im a huskador (husky and lab) so obviously Im very smart and playful.I also go in my kennel all by myself at night but that's where the treat comes in. I haven't had any accidents in my kennel and my foster mom says I'm doing super good in the house too! And I get along great with the other dogs and cats in the house!

Email adrienne@rescuemega.org or fill out an adoption application on our website- www.rmgdogs.org\n\n \n\nPLEASE NOTE: RMG does require another adult dog in the home for all puppy adoptions. This is a strict requirement with no exceptions allowed.",

She does have a ferocious growl, but is careful when she plays.\nShe gets excited to make new friends (human and dogs), so may need some work to not jump on them, or just to give them space.\nShe definitely gets attached to her people, so she would do well with a family who was around a lot!\nShe definitely is in need of a lot of love, but its honestly not hard to love her! (Everyone that has met her has been a big fan, even strangers on the trails!)\n\nIf you are interested in this animal please start by filling out an adoption application at <a href=\"\"http://www.cfp-nc.org/adopt\"\">CFP-NC.org/adopt</a> and we will get in touch with you.",

            "description": "Bizkit has just been welcomed into his Muddy Paws foster family and more information will be available as he settles in over the next couple of weeks. As of now, we think Bizkit may be a bit timid with men, but we know he loves his foster mom! One of his favorite activities is settling in on the couch after a long hard day of supervising her from room to room. Bizkit's also pretty happy to have some kiddos around when it's time to play; however, Bizkit has a lot of energy and is serious about his playtime so he would do best in a home with no children under the age of 10. This little guy is quick on his paws and likes an adventure so he will need a fenced in yard to keep him safe at home! We've discovered that Bizkit gets prettty excited about seeing dogs on television -- his foster mom says he runs up to the tv with his tail wagging, ha! Stay tuned for more updates as we get to know Bizkit.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Bizkit is $300. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

            "description": "Amber is a resiliant 2-year-old Blue Nose Pit Bull Terrier rescued from a euthanasia list at an overcrowded Tulsa shelter. She was pregnant and gave birth to 13 puppies on Christmas Eve, only days after arriving at a rescue in Grove, OK. Unfortunately 2 of the pups didn't survive, but the other 11 are alive and thriving! Amber and her puppies are now in the very capable hands of a Muddy Paws foster family. Once she is finished caring for her pups, she will be available for a February adoption. We are currently taking applications for pre-approval. She is looking for a furever home where she can be loved unconditionally!\n\nBefore applying to adopt Amber, you need to be familiar with your local breed-specific legislation regarding Pit Bulls. Applicants must live within 50 miles of the Omaha/Council Bluffs area.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Amber is $350. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

He may be a little shy at first but warms up quickly, and LOVES to be around his people. He has some health issues stemming from a neurological disorder that he was born with, including balance and vision, but that doesn't stop him from bouncing around and trying to wrestle with you. Blue is a little sweetheart who loves to be pampered and will never have enough pillows. Potty training is still in progress, so he would do well in a home with a large yard and some fur siblings to play with. He loves to chew on things and has endless puppy energy, but definitely enjoys hours of just lounging around the house as well. He needs a little extra love and attention so a home where someone is with him most of the time would be ideal. Come meet Blueberry, he would love to be your companion!",

He's perfectly happy following you around all day and spending as much time with you as he can! Just give him a bed and a window and he'll be your best co-worker and power napper! His favorite thing to do is to roll around in the grass, sunbathe and 'graze' (he really likes the taste of grass!) He enjoys fetch, tug-of-war, frisbees (really anything he can get his paws on) and has yet to meet a stick he doesn't like. This super smart guy knows a bunch of tricks/commands (sit, shake, down, up, stay, kennel, bed). He is a house-trained boy who is also working on touch and wait commands - who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks! Hooch doesn't socialize well with other dogs, but he loves making new human friends (just take it slow)! As soon as his initial excitement is over, he's all about getting pets and showing off. He loves going on walks. He likes taking it slow in his neighborhood, but is enthusiastic on trails and hikes! And he does really well on a leash as long as you give him enough time to sniff everything. Hooch has some anxiety and takes a little pill for that daily. If you choose to adopt him as your only pup, the APA! Behavior team will be available to help you guide him toward a smooth transition into your home and family life. Come meet this happy boy and see how quickly he'll charm his way into your heart!",

She clearly wasn\u2019t treated well early on but she warms up quickly and becomes a goofy, wiggly cuddle bug. This girl loves to cuddle. She\u2019d lie on top of you if you let her. Daisy wants to please and listens well and learns the rules quickly. She is potty trained and mellow in the house and gets along wonderfully with the other female dog and friends dogs that she has been introduced to. She can be aggressive to dogs outside her home or pack so she will need to be on leash or in a yard at all times. She does have some separation anxiety but does well with bones or toys to chew while you are gone. She doesn\u2019t know her own strength and wants to play with excited kids and can knock them down so she will be best in a home with no small kids.",

            "description": "Animal Profile: Rusty is estimated to be a 2 year old and a Pit Bull mix who joined us from Texas on 9/26. Rusty was found as a stray in Texas and could have possibly been a backyard dog. He's spent a month with the director of the shelter, coming out of his shell and starting to learn how to trust people. He will need a foster who is patient and can work on his socialization here in the PNW. We will post more info as we get to know him! Rusty is NOT comfortable with children and is looking for a companion that is willing to advocate for him around them.\n\nSeattle Foster Update:\nRusty has been settling in to his foster home really well and would love a home with a playful confident dog to spend his days with but could also make a really good companion as an only dog. Rusty loves the outdoors and would thrive in an active home that enjoys exploring the PNW. Rusty can be a little shy when first approached but with an owner willing to take things slowly and advocate for him in new environments and around new people, he does warm up quickly when approached appropriately.\n\nHere are some of the things Rusty's foster parents have said about him.\n\nHe is still very puppy like, so he is a very fun addition to the house.\n\nCar Friendly\n\nPlays well with other dogs\n\nKnows how to sit\n\ncomes when he is called\n\nJust wants to please you!\n\nAffection motivated\n\nGoof ball :)\n\nlearns quickly\n\nknows how to retrieve his ball/frisbee\n\nhouse trained\n\ncrate trained\n\nBiggest snuggle bug!\n\nloves toys\n\nrides in the car really well\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $500, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, and heartworm test. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue.\n\nApply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org",

            "description": "Gunner is about 23 months old (as of 1/11/2021), a Beagle and Wiemaraner Mix from the country of Taiwan.  He weighs 44 pounds and is fully-grown.  Gunner has been living with our foster family in North Wilmington in Delaware since 8/21/2020.   \n   \nGunner\u2019s rescued story:\n\nIn last October, while a dog rescuer driving on a busy highway in northern Taiwan, she glimpsed a very skinny black dog strayed on the traffic island.  The rescuer pulled over and approached the dog with a can of dog food and some dry food.  Surprisingly, the dog walked toward her soon he saw her; he ate the entire can food quickly and more dry food. \n\nAs the rescuer looked closely, she immediately realized how severely emaciated this black dog was.  He was not only extremely thin, but his body and head covered with many new and old wounds, and some of these wounds were still bleeding.  The dog was very friendly, so she successfully walked him to her car.  We named the dog Gunner as he fights for his life like a brave warrior.\n\nGunner was brought to the vet hospital for a checkup.  He was about 8-9 months old and only weighed 24 lbs., more than 10 pounds under the ideal weight; he was suffering from severe malnutrition.  Much sadly, the vet confirmed that the wounds on his body were from the knife slash, dog bites and objects cut.\n\nThe rescuer concerned if Gunner was a lost dog due to his gentle and mellow disposition; however, she was told about his tragic life by one of her friends living in where Gunner was found.\n\nGunner originally was one of a litter born by a neglected family mother dog, the owner did not want to spend money spaying the dog and let the dog continue getting pregnant.  None of the mother dog and her puppies were allowed to live inside the house, a cardboard box next to the owner\u2019s house was their shelter. \n \nAt the age of 3-4 months old, Gunner already lost all his siblings from being killed by the cars or died from being sickness; he was the only puppy luckily survived.  But, one day Gunner was thrown out into the streets by the owner to let him fend for himself.  Whenever Gunner approached the house, the owner brutely beat him away with a thick stick or a broomstick.  Gunner confused why he was not allowed to go near his mom nor the house.\n\nThe neighbors were not nice to Gunner either; they would hit him or scare him away because they think that Gunner would refuse to leave after being fed.  Although Gunner was treated cruelly by his owner and the residents, he never walked far.  He strayed close to his mom, the house, and the owner family because it was the place he grew up and they were the only people he knew.  \n\nGunner\u2019s completed medical information:\n\nGunner has received a thorough medical exam; fortunately, he was rescued in time because he was found to have Haemobartonella and Giardia infections.  After three months of treatments, his both infections were cured, and he has been healthy since then.  \nGunner is negative on the following disease and infections: Distemper, SNAP 4Dx (Heartworm, Lyme, Ehrlichia, Anaplasma Phagocytophilum), CBC, Biochemistry blood work, and PCR tests for diseases and infections transmitted by fleas or ticks.  He has also received an x-ray on his hips and joints; he does not have hip dysplasia.  He got his teeth cleaned in August 2020.\n\nGunner is neutered, de-wormed, up to date on all vaccinations including rabies shot.  He is heartworm negative and on preventative treatment and is micro chipped.  All Gunner's medical documents including his X-ray films on the hips will be given to his adopter when he is adopted.\n\nGunner\u2019s temperaments and personality:\n\nAlthough Gunner has a rough start, he never gave up hope and trust on human.  He is one of the most mellow and gentlest dogs we have ever met; he does not have a mean bone in his body.  Gunner has adapted to any new environment very easily, and there is no transition for Gunner.  He is kind and sweet to every creature he met; he just very cherishes any roof provided.\n\nGunner is a naturally loving and affectionate dog that loves people unconditionally even though he was mistreated by the people whom he loved.  He is super friendly and passionate to strangers and wants to cuddle when he just met the person.  \n\nAlthough Gunner is almost two years old, sometimes he still acts like a puppy; he loves to communicate or get attention by pawing at people.  Gunner loves to sleep; especially, he loves to snuggle with his foster mom on the bed, but like a little child, Gunner is sleepy in the morning and it is hard to wake him up.  Every morning when the foster mom tries to get Gunner out of bed, he would slip foster mom the paw, \u201cI wanna sleep!\u201d  While the foster mom getting ready in the bathroom, Gunner usually still sleeping.   \n\nBefore coming to the USA, Gunner was fostered by a family for nine months, living with two 12 and 13-year-old children, many rescued dogs and three cats; he got along very well with all of them.  Everyone that meets Gunner loves him right away for his well-behavior and easy-going personality.  He is also submissive and listens.  \n\nGunner loves to play and run with other dogs, and he is often the center of the group while wrestling.  He seems to enjoy such attention from his dog friends, and he has never got upset even though sometimes some of them went too rough.  \n\nGunner likes to chew dental bones, deer antlers and twigs, but does not seem interested in playing with the ball.  He LOVES food, but he is not food or toy aggressive or possessive toward both people and dogs.  Every time while other dogs are still eating their meals, Gunner already wolfed down his food.  Although he wants other dog\u2019s food, he would politely stand behind the dog and wait patiently to see if he could luckily pick up some kibbles falling from the bowel.  \n\nGunner does not have separation anxiety; he is fine to stay at home with other dogs.  He is not scared of thunderstorms, fireworks, or other noises, but he is alert; he would bark if there is a dog barking or some noises outside.  He also howls at the answering machine, but he would stop howling when he was called.  \n\nGunner is very playful but not hyper, he will be a wonderful companion for a moderately-highly active family that likes outdoors activities with children older than 5 years old.  \n\nGunner needs some outdoors exercise everyday such as long-distance walks, hiking, playing, or running in the yard.  He will not do well in the apartments, condos, or with the retirees\u2019 life paces; he needs a fully enclosed fenced yard, not invisible yard.  People who sharing living space with roommates are not considered by us either. \n\nGunner is house broken, walks nicely on leash, and loves car rides; he is calm and well-behaved in the car.\n\nWe hope Gunner\u2019s new parents could include him into your outings, short trips, or vacations besides daily walks in the neighborhood, or playing in the back yard.  We wish Gunner could have chance to experience different parts of his life that he had missed before.\n\nHow to meet Gunner?\n\nIf you are seriously thinking of giving Gunner a loving permanent home, please email us for an application form.  Because all our rescues live with our foster family, we do not accept stop-by visits if you are interested in seeing our dogs.  Before meeting Gunner, the prospective adopter needs to fill out the application and gets approved.\n\nMore videos of Gunner are as below:\n\n1.\tStarving abandoned Gunner on the traffic island was rescued in Taiwan  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVwUapOi-lA\n2.\tCuddling with his foster mom in Taiwan  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MCJs26qNlU  \n3.\tRunning on the beach for the first time  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfVAgUUraAo\n4.\tGunner was calm while taking a blood test  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmzyQUEZm-A\n5.\tGunner is snoring  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqqGfW1IgtA\n6.\tGunner is very calm with the vacuum  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZyClxHce3w\n7.\tGunner patiently waiting for the bone  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BamWZrl-ABg\n8.\tCuddling the gentleman, he first met  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4zrzckPVPg\n9.\tStrolling in the Washington Crossing Historic Park  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFJ0xTZVwAQ\n10.\tGunner is very passionate to strangers  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8A2XU1hESs\n11.\tGunner wants to say hello to strangers  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih_k_F4bSGY\n12.\tVisiting new friends and playing in their yard  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUqpkuaonYk\n13.\tPlaying in the snow for the first time (Gunner with red collar) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_jROZSypsg\n14.\tGunner (smaller one) and Prince wrestling in the snow  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnN532MJmho\n15.\tThe best cleaner, not wasting any food!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENhoUqhokT4\n",

The first step will be to set up a virtual meeting with their current foster family via phone, zoom, or facetime, to provide you with more detailed information about the animal. Following that, if you feel like it could be a good adoption fit, shelter staff will help coordinate a socially-distanced meeting in person so that you can meet your potential family member up-close and personal. Thank you for your patience during this time. We really appreciate your support!\n\nTorie is a beautiful and active young dog. She gets along great with other dogs, has excellent doggie play skills and may enjoy living in a home with another dog. Torie can be fearful in certain situations and when surprised by unknown people. She needs to live in an adult only home. Torie is smart as a whip and learns quickly so working with a trainer can help her learn to become more comfortable in novel situations and overcome her fears. Torie has so much love to give, with consistency, routine and training she will become a wonderful pet.\n",

            "description": "Animal Profile: Hilly is a lab who joined us from Texas on December 30th. She had a rough start in life as she was dumped in the Texas country when she was a young puppy. She was being fed by someone and kept with several other dogs. All the dogs eventually found their way to 4 Legged Friends rescue, and from there she made the trip to Seattle.\n\nWhen she first arrived Hilly was very afraid, anxious, and confused. She bonds well with other dogs, her companions really help her to come out of her shell. In Texas learned that people are good and they give good attention, but she is still shy when first meeting new people. She will need a home with a confident resident dog to help her feel most comfortable, a securely fenced yard and no young kids.\n\nSeattle Foster Update:\nComing soon!\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $500, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, and heartworm test. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue.\n\nApply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org\n\nAnimal History: This dog was rescued by 4 Legged Friends Rescue in Texas and transferred via Project Freedom Ride. This dog will be available for adoption in Seattle once evaluated.",

            "description": "Tank was brought into the rescue just before his owners were going to take him to the shelter as they had no time or space for him.  Not sure why the name Tank but perhaps his former family wanted him to have a powerful name to counter his diminutive size.  Tank is two and a half years old and 11 pounds.   He has been vetted, neutered and micro-chipped.   He is a sweet boy who does talk to people using a growling like tone .  He is a Chihuahua/rat terrier mix.\n   \nHe seems to get along fine with other dogs and children, at least teenagers.  He would be fine as an only dog or as part of a pack.   He will bark when playing with other dogs and at times when playing alone with his toys.  We do not think he would be a good fit in an apartment since he does bark at times.\n\nTank loves to retrieve a tennis ball so needs an adopter who excels at repetitive throwing. On the other hand, he is very much a SNUGGLER, a true lap dog and likes to sleep in his foster mother\u2019s bed.  She is trying to teach him boundaries as he prefers to be as close as possible.\n\nIf you think you can provide a good home to this little guy, please go to www.freedomstreetrescue.org to complete an application. or email rhondabarron@earthlink.net for an app.   He is located in Houston, Texas and will come to his new home by professional transport.\n",

We\u2019ve all heard the phrase, \u201cYou can\u2019t teach an old dog new tricks,\u201d but that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Adult dogs have a great attention span and eagerness to please, allowing them to learn faster than more youthful members of their species. If you\u2019re looking for a steadfast companion who will be truly grateful for a second chance at a happy life, consider adopting a dog. \n\nFauna is a strong, German Shepherd who needs an adopter familiar with the breed. She has resource guarding issues over her food bowl and potentially other resources she finds to have high value .Fauna would do best in a household with older teens able to take direction. Young children may be in jeopardy around food items or food dropped on the floor. Fauna can be introduced to other dogs but does not solicit play.(selective). No cats.",

I'm Roxie! I am a sweet, loving young girl. I like being outside and I walk well on a leash but I also learn my surroundings and love roaming free in the yard, checking everything out. I can find out a lot of things by using my nose and ears. I recall when you say my name, and since I don't like to be too far from you, I'm easy to keep track of! I don't really play with toys outside, but I do like to have stuffed animals and chews when I'm inside. And I like going on car rides!\n\nMy best talent is being a companion and sharing all my love with whomever is around. I am very gentle and love being touched. I will curl up by your feet and snooze happily while you're reading or watching TV. You don't have to worry about me getting on the furniture all the time because I need help, so unless you want to invite me, I will stay on my bed or on the carpet. I'm currently on thyroid medication and can be a little anxious just because everything is so new. However, I'm learning that people can be so nice and that I can trust them! If you would like a very sweet companion to just go on strolls and become your best friend, I'm volunteering!\n\nFrom foster Mom - Roxie is really coming out of her shell and is a wonderful girl. She is a little shy at first and still unsure of her surroundings but is generally quite calm and loving and just wants to be wherever you are. She needs to have her family around to help her figure her surroundings out and help her feel secure for a while. Her vision is currently impaired, but will hopefully be improving soon. Roxie is scheduled for cataract surgery in Vancouver, WA so she is looking for a foster to adopt home near there! If she sounds like your girl - please fill out an application today. You won't be disappointed!\n\nBit.ly/WHBRadopt\n\nwww.Wigglinhomeboxerrescue.org\nEmail: wigglinhomeboxerrescue@gmail.com\nPhone (360) 723-0219",

I am also crate trained and am learning manners in the house, including sit and lay. \n\nI am spayed, am UTD on shots, and have a current rabies tag. \n\nWill you be my best friend? \nIf you are interested in meeting me or have questions please contact Susan Mayne at elmorromaynes@gmail.com.

He is super nice but very jealous of other dogs. Apollo will do best in a home with no other animals. He is about 14 pounds. He is vaccinated and scheduled for a dental, neuter, and microchip in the next few weeks. Apollo is NOT housebroken. He needs help in that area. He also will not go in a crate and has separation anxiety. A perfect home for Apollo would be either a retired person, someone they can take him to work, or a family where there is at least one person home at all times. He is very needy but really nice. You can apply for him via the website and if you have any questions please text 570-903- 1731. Www.nepapetrescue.com.",

She is a darling \u201cfuzzy\u201d not your typical greyhound, maybe mix of retriever or pointer?!  Nala is an amazing love bug who needs a very active home with a securely fenced yard.  Her previous adopter ran and biked with her, both of which she loved. Unfortunately, his circumstances changed and he can no longer keep Nala- therefore she is looking for her truly forever home now.  Loyal and social Nala is curious, fearless, fast and agile.  Smart and young Nala is eager to learn and a real pleaser.  She is affectionate and outgoing and enjoys anything outdoors! She loves car rides!  Nala does ok with other dogs, but she plays fast and furious and does best with sturdier, larger, non-greyhound breeds. Nala is perfectly happy to be the only dog as well as she digs your companionship and your one-on-one activities.  As a greyhound mix, Nala has some prey drive and therefore needs a home without cats.  Nala has been friendly to children she has met when out and about, but she may be too active for toddlers who she could knock over.  Nala\u2019s adoption fee is $500 and she is available to meet at Greyhound Pets in Woodinville. Nala is spayed, vaccinated and micro-chipped. For questions or to set up a meet and greet, contact Kathy at kkreyling11@yahoo.com and please use the link for our adoption application: https://www.greyhoundpetsinc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Adoption_Application_2020-Revised-Website.pdf.  Loving and lovable Nala is the most deserving and fun adventure girl who deserves you and your active northwest family!\n",

            "description": "Meet medium size and medium energy Brock who would love a serene and calm place to retire.  Brock was adopted over 6 years ago after he was rescued by RCR and transported from a high kill shelter in Georgia to Washington state.  Sadly, now 8-year-old Brock is again looking for his forever home as his owner of 6 years has a new girlfriend who doesn\u2019t like Brock.  Jack Russell mix Brock is back with his former foster in Moses Lake while he awaits a patient and loving adopter who has no other pets or children. Brock weighs just 28lbs and is still as active and playful as he was years ago. He\u2019s had a lot of changes lately, so Brock needs an adopter who is knowledgeable about fearful dogs and who is willing to give him time to adjust. Brock is skittish and reactive to loud noises and sudden moves. He likes daily walks and needs an enclosed, fenced in yard. Brock is a pretty calm boy once he feels comfortable with you and will gladly be a couch potato with you or more likely your lap warmer. If you give him the ability and space to choose the amount and type of interaction he wants, he thrives!  Brock craves attention and loves to snuggle. He would love to be with a single person who is without kids and is not away from home for too many hours a day.  Brock is totally house trained and crate-trained. He gets along well with other dogs after proper intros, but really just prefers being with you, his people! Brock happily sleeps and hangs out in his crate.  Brock is very food motivated and is very smart.  He knows his basic commands and sits before going in a door and on command. He is also quite good with \u201cstay\u201d and will give you his \u201cpaw\u201d. Brock LOVES squeaker toys! Loud and sudden noises seem to remind him of his past and startle him which makes us assume it wasn't a very happy past. This is Brock\u2019s last chance at finding an experienced and caring adopter who can make Brock the center of their world. We are hoping that we can find Brock a home that will guarantee him a happy future. Brock's adoption fee is $150 and he is neutered, micro-chipped and fully-vaccinated.  For questions and a conversation with his foster mom Lindsey, please email rcrlindsey@gmail.com. Brock is currently being fostered in Moses Lake, WA. To complete an application, go to www.raincityrescue.com/adopt.  Best boy Brock might be a bit complicated, but if you need a project and to help save a life- Brock will be totally worth your time to check out.  He will repay you with kisses and loves and gratitude forever! \n\n",

            "description": "Sweet Abbey is ready to find her furever home. She has been with us for about three weeks now and has adapted so well to being in a new home and out of the shelter. She has proven herself to be a loyal and loving girl with a hint of rambunctious. She loves her humans and we are anxious to find her a home where she can build bonds that will last forever. \n\nUnfortunately, Abbey was surrendered to a SC shelter by her owner due to medical challenges, but she wasted no time befriending her new foster family and instantly became attached. Although she struggled with anxiety for a little while, we have since seen her amazing spunky personality emerge. Abbey loves going on walks, taking car rides, and snuggling up with her stuffed animals at the end of the day. She recently mastered the art of fetch and needs a big yard to run around in, especially when her \u201czoomies\u201d come on. Abbey craves attention and we would love for her to find a family who can shower her with pets and belly rubs throughout the day. Although Abbey does great on a leash, she is fairly strong and should be placed with someone who is prepared for occasional pulling when she gets excited. Abbey is an absolute sweetheart and is bound to melt your heart. \n\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  While this Lab may not be available for adoption by the time you complete the adoption process, other great Labs are always finding their way into our Rescue. \n\nFor more information on this Lab, please contact INFO@BROOKLINELABRESCUE.ORG.  \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this Lab or any other Lab from our Rescue, please visit our Web site, www.brooklinelabrescue.org, for more information on our adoption process. If you need additional information about the adoption process or whether you are in our coverage area, please send an e-mail to our Rescue at info@brooklinelabrescue.org\n\nEven if you are not ready to adopt, you can still help us help our Labs!\n\nBrookline Labrador Retriever Rescue is a 501(c)3 non-profit volunteer organization funded entirely by donations.

We are unsure of his exact breed since his parents are unknown but we do believe Nemo will grow to be a medium sized dog. Nemo is currently being house trained and crate trained in his foster home. He is very bright and is picking up these new skills quite easily! \n\nNemo is a happy snuggly little nugget. He\u2019s learned how to play with his toys and hasn\u2019t had any issues with being destructive so far. Nemo loves other dogs and all people! Adopters interested in Nemo should be aware that he is very young and will require continued training and redirection. He will need a home that is willing to work with all the challenges associated with a puppy including training basic commands, house training, nipping, destructive behaviors etc.\n\nTo adopt Nemo fill out our adoption application at the link below \nwww.bullluvablepaws.org/adopt",

            "description": "OUR ADOPTION PROCESS AND APPLICATION ARE AVAILABLE AT WWW.SOHODOGRESCUE.ORG AND OUR ADOPTION FEE IS $275\n\nPippa is a sweet, happy Cattle Dog girl who is full of \"go\"!  She is 5 years young, weighs about (40) lbs, and she is crate-trained and house-broken.  Pippa walks nicely on leash and she is great in the car.  Pippa is a wonderful girl at home with her people.  This little athlete is super smart and loves to learn all kinds of new tricks.  She has so much personality, and she will make you laugh with her antics as much as she will charm you with her sweetness. Pippa is also a medium-to-high energy girl who would be a great companion for hikers, bikers, and runners - here's your chance for a top-notch companion!  She LOVES to go for a run with her human.\nCattle Dog enthusiasts know how strongly they will bond with one person. Pippa has that quality with just a slight twist.  She will gladly share her human with other humans, but she is selective when it comes to sharing her human with other dogs.  We are therefore looking for a home for Pippa where she can be the only dog, at least to start.  Also, because she can be a bit nippy (like most ACDs), any children in her new family should be over the age of 12.  For those who love Australian Cattle Dogs, this little girl is a classic example of the breed. \nNow the caveat: Pippa most likely has glaucoma. Glaucoma is a treatable condition that causes pressure on the eye, and it makes dogs feel like they have a constant migraine headache. She needs daily eye drops which are not very expensive, but will be needed for the rest of her life.  She will also require yearly visits to an eye specialist.  We are working with eye specialists now so that we can get a treatment plan set up for her, which is not easy in this COVID world where all the vets seem to have incredibly busy schedules!  \nThis is where a very rare foster-to-adopt opportunity comes in! We don't feel that there is any advantage to Pippa to hold her in a foster home when she could be bonding with a new family.   However, we need to continue to be responsible for her eye care until she is stable on a long-term treatment plan.  Our solution is to find a forever home for Pippa, with the understanding that the adoption won't be \"official\" until we have a complete diagnosis and treatment plan. We are looking for an energetic new family for Pippa near a major metropolitan area where we can find an eye specialist to continue this work.  You, as a foster-to-adopt family, will benefit from our knowledge base, have expert guidance with our trainers, and we will foot the vet care bills for her specialized care until we get a final maintenance plan from the eye specialist.\nPippa has really lit up the lives of her foster family, and she will do the same for her new family. She is a keenly intelligent, sassy little girl and we want her to stay that way for years to come! If you are interested in Pippa, please apply today!  Pippa is in Chesapeake, VA\n",

Nice to meet ya!  \n\nWATCH MY VIDEO:  https://youtu.be/C6OmmW1qWzY\n\nhttps://youtu.be/7j6NvJyryLo\n\nA nice person came along and took me in and, now, I am ready to hit the road to your house!  Uh, make that \u201cour\u201d house, OK?  I definitely need a house with a fenced-in yard cuz I need room to run and romp and be safe!  The rescue requires (1) a fenced-in yard and (2) a vet reference from a vet that you have used for a current or previous dog to be sure that all vetting was done and (3) a comparable-sized doggie sibling)  \n\nI am a Retriever/Staffy mix.  I am 10 MONTHS old and I weigh 55-60 pounds. I have been neutered and am up to date on vaccines so I'm ready to go to my new home with YOU!!  Those funny-looking 2-legged creatures said I\u2019m also microchipped \u2013 whatever THAT is.  At any rate, I am fully vetted.  Is that anything close to petted?  I love to be petted!  They say I'm precious.  Hmmm, Is my name Milo or Precious?\n\nWanna hear some more good stuff about me?  OK, here goes.  I like ALL people and ALL dogs.  I need to have a DOGGIE SIBLING about my size so we can run and romp together and burn up LOTS and LOTS of energy!   I know basic commands.  I respond very well to consistent, positive reinforcement training and I'm a good learner!  Smart, huh?\n\nI am attentive, affectionate, silly, playful and loyal.  I LOVE cuddles, car rides, holding hands and tummy rubs.  I am a beta doggie.  I back down when prompted by aggressive dogs. I'm an amazing companion!\n\nI have lots to learn.  Will you teach me all the things a pup needs to know to be safe and happy? I LOVE to give kisses so get ready!  \n\nIf you have children, then need to be older children - 12 and up because I like to play hard and run fast!  It's fun!\n\nI like to take naps when I'm tired from playing.  I need  love, exercise and couch-sitting when we get tired!  Let's be a team, OK?\n\nIf you would like to take me home (and you know you do), please email rescuedogsgalore@gmail.com  and they can get me on my way to a new and loving home!  My adoption fee is $150 and includes my vetting, neutering, and a microchip.\n\n",

I am house trained, have basic obedience skills, and would love to learn more because I am eager to please and I love treats! I'm gentle taking food from your hand. I like to swim and go for car rides - I'm always up for an adventure! I love my squeaky toy, but sometimes I need a reminder not to get TOO excited. \n\nI'm happy to lay around and cuddle with you, I'm very affectionate. I love having my ears massaged and my belly rubbed. I really like meeting new people, but sometimes I get just a little too excited and need to be reminded not to jump. I'm good with people, but not sure about other dogs, my foster parents haven't seen me with other dogs yet. They do know I'm not a fan of felines, and this one time an opossum was in the backyard, and I didn't really like him. Speaking of yards, I would love a big yard with a six foot fence. Sometimes loud noises scare me - darn fireworks! \n\nI am looking for a loving and affectionate forever home that is patient and willing to work with me on my few little quirks. I'm want to be your fur-ever boy!\n\nBoBo is 3 years old, 83 lbs, and ready for his forever home! Please visit www.liveloveanimalrescue.org to fill out an adoption application.",

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are showing dogs on an appointment only basis. Please understand that we are receiving a high volume of applications at this time and are doing our best to address as many as we can. Please be patient. Thank you.\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs is $250. Aside from the shelter, food and water, exercise and compassion they receive while in our care, this also includes veterinary services such as Rabies, Distemper+Lepto, Bordetella, H3N2/H3N8 Influenza, heartworm testing, fecal exams, preventions and deworming medications. Spays/Neuters are also included as part of the adoption fee as is microchipping. \nPuppies under the age of 6 months have an adoption fee of $350. The veterinary services rendered include puppies first round of vaccines, fecal exams, deworming medications, preventions, and microchipping. Our facility spays and neuters dogs at 6 months of age. If the puppy is adopted prior to his, or her prescheduled surgery date, a $200 spay/neuter deposit will be taken on the day of adoption. This deposit it refundable and will be returned to the adopter once proof of the procedure is returned to the shelter. \nCOVID-19 NOTE: Please understand that we are looking for forever home for our pets. We understand that many people have a lot of time on their hands during the COVID-19 pandemic, so this may seem like an ideal time to bring home a new pet. Please be sure you are prepared to give your new pet his, or her forever home once our lives go back to normal. They deserve it. Thank you and stay safe.",

Poor baby most likely didn't have a great past.  Her pretty white fur is still a bit stained from her living conditions.  \n\nSophie is doing well with us!  She is learning how to walk nicely on a leash.  Sophie sure loves her walks!  Sophie is a very smart girl!  She loves to be mentally stimulated.  Interactive toys are her favorite!   Sophie also loves to snuggle up and snooze.  A soft comfy pillow to help her heal from her past is a must.  Hopefully you don't mind her snoring!  \n\nSophie would make a great adventure partner.  She loves to go for rides and travels will in the car!  Do you need a new hiking friend, Sophie could be the gal for you!  \n\nIf you are possibly interested in meeting Miss Sophie, please go to our website, www.crcpa.org, and complete an application.  Local families only please!",

The dog was fearful so would run away when the Good Samaritan would try to get her. We ended up going out to the rail line..... the situation was near impossible but after a 3/4 mile walk down the active tracks, we reached her. It took some coaxing and patience, but we were able to get a slip lead around her neck; we called her to come the rest of the way down the hill, snd she melted into a loving dog, that was relieved to be out of the elements. Before we scanned for a chip, we took the horrible, heavy pinch collar off of her. \n\nNo tags, no chip and no owner came forward so........ she gets a new great home!!!!! \n \nThis girl is truly special. Nia is about 5 years old and approx 40#. She has been with her foster family several weeks now and she\u2019s ready for her fresh start. Nia is great with dogs of all sizes as well as cats. She\u2019s extremely loyal to her people, is smart, knows basic manners but can pull a tad on lead. She can be active and playful but also enjoys a snooze. Nia enjoys natural bones, Nyla bones, balls and squeak toys. She loves all people and is truly a deserving girl that will be a fantastic family member to a family. \n\nNia is vaccinated, spayed, chipped and ready for the right home. If you\u2019re interested in adoption, please complete the following link. Her adoption fee is $225. Adoption application.  https://form.jotform.com/careforpets/cfp-adoption-application",

She has a hard time getting around due to instability in her back legs so she will definitely need a home with no stairs and good traction (no slippery surfaces!)

            "description": "Red is a 7 year old spayed female chihuahua/feist mix who weighs about 25 lbs. Red was rescued from a hoarding situation along with 27 other dogs. After enduring so much neglect in her life, she can be very shy at first and is looking for an experienced, quiet, patient family that will take things slowly with her as she settles in. Once she settles in, Red is an easy-going, well-mannered girl. We have loved watching her blossom in her foster home with the love and care she was deprived of for so long. Red is crate-trained, housebroken, and walks well on a leash. She does well with other dogs after a slow, proper introduction but wouldn't mind being the center of her family's attention. She isn't interested in playing with other dogs at all, just exists with them. In her foster home, she has learned how fun it is to play with soft squeaky toys with her people. Once she feels safe, Red enjoys getting pets and scratches from her people and will curl up next to her foster family for more attention. She's almost bossy with her requests for attention and snuggles. We have no doubt that Red will make a wonderful companion - all she needs is a chance! Please help us find Red the amazing forever family she's waited her whole life for!\n\nInterested in adopting?

            "description": "JoJo is a beautiful mixed breed pup, who likely has some mastiff in her. She weighs about 60 lbs and is likely 2-3 years old.\n\nJoJo loves her foster dads and they have thoroughly enjoyed having her, but their landlord has breed restrictions and won't let them adopt her. So she's on the market and hoping to find her forever home soon before the landlord kicks her out!\n\nShe LOVES playing ball and loves car rides. She is very affectionate with her humans, but not quite comfortable with other dogs yet. With time, proper introductions, and professional training, she likely would overcome her fear of other dogs and live with another one... however, in the meantime, we prefer she be adopted as an only dog. She has not been cat tested or kid tested, but we will not adopt her to a home with young children.\n\nJoJo has been spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, and is heartworm negative. Her adoption fee is $300. If you are interested in adopting JoJo, please submit an application on our website, www.prodogsohio.org/adoptables.\n\nShe's being fostered in the Dayton area. Please note, we only schedule meet and greets with approved applicants.

ARGH!\n\nAnd I sat and waited, and waited. AND WAITED. They never came to get me and my time there was pretty much up!\n\nThankfully the pound and volunteers all called this rescue cause I'm such a good boy they wanted me to go to a RESCUE so I'd go to a GOOD HOME.\n\nSo here I am, I'm READY to be the WAFFLES to your BREAKFAST dish!\n\nI'm a 3 year old 70 pound beautiful and sweet bully boy who is house and crate trained and good on a leash but I need a strong leader to continue to teach me what I need to know since my first owners used me as a backyard lawn ornament.\n\nI'm good with other dogs my size but should be in a home with no kids or small dogs or cats.\n\nMy most favorite thing to do is to snuggle, get petted and give kisses!\n\nI do need someone with experience with my breed and to go slow and give me a little time but once I know you are not gonna hurt me I will be your bestest friend and always want to be at your side!\n\nIf you think we might be a good match please go to www.bulliesandbuddies.com and fill out an application to ADOPT me ok?\nHope to meet ya soon!\nLove,\nWAFFLES \n\nI am in the Southern CA area-sorry but my rescue does NOT adopt out of state \n",

She was found by Animal control emaciated, with bad demodex mange and pregnant. We brought her up here to our rescue, where she had her babies which are now in their forever homes. Fern is on the mend and now it is her turn to find her forever home. Fern is still missing some hair, but most will grow back over time. We believe Fern is in American fox hound mix, now weighing about 50 lbs. She rides well in a car, walks ok on a leash. She is crate trained and house trained. Fern loves to play with other dogs. She is a silly girl that's is just looking for love.\n\nFern is spayed, up to date on vaccines and micro-chipped\nIf you are interested in Fern, please read our adoption requirements and fill out our application which can be found on our web site www.itavar.com. Once we get your application, we will call you to set up a meet n greet.\nYou can also see more pictures on our Facebook page, https://www.facebook.com/ITAVAR/\n",

She doesn't prefer a house with younger, playful dogs, but will do well as an only dog or with an older dog that isn't intrusive into her personal space.\nShe does exceptionally well around our 5 year old son, as she was raised with kids in her original home.\nShe is overweight, but she does really well on a leash, so if she is walked regularly she should slim down to a healthier weight.\nShe is set to be spayed and microchipped and have some dental work done on 1/22.She will be ready for adoption 1/24..\nAdoption fee $400\n\n\n\n\nAll UnderDogs are spayed/neutered, heartworm checked, microchipped, up to date on vaccines and heartworm/flea/tick preventatives.  For consideration for one or more dogs, we require that an on-line application is filled out.  \n\nTO ADOPT THIS DOG PLEASE FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AT https://underdogrescueofflorida.com/. \n\nSorry, we do not adopt outside of Florida.  Applicants are subject to a home visit, and veterinary references will be checked. Please include a vet reference (including phone number) when applying online.\n\nOur application process:\nFIRST, an application must be approved for adoption from our rescue.\nSECOND, we determine whether the dog that has been applied for is a \"good match\" for the household that wants to adopt him/her.  We take into consideration the dog's activity level, compatibility with other members of the household (human and other pets), etc.\nIf your application has been approved, but the dog you applied for is no longer available, please take the time and look over our adoptable dogs again.  We will make every effort to find the right dog for an approved applicant.\n\nWe hope you agree and understand that our goal to find the best forever home is our #1 priority! Please fill out an Adoption Application at https://underdogrescueofflorida.com/",

            "description": "#121407Age: 5 years, 1 month Weight: 88 lbs How this pet arrived: This pet was brought in by a Good Samaritan on December 26, 2020. At SDHS:Beaver has been microchipped, neutered, and is up to date on vaccinations. Now he's ready for his new home! Why this pet is the one for you:Meet Beaver! This handsome fellow is looking for a home that will make him part of the family. Beaver really enjoys getting attention from his favorite people--he'll sit right next to you and let you pet him all day long. Beaver pulls a little too hard on a leash, so he would benefit from a lot of positive reinforcement. It's been reported that Beaver is very housebroken and loves going outside to sniff the surroundings and and sometimes dig under the fence if he gets bored. He is a fan of high value treats- Beaver won't say no to cheese or hot dogs :) This precious gentleman would prefer to be the only dog in the house and get all your attention. Does he seem like the dog for you? Click on \"Adopt Me\" to get started!\nI'm a special guy! Click here to read some additional info about me and my needs.

His mom is a Shepherd mix and he looks like she might have some Lab and Shepherd in him.  They were rescued from a backyard in Texas where mama was tied to a tree and had to have her puppies under the tree.  A neighbor called animal control and they were taken to the local shelter.  We were asked to take them in and find them homes.  Kubota is a fun guy, he absolutely loves to play.  He can also be a big snuggle bug.  He would love to find a home that has room for him to play!!  Kubota is currently being fostered in Cheyenne, Wyoming.  He absolutely loves being in Wyoming and is ready to find his new home.  If you would like to meet Kubota please fill out an application at\n   \nwww.lowridersofthewest.org\n\nKubota\u2019s adoption fee is $375.00  - if you have any questions please email the rescue with them.\n\n",

            "description": "Gravity is a six-month-old 36lb cattle dog mix! He was found with a broken back at six weeks old, which was surgically repaired, but he also incurred a deep laceration to his spinal cord. This has left him partially paralyzed from the lower back down. There is a chance that some of the nerves will regenerate over the next two years,but it's important to note that any progress will be slow and steady. Although he is partially paralyzed he gets around great and absolutely loves playing with dogs of all sizes in ages and going for a nice long walks. He's an active puppy and loves to go for car rides & beach romps but also loves keeping himself entertained basking in a sunny spot in the house with a chew toy. \n\nCheck him out on Facebook at 'Gravity, a puppy's journey' and Instagram at 'defyinggravitypup'.\n\n\nMedical Needs:\n - Incontinence: Gravity is incontinent both urinary & fecal. He needs to be manually expressed multiple times a day (at the most every two hours up to every 4 to 5 hours) it takes a bit of patience to learn but besides getting a bit of an arm workout it's fairly easy, promise! Typically when you express him, he'll pee & poop so it makes it easier to plan your day. ***On a day to day basis Gravity wears belly bands so he doesn't pee everywhere and uses diapers for certain situations like car rides if I need to stop in a store (he gets worked up if alone), at PT and at my shop while I'm out walking dogs.\n - Gut health: He's currently eating Purina Pro Plan complete essentials which has a probiotic. He's on 2 supplements- one for fiber to keep things flowing and a cranberry chew to help keep UTIs away. He also gets a spoonful of yogurt added to each meal.\n - Paw care: It's important to keep his front nails short for gripping and his back paws protected. Because he drags but flips them I to the right position he whittles away at those nails. To keep them safe on long walks we use PAWZ booties (size medium)\n\nBehavioral needs:\n - Separation Anxiety: Gravity has displayed some pretty significant separation anxiety since he has been in Massachusetts. It is in his best interest that he goes to home with at least one other dog as it definitely makes him more confident. He can be left uncrated and unsupervised with my dog at this point and he is totally fine. If he is at my shop alone while I am out walking, even with other people in the store-he will bark and whine but go through periods of time where he'll be able to settle. If I leave him alone, even for something as brief as picking up a to-go coffee order he can get himself pretty worked up and will be panting by the time I get back to the car. Sometimes he gets himself so worked up in these various situations that he will poop himself. These are the scenarios I will make sure he's in a diaper for . He is crated for each of his meals and every time I go outside for brief things like getting the mail or putting out the trash, and he is now totally settled. He is doing better in a crate for longer stints when the crate is covered with the lights off & music playing, but if somethings startles him he will start crying and typically then takes him a while to settle.\n - Barking: When he plays he loves to use his voice! He also barks when left alone.\n\nFinancial needs:\n - Physical Therapy: Gravity is currently enrolled in physical therapy twice a week at Boston Animal Hospital. It is important that he remains seeing his team to regain some flexion of his knees and his overall balance and strength. Physical therapy can be quite costly so it's important to note that we see PT in his future indefinitely\n - Daily supplies: Belly bands, diapers, pee mats, supplements, food, yogurt, booties etc\n\nFun things to know about Gravity:\n - Likes: Loves dogs of all sizes & ages, obsessed with Benebones and chew toys and loves a good stuffy to shred, loves long walks, beach time is his favorite, great for car rides, we're working on leash skills and he walks wonderfully in a pack\n - Dislikes: Being left completely alone, vacuum cleaners, steam cleaners, random scary loud noises\n\n\nName: Gravity\nBreed: Cattle Dog Mix\nSex: Male\nAge: 6 months\nWeight: 36\nSpayed/Neutered: Not yet\nVaccinations: Up to date\nHeartworm: Negative\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nBASED ON OUR OBSERVATIONS:\nGood with Children: Unknown - brief interactions were promising however he's still a pup (mouthy) and has never lived with kids\nGood with Dogs: Yes! Loves all dogs\nGood with Cats: Unknown\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION:\nInterested in a specific dog, please fill out an application if you are interested in a dog. The number of individual inquiries is overwhelming and we are finding it difficult to respond to each one. We cannot guarantee you will receive a timely response.\n\n\nPaws New England is a rescue, not a shelter, and as such we do not have our dogs housed in one location - they are in foster homes both in New England and in our southern foster homes. If you're interested in a specific dog, please complete a short online application and you will receive a reply within 48 hours so you can ask questions.\n\n\nAt present, if a dog is listed on our website, the dog is considered still available HOWEVER, may have applications that have come in before yours but it's still too early to know if any are a good match; therefore we encourage you to apply.\n\n\n\n\nNOTICE WITH REGARD TO LOCATION OF DOGS: Please note: Paws New England is a foster-based rescue. We do not have a brick and mortar building to house the dogs we rescue. We have found that dogs in foster homes are much more adoptable because they have been observed in a home setting. Dogs listed with Paws New England typically reside in various locations throughout the south (primarily Tennessee, Texas, and Arkansas) and New England (not necessarily in the state of Rhode Island). You will be notified by the adoption coordinator of the location of the dog you are interested in so you have the ability to decide whether to pursue adoption or not.\n\nDogs transported to New England are done so at a fee of $150.00 paid directly to the transporting company by Paws New England; no additional transport costs are responsibility of adopter. This fee is included in the adoption donation.\n\nAdoption donations cover pre-adoption vet costs (including vaccinations, spay/neuter when age appropriate, and heartworm testing/treatment when necessary), a microchip, and transportation to New England if necessary.\n\nDonations for our young, healthy puppies and dogs support their fellow canines of advanced age or suffering from injuries and abuse whose donations are reduced but whose veterinary costs are typically much higher. We appreciate your understanding that your dog will help others in need.\n\nAll known information about the animal is listed above. We do our best to give accurate information, but most of our dogs are rescues and do not come with a known history.\n\nPaws New England abides by the dog importation regulations set forth in the states of MA, CT, NH and RI.",

Visit our FAQ webpage for commonly asked questions about our adoption/foster process.\nHi! I'm Kodiak, a sweet, affectionate boy who is super excited to find my forever home. I was rescued from a construction site near a rail yard and I am thrilled to have an opportunity to find a family that I can love.\n\nTraining and trust will be key to make sure I can be the best dog I can be. I'm house trained, crate trained and get so excited when I see my leash but could use a little help learning not so pull so much.\n\nI love as much attention as possible, laying around and tugging on my rope toy. I would prefer not to share my home with any other animals or small children. I was a stray and need some time to learn my surroundings. A home where I can continue to learn will make me most happy.\n\nI've been described as gorgeous, affectionate, smart and strong. I am very alert when it comes to loud noises, such as the garbage truck or new sounds. My future owners will need to be patient and kind, and continue with my training and socialization.\n\nI'm a sweet boy who is longing for a home where I'll never be left behind again. Can you help me complete my journey and make my dreams of a loving home come true?\n\nFor more information or questions, email atrembley@yahoo.com.Last Day Dog Rescue now microchips all animals before adoption. Microchips are implanted between the animals shoulder blades and are a permanent form of identification. The microchips are registered to Last Day Dog Rescue with the adopter's info added once adopted. If the animal is ever lost and slips his/her collar/tags the microchip allows the finder to know who to contact if scanned for a microchip. Animals MUST still have a collar with tags on at all times. Per our contract, we take all our animals back if for any reason you can't keep your adopted animal.\n\nPlease understand the statements about this animal are based upon the foster home's evaluation of the animal. The animal might behave differently (negatively or positively) in your home. While the animal might be good with the current foster's dogs, cats, children, etc., it may not be with your animal(s) or children. The animal may be housebroken or litter trained in the home of the foster but may relapse in your home. The animal is represented to the public as it performs in the foster home and any statements made regarding the animal are conditional to that foster home setting. Please understand that statements made regarding this animal are simply overviews and are not guaranteed.\n\nThe Petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our animals. Visual breed identification in animals is unreliable so for most of the animals we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each animal as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our animals based on personality, not by breed label.\n\nThank you for looking through our list of animals needing forever homes and choosing rescue first. We appreciate you stopping by.",

I don't want any other dogs or kids in the house to have to share your attention with. I love car rides and am the perfect passenger. My previous owners say I can escape any crate, but my foster lets me free roam inside when they're gone and I am very trustworthy to not chew or destroy the house. I get so excited on walks that I pull sometimes, but I just need someone to show me how to be a proper lady. I get nervous in new places or if there is a lot of commotion, but who can blame me?\n\nZoie is about 4.5 years old, spayed, UTD on her vaccines, and house trained. Zoie is a very sweet, gentle girl. She likes toys and chewing on them. We are still learning about her personality, but she will take some time to fully decompress. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet please complete an application at this link https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/24689/generic . \n\nWe are an official 501C3 organziation that does not have a physical location.

            "description": "A SENIOR DOG THAT SAVED HIS FAMILY IS NOW LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO SAVE HIS LIFE!\n\nKesshie and his brother were sleeping in their previous home when suddenly they smelled smoke. They immediately ran into the bedroom of their former owners and started barking loudly, letting them know that something was wrong. The family woke up and followed them down the stairs and outside to safely. By the time emergency services arrived, the home was already engulfed in flames; had it not been for Kesshie and his brother, the family may not have been so lucky. The family was so very grateful for their dogs, but worry soon followed...the former family home was no longer habitable. Left without shelter, the family was forced to move-in with relatives, but unfortunately, Kesshie and his brother were not able to join them and were forced to be surrendered to a high-kill shelter. Being that Kesshie's brother was young, he was quick to be adopted but sadly, Kesshie was left behind and continued to be passed over (presumably only because of his age). Kesshie is glad his former family is now safe; but now it is his turn to rediscover what the safety of home and family feels like! \n\nKesshie is a young (but still vibrant and friendly) 10 years of age. He weighs approximately 42lbs, is neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, microchipped and heartworm negative. Kesshie loves people of all sizes and gets along well with other dogs (cats are not known). \n\nIf you have an open place in your heart and home, won't you please consider giving this sweet senior boy all of the love and creature comforts provided by a permanent home? Please complete an application to meet Kesshie today!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

My foster mom always tells me how sweet and adorable I am and that there is a perfect home out there for me here in Colorado. I may be a little shy at first but I am quick to warm up when you give me the time and patience to adjust to new places, people, and situations. My foster family says I am silly, and I love my toys and dog bed. I am crate trained and potty trained and I love to go on walks. My furry foster sisters have helped me be more confident out in the world. We play chase, tug-of-war, and run around the yard together. I am good with other dogs and with children. Please consider opening your hearts and home to me and I will forever be your friend.\n\n*Homeownership Required!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n\nAdoptaGSD.org\n\nPlease consider that some of these dogs have been abandoned or ignored by their previous owners, having little interaction with someone who cares about them.\n\nWhen adopted, they will need time to adjust to the changes in their life.\n\nHi, my name is Ruby and I'm a beautiful one year old GSD who was surrendered to FRGSR by my former senior owner after I knocked her down and caused her to be injured to the point where she could no longer care for me. I didn't mean to hurt her - I just have a good bit of puppy energy that was too much for her. Sadly, I have some medical issues of my own. My pastern (lower left leg) angles out to the side, possibly due to a growth plate injury, and because this issue wasn't addressed during my puppy months, it looks like I'm going to require an extensive surgery to help me regain proper use of my leg. I am able to run and play now, but this issue does need to be corrected. FRGSR is consulting with an orthopedic specialist regarding next steps and the hope is to find an adopter who will commit to my aftercare, which will require leash-only exercise for approximately three months. I'm a happy, somewhat shy dog who's hoping there's someone out there waiting just for me! Is that you? If you are interested, please go to adoptagsd.org and submit an online application.\n\nAlthough we do our best to keep our adoptable animals page as current as possible,the animals you see may already be in an adoption process.",

OUR CONTACT IS THROUGH FACEBOOK MESSENGER. https://www.facebook.com/REDRescueEveryDog/\n\nMeet Fancy! Fancy is a super sweet Pomeranian who is estimated to be 6-8 years old and 6-8lbs. Once comfortable with you she loves being held and babied, but can be evasive about being picked up, especially with new people. She is a favorite with volunteers she knows and trusts, as she is a kind and happy soul without a mean bone in her body. As sweet and kind as Fancy is, she is also an enormous flight risk who loses all recall once out of her safe area. She is tiny and can (and has) slipped out under feet through doors and gates. Fancy is most comfortable in her routine,\nhome environment. She is not comfortable in new places or situations and can easily slip out of collars and harnesses, so a home that wants to take her out on walks is not a match to her. Once she is out and loose she is nearly impossible for a team to catch and would be impossible for a single person. Due to this she a double barrier catch system is required for her adoptive home.  She has been good for grooming with us. She does well with other like sized and kind dogs and with a quiet and consistent routine is quiet and joyous. Again, this dog requires a fully fenced and secure yard with a visible fence, as well as a sturdy, high quality crate. She is a flight risk if she gets loose, so a safe routine for going out and a yard like Fort Knox is required. She also had been debarked before we rescued her, and so you will need a vet that understands this and will need to be willing to do any dentals without tubing. She has a slight case of alopecia that has been getting better and growing hair back since she was spayed. She is an exceptionally sweet dog, looking for  a loyal and loving family to finally give her the home she has always deserved. Adoption donation is $600.\n\nTHIS DOG IS IN FOSTER CARE IN POULSBO, WA. MEET AND GREETS WILL TAKE PLACE THERE AS WELL. \n\nREQUIREMENTS FOR ADOPTION:\n\n- Incredibly secure, visibly fenced yard \n- Double barrier catch system \n- Sturdy/safe crate space\n- Vet & groomer references (Or ability to groom on your own).\n\nADOPTION PROCESS: \n\nIf you are interested in adoption please fill out an application here: http://www.rescueeverydog.org/Adoption.php\nAnswers to the application MUST be sent via message on Facebook (we do not receive applications sent via email)\n\n1.

            "description": "*Please read the whole bio. As Annie needs a special adopter*\n\nAnnie is a sweet special maltipoo girl with a little \"sass\". Big dog personality in a small body. She is 6 years old and 9.5 lbs. She was surrendered to the rescue when her previous owner could not care for her anymore. She wants to be with her people all the time if she can, we call her the little velcro dog =) Annie is not potty trained and she does mark (hike her leg) inside the house. We are working hard on that but for now she is wearing a diaper inside. She can be without diaper for a short period if monitored. Annie reminds me of typical dog that was never properly socialized and she can get a little nervous/growly around new dogs. She is currently living with two large dogs in the house. She does not like cats. She eats separately in her crate due to food guarding. Annie sometimes gets nervous when pushed beyond her comfort zone and that can make her a little snappy. Due to this, she would do best in a calmer household with no younger children. Annie loves her daily walks and doesn\u2019t mind riding in the car. She loves to go where I go. Annie potentially has allergies and she is on a trial run on Apoquel tabs to help with her itchy-ness. Interested in Annie? Next step would be to fill out an application, link below.\n\nAnnie is heartworm negative, spayed and up-to-date on vaccinations. The dog has a microchip that will be transferred to the adopter upon completion of the adoption process. The adoption fee is $300. \n\nIf you would like to meet Annie or have any questions, you can email the foster home at malinsavland@gmail.com\n\nReady to adopt?  Please complete our on line application here:\nhttps://pethoodga.org/dog-adoption-request/\nIt will be reviewed and the foster will contact you.\n\nTo sponsor a dog, please visit pethoodga.org/give",

She is a gentle eater and eats gracefully from your hand. Sweet girl loves sticks, balls, ice, her toys and her bed. She's eager to learn and responds well to commands. Introducing her to people takes about 10 minutes or so to build the trust, then she can melt someone's heart. I'd really love to be her dog sitter if you go out of town.\n\nSweet Girl is house trained, and crate trained. She is not so great with cats, but I believe she can be trained. I am not sure if she is good with children (she can learn because she's sweet).\n\nYou can submit an application to adopt at\nwww.obbrescue.org.\nAdoption fee $275.00 for dogs 6 months and older, puppies are $315.

            "description": "Tucker was found living under a car at a local automotive plant. He was terrified of people. After eventually being lured out with food, after he'd been starved for days, he was taken to animal control.  Tucker reverted back to a very fearful state. \n\nAfter months of rehabilitation with volunteers, Tucker has become comfortable enough to interact with volunteers and even newly introduced stranges. He has proven himself to be a sweet, goofy and playful boy.\n\nHe has a clear aversion to leashes, which volunteers are working with him to overcome.\n\nHe is food motivated, eager to please and we are confident that he will be a fantastic companion.\n\nWe are looking for a REGISTERED RESCUE with the experience to take over his rehabilitation. Proof of professional training experience and veterinary reference a must in this case. \n\nTucker is a unique case for our shelter. \n*****************************************************************************************************\nInterested in adopting?\n\nDue to COVID- 19 the shelter is closed to the public at this time.\n\nWe are still conducting adoptions, but with a few changes. :)\n\n1. Submit an application through our website at wacshelter.com if you are interested in giving one of our shelter animals a home\n\n2. We will schedule phone interviews once the online application has been processed.\n\n3. If the animal applied for is determined to be a good fit for the home, we will schedule a controlled in person meeting with the cat or dog prior to the adoption.\n\n*ADOPTION FEE:\n\n$95 (cash only) and includes:\n\nSpay/neuter\nFirst vaccines\nFIV/FeLV test (cats)\nHeartworm test (dogs)\nRabies vaccine (if old enough).\n\n*****************************************************************************************************\nAdditional questions?\n\nDoes this dog get along with cats? There is almost always an acclimation period when a new pet joins the household. We are happy to suggest a few ways to ease the transition. A new dog should never be left alone with resident pets though.\n\nDoes this dog respond well to other dogs? No dog loves every other dog. A proper introduction (meet and greet) would be required as part of the application process.\n\nIs this dog good with children? The better question is how the children have been taught to handle animals. A dog will respond negatively if he/she is not being handled properly. We can offer suggestions on how to teach children to interact with dogs and pay attention to body language. Young children should never be left unsupervised with new animals.\n\n*****************************************************************************************************\nWant to help a real shelter animal by adopting a Mini Plush Pet from our limited time fundraiser?

Surrendered for marking indoors and anxiety when left alone. ----- Additional Notes: Kiko has been a blast to have a round. We crate when we are not home and he is working on crate training so anxiety is not an an issue for us. He may be a barker for an apartment if he hears people and other sounds. But here, he is good. He loves to play with the other dogs and is just a happy little guy. We don't really know breeds for sure but were told boston/rat but I see some corgi and chi characteristics. My guess would be that he is a heinz 57! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If interested in meeting and potentially adopting, please read the adoption requirements and complete the adoption application located at forbellessake.org. Once processed and approved a meet and greet can be scheduled and if a match an adoption can be finalized at that time. FBS standard adoption fee is $175. All residents are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped, and treated for any known medical needs. Breeds are best guess. Housetraining is not guaranteed but crate training is worked on with all residents. A secure physically fenced yard is required. See Less\n",

He is a herding dog and will need an active individual with a fenced in yard. Louie has lived with two young children but we feel children over 10 would be best due to his size. Louie is a happy dog who enjoys leash walking . At 70 pounds he is not a puller but an enjoyable walk. He is crate and house trained too!!\nif interested please fill out an application online at njshpetrescue.org. Please note that you must live within 60 minutes of Chester NJ to be considered",

She does get along with other dogs but really loves her toys and doesn\u2019t always like to share so would do best with a laid back dog. She would do best with no cats and not small animals.\n\nShe knows some basic commands but needs some work on her leash manners. She is very vocal, as an attention seeking behaviour. She would do best in a detached home with a fenced in yard.\n\nShe has been vaccinated, spayed, heartworm tested and microchipped.\n\nPlease do not come to the kennel to meet Bryn. We are processing applications prior to meet and greets due to COVID policies to help keep everyone safe. If you are interested in more information please either email or call. The adoption application can be found on our website at www.acclobo.com. \n",

I am Nike and I LOVE people!!! I am good with cats after proper introduction\nand have 2 who take naps with me on my bed now. My foster mom says to not\nlet my age fool you. I still have plenty of wiggles that need daily exercise. I prefer\nto be where my human is at and will move rooms to be near my humans. I like\ncar rides. I don't like the crate but if you insist on it, I will stay quietly in one when I am not able to go in the car with you. I am a bit of a mischief maker when left out loose so to let me ride along, right?\n\nMy foster mom says my ideal home means I get to be with my\nhuman(s) nearly 100% of the time. I am a senior and want as much time as possible to love on my peeps and being alone is for the birds, not me. I walk well on a leash and also enjoy a good zoomies session when I am off leash.\nI haven't met other dogs much, although the neighbor dachshunds were coolio. The few I have met thru a fence on walks I am polite to and a pal might be something I wouldn't mind. My foster mom says I am not a barker or a licker but that I do love hugs and lots of loving from my humans.\n\nDoes Nike sound like a match for your family?\nConsider applying to adopt today at:\n\nhttps://www.nwboxerrescue.org/adoption-form\n\nIf you would like to adopt him, fill out an adoption application on our website www.nwboxerrescue.org\n\nLike us on facebook for more photos of this handsome boy, as well as other boxers we have available! www.facebook.com/northwestboxerrescue",

            "description": "We would love Opal and Ray Ray to be adopted as a bonded pair. However, we would certainly consider separating them for the right situation. Please read their beautiful heart felt bio below.\n\nLike a lot of great people and animals, Opal and Ray Ray came from humble beginnings. Only they know all of the details of their past, but Opal came to ACT from a hoarding situation and Ray Ray came to ACT as a young dog with multiple issues including an infected eye that had to be removed. Their luck turned when they both found their way to a loving foster home that offered good food, a quiet, consistent environment and a loving person all their own. Of course, they soon became \"foster fails and were adopted by their foster mother. Life was very, very good, until their person suddenly passed away, and they found themselves back at ACT. Their world turned upside down and they clung to each other, the only thing they knew. \nOpal is a survivor and makes lemonade out of lemons whenever possible. She would love a new home with soft beds, both human and dog, lots of lap time, and lots of walks where she can stretch out on the grass and smell the roses. She wants love and knows how to get it. Ray Ray, on the other hand, lacks Opal's confidence. Generally afraid of new things, Ray Ray would do well in a quiet home where he could come or retreat as needed. But once he feels at home, you can bring out Ray Ray's magic wand...... Cheetos!!! Wave a Cheeto at Ray Ray and you'll be amazed at how many commands he knows.... provided a Cheeto is in sight. \nIf dogs reminisce, I think they miss their human. We all do. But life is for the living, and both Opal and Ray Ray have a lot of life left to live. Opal and Ray Ray have a few special needs, but they have a lot of love to give.\n\nGenerally afraid of new things, Ray Ray would do well in a quiet home where he\ncould come or retreat as needed.

            "description": "We would love Opal and Ray Ray to be adopted as a bonded pair. However, we would certainly consider separating them for the right situation. Please read their beautiful heart felt bio below.\n\nLike a lot of great people and animals, Opal and Ray Ray came from humble beginnings. Only they know all of the details of their past, but Opal came to ACT from a hoarding situation and Ray Ray came to ACT as a young dog with multiple issues including an infected eye that had to be removed. Their luck turned when they both found their way to a loving foster home that offered good food, a quiet, consistent environment and a loving person all their own. Of course, they soon became \"foster fails and were adopted by their foster mother. Life was very, very good, until their person suddenly passed away, and they found themselves back at ACT. Their world turned upside down and they clung to each other, the only thing they knew. \nOpal is a survivor and makes lemonade out of lemons whenever possible. She would love a new home with soft beds, both human and dog, lots of lap time, and lots of walks where she can stretch out on the grass and smell the roses. She wants love and knows how to get it. Ray Ray, on the other hand, lacks Opal's confidence. Generally afraid of new things, Ray Ray would do well in a quiet home where he could come or retreat as needed. But once he feels at home, you can bring out Ray Ray's magic wand...... Cheetos!!! Wave a Cheeto at Ray Ray and you'll be amazed at how many commands he knows.... provided a Cheeto is in sight. \nIf dogs reminisce, I think they miss their human. We all do. But life is for the living, and both Opal and Ray Ray have a lot of life left to live. Opal and Ray Ray have a few special needs, but they have a lot of love to give.\n\nHi my name is Opal and although I may be a little shy at first it doesn't take me very long before I come right up to you and give you kisses. I love to go on walks, going with you on your vacations or doing some gardening with you and then relaxing with you at the end of a long day. I have a lifetime of love, affection and loyalty to give you in exchange for just a little bit of patience and understanding to help me feel comfortable in my new home.",

German short haired pointer mix looking for his furever home. This handsome boy is a gentle soul who loves to run and play in the yard, then nap on the sofa. He is a bit timid and requires the companionship of a confident, friendly dog to help him navigate the world. He is housebroken, crate trained and dog and cat friendly. Please review Falcon's requirements before applying: Falcon requires a home with a physically-fenced yard, a calm, confident fur sibling. He is not suited to apartment living. If you have any current pets, please make sure they are up-to-date on vaccines, heartworm testing and flea and tick prevention and heartworm prevention. We check vet references before we contact applicants. If you would like to meet Falcon, please fill out a foster-to-adopt application at\ndreamhouserescue.org.\n\nAll of our fully-vetted adoptable dogs go to prospective homes for a one-week trial foster-to-adopt period to make sure the dog and home are the right fit before an adoption is finalized. We only adopt dogs into homes where all current pets are spayed/neutered and current on vaccines and heartworm and flea and tick prevention. We do check veterinary references to make sure adopters are compliant with standard veterinary care.",

            "description": "Here is Hobbes' story...\nWe got him about six years ago from Animal Control, he was a stray. He was very fearful and timid, but with a lot of work and love from our volunteers, he overcame these issues.\nHe was adopted to a great home, but it was an apartment, and Hobbes did some damage to the carpeting and walls when his mom left to go to work. Second home was better, he had a fenced yard and another dog for company. Those people had to move and their new house did not have an adequate fence to keep him in. We tried to help them improve their fence but Hobbes still escaped.\nSo he's back here, thank goodness, safe and sound. Hobbes must have a 6' high, solid wooden fence. He can climb chain link like a monkey. The second family that had him said he had occasional seizures, although we have not witnessed any. He is a nice dog, kind of quirky personality (you need to meet him to appreciate it) and is a great companion. Okay with dogs and older (10 years +) kids. Most likely would chase cats.All of our dogs are available for a $200 donation. This includes them being spayed/neutered, micro-chipped, and fully vaccinated.\nTo adopt a dog, we require an approved pre-application, as well as a securely fenced yard. This means an actual, physical, fence. 'Invisible' fences are not acceptable, sorry. If you live in an apartment and do not have a yard, we are not able to adopt to you.\nPlease contact us at: dogtownmutts@gmail.com for details.\nPlease note: we typically do not do 'out of the area' adoptions. This would be any location more than 60 miles away from the Reno/Carson City area. 1/31/21 8:46 PM",

            "description": "Hagrid is a very charming 1 year old St. Bernard weighing 160 lbs and growing.  He is a very sensitive young man  He enjoys the company of other dogs at the dog park and, because he is very curious about other dogs, he sometimes forgets his training when he sees them on walks.  He\u2019s a little leery of strangers he meets on a walk\u2026until he has the opportunity to learn that they can be trusted.\nHagrid likes stuffed toys with squeakers in them, which he will use to tell you all about it. He loves to snuggle and enjoys leather couches to keep cool through the night.  \nHe is not crate trained but is fine being left alone in the house\u2026he may, however, chew on a shoe of his favorite person if left alone with the available shoe...he misses his human so much!   Hagrid needs a home with a fenced yard (not invisible/electric fence) and a person or family that does not need to leave him alone regularly for long hours.  He has lived with 2 other dogs, so might enjoy a doggy companion in his forever home.  And while he has not lived with cats, he has enjoyed the ones he met. (Hagrid is currently unneutered; adopter will be required, under monitored contract, to neuter him by a specific date.)\n(A $400 adoption fee is required.) \nIf you are interested in this dog, please go to the Adopt page of our website where you will find a link to an adoption application form  https://www.chewdogrescue.org/index.php/component/rsform/form/5-adoption-application-form\n \nIf you have previously submitted an application form, there is no need to re-apply. Just let us know you're interested in this dog. We do our best to match families and dogs so everyone is pleased and the placement is permanent. We reserve the right to refuse an applicant if the home situation is incompatible with the needs of the rescue dog. Rescue is about doing our best for the dog. We do home and reference checks.  All of our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and are up to date with current vaccinations, before being placed in their forever homes.\n\nFOSTER HOMES NEEDED! We are always looking for good foster homes. Our rescue is foster based and we can always save more dogs if we have foster homes for them to go into. It is not a long term commitment. We have been able to find good forever homes in a short time. We also welcome volunteers who can help transport dogs and help with our outreach and fund raising efforts. Please contact us if you can help.",

It took a few weeks, but Rosie finally arrived at Recycled Rotts on Saturday, Jan. 9th. She is such a good girl, but still not quite sure what is going on. Rosie can be very timid and shy when you first meet, but it doesn't take her long to warm up. A treat is definitely a friend maker, and a piece of cheese will really bring out the wag in her rottie tail. Rosie is good with other dogs, and loved spending the evening with her new friend, Behr. We do not know how she will react to small dogs or cats.  She is housebroken, but it might take a week or so to get into a new routine. Crates are ok for a while, but she would prefer to be near her people. Rosie would love to have a new family to call her own. One that will make her feel special, let her know she is loved. If there are children in the family we prefer they are over the age of 7.\n\nIf you are interested in including Rosie in your home, please go to our website http://www.recycledrotts.org/wp/?page_id=150 for the rescue location, placement policies, placement fee and the link to our online application.",

            "description": "Dodger was allegedly adopted from us a few years ago, we don't recall if he was or not, but we gladly took him in from Animal Control.\nHe was a bit growly when we first got him, but he's really turned the corner and is a happy, healthy boy. We probably would not recommend him for homes with young (under 10 yrs) children, as he's very strong and has a lot of energy. Does okay with other dogs, probably not a great candidate for cats.\nWe are guessing he's around 7 years old, very spunky and affectionate. All of our dogs are available for a $200 donation. This includes them being spayed/neutered, micro-chipped, and fully vaccinated.\nTo adopt a dog, we require an approved pre-application, as well as a securely fenced yard. This means an actual, physical, fence. 'Invisible' fences are not acceptable, sorry. If you live in an apartment and do not have a yard, we are not able to adopt to you.\nPlease contact us at: dogtownmutts@gmail.com for details.\nPlease note: we typically do not do 'out of the area' adoptions. This would be any location more than 60 miles away from the Reno/Carson City area.",

She lights up and wags her puppy tail with enthusiasm when she plays with her foster brother who is a large Golden Retriever. Current pastimes include: playing with toys, chewing on stuff, exploring the backyard, running, jumping, long naps, and snuggles. Lola also enjoys giving people kisses. This Labrador Retriever mix will probably be a medium to large sized dog (50 - 80lbs). Lola is looking for a home where someone is home most of the time (even post-covid.)  She also really, really wants a playmate - a medium to large breed, active, adult dog who can show her the ropes and who she can play with (along with loving humans who will spoil her and give her lots of cuddles)!\n\nCheck out this video of Lola: https://youtu.be/ZSXQzbD33wE\n\nIf you are interested in adopting from us, please complete an adoption application at our website (www.fetchinretrieversrescue.org). Once your application is received, it will be reviewed and you may be contacted to arrange a home visit. In keeping with our adoption process, there are no meet and greets with a dog until all steps in the application process have been completed and a potential match has been made. We adhere to this policy because we strive to ensure adoption success between dogs and their new family.",

            "description": "Intake Date: 9 Jan 2021----- Age: 2 yrs ----- Breed: Parson Russell Terrier----- Size: 20 lbs ----- Status: Owner Surrender ----- Compatible with: children, some dogs and cats ----- Suitable for: home with fenced yard ----- Medical/Behavioral Needs: Came with aggression issues towards the other animals in the home. ----- Additional Notes: Kipper is a handsome guy! He came to FBS as an owner surrender. His family worked with him for a long time trying to get him compatible with the other jacks in the home but Kipper just wasn't having it. He is doing good here with the animals at FBS so far but he is still new so it's all unknown to him. We will know more as he settles in and gets neutered. So far, he is shy and a bit standoffish with new people but otherwise, has been adjusting well. This is not a breed for the passive or inactive. This is a working dog with a lot of spunk! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If interested in meeting and potentially adopting, please read the adoption requirements and complete the adoption application located at forbellessake.org. Once processed and approved a meet and greet can be scheduled and if a match an adoption can be finalized at that time. FBS standard adoption fee is $175. All residents are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped, and treated for any known medical needs. Breeds are best guess. Housetraining is not guaranteed but crate training is worked on with all residents. A secure physically fenced yard is required. See Less\n",

He is very smart and eager to please, but he gets a little anxious and nervous at times trying to anticipate what is being asked of him. He has passed 6 weeks of training at Kai's Academy in Ankeny but he needs continued training and reinforcement of the things he has learned. He needs an owner that is willing take the time he needs to learn the expectations in the his new home and give him a predictable schedule to help with his fears of the unknown. He is working on kennel training and leash training in his foster home. He is very strong and loves to go for walks but can pull quite hard at times. The proper harness, training collar, and practice will help with this. Max gets along with other dogs and enjoys meeting new dogs, but needs a home with children over 10 or no children. He is not currently in a foster home with cats, but he has been exposed to them and does well with them.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Max, please complete an online application at https://hopeanimalrescueofiowa.duplie.com/forms/196/dog-application\n\nAdoption fee is $250 which includes spay/neuter, microchip, and age appropriate vaccines.",

            "description": "Say hello to Dakota! She is a 4-year-old, intelligent, Siberian Husky mix looking for a family who loves and appreciates the typical husky shenanigans. She is a husky who likes to have fun and can find it in everything she does. She's a smart girl that already knows sit, shake, and down. She's a great car rider and loves to feel the wind in her face. Be sure to keep an eye on this smart girl as she has rolled the electric window down before and tried to exit the vehicle while moving. Dakota is social and friendly girl and loves to go places to meet new people. She even enjoys visits to the groomer and the vet. Dakota likes to play with other dogs her own size, but prefers to be left on her own when chewing on a bone and eating her meals. No small dogs, small animals, or cats for her though, as they look like fun play things and sometimes prey. Dakota is hoping for a family that understands life with a husky and all the things that come with that. She is also hoping her family likes to be active and spend time with her. She's a bit overweight and could use some help shedding those extra pounds. She LOVES to go swimming. If she sees a lake or pond she will jump right in. She is crate trained in that she won't mess in her crate but it's not her favorite place to be. She would rather be left out loose during the day and in her old home she would behave while her owner was at work. Dakota was only returned to us because her owner's job changed and required a lot of travel. She is house trained and would be sure to hold it when left alone. Just be sure to have the trash out of reach and don't leave any food on the counters, not even a loaf of bread. Dakota likes the older kids and wants to snuggle with them. No apartments for her. Dakota's adoption fee is $150. If you would like to adopt Dakota go to www.pawpatroldayton.com/adopt and fill out an application. All of our animals are vaccinated, micro-chipped and spayed/neutered before being adopted.",

She loves to play with other dogs and to go on hikes. She would make a great walking/running partner!  \n\nGhazala needs to lose a significant amount of weight, so we would like to find her a home with an active owner and a fenced-in yard where she can get lots of exercise. She would do great in a house with another dog to play with, but would also be fine as an only dog. \n\nWe would like to have Ghazala adopted around the Baltimore area. She will come up to date on her shots, spayed, and microchipped. If you are interested in adopting her, please fill out an online application on our website wingsoflovekuwait.com. We will then contact you to conduct a home visit and, once you are approved, a $100 deposit is required.\n",

He is on heart medication. Kadey deserves a senior home, soft bed, and lots of love. ----- Additional Notes: Kadey is a senior boy found astray and picked up by ACO. He came to FBS after being unclaimed. He was matted and smelled horrible but a good grooming and he is all spiffed up. Kadey is such a sweet boy. He is so good with all of the other dogs and ignores the cats. He mainly just wants to lay on his soft bed and get cuddles. This old guy deserves the warmest of homes to live out his remaining years. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If interested in meeting and potentially adopting, please read the adoption requirements and complete the adoption application located at forbellessake.org. Once processed and approved a meet and greet can be scheduled and if a match an adoption can be finalized at that time. FBS standard adoption fee is $175. All residents are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped, and treated for any known medical needs. Breeds are best guess. Housetraining is not guaranteed but crate training is worked on with all residents. A secure physically fenced yard is required. See Less\n",

She is a million miles an hour and deserves an active home. She is also young and needs training and boundaries. This is noted when she plays with other dogs, she doesn\u2019t know social boundaries and when to stop. She likely just never received manners but once she learns, will blossom. Fenced yard required. Has not been cat tested yet. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If interested in meeting and potentially adopting, please read the adoption requirements and complete the adoption application located at forbellessake.org. Once processed and approved a meet and greet can be scheduled and if a match an adoption can be finalized at that time. FBS standard adoption fee is $175. All residents are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped, and treated for any known medical needs. Breeds are best guess. Housetraining is not guaranteed but crate training is worked on with all residents. A secure physically fenced yard is required. See Less\n",

            "description": "Sweet, cuddly, affectionate, easy-going, laid back - sound like your dream dog? Then you simply must meet our sweet lovebug, Patches! Around 3 years old and 70 lbs, she could use to shed a few extra pounds, but hey, who among us couldn't?! It's just more of her to love! And let us tell you, this girl LOVES love. She is a velcro dog for sure. Working from home? Need some moral support? Patches will be Team You all day everyday. Sitting by your side and making it all seem effortless. Patches is a mature gal who knows how to respect nice things and surely knows where to do her business. Personal space, not so much her thing, as the closer she can get to you the better and she is sure to be an awesome foot warmer as you sit at the desk, television or kitchen table. She is your all around best mate! Cuddles and food may tie as her favorite things. If Patches sounds like she may be on your list of favorite things then submit an application to come to meet her today! A dog this sweet surely won't be hanging around the farm long!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.\n\n2/2/21 5:51 PM",

She needed a little extra TLC. Madi is a good girl, just a little shy and uneasy at times, especially in really loud or active situations. She likes other dogs but is not a fan of bouncy playful in your face pups. She\u2019d rather have a low key companion. She is a good girl deserving of a lifelong home. Has not been cat tested yet. Prefer a home with older or calmer children at this time. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If interested in meeting and potentially adopting, please read the adoption requirements and complete the adoption application located at forbellessake.org. Once processed and approved a meet and greet can be scheduled and if a match an adoption can be finalized at that time. FBS standard adoption fee is $175. All residents are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped, and treated for any known medical needs. Breeds are best guess. Housetraining is not guaranteed but crate training is worked on with all residents. A secure physically fenced yard is required. See Less\n",

Thank you!**\n\nMeet elegant Annie Rae, an 8-year old, 48-pound, Red Bone Coonhound lady.\n\nAnnie was found straying alone.  She had clearly been away from care for a long time since she was way underweight.  Now that she\u2019s in a loving foster home, she is making up for lost meals, feasting on as much food as the vet thinks is healthy and begging for more.\n\nAnnie is a mature girl with a teenage spirit.  She\u2019s very outgoing and curious about everything.  She wants to meet every new person that comes to her foster home and she follows every scent she picks up all around the house and the yard. \n\nAnnie Rae is very good on a leash and loves her long walks just as much as she loves coming back home and cuddling up and sleep next to nice warm human friend.\n-- \nAll dogs are up to date on vaccinations and spayed/neutered at the time of adoption.  \n\nTo adopt or learn more about Annie Rae, you must fill out an adoption application. To find the application, copy and paste this URL into your browser: WWW.GDRNE.COM/ADOPTION-APPLICATION [Adoption Fee: $425]  **  PLEASE READ: If a dog is listed, then s/he is currently available for adoption. Their information is correct to the best of our abilities and the information we have been given as of the day of posting. Please note, GDRNE does not guarantee the breed of any dog or puppy unless stated that we have run DNA. All breeds listed are educated estimates. Our dogs are rescued from various situations. It is most likely that both their parents were strays and even if not, mixes of some sort and that their grandparents were mixes as well. The dog may have some genetic material of an American Staffordshire Terrier (pit bull). The dogs are usually mixes of many breeds, making them a breed all their own - a True and adorable American MUTT. If you are interested in this dog, you must submit an application. Great Dog is not a shelter so there is no building you can visit. Our dogs live in private foster homes until adopted. To learn more about our *shelterless* rescue, adoption fees, and procedures, review the list of Frequently Asked Questions on our website at WWW.GDRNE.COM.",

My foster says I absolutely love the walking paths in the forests. I can be a little shy at first, but once I get to know you, I become the most loyal pal you will ever have. When we are getting ready to go outside, I'll give you my big old puppy eyes and tap my feet with excitement! You won't be able to resist.\n\nRocky is currently living with a volunteer foster family.

She needed a little extra TLC. Madi is a good girl, just a little shy and uneasy at times, especially in really loud or active situations. She likes other dogs but is not a fan of bouncy playful in your face pups. She\u2019d rather have a low key companion. She is a good girl deserving of a lifelong home. Has not been cat tested yet. Prefer a home with older or calmer children at this time. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If interested in meeting and potentially adopting, please read the adoption requirements and complete the adoption application located at forbellessake.org. Once processed and approved a meet and greet can be scheduled and if a match an adoption can be finalized at that time. FBS standard adoption fee is $175. All residents are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped, and treated for any known medical needs. Breeds are best guess. Housetraining is not guaranteed but crate training is worked on with all residents. A secure physically fenced yard is required. See Less\n",

He had come to their home as a stray and, while they tried their best to make things work with him, he is NOT good with cats and began to have territorial and resource aggression behaviors with their other dog. \nHank tested good with children 8+, is house and crate trained, knows 'sit' 'down' 'wait' 'shake' and 'leave it'. His owner reports that he LOVES road trips and would make an excellent travelling companion!! \n\nThe adoption fee is $250 and includes spay/neuter, current vaccinations, microchip with life-long free registration, deworming, and Heartworm test for all dogs over 6 months. Age and breed are our best guess.\nYou can fill out an application on our website www.newhoperescueinc.com by clicking the animal's picture and then clicking on the adoption application button.\nPLEASE READ OUR COVID-19 AND DEPOSIT POLICY ON OUR WEBSITE!",

And even though he might look quite serious, he\u2019s a goofy guy who will play all day if you let him. Tug of war with his favorite rope toy = pure bliss in Bruce\u2019s book. Bruce knows basic obedience and engages well during training, but he can sometimes forget how big he is and would therefore do best in a home without small children who he could easy knock over. He's also crate and potty trained and does very well in his crate. Bruce is very friendly with women, but he tends to take a little longer to warm up to men and prefers interactions to be on his terms until he\u2019s comfortable. He's fostered with dogs of all sizes and ages, as well as dog-savvy cats, and he\u2019d really love another playful dog who he can zoom around and play tug with. If Bruce sounds like the meaty man of your dreams, then apply today! His adoption fee is $250.\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",
