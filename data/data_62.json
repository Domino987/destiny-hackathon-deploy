We do require that all of your current dogs and cats are current on vaccines and spayed/neutered.  We do not have a shelter, and are a foster-home based organization.  Other than meeting our babies at events, we do require that you have an approved adoption application to schedule a meet and greet.  You can fill out an adoption application on our website, www.herorescue.org/adopt.",

He loves every person he meets, is submissive with other dogs, LOVES to play and run and is just an all around sweetheart. He does really well in a home with other dogs and for his happiness, he will need to be placed in a home with some buddies to love and play with. He could use some manners as he is learning not to jump on people but does it out of complete love.:-) He would be a great running, hiking, or adventure buddy and would love to explore the mountains of CO with his new family. This is one special boy and we can't wait to find him the home he truly deserves. \n\nChance is located in a foster home in Denver, Co.. He is neutered, up to date on all shots, microchipped and his adoption fee is $250.

At first it seemed as if I was going to get to go back home but due to unfortunate circumstances that is not going to happen. That is pretty sad, yes, but I know there are many very kind humans out there so I am just going to count on one of them deciding that I would make a great new best friend for them and then decide to come meet me. I am a very good girl and I will give that person a heart full of unconditional love forever! Does that sound good to you? Call for an appointment to meet me and let\u2019s get started on our happily ever after right away! OK????\n\nAvailable for adoption at:\nMuskingum County Dog Warden & Adoption Center\n1500 Newark Rd., Zanesville, Ohio 43701\n740-453-0273\nPlease call ahead if you plan to visit.\nOpen M-F 11-5 and Saturday 11-4.\n\nAdoption fee is $105 which includes spay/neuter, combo, rabies, and bordetella vaccines, heartworm test and dog license, $125 if vaccinated for the flu. (Although some of the dogs come to the pound spayed or neutered, most do not. If you adopt a dog that has not yet been spayed/neutered, we will set up an appointment for the dog to be spayed/neutered before it can leave the facility.)",

He gets along with other dogs, walks well on the leash, and would probably make someone a good jogging partner. He is currently walking a little over 1 miles with his foster mom daily. She is working on house training and Murphy is responding very well.\nA good home for Murphy would be with a family who will love him and give him lots of attention. Murphy would really like another dog in the home to play with too.\nIf you would like to meet Murphy or know more about him, please email rrcainfo@gmail.com or go to our website to fill out an adoption application at www.russellrescueca.com 2/1/21 12:12 PM",

She is understandably confused and therefore shy for finding herself in unfamiliar surroundings but she seems to warm up fairly quickly. She also seems to want nothing more than to be loved.  She is obviously a mix of a husky and likely Australian shepherd. Therefore, we will require that any potential adopters be extremely familiar and experienced with these breeds.",

He is very timid with new people but is absolutely devoted to \"\"his\"\" person/people. He's extremely loving but not social...no dog parks, etc.\n\nRemi will make a great addition to a quiet household. He is housetrained, fully vetted, neutered, microchipped, and is on flea/tick and heartworm prevention. His vet records will be turned over to his adoptive parent(s).

Welcome the Cutie Pie Pups - chock full of fluffy morsels to tempt your sweet tooth! Indulge today!\n\nMeet beautiful Natalie! A 1-2-year-old female Lab blend WEIGHING 41.5 POUNDS, she is fully grown and ready to take on the world! Natalie was an owner surrender (her family couldn't take care of her due to financial reasons). She was going to be placed in a shelter but our foster friends were able to convince her owners to allow MatchDog to take her. Now, this sweet, sweet girl is under our care. Natalie's foster says that she is calm, loving and friendly. Playful, too! She'll need a family that loves to go for walks and jogs or one that will be able to provide a yard in which she can run and have fun. Crate trained and house trained, she'll be ready for her new home in February. If you are looking for a new buddy to take on 2021 with, Natalie's your gal! Don't delay! Apply for this fabulous pup today! \n\nIf you think you are a perfect match for Natalie please complete an application fully: https://www.petstablished.com/organization/243592 \n\nNatalie has been fully vetted, is up to date on all vaccinations and on preventatives for heartworm, flea, and tick. We cannot guarantee breed information. You will find price guidelines for adoption at matchdogrescue.org and you can read about the whole adoption process and what MatchDog Rescue provides with each dog. \n\nThis gorgeous MatchDog is currently being fostered and cared for at our own facility so as to look and feel her best when she meets you on Saturday, February 13th, 2021. For the very best chance of securing a meet with this dog, you must be available all day on this date. \n\nIf you see a pending notification on this dog, it means we have informed the lucky family selected as the best match for this particular dog and they have agreed to come to the transport/event with the goal of taking the dog to their forever home. If for any reason this plan falls through, we will change the picture back to its original format and revisit other applications.",

            "description": "Solo T. is an extremely calm, sweet 11-year-old male German Shepherd Dog who was surrendered by his owner to a shelter in Southern California. He is an easy going boy who takes a general interest in other dogs but really loves to be with his people. Solo was placed with a foster family who was amazed at how well he adjusted to a new environment. Unfortunately, Solo developed a skin condition that resulted in his return to the shelter for treatment. His itchy skin is now under treatment, making him more comfortable but still very interested in back rubs! Like most senior dogs, Solo has some arthritis but he loves to go out on short walks and walks well on leash. Solo is house trained, loves to be petted and rides well in the car. He shows no food aggression or other difficult behaviors. Solo is a very polite, quiet dog. He never nuisance-barks even when dogs around him are all barking! He is house trained, crate trained and loves treats. TSGSR volunteers love his kind, sweet disposition. Solo will make a loving, calm addition to a new family!\n\nSolo T. Summary:\n- Solo is a male, 11 yrs old, weighs 62 lbs, current on shots\n- Good with Adults, middle school aged children, dogs, and travel in the car\n- Cats TBD\n\nSolo passed a set of evaluation tests before being accepted into the TSGSR. The tests are not intended to assess how smart the dog is but are important for TSGSR to determine if the dog is expected to be safe in a family home. The tested behaviors check to see if the dog will guard or protect food or toys from people, will tolerate handling all over its body (including ears, nose, lips to check teeth, lifting paws, belly, back, and gently pulling the tail) and the ability to get along with other well behaved dogs. He remained calm during all of these tests and showed no aggressive tendencies. \n\nPlease join us in welcoming Solo to TSGSR! Check back often. We will be updating his bio as we learn more about him!\n\nWhat's Next for Solo T:\nThulani Senior German Shepherd Rescue (TSGSR) will continue to see that Solo is well cared for and receives all medical care needed for his well being while in our care. In addition, TSGSR is beginning a search for an adoptive home that will care for him for the rest of his life. He will come to his new home with a supply of food, a cushy pad if wanted, and other goodies such as toys. \n\nSolos medical expenses will be covered for the rest of his life by Thulani Senior German Shepherd Rescue (TSGSR)!\n\nIf you want to learn more about Solo, or are interested in possibly providing an adoptive or foster home, please send us a message by clicking on the \"Ask About Me\" button. We will often get feedback or \"updates\" from a dog's foster home and as any updates become available they will be included here.\n\nIf you are reading about him on Petfinder.com sometimes an available YouTube video is not listed. If this occurs you can still view the video by pasting its URL into a new browser window or tab.\n\nAvailable Video URL(s): https://youtu.be/RE1T97VRg9U\n\nSaving one dog wont change the world. It will change the world for that one dog.",

Buddy is a very intelligent dog who has great house manners, does not need crated wile alone, will happily play with his toys, and sleep on his bed at night. \n\nBuddy will need an owner who can follow through with what he is learning with our trainer regarding leash walking, greeting strangers, and can help him feel safe in his surroundings. Buddy attends daycare with other big dogs but may prefer living in a home as the only pet. Buddy is not cat friendly and would do best in an adult only home. He would not do well in a busy or active home, as he would rather keep his social circle small. \n\nBuddy is a big boy, nearly 75 lbs and is between 3-4 years old. Our vision for the perfect home for Bud is a single person who wants a companion, is interested in dog training and can appreciate an intelligent dog, can send him to day care on occasion, likes to walk or hike, and has a fence. Adopters will have to commit to working with our tainer for a few weeks to make sure they understand how to help Buddy continue with his new skills.",

Jillian at Training to the Rescue is now helping Blue to find his truly forever and a wonderful new home. Beautiful and best boy Blue weighs 75lbs and is just the biggest love bug!  Super calm and playful, silly Blue loves to cuddle. Great with people, dogs and kids- he loves everyone and everything! Outgoing and energetic Blue is wonderful with any size dog. He loves to play and run on the treadmill at his day care and trainers, Fetch and Sketch in Peachtree Corners. Blue has been through training at Fetch & Sketch Dog Training and he is a great student!  Smart and a true \u201cpleaser\u201d, Blue knows all basic commands and he walks very nicely on leash. Blue is crate trained and house trained and will settle into his new surroundings easily. Blue loves to be outdoors and he would make an excellent exercise partner too. Blue is vaccinated, micro-chipped and neutered.  His adoption fee is $350. Please fill out the application before setting up a meet and greet: https://www.emailmeform.com/builder/form/fV5jyhrZ88bJM08p4 and if you have any questions about this possibly the most perfect pittie, Blue, email Jillian at trainingtotherescue@gmail.com\n",

We have been selfishly hoarding all of her kisses for ourselves, but she is ready to find her forever! One that sticks and will be patient with a young, playful and energetic dog. Floppy needs to be an only pet, as she was returned for having problems in her previous home with the other dog.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please go to our website at www.partnersforpetsil.org and fill out an online application.\n\nAdoptions are held at the O'Fallon, IL PetSmart every Saturday of the month from 11am-3:30pm and at the Glen Carbon, IL PetSmart every Sunday from 11am-3:30pm. We are also at Petco in Edwardsville Crossing on Sundays from 11:30-3:30 pm. The cats are only at Glen Carbon Petsmart. Please let us know if you are interested in a pet and we can arrange to have them meet you at one of the adoption events.",

She doesn\u2019t realize she is a big dog, she wants to snuggle and cuddle in your lap like her tiny foster sister (you see them all cuddled up together, like they are playing twister!) She is house and crate trained, but has excellent house manners so doesn't need a crate. She has a calm energy when indoors, but very playful outdoors.",

She is definitely a bit stronger willed than her brother Billy Ray. Her beauty and personality automatically make you smile!  She holds her own with other dogs and refuses to be intimidated!  She would make a wonderful family dog but would definitely need some patience and firm hand at first.  However, anything that cute is worth it.  She is approximately 8-9 months old and weighs around 30 lbs. She will require basic obedience, leash, crate and house training. \n\nAdoption fees details:\u00a0\nPuppies - Adults $ 550, Seniors $375. These adoption rates include transport from Alexandria, Louisiana to designated New England adopter pick up locations and NE foster homes using either Rescue Road Trips, Pets LLC or CAFA Transport.

Available for a Meeting confirms the dog is in a NE Foster home and available for a meeting in the city state provided. \u00a0Most times our dogs get adopted before a foster home becomes available - and if so, they go straight to adopters home. Foster parents talk to adopters and feel confident that this will be a match before our dogs are transported up. Also if by some chance it is not a match we have a safety net in place as we ask that adopters to let us know that it is not a match and we direct you to take the dog to a foster home or boarding kennel once that is arranged. If necessary, we will ask you to foster the dog until a foster home can be arranged.\u00a0\nTransport details:Rescue Road Trips (rescueroadtrips.com), Pets LLC (petsllc.net) or CAFA Transport will deliver our precious pups on commercial rescue animal transport to designated locations. \u00a0The fee is 185.00 which IS INCLUDED in your adoption fee already.**Rescue Road Trips, was featured on The Today Show - view it at http://www.today.com/video/today/55034556#55034556\n\nMA and NH RESIDENTS:\nIf you are a Massachusetts or New Hampshire residence, an additional fee of $125.00 will apply due to State quarantine fee requirements. If the dog is in a foster home in MA or NH, this fee will be added in the adoption fee regardless of where the adopters home is located making the total adoption fee $675.00 for puppies and adults $500.00 for Seniors, otherwise the full adoption fee for all other states is $550.00 for puppies and adults and $375.00 for seniors.

He then moved to our partner boarding house in early 2020 and is now with a foster family in Vancouver, BC.\n\nHe is a jindo/corgi mix with a very sweet and calm temperament with a quiet personality. Although he can be shy with humans, he enjoys being in their company, is always gentle and accepts pets and belly rubs. He enjoys stuffy toys and well as chewing on his dental sticks. Currently, he lives with 2 other small dogs who he gets along with well. He is potty trained (his foster says he\u2019s never had an accident!) and has never shown any destructive behaviors in the home.\n\nIt is important to note Dong Dong is still getting used to being outdoors, especially if triggered by something that might scare him like a loud truck. It will be important for his adopter to be diligent with his safety. Overall, he walks well on leash and likes to greet every dog he sees on the street.\n\nThis handsome boy's ideal home is:\n\n- A calm and low activity home with adults only, or older teenagers\n-\u00a0Active humans who enjoy walks, runs, hikes, etc.\n- A quiet neighborhood (as the sounds of trucks and traffic still scare him)\n- A home with a secure yard to run around\n- A home with another friendly dog is highly preferred (another confident dog he could mirror would also help him overcome his fears)\n\nVaccination Details>>\nDHPPL, Canine Influenza, Kennel Cough, Rabies, Corona, Heartworm test, Giardia test, Flea & tick & heartworm prevention are all done.\n\nTo learn more about the dog, or to submit your application, please follow the link.\nhttps://www.freekoreandogs.org/adopt/dong-dong/",

            "description": "Everyone meet Junie B! Junie B is a female treeing walker coonhound around 3 years old. Like a dog who wants to go for rides? Junie is the girl for you! When she sees the car, she wants to go on an adventure! Do you have kids? Well, Junie doesn't live with any but we think she would do well with school aged kids. She may be too bouncy for little ones. Junie cannot live with cat or other small critters because she does have a high prey-drive. Junie does well with other dogs and loves to play with the active 1 year old mix breed dog in her foster home. They can play chase in the yard for hours! Junie is an active girl and needs to be stimulated. A worn out hound is a well-behaved hound! This is really important for Junie in particular. If she gets bored, she will dig holes in the yard and chew things you really don't want her to chew. \n\nSo what would be Junie's ideal home?\n-Fenced in yard to romp and play\n-An active dog companion or an active family or even better....BOTH!\n-A cat free home\n-A family who wants to train and do obedience. Junie is smart and would love and benefit from this! \n\nWant to know more? Contact the good folks at HoundSong to learn more about sweet Junie B! \n\nHoundSong Rescue dogs are vaccinated, spayed/neutered, and microchipped. If you have questions about this dog, the adoption process, or are interested in meeting a dog, please visit www.houndsong.com and complete the adoption application. No meet and greets will be scheduled without the completion and approval of an adoption application.",

DeZeer is going to need someone who isn't afraid to be the alpha in his life, he is currently in a foster home recieving training. He is doing great learning to sit, stay, down, and the foster is able to take anything from him without any issues. Due to his size a home with older children would be best as he does not realize his size what so ever and will run little ones over. He has been showing signs of aggression towards other dogs and likes to chase the cats in his foster home. \n\n*This dog will be required to be registered for a training class and continue training upon adoption*\n\n\nTo meet this dog in person please submit an application, which can be found on our website chippewahumane.com.

            "description": "**If you're viewing this on Petfinder, please visit www.lovepawspg.org to complete our non-binding application.**\n\nMeet Maggie, a beautiful and sweet 3-year-old beagle mix who weighs about 35 lbs. Maggie came to our rescue with her newborn babies and was the sweetest mommy ever. Since then, her babies have all been adopted and now it is Maggie's turn to find her forever home! She is extremely sweet with her foster family. Maggie is best suited as an only dog where she can get all the love and affection of her humans all to herself. Maggie enjoys people and would be happiest in a home where someone is at home a good portion of the day. Maggie has completed her heartworm treatment and is feeling great! Maggie is not in a foster home with kids, so if there are kids in her forever home they should be 10 years and up. Maggie requires a large fenced-in yard and is not suited to apartment/condo living. Maggie is housetrained, microchipped, up-to-date on vaccines and preventatives and eager to find a family to love!\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $350 which includes routine vetting and spay/neuter.\n\n***Please note that our first step is submitting an application (it does not commit you in any way but allows us to discuss with you if you and the dog are a good fit). In addition, an important step in approving adoption applicants is to complete a vet check. Vetting of current and past pets is very important to us, thus we will be speaking with the vet(s) listed on your application to ensure that your current and previous pet(s) are kept up to date on vaccines (including rabies), spayed or neutered, maintained on appropriate monthly preventatives and examined annually by your vet.***\n\nTo complete an online application, please click here and email Kim at KLarimerLovepaws@gmail.com.",

She is a girl that's come a long way since being pulled from the shelter and in a foster home where she is learning to be responsive and learning manners.\n\nHer foster family has her in North Carolina and is very experienced, so Kali is learning lots about being a \"loved\" vs neglected dog!   Her foster mom said, \"I think Kali just needs work. I have some of basic commands installed in her. She\u2019s a smart dog. She has lots of energy. These pics are of her walking at heel and place. You can see that she is doing good.\"\n\nKali is dog selective, so it is for that reason that we suggest she goes to a home with no other dogs.  Because of her good energy level we are also requiring that she be at a home that can provide her with sufficient exercise and a fenced yard. \n\nKali is thought to be around 1.5 years old and weighs 52 lbs.  She was fully vetted and is spayed as well as microchipped.  Her ideal match is a family who would have a fenced in yard and is committed to continued training and sufficient exercise.  She would not do well in an apartment or condo setting.  \n\nIf you can provide Kali with the homes of her dreams, please go to our website at http://diamonddogsrescueinc.com and fill out our online application.",

            "description": "Neptune is a medium energy dog who enjoys getting outside for a couple of walks each day. He loves a brisk walking pace! We go outside around 7 or 7:30 am and then again after breakfast around 8:30 or 9 am with a longer walk at that time. We have been going outside every couple of hours with two of those times being for longer walks. He typically eats dinner around 6 or 6:30 pm - we will go outside after dinner and again before bed around 9:30 pm.  He sleeps in his crate at night but would be fine sleeping on his pillow as well.  He is perfectly happy to spend time during the day lounging on his pillow and chewing on either his favorite stuffed rabbit or other chew toy.  He would love a home with plenty of space to run around outside to learn how to play fetch.  He gets anxious about strange noises and other dogs barking which is why it would be best for him to be in a house rather than an apartment building. \n\nGuests in your home will need a slow introduction to Neptune. Outside of the home / on walks he does not bark at other people. He will likely react if they have a dog with them.  Neptune would do best in a home without children, so movements are more predictable. \n\nNeptune enjoys walks and in addition to his bathroom trips outside typically does 2 or 3 ten-minute walks each day. His natural pace is brisk which makes it seem like he is pulling, but he will walk well and slow down a bit once he feels comfortable with his surroundings. He is good at entertaining himself indoors with toys (particularly non-rawhide type chews or stuffed toys) or naps on his pillow.\n\nOutside of the home Neptune does react to other dogs while taking walks including barking at them but will respond to a firm sit command which reminds him that you are in control of the situation. As long as we keep walking, he will forget about the other dog. We are working on this anxiety about other dogs, but this is something that will take more practice.  He currently uses a prong collar on walks. Neptune would do best without any cats in his forever home.\n\nNeptune attended a two week board and train program with Enlightened K9 Training in New Berlin, WI.  The trainer helped Neptune to build a solid foundation of obedience.  \n\nNeptune tends to get anxious about being left alone, but we are working on this by practicing him being alone for short amounts of time. He is in his crate when I am out of my apartment, but he would likely be fine to be outside of the crate once he is comfortable in his new home. He does not chew on non-toys or jump on furniture. I currently work from home so he is not often left alone for very long- this is something he would need to practice. \n\nThe vet noted some tartar accumulation so an adopter should expect a dental in the next 1-2 years.  \n\nNeptune is a curious and sweet dog who would do best in a house environment with space to run around outside. An owner with previous dog experience would be a good fit and it should be expected that the owner will need to help Neptune when he is anxious and provide a sense of security and structure. Neptune is a happy dog, a quick learner, and eager to find his future home!",

            "description": "Izzy (female chihuahua) and Tee (male pug) are a senior bonded pair looking for their forever home.  These sweet pups ended up in foster care when their owner had to surrender them.  They have a been a joy to foster! \n\nTee (who we call T-Bone) is an attention hog and is very vocal about getting his pets, often whining when he wants attention (which the pug breed is known for).  He\u2019s also skilled at using his rear end to push Izzy and other dogs out of the way so he can get all the attention from the humans!  Meanwhile, Izzy is more laid back and can usually be found snoozing in a dog bed or on a blanket (though she also loves to get pets too).    Both of these pups can\u2019t get enough snuggles and would prefer to be around their human as much as possible.  During the day, they are content to sleep behind me in their dog beds as I work from home, taking occasional potty breaks outside.  In the evenings, they love to be on my lap or right next to me on the couch.  They are expert cuddlers and love to give kisses! \n\nDespite being a little older, these pups still have some spunk! They both like to play with stuffies and Tee likes to play tug, both with humans and other dogs.  While they\u2019ve been in our home, they\u2019ve been exposed to lots of other dogs, most of them larger and younger than these two, since we do in-home doggy daycare.  They do well with other pups, but will sometimes bark to put other dogs in their places if they are being too hyper (but Izzy and Tee are all bark, no bite).  Izzy and Tee would do fine living with other dogs, but they would probably prefer calmer dogs or to be the only dogs in the house.\n\nHealth-wise, Tee doesn\u2019t have any known health issues and has enjoyed taking a few longer walks (~2 miles) with other dogs in the house.  Izzy has floating patellas (kneecaps), a very common issue for her breed and small breeds generally.  This just means she walks a little more slowly and she looks a bit stiff when she walks.  However, she does well getting around, enjoys wandering around our fenced in yard (or did, before it snowed) and can get up and down our flight of stairs several times a day without issue.  That being said, she\u2019s probably not up for very long walks.  Izzy is also totally deaf, not even vacuuming right near her wakes her up from a nap, but she says her hearing loss is a blessing because Tee snores quite loudly when he\u2019s sleeping! Despite being deaf, Izzy manages just fine and often takes cues from Tee.  Both Izzy and Tee are pretty low energy and have minimal exercise requirements, preferring to spend most of the day snoozing, but both enjoy taking short walks outside (Tee is doing better adjusting to the cold weather; Izzy is a typical heat-loving chihuahua and prefers the hot summer sun). \n\nWe crate Izzy and Tee at night (with both sleeping in the same crate) and occasionally during the day.  At night, they settle in and sleep through the night.  During the day, they will bark or whine if we are active in the house and they are crated (but this is true of most dogs).  They have never shown any destructive tendencies, so they likely wouldn\u2019t need to be crated if that is what their adopter preferred.  Both are potty trained, but need to be let out every few hours to avoid accidents.  Izzy has had a few tiny \u201cpiddles\u201d in the house while in our care, but this may be due to being spayed at an older age.  \n\nIzzy and Tee live with their foster parents and our toddler. While they tolerate the toddler very well (she loves giving them hugs and she\u2019s fascinated by Tee\u2019s curly tail), given their age and size, they would probably do best in a home with older kids or no kids.  They have both been friendly to the few strangers they have met while in our care.  \n\nSenior dogs have so much love to give, and these two are guaranteed to bring you a smile and make you laugh every day!  Their adoption fee is $300 for the pair.",

He has not displayed signs of separation anxiety while in foster care. He rides nicely in the car and when left alone, he tends to lay down and sleep.\n \nHolden has been an only dog while in foster care, so we do not have info on him living with another dog. When walking he will want to meet the other dogs, but it\u2019s easy to just get him to keep walking. When meeting people, he\u2019s happy to meet them. In foster care he has had no issues with adults, but has not been exposed to children. Like any large breed, he could accidently knock down a child. Holden has not lived with cats, but does bark at the feral cats when walk by outside. Holden requires an adult only home with power breed or Doberman experience. Since Holden has been fostered as an only pet with no children in the home we do not have info on him living with other dogs, cats, or children.

            "description": "Roscoe is a shepherd mix who was born in November 2019.  He's a happy, energetic boy who seems to have never met a stranger, and is always up for adventure and a good joke.  You might think that Roscoe spends hours in front of the mirror each morning fixing his ears but nope - he's just naturally that adorable!\n\nRoscoe needs a home with a fenced yard for his safety and to make sure he gets lots of exercise, and an active person or family who will also let him join in on walks and hikes.  This boy is no couch potato!  Roscoe is still learning his manners and would do best with an adopter who has the time and patience to work with him.  \n\nPlease note: Due to COVID-19, our visitation policy has changed. LIFE House is currently open by appointment only to individuals with approved applications. Please download the adoption from our website (www.lifehouse4animals.org, under the 'Adopt' section) and email it directly to the adoption counselor at amyc0405@yahoo.com. If your application is approved, the adoption counselor will facilitate an appointment for you to meet this animal.\n\nWe are located at 14 Fido Ct., Frankfort KY 40601.\n\nIf you have questions about this animal, please contact the adoption counselor directly at amyc0405@yahoo.com. We are staffed by volunteers and are typically unable to complete the adoption process on the same day that applications are submitted. Please understand that it can sometimes take 2-4 days to process an application.",

            "description": "PUPDATE 3\n\nTucker had a great Christmas! He loved curling up by the fireplace and snuggles with the whole family for movie time. Really enjoyed the treats and his gifts.\n\nPUPDATE 2\n\nTucker is the kind of guy who needs frequent potty breaks and moist food. It could be a lot worse for an old guy with kidney issues. Who can\u2019t love an old guy that hangs out with you while you work from home?! He joins you for a midnight snack in the kitchen on nights the baby refuses to sleep. He puts up with preteen shenanigans outside playing and still loves to cuddle up with her at night. He just loves everyone is and always down to hang out.\n\nHe\u2019s a perfect starter for a family that needs someone to love. He\u2019s super tolerant of everybody and everything. I think he\u2019s just gotten to an acceptance age and just enjoys whatever time he can get with his peoples.\n\nAs someone with kidney issues myself\u2014you can accomplish a lot over many years with the right diet and either none or minimal medication. It\u2019s not an end all be all. He can still have a great life for a few more years. They say Chihuahuas can live up to 20yrs!\n\nPUPDATE 1\n\nJust like some old men you never know if he likes you or not. He\u2019s not really a tail wagging playful guy. But every so often he\u2019ll come up to you, wait for you to pet him, then lean into your head rubs. Figured this is his way of showing affection.\n \n Tucker is definitely a great guy to Netflix and chill with! Which is how he spends his days when he\u2019s not chilling next to one of us taking a nap while we work/kids attend virtual school.\n\nInside the home he loves everyone that cuddles him. Outside he\u2019s been to the groomer and interacted with several people from check-in until pick up he did well even with nail clippings. He seemed to be especially happy afterwards and spent the afternoon exploring the main rooms of the house with his tongue out.\n\nWe have 5 children ranging from just turned 1 year old to almost 14 years old. He loves anyone that will hold/cuddle him. Tucker just gets up and leaves when he\u2019s had enough of the baby. \n\nTucker is a super low energy pup. He doesn\u2019t care if he\u2019s on or off a leash. He just wants to do his business and go inside. He will go outside to the bathroom on and off the leash. We use an electric fence but still stay outside with him since he struggles to get up and down stairs. He does the cutest little cat like thing and covers up all his potties. He\u2019s a little off on covering it\u2014probably because he\u2019s got some cataract going in both eyes???? I wonder sometimes if he was litter box trained another lifetime ago. He\u2019s not really a go for long walks kind of guy either\u2014but that might be weather related with the cold. He only makes it a short distance on walks with a leash before he\u2019s tired and just stops waiting to be held. Tucker is well behaved on a leash without pulling. He just occasional side tracks to sniff.\n\nHe tends to ignore our resident dogs for the most part. Tucker just exists near them. He does understand what treats are and when they are getting some and will stand patiently near them for his turn.\n \n Tucker also prefers to take his food at his leisure all day long in the kennel. We are a multi dog family with the other dogs being much larger than him. He doesn\u2019t bother their food\u2014just likes his separate. Then Tucker actually eats his food. Tucker does not have cats in his foster home.\n\nHe is fine during the day\u2014gets vocal and starts roaming the house if he\u2019s without a bedtime cuddle buddy. Tucker likes to be near his people and might have some separation anxiety. \n\nHe won\u2019t sleep quietly in the kennel outside, but can make it overnight in bed with his human.\n \n That being sad\u2014the kennel is the most comfortable way to travel by car. He gets a little anxious outside of the kennel on someone\u2019s lap and can\u2019t be still in a car.\n\nTucker has kidney disease but this doesn\u2019t stop him from being a wonderful senior dog!  The vet recommends a prescription kidney diet food to help his condition. Tucker\u2019s adopter will need to continue rechecks to keep an eye on it.   \n\n",

She will make a wonderful companion for someone who is home most of the time and would like an adorable sidekick to spend their days with!\n\nShe goes out and wonders around our yard in the morning and then back out after breakfast to ensure she has plenty of opportunities to relieve herself out there. She is making significant progress towards our house-training goals but will need continued work with this. Throughout the day, she wants to be near her human and will cuddle up anywhere that person is.\n\nSchatzi has not been around children, but is easily frightened so would likely do best with older children.  She has not met a cat. \n\nShe is a senior lady but has lots of spunk! She loves to follow her person around out in the yard when the weather is nice and uses a step to get up on to the couch. She has low exercise requirements but walks just fine on a leash and should go for a couple of short walks per day.\n\nSchatzi currently has three foster siblings and is wonderful with all of them. She doesn't want to play but would be fine with other dogs that are respectful of her space. She does not guard her food or treats.\n\nShe has separation anxiety and will usually have an accident if left loose in the house, although she is getting better with this. She has been crated when we leave and does fine in the kennel, although is sometimes vocal. She does not chew or destroy anything when left loose and unattended.\n\nSchatzi is a really good girl who makes us laugh every day. She is smart and learns very quickly, we are so proud of how far she has come in the short time she has been with us. She is a little love bug and will make a wonderful companion for someone who has the time to spend taking strolls and snuggling with her!",

I am learning everything that a puppy needs to learn. I am learning to follow commands, go potty outside, be in my crate and realize that it\u2019s a safe place to be, and just learning how to be loved. It\u2019s something I wasn\u2019t shown a lot of before. One of the things that I am working on is my separation anxiety. I get scared when I can\u2019t see my people, so I am working on understanding that it doesn\u2019t mean that I am left alone and no one is ever coming back, it just means that I am alone for a tiny bit. I love my toys and just playing around and being a puppy. I\u2019m still settling in, but please check back for more information or if you are sure that I am your guy for life, fill out my application and let\u2019s be life long friends!! Your best fur friend ever, Harry (UPDATED 01/01/21)",

            "description": "AT PEPPERMINT PIG ANIMAL RESCUE, WE UPDATE ALL OF OUR PETS ON A REGULAR BASIS TO REFLECT THEIR AVAILABILITY.\n\nIF YOU SEE ME HERE, I AM AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION. PLEASE READ MY BIO BELOW TO LEARN MORE ABOUT ME AND HOW TO APPLY TO ADOPT :)\n\nMeet the B pups:: 3 to 5 pounds, 8 weeks old 1/2/21, Chihuahua/Pug/Terrier mixes (best guess, but we think they are mostly Chihuahua)\n\nAvailable for Adoption!\n\nBon Bon is the smallest (along with Biscotti, they are the same size). She is perfectly content to just cuddle and be held. But make no mistake, when snuggle time is over, she can achieve some speed and hops just like her siblings. She fits her name, a small lil piece of sugary sweetness.\n\nThe B pups and their dad were surrendered to us on the condition that they allowed us to spay their mother. Unfortunately, we do not have a photo of their mother, but we were told she is a 10 pound Chihuahua mix. Their father, Brent (pictured) is 16 pounds and appears to be a Chihuahua/Pug mix. \n\nThe B puppies are a playful and outgoing bunch and they are ready to find their forever homes!\n\n$195 Adoption Fee. \n\nA $10.00 non-refundable application fee is required to submit your adoption application and will be deducted from your adoption fee if you adopt.\n\nAll puppies are dewormed, started on heartworm and flea prevention, and microchipped.\n\nAll puppies will be adopted with current, age appropriate vaccines, given by Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue. Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue will provide their puppy series DAPP vaccines, given at 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age.\n\nPuppy adopters will be will be required to bring the puppy back to Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue to receive any remaining puppy vaccines after adoption. \n\nPuppy adopters will also be required to bring the puppy to our vet for their spay/neuter surgery after they receive their 16 week vaccination. \n\nThe spay/neuter and puppy vaccines are included with the puppy adoption fee.\n\nWe have a strict one hour puppy adoption radius, puppy adopters must be within one hour of Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue. Please see our Adoption Radius tab on our website for more info, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/adoption-radius/\n\nAlong with other criteria evaluated in the adoption application, a Fenced Yard is required to adopt. \n\nPlease see our Fenced Yard Requirements tab on our website for more information, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/fenced-yard-requirements/\n\nTO CHECK AVAILABILITY of any of our adoptable animals, please go to our available pets tab, here: https://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/available-pets-for-adoption/\n\nAll pets listed here are updated regularly to reflect their availability.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR PEPPERMINT PIG ANIMAL RESCUE:\n\nBefore completing the application, please read our ADOPTION PROCESS tab on our website, here: \nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/how-our-adoptions-work/\n\nTo complete our easy online adoption application, please visit our website at PeppermintPigAnimalRescue.org.\n\nAdoption events are held every Saturday in our thrift store from 1:00pm to 4:00pm. Please complete your adoption application in advance so our volunteers have time to screen and contact potential adopters.\n\nIMPORTANT: All applications are reviewed in the order they are received and qualifications are based on best fit for each individual pet.

He came to us as an owner surrender, a backyard dog who has received no medical care and very little/no love or attention. Now that he knows what love feel like, he's not letting go of that!\n\nHe is a super friendly, cheerful and mellow guy. His favorite activity is to sleep, though he has gained much more energy while in his foster home.\n\nWe think that he is around 13 years old and he's 16 lbs.\n\nPrince seems to be good with other dogs. He will do best in a home with no small kids, as he isn't always a fan of smoochy-face! The ideal home for him will be one where he's not alone a whole lot. Or, if he will be, he needs some time to adjust to that. He is a pretty perfect working companion and will hold down your lap while you work!\n\nThis little charmer is a champion snuggler and he looks forward to LOTS of cuddle time with his family!",

PLEASE READ MY BIO BELOW TO LEARN MORE ABOUT ME AND HOW TO APPLY TO ADOPT :)\n\nMeet the B pups:: 3 to 5 pounds, 8 weeks old 1/2/21, Chihuahua/Pug/Terrier mixes (best guess, but we think they are mostly Chihuahua)\n\nAvailable for Adoption!\n\nBlizzard is a favorite of their foster's and an adventurous and happy guy who can HOP. He is always looking to explore, and is a wiggle piggle, but as soon as you catch him mid air and snuggle him to your neck, he presses right against you and wants to stay right there. He has a flurry of white on his chest.\n\nThe B pups and their dad were surrendered to us on the condition that they allowed us to spay their mother. Unfortunately, we do not have a photo of their mother, but we were told she is a 10 pound Chihuahua mix. Their father, Brent (pictured) is 16 pounds and appears to be a Chihuahua/Pug mix. \n\nThe B puppies are a playful and outgoing bunch and they are ready to find their forever homes!\n\n$195 Adoption Fee. \n\nA $10.00 non-refundable application fee is required to submit your adoption application and will be deducted from your adoption fee if you adopt.\n\nAll puppies are dewormed, started on heartworm and flea prevention, and microchipped.\n\nAll puppies will be adopted with current, age appropriate vaccines, given by Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue. Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue will provide their puppy series DAPP vaccines, given at 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age.\n\nPuppy adopters will be will be required to bring the puppy back to Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue to receive any remaining puppy vaccines after adoption. \n\nPuppy adopters will also be required to bring the puppy to our vet for their spay/neuter surgery after they receive their 16 week vaccination. \n\nThe spay/neuter and puppy vaccines are included with the puppy adoption fee.\n\nWe have a strict one hour puppy adoption radius, puppy adopters must be within one hour of Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue. Please see our Adoption Radius tab on our website for more info, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/adoption-radius/\n\nAlong with other criteria evaluated in the adoption application, a Fenced Yard is required to adopt. \n\nPlease see our Fenced Yard Requirements tab on our website for more information, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/fenced-yard-requirements/\n\nTO CHECK AVAILABILITY of any of our adoptable animals, please go to our available pets tab, here: https://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/available-pets-for-adoption/\n\nAll pets listed here are updated regularly to reflect their availability.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR PEPPERMINT PIG ANIMAL RESCUE:\n\nBefore completing the application, please read our ADOPTION PROCESS tab on our website, here: \nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/how-our-adoptions-work/\n\nTo complete our easy online adoption application, please visit our website at PeppermintPigAnimalRescue.org.\n\nAdoption events are held every Saturday in our thrift store from 1:00pm to 4:00pm. Please complete your adoption application in advance so our volunteers have time to screen and contact potential adopters.\n\nIMPORTANT: All applications are reviewed in the order they are received and qualifications are based on best fit for each individual pet.

            "description": "Hello, my name is Cyrus! I've been at the shelter for a little bit while the staff worked on my behavior. I'm ready to be adopted but I'm not a dog for a first time dog owner. I'm not very trusting of new people and I need people who understand how to manage my nervousness. When I hang out with people I tend to feed off of their energy. I need a confident and relaxed handler. I've been to playgroup with other dogs and did well. My play signals are a little mixed up and not every dog I meet may know how to interact with me. Please keep checking my profile for updates as the staff gets to know me better! If this dog has been successful in our play groups it is not a guarantee that a dog will be social with other dogs in their home or in public settings. Dogs are individuals and have personality conflicts, just like us. Play groups do not guarantee that territorial or resource guarding issues will not surface in the home. While play groups do help us get to know the dog's better, once they are adopted their new environments and new relationships will influence their behavior in ways we cannot predict. The Adoption Fee Includes: - initial canine distemper combination vaccination - first worming or stool check - rabies vaccination (for animals over 3 months of age) - AVID microchipping - flea treatment/preventative - spaying or neutering Adoption fee: $135.00 Per state law, ALL ADOPTERS must purchase a non-refundable 2021 dog license at time of adoption for any canine three months and older. The cost of the license is $7.00. (Senior Citizen or Person with Disability-$5.00) Leash and collar included",

ADOPTED! ADOPTED! ADOPTED! ADOPTED! ADOPTED! ADOPTED! ALL OF MY PICTURES ARE AVAILABLE BELOW! MY ORIGINAL INTAKE INFORMATION: Hi Everyone! My name is Bella, and I just arrived at the CSAC from the kind people at Spanky's Project. I was rescued from a puppy mill. I am shy because I have not been around a lot of people or lived in a home as a pet. My perfect home will be one with dog experience that can help with my training and acclimating to the outside world. Right now, I am in the caring hands of one of the great Vets that work with the CSAC. They are checking me out and making sure I am healthy. Hopefully, I will find my new family that will help me to understand that I am a cherished family pet, not just an animal to be used to make money. For more information about this dog, email our Adoption Coordinator. Our adoption process starts with an application. If you are interested in adopting this pup, please click the Adopt menu at the top of the screen, read about our process, and click the application link. The medical and custodial care of the many Cockers in our care is tremendous. More and more dogs are abandoned with urgent and serious medical issues. We are committed to providing the best possible care for these forgotten friends. Unfortunately, the mounting high costs are beginning to limit the number of dogs we are able to take into our program. Even if you cannot adopt or foster one of our current adoptable dogs, please consider making a donation. The Cocker Spaniel Adoption Center is a 501(c)(3) non-profit charitable organization, and your donations are entirely tax deductible. Click the Donate menu at the top of the screen.

He should remain about this size as he is around adult age.\nNotice his beautiful two colored eyes? We are not sure what he is mixed with as he was at a kill shelter as a stray.\nCody is now in a foster home getting used to the North Dakota weather. It has been an adjustment with the the cold weather. The foster family has other her size dogs and and cats in the home and he does well when properly introduced. There aren't any children in the foster home so we are unsure how he is around kids. They are working on crate and house training and getting use to cold Temps.\nThe family who adopts him will need to continue the routine of the foster home for him to succeed with house training, socializing etc.\nAll medical medical work is completed prior to adoption including neutering shots worming flea treatment rabies shot micro chip heartworm test negative and vet exam.\nThe adoption application is available on the website www.prairiepawsrescue.com and go to the adopt link to download the jotform application fill it out and submit.\nPrairie Paws Rescue does not adopt on a first come basis but who will provide the best home suited to the pets needs.",

Time and consistent training will help your new buddy adjust to their new home. This poor guy has had ulcers on his eyes-this limits his vision, but he can see. Taz has been vet checked as well and his adoption fee is $350, apply today! \n\nIf you are interested in adopting from Boston Terrier and Short Nose Rescue of Oklahoma, please complete the Adoption Application here https://form.jotform.com/70368678829172 Please note that it can take several days to process an application as we are run entirely by volunteers, If you have completed an application, but have not heard from us within 3-5 days, please feel free to contact us. \n\nPlease note that we are foster-based and as such, we do not have a facility to visit the dogs. \n\nAll Boston Terrier and Short Nose Rescue of Oklahoma dogs are fully vetted at the time of adoption which includes spay/neuter, all vaccines - Rabies, Bordetella, and DHLP - along with heartworm check and the first month of preventative, and a vet check. Adoption fees vary per dog, but generally range from $150 to $450 depending on age and what vetting the dog required. The adoption fee is on a cash basis, is non-refundable, and is due at the time of the adoption. All adoption agreements state that the dog will be returned to the rescue if the adopter can no longer keep the dog for any reason. We highly recommend allowing at least a month for a dog to adjust; oftentimes settling into a new home can take time and lots and lots of patience.\n\nWhile we do adopt to out-of-state adopters, we will typically not adopt outside of an approximate 1200 mile radius from Muskogee, OK with a strong preference for in state and surrounding states. We do not transport our dogs; all dogs must be picked up in Oklahoma. There are many other Boston Terrier rescues throughout the country and if we are unable to adopt to you due to your location, we will do our best to point you in the direction of the rescues nearest to you. Please contact us with any questions.",

While he likes his walks and has occasional bursts of play, he is a low maintenance, middle aged dog who just wants his very own person to love and spoil him.  While a fenced in yard would be preferred for Buster to roam and play in, it is not required.  Buster does need to be the only pet and is reactive around small dogs.  Buster has been a perfect gentleman for us and loves each and every person that comes to visit him but he really deserves his own family.

He probably still has a bit more growing to do.  This gentle giant has no idea of his size and likes nothing more than to cuddle in the closest lap.  He loves running around with his canine foster sister and plays a mean game of fetch. His absolute favorite thing is a good belly rub, and is always ready to drop and roll over.\n\nSam is house trained, knows basic commands, and walks well on a leash. He is crate trained, but much prefers to stretch out on the sofa or snuggle in your bed. Highly food motivated and eager to please, Sam should have no problem learning appropriate house manners. He is friendly and playful with other dogs, and his charming goofiness makes him irresistible to everyone he meets.  Sam has established very strong bonds with his foster family and is happiest when he is with his people. He is calm and respectful in the house but needs exercise and outdoor playtime and would benefit from a home with a large fenced yard and an active canine companion. Given his size he might not be appropriate for a family with small children.  Whoever adopts this beautiful boy will reap the rewards of an amazing, loving pooch.\n\n\nThank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (https://anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible organization. ANCAR is a foster-based rescue, and we adopt within a 90 mile radius of Bedford Hills, NY.  You will find the adoption application here: (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/).  All fields on the application must be completed.\nPlease read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) so you'll know what to expect when you submit.   \n\nOur dogs are in foster care and we do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. This is a firm policy. Our busy volunteers are not able to respond to questions about the dog or dog meeting requests in the absence of an application.  We know these dogs very well because they are in foster care. Please read the profiles of the dog(s) you are interested in prior to submitting an application.  If there are specific requirements stated (ie: Fenced Yard or Canine Friend Required) these are included because they are vital to the happiness, health, safety and adoption success of that dog. \n\nWe are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering and microchipping before transporting our dogs. We provide all supplies, preventatives and any follow up vet care necessary while they are in foster care. These costs are high and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you.  We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources. If you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through the kindness of supporters like you that we are 'changing lives...one tail at a time' by providing our dogs with 'A New Chance.' (https://anewchancear.org) \n\nThanks so much.",

We set up meet and greets with an approved application only.\n\nScooter is a male chihuahua who is about 5 years old.  He is full of energy and wants to play all of the time.  He is a sweet boy but will need a quiet home where he can be the focus on his family's attention.  He does not do well when left alone for long periods of time as he just wants to be with his people and play.  He weighs about 10 lbs .  He is neutered, up to date on his shots including rabies, microchipped and dewormed.  He will be a wonderful addition and will add so much joy and fun to your life.  We do not know if he is housetrained .  He does not do well with children, other dogs or cats so he needs to be an only child.  Thanks so much for your interest!  His adoption fee is $200.",

Now that she's all cleaned up, and spayed, she is ready to find her new home! She has loved everyone she's met since she warmed up to us, and she is a very active girl! She's a bit scared of cats and does her best to avoid them. She's been doing well meeting other dogs. We would want to set up a meet and greet with any current dogs in the family before adoption to make sure they got along. We have not tested her with kids, but we think she would do best with older kids that know how to behave around dogs. \n\nThis girl will fetch for hours! She is very good about dropping whatever toy you've thrown for her, and she brings it right back to you! She's a very active girl that will need someone who has the time to give her the exercise she will need to stay happy and healthy!",

A quiet household without young children would be best for me. I really love to snuggle and be near my foster mom. If she's working I'm content to lay in my bed near her.\n\nI can be an escape artist, so a secure backyard is a must and I shouldn't be left out alone. I'm dog, cat and rabbit friendly! \n\nIf you think I'd be a good fit, you can fill out an application at Emmaswishsdr.org/adoption-application. DFW area only",

I say I just want to explore as much of the world as I can. Because I like to explore, I will need a home with a 6' fence or leash walking or possibly a dog friend to help keep me occupied. I am kennel and potty trained. I tend to bark at new friends, dogs and people, but I warm up quickly if they are willing to play with me. I get along with cats too! I am pretty much perfection. One of my puppies was DNA tested! Turns out I am Lab, Golden Retriever, Staffordshire Terrier, American Bulldog and Great Pyrenees! I am large, at about 55-60 pounds.\n\nInterested? Please visit https\\://dogsbydebin.com/adoption-application/ to complete our quick online adoption application. Darla's adoption fee is $175 which includes: Spay, deworming, microchip, heartworm test, vaccines and an offer of pet healthcare for 30-days!",

            "description": "Meet Dillon~\n\nMy name is Dillon and I am a 4 year old Shepard/Rottie mix from South Carolina.  I weigh roughly 60 lbs.\n\nEven though I didn't have the best life so far, I am a very sweet boy. I am quiet and generally pretty calm. \n\nMy foster family thinks I am a great dog. Unfortunately, sometimes I give a little bit of attitude to new people. Also, with a puppy I met I gave some attitude over toys and food. I have not been seen doing that with anyone else though. \nI have been through a lot in my life so these things might never develop to be an issue but my new family just needs to be sure I am trained properly!\n\n*I am also a heartworm survivor.\n\n With my adorable looks, and unbridled loyalty, I will always be there for you through thick and thin. I will never judge you, or turn my back on you. Every single day, you will look at me and you will know that you are loved unconditionally. I will never betray you or hurt you, and I will grow old by your side.\n\n******IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ ALL THE GREAT INFO BELOW******\n\n***Please don't apply unless you are very serious about adopting, and are ready to move forward with the adoption process. We are super busy and make a great effort to respond back to EVERYONE ASAP! WHEN WE TAKE THE TIME TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION AND RESPOND BACK TO THE APPLICANT JUST TO BE EITHER IGNORED OR BE TOLD THEY CANNOT COME FOR SEVERAL DAYS, MORE TIME IS WASTED~PLEASE HAVE MORE RESPECT THAN THAT!\n\nPLEASE read our website's ADOPTION PROCESS PAGE prior to submitting an adoption application. www.apupspizzazzrescue.com/adoption-process \nADOPTION APPLICATION: www.apupspizzazzrescue.com/adoption-application \n\nABOUT OUR RESCUE DOGS: \n All of our dogs are located in Connecticut, are spayed or neutered, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, have been given deworming medications, and have had CT State health checks, & go home with a leash, collar, & packet of medical paperwork. \n\nBREED IDENTIFICATION:\nPlease understand that many rescue dogs are mixes of multiple breeds. Petfinder allows us to choose up to two breeds per dog. While the shelters and our rescue do our best in accurately identifying breeds, breed identification is not guaranteed. If there is a certain breed that you do not want, it is very important that you share this with our rescue when applying. When adopting a puppy, breed uncertainty plays a big part in the size/look of the dog as an adult. Please know that any puppy can be a wonderful dog, regardless of preconceived notions of certain breeds, but it is very important that the adopter has the dedication and patience to raise the puppy with boundaries, consistency, structure, & love. The more effort you give towards training & time you allow for exercise, your puppy will grow to be a HUGE source of UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, TOTAL LOYALTY, HAPPINESS, COMFORT & COMPANIONSHIP!\n\nABOUT OUR RESCUE:\nWe are a small rescue run by volunteers & focused on finding the right match for both our dogs & for you. If you are interested in adopting through our rescue, you first will need to complete an adoption application & be approved as a potential adopter before meeting any of our pups. No need to be intimidated by our application as it allows us to get to know you & your lifestyle. Of course, the more you can share the better! Please also note, while a fenced yard is fantastic, it is not required by our rescue, however, it may be required for a certain dog occasionally.  Once adoption applicants are approved to become potential adopters, we offer private appointments where you can meet one or several dogs at the discretion of the rescue. We offer a unique & pleasant experience focused on finding the perfect match. It is extremely important to us that everyone is treated with respect & that NO ONE IS LEFT HANGING. WE WILL GET BACK TO YOU WITHIN 2 TO 3 DAYS of application submission. If there is a dog you are eager to meet, please  TEXT US DIRECTLY at 203-241-2351 so that we can check the status of your application and move it forward immediately. We look forward to hearing from you and helping you find your new best friend.\n\n*All adult dogs can be cat tested by request.\n\nHOME/RENTER INSURANCE:\nSOME PROVIDERS HAVE VERY STRICT POLICIES REGARDING WHICH TYPE OF DOG BREEDS ARE ALLOWED UNDER THEIR COVERAGE. STATE FARM WAS SUGGESTED TO US AS THEY DO NOT PUNISH, DROP, NOR REFUSE YOU DUE TO DOG BREED SHOULD YOU RUN INTO ISSUES WITH YOUR CURRENT PROVIDER.",

            "description": "Daisy is a Bassett Hound and Great Pyrenees mix who asks nothing more than to be with her people. She is deeply devoted and affectionate to her family.  She's approximately 6 years old and is approximately 60 pounds. She has beautiful, soulful eyes and long, soft ears. She loves to \"sing\", and gets very excited for walks and car rides. Daisy is dog selective and needs to be an only dog. She would do well with a fenced yard to run in.\n\nDaisy was rescued from a horrible existence on the end of a chain. She was very sick with a 4-inch bladder stone that required surgery, but she recovered quickly and is doing well with a prescribed urinary diet.   Daisy is house trained and crate trained.\n\nDaisy is spayed, microchipped,  heartworm negative and started on a monthly flea and heartworm preventative. \n\nDaisy's adoption fee is $200.00.   Animal Friends Society is a small 501(c)(3) group that uses adoption fees to care for the current and future fosters in our care and to continue our mission of spaying and neutering.\n\nFor more information on Daisy or to fill out an application, please visit animalfriendssociety@hotmail.com.",

I am a great family dog, fully house trained, love Netflix, not a fan of The Bachelor, and I love to share some meditation time with you on the couch. I have a bit of a green thumb as I have been known to dig a hole under the fence thinking that you may want to plant something and then I squeeze out and go for a run. I have been known to run out into traffic if not carefully watched, so please keep an eye on me! One of my very favorite places to go is the beach so that I can run around in the sand. I am a very good boy and I'd love to join you out and about as you do your daily activities, if you'll have me! I am very friendly with everyone that I meet so as far as I'm concerned, the more visitors, the merrier! I am well-trained and know my commands and I'm very good at walking on a leash. It is also smart to keep the door locked in the house and an eye on me around doors as I may take that as an opportunity to go on another run. I am just great with kids, house trained and extremely loving.",

            "description": "Looking to add some good vibrations to your life? Look no further than Barky \u201cBark\u201d Wahlberg! This 6 month old male coonhound mix is more than just devilishly handsome. He has a surprisingly deep, melodious voice that he loves using and has a very soft, plush coat. We think Bark\u2019s going to be a big boy, as he is already 45 lbs and has some really big paws and ears to grow into. Bark is a very playful puppy, but also adores his humans above all else. He would do best as either the only dog where he can have all the attention or in a home with other playful dogs that can tire him out. He\u2019s definitely a ladies man and can be a little shy around men. Bark is a very sensitive dog that loves to cuddle with his foster mom and will require positive reinforcement. All he wants is love.  He is crate trained and house trained. While Bark doesn\u2019t have a third nipple (he probably has more) he does have rear dew claws unlike most dogs, making him extra special. This sweet boy is going to make a great companion and is certainly a dog for the people. Are you ready to make Bark Wahlberg a part of your funky bunch? Bark's adoption fee is $400.00.\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

She is housetrained and crate trained but like any young dog, she needs training, structure and guidance. Cherry is good with other dogs, has befriended a big male in our pack, and was fine with the cat in the original home. She has a cute personality that you can see in her face. She just needs someone willing to invest time in her (On a side note, I have this exact same mix at my house and she turned out to be the most fun and entertaining dog I have ever had-and Ive had A LOT of them).

Linus will need to stay on CD food from now on to keep more stones from forming but other than that, he\u2019s great. He\u2019s probably a bichon mix and he is a senior but we aren\u2019t sure of his exact age.\n\nAll our pets are spayed or neutered, vaccinated including rabies, given de-wormer, heartworm negative or being treated with the slow kill method approved by our veterinarian, on prevention, on flea/tick prevention, most are house trained. The majority but not all of our pets require a fence. Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered. We adopt within 300 miles of New Orleans/Baton Rouge, La and we do not ship or transport--Adoption fee $200. Email us at creolepoodlerescue@yahoo.com to get an adoption application. Complete an adoption form and email it back to us (we do not have a FAX) if interested in adopting and providing a loving home for this pet.  If you can't email it to us, you can mail it to P.O. Box 2333, Gonzales, La 70707, but this will slow the process down.\n\nWhen you request an adoption application, we will also send you our guidelines to read - many questions you may have are answered there.  All of our pets are in private foster homes. We require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meeting for any of our pets. Everything we know at this time about this pet is posted.IF YOU SEE THIS PET POSTED ON OUR ADOPTABLE PETS PAGE, THIS PET IS AVAILABLE. WE UPDATE OUR ADOPTABLE PETS SEVERAL TIMES DAILY.  IF THE WORD PENDING IS NEXT TO THE NAME, THE PET HAS AN APPROVED ADOPTER COMING TO MEET AND PROBABLY ADOPT HIM OR HER.  We reserve the right to refuse adoption for any reason.\n\nWe are all VOLUNTEERS and have full time jobs, families, pets of our own to care for - we do the best that we can to get back to you in a timely manner.  Please realize that turning in an application today will not mean that you adopt a poodle tomorrow.  We believe in taking the time to go through our thorough process to try to match the dog with the family.",

Hope looks to be about 2 years old and we are guessing she is a Pyrenees maybe mixed with Anatolian shepherd. She weighs 80 pounds. Hope will do best in a home with another friendly dog to play with and a big fenced in yard. She is now spayed, up to date with vaccines, microchipped and tested negative for heartworm. Her adoption fee is $350.00. If you are interested in adopting Hope, please visit our website www.LHARinc.org go to Adopt and complete the dog adoption application.",

They are very sweet, and have had shots updated and grooming scheduled for next week (delayed due to holidays).  They will make great lap dogs for some lucky person who wants a little dog for company.\n\nAll our pets are spayed or neutered, vaccinated including rabies, given de-wormer, heartworm negative or being treated with the slow kill method approved by our veterinarian, on prevention, on flea/tick prevention, most are house trained. The majority but not all of our pets require a fence. Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered. We adopt within 300 miles of New Orleans/Baton Rouge, La and we do not ship or transport--Adoption fee $200. Email us at creolepoodlerescue@yahoo.com to get an adoption application. Complete an adoption form and email it back to us (we do not have a FAX) if interested in adopting and providing a loving home for this pet.  If you can't email it to us, you can mail it to P.O. Box 2333, Gonzales, La 70707, but this will slow the process down.\n\nWhen you request an adoption application, we will also send you our guidelines to read - many questions you may have are answered there.  All of our pets are in private foster homes. We require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meeting for any of our pets. Everything we know at this time about this pet is posted.IF YOU SEE THIS PET POSTED ON OUR ADOPTABLE PETS PAGE, THIS PET IS AVAILABLE. WE UPDATE OUR ADOPTABLE PETS SEVERAL TIMES DAILY.  IF THE WORD PENDING IS NEXT TO THE NAME, THE PET HAS AN APPROVED ADOPTER COMING TO MEET AND PROBABLY ADOPT HIM OR HER.  We reserve the right to refuse adoption for any reason.\n\nWe are all VOLUNTEERS and have full time jobs, families, pets of our own to care for - we do the best that we can to get back to you in a timely manner.  Please realize that turning in an application today will not mean that you adopt a poodle tomorrow.  We believe in taking the time to go through our thorough process to try to match the dog with the family.",

            "description": "Meet Aliza\n\nAliza is a 9-10 year old, American Eskimo female who is looking for her new forever home. Aliza is such a love and has spurts of puppy energy. She loves to cuddle up with her foster family and get lots of rubs, but also enjoys her own space as well. Aliza is very well trained with no accidents in the house. Aliza prefers to be the only dog in the house. She would prefer a house with older children as she hasn\u2019t been around the young-ins that much. Aliza unfortunately lost her owner to cancer a few months back and was surrendered to STARS. We promised to find her another loving family, will that be you? \n\nClick on www.starsrescue.org to complete an application to be pre-approved to adopt this pup. As you can imagine, we get a lot of interest in our rescues and kindly ask that you are patient with us while we review applications as it may take a few days.We will contact you regarding your application, during which you can ask more questions about this specific pup. If pre-approved we will coordinate a date for meet and greet.\n\nOur adoption fee is $500. This includes spay/neuter, microchipping, deworming, and all age-appropriate vaccinations.",

She is around 10 pounds and would do best in a home without small children.\n\nAll our pets are spayed or neutered, vaccinated including rabies, given de-wormer, heartworm negative or being treated with the slow kill method approved by our veterinarian, on prevention, on flea/tick prevention, most are house trained. The majority but not all of our pets require a fence. Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered. We adopt within 300 miles of New Orleans/Baton Rouge, La and we do not ship or transport--Adoption fee $200. Email us at creolepoodlerescue@yahoo.com to get an adoption application. Complete an adoption form and email it back to us (we do not have a FAX) if interested in adopting and providing a loving home for this pet.  If you can't email it to us, you can mail it to P.O. Box 2333, Gonzales, La 70707, but this will slow the process down.\n\nWhen you request an adoption application, we will also send you our guidelines to read - many questions you may have are answered there.  All of our pets are in private foster homes. We require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meeting for any of our pets. Everything we know at this time about this pet is posted.IF YOU SEE THIS PET POSTED ON OUR ADOPTABLE PETS PAGE, THIS PET IS AVAILABLE. WE UPDATE OUR ADOPTABLE PETS SEVERAL TIMES DAILY.  IF THE WORD PENDING IS NEXT TO THE NAME, THE PET HAS AN APPROVED ADOPTER COMING TO MEET AND PROBABLY ADOPT HIM OR HER.  We reserve the right to refuse adoption for any reason.\n\nWe are all VOLUNTEERS and have full time jobs, families, pets of our own to care for - we do the best that we can to get back to you in a timely manner.  Please realize that turning in an application today will not mean that you adopt a poodle tomorrow.  We believe in taking the time to go through our thorough process to try to match the dog with the family.",

He's a gentle giant and is as sweet as they come.\n\nHe's about 6 years old and was found as a stray.  He has some bald spots and pressure points but we know with some TLC he will shine.  He's absolutely beautiful despite this, and is a real head turner.  He is a beefy boy but has really good manners on leash and respects your space.  He loves to come in close for a cuddle and is a really \"warm\" dog.  He has shown signs of being housetrained.\n \nDuring his assessments he showed us he really didn't want to have much to do with the other dogs, so we are betting he'd be happiest as king of the castle or with a dog that is going to match his mellow personality and a family that will make sure it is a happy match.  He also really loves food and rawhides, so a home that is going to help him adjust to the good life is his best fit.   \n\nHe is sponsored by Danahy Real Estate with a reduced adoption fee and funds towards training classes to take with his new family.\n\n\n\nBecause of the COVID19 situation, the shelter is closed to the general public. If you would like to meet any of the adoptable dogs, please fill out an application online (if you are not already pre-approved) , call the shelter, and leave a message with your name and phone number and the dog you're interested in. Have patience, and they will call you back when they can. From there, a time will be scheduled for you to come and meet the dog. Please be patient, and remember they are very short staffed at the moment.\n\nApplications can be found at https://friendsofcbas.org/adopt",

Honey really likes playing tug of war with her rope toys, and has removed the squeaker from all her toys but still seems to enjoy their soft shell! One great thing about Honey that you don't see often with other dogs is when I step out to run to the post office or pick up food, she doesn't seem to have any interest in eating my shoes or books, which are all in very accessible areas. I've only been gone for maybe 15 minutes at the most so far, but every time i've come back she is usually just relaxing on or next to the couch when l come in! She does seem to be a little sensitive to the noise of the neighbors, so I just make sure I have music playing for her and I haven't received any complaints of barking.",

When Cardis owner passed, she and a black cat named Jack were brought to us.Upon arrival, it was apparent that Cardi needed some TLC. She had little fur on her back due to a bad case of fleas that led to a skin infection. We found out pretty quickly that this girl does not care for baths, or any kind of experience that involves water. Cardi wasnt happy about her regular trips to the bathtub, but it had to be done in order to administer the medicated shampoo she desperately needed. Thankfully, Cardis fur has now grown in again, and she has the most beautiful brindle coat! Cardi is a very friendly 2-year-old pittie. She becomes excited whenever we walk up to her kennel, doing a whole-body wiggle when she knows its time for walks and playtime. When shes in the Big Yard, she runs around happily, and will chase anything you throwballs, sticks, frisbees, and rope toys. We think she would do best in a home that has a yard, and would get along great with older kids who she can run around and tucker herself out with. Cardi showed signs of resource guarding with other dogs, but she doesnt mind when they walk by her on the trails. We think she would be happiest if she could be a familys one-and-only pet. Come and meet Cardi by heading to kenthumane.org to submit an application! Due to COVID-19 precautions, the Animal Care Shelter for Kent County is open by appointment only. Once your application is approved, we will set up an appointment with you!Animal meetings and adoptions by appointment only. Please go to kenthumane.org/adoption-applicationOnce approved we will call you to set up an appointment!",

            "description": "Its that time right after the holidays, when the festivities have come to an end, the decorations have been packed away, and everything feels a bit dimmer in the cold January light. While many of us are feeling low, here is a dog thats holding out hope for an upswing. Sherbert arrived at ACSKC after our Animal Control Officers were alerted about a case of neglect. The puppy they found was locked in a crate and barely 20lbshalf the weight he should have been at his age. Now, Sherbie is doing just fine! His weight is good and he does not show signs of any health problems or distrust in people. In fact, he becomes very excited upon meeting new friends! Just over a year old, Sherbie still has a lot of puppy energy. He loves to chase balls, run around our Big Yard, and get in some cuddles. This active pittie not only needs an outlet for all his energy, Sherbie should also work on his obedience training. While he is very food-motivated and will sit and offer his paw for treats, he could use a review of the basics. As Sherbert gets super excited when he sees someone he wants to meet, this can result in leash pulling and jumping. He will also get mouthy when playing. For this reason, we think he would do well in a home with older kids, and with another dog he can romp around with.If youve been looking for a way to get out of a slump, this lively and loving puppy is just what you need!Animal meetings and adoptions by appointment only. Please go to kenthumane.org/adoption-applicationOnce approved we will call you to set up an appointment!",

WE are a high intake No Kill Shelter ran by a staff of 4 and do not always have time to answer every question asked by so many. If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced. It is never our intention to ignore a request about an adoptable animal in our facility.\n\nSandy Brown, Director, PAW Animal Shelter\n\n319-372-2274",

The first step will be to set up a virtual meeting with their current foster family via phone, zoom, or facetime, to provide you with more detailed information about the animal. Following that, if you feel like it could be a good adoption fit, shelter staff will help coordinate a socially-distanced meeting in person so that you can meet your potential family member up-close and personal. Thank you for your patience during this time. We really appreciate your support!\n\nJoe is an outgoing and active dog. For a big guy, he\u2019s got some stamina, loves his long walks, and will even jog. He\u2019s also a really snuggly guy who will make a very loyal and devoted companion. He would prefer to be an only pet.\n",

We evaluate all dogs in a foster home for at least two weeks and then we will post an update with more information about the dog.  This evaluation period lets us know if the dog is good with other dogs, house trained, has any health issues, etc.   \n\nPlease apply at tzuzoorescue.com if you are interested in adopting from Tzu Zoo Rescue.  More information available by contacting tzradopt@gmail.com.\n\n[NOTE: We are a rescue NOT a shelter, meaning WE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY THAT OPENS TO THE PUBLIC. Typically, an application and home visit (both of which are required for adoption) MUST be completed, BEFORE a potential adopter will be introduced to one of our pets, in order to first determine that our basic adoption requirements are met, prior to introductions being made. We also utilize personal reference and vet checks (to ensure that any pets already in the potential adoptive home are current on vaccines, heart worm prevention and sterilized) in our adoption process, all of which is intended to ensure that the best match, between pet and people, is made. The adoption fee is based on on the dog's age.",

            "description": "Breaking news... there's a puppy at Frosted Faces! Allow us to introduce Ysabel!\n\n5-month-old Ysabel was found by one of our adopters when camping in Santa Ysabel. She was running down a trail with anther dog, and they were only able to catch her. We advised that they should have animal control impound her for a suitable stray hold in case anyone was looking for her, even though we suspected backyard breeding had happening, and she was likely dumped for having impairments.\n\nYsabel is blind and deaf, so we wanted to spring her as soon as possible from the scary shelter and also make sure she had an advocates for life - Frosted Faces and her future forever family. On December 31st, we exited Ysabel from Bonita Shelter. The other dog Ysabel was seen running with, was later caught and impounded also. When we called to check on her, staff said she had fewer impairments than Ysabel and already a scheduled adoption appointment. YAY!\n\nYsabel is truly a puppy and plops her big clumsy puppy paws on you, and play bows! Her adaptability is impressive, and she is very sweet and affectionate. We took Ysabel to College Animal Hospital where her bloodwork was normal except for having a UTI, so we started her on antibiotics. Ysabel has spay surgery scheduled later this month.\n\nYsabel is living in a foster home while she awaits a patient forever family who will give her the wonderful life she deserves. Her Foster Mom reports that Ysabel is very loving and cuddly, gets along well with the other pup in the home, and understands that the front door means potty and will hang out in that area when she needs to go. What a smart cookie!\n\nApply to meet sweet Ysabel: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees and we help with medical costs!\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated 1/11/21 KG",

            "description": "Meet Allen!\n\nAllen is a paralyzed pup who isn't afraid to love fiercely after all he has been through in his short life. He is 2 years old and just 12 pounds. He was hit by a car and left dragging himself but you would never guess he was failed. He adores his humans, and craves affection. His favorite place in the world is being on a couch wrapped in the arms of the person he loves. He has overcome a lot and continues to get stronger with each week. He enjoys going on walks in his wheel chair and when he isn't in his wheelchair, he can zoom around the house and yard like its nobody's business! When he really wants to move at fast speed, he starts to hop and you'd be amazed by the skill in this! He has lived in a home with many dogs, cats, and a 4 1/2 year old gentle boy. He wants to be included in the fun and festivities, but also is good with some chill time sunbathing. Allen does require some extra steps in his daily care but it doesn't take long for this to become part of a normal routine (his current fosters have never taken care of a special needs dog before). He needs his bladder expressed a few times a day because he lost that control when he was hit. For this reason he also wears a belly band, because he does leak some, more so when his bladder is fuller. Allen had to learn for himself as well on how to embrace his new life. He benefits from basic physical therapy at home, and may even reward you with a tail wag. Allen would do best in a home with a family that is home more often than not and has a calmer small/medium size dog as a companion for him, he can also handle cats. Allen's facial expressions don't change much and we call it \"resting Allen face\" , but even though his facial expressions don't show it; he is a happy boy! He does get into playful moods where he will start having \"zoomies\" and carrying around big toys (he LOVES big stuffed toys). Allen is just looking for love (the more cuddles the better in his eyes) and someone who will accept him for who he is. Hopefully that's you! \n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $275.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

She is the complete package \u2013 friendly, fun and eager to please.  Sometimes she barks \u201chello!\u201d to other dogs but calms down as soon as she meets them and even walks well in a pack.  She is calmer off-leash in a yard or a dog park where she can play with other dogs.  She needs someone who will take her on long walks through the park or a fun day at the beach (and really, how can you resist saying \u201cno\u201d to that face?).  Lola enjoys all the praise and petting she can get in her life, and whatever Lola wants, Lola gets.\n\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website and Facebook page!

She loves people and is going to make a great family dog.\nDanielle has not done well with other dogs, and will need to be the only dog in the home. \n\nPlease visit our website at faithfulfriendsrescue.org/adoptable-pets if you are interested in adopting.\n\nI am a mixed breed dog. This means I don't have a specific recognizable breed. The rescue uses the following guide which are guesses based on my current size and age for how big I will be when full grown: Mixed Breed (small) up to 25 pounds - Mixed Breed (medium) between 25-45 pounds - Mixed Breed (large) more than 50 pounds. For more information on, please visit the website https://faithfulfriendsrescue.org/adoptable-pets.\n\nWe are setting up adoptions with approved adopters on an appointment basis. We are no longer hosting adoption events at PetSmart until further notice. We are not arranging meet and greets; but appointments to finalize adoptions to limit exposure for all. Our adoptions come with a one week trial period in which if things are not working out, we will refund your adoption fee if you decide to return your newly adopted Faithful Friend. Our adoptions must be done in person and we do not arrange transport to adopters. Our adoption fees vary and we are only able to accept payments by card* at this time but include spay/neuter, heartworm test (dogs), FeLV/FIV test (cats), age appropriate vaccines and deworming, flea, tick and heartworm medication and microchip.",

            "description": "Atlas was adopted from our organization as a young puppy, but quickly grew and became more than could be managed with a kiddo and other dog in the house. He is looking for a kid-free, dog-free and probably cat-free home. He will also need a very strong person due to his size and strength! He also needs mental and physical stimulation to keep him from becoming bored and finding things to get into on his own. \n\nPlease visit our website at faithfulfriendsrescue.org/adoptable-pets if you are interested in adopting.\n\nI am a mixed breed dog. This means I don't have a specific recognizable breed. The rescue uses the following guide which are guesses based on my current size and age for how big I will be when full grown: Mixed Breed (small) up to 25 pounds - Mixed Breed (medium) between 25-45 pounds - Mixed Breed (large) more than 50 pounds. For more information on, please visit the website https://faithfulfriendsrescue.org/adoptable-pets.\n\nWe are setting up adoptions with approved adopters on an appointment basis. We are no longer hosting adoption events at PetSmart until further notice. We are not arranging meet and greets; but appointments to finalize adoptions to limit exposure for all. Our adoptions come with a one week trial period in which if things are not working out, we will refund your adoption fee if you decide to return your newly adopted Faithful Friend. Our adoptions must be done in person and we do not arrange transport to adopters. Our adoption fees vary and we are only able to accept payments by card* at this time but include spay/neuter, heartworm test (dogs), FeLV/FIV test (cats), age appropriate vaccines and deworming, flea, tick and heartworm medication and microchip.",

This sweet girl came to us with King from a home where she had experience being around children and enjoyed just hanging out. She is very bonded with  King. On leash, she is most comfortable with him at her side. She follows his cues but will defer to you too. Moka is a good size girl and has experience with basic commands like sit and stay. She has shown excellent house and yard manners as well. She doesn\u2019t seem to pay much mind to other dogs, whether she\u2019s on leash or when in playgroups. She just lets them romp and comes back to you looking for attention and encouragement. She is really looking for a home that has a little extra room for her and King. So if you are looking for a good girl like Moka with the bonus of a good boy like King, too, please fill out an application.\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website and Facebook page!

He is bonded with his kennel mate, Moka, and you can always sense him looking for her anytime she\u2019s not in his line of sight.  But when reunited, he comes out of his shell and is ready to get out to explore, following your lead. A handsome boy with a medium energy level, he has a lovely dark coat and enjoys receiving affection from his people, as well as giving some back to them.  When around other dogs, he doesn\u2019t pay them much mind - he walks past them when on leash and, when off leash, he meets dogs well and just wants to hang out.  King came to us with Moka from a home where he was good with children and showed very nice house and yard manners.  Like many Shepherds, he\u2019s quite smart and has learned commands like stay and sit.  He is very much looking forward to returning to a loving home environment, especially if there is also room for Moka.

To him, age is just a number and does not identify his energy and ability -- Bryce defies those stereotypes. He's a happy boy with bursts of enthusiasm, especially when he knows he\u2019s about to go for a walk. This goofy boy may pull on leash but will settle in to a nice trot alongside you. He does well in playgroups; he socializes with staff and other dogs, and enjoys exploring the play yard. He is not a fan of pushy pups, so will do best with friendly canine pals. He absolutely enjoys affection from his people and, if you can imagine that release of excitement, then he will surely not disappoint, and you can\u2019t help but laugh at his silliness. He is the perfect mixture of grace, gratitude and positivity, and he will surely make a family gush with pride. Bryce will patiently wait for you, but don\u2019t wait too long.\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website!

            "description": "Angelic senior lady Zara is one who we could not leave behind at Chicago Animal Care and Control this past New Year's weekend! We had seen her when she first arrived there as a stray in early December and she was completely emaciated. She still needs to put on weight and acts like she has never eaten a treat before the way she drools and devours them (but wont take your finger off, don't worry!) but she looks so much better!\n\nZara is much more petite in person that she looks in pictures, she is around 50lbs. She may be 9 years old but she has lots of energy and a zest for life for sure! She loves to run, play, walk, and explore. She is super loving with all people and will promptly roll over for belly rubs! She is just so cute and so deserving of a home after all she has been through.\n\nZara looks as though she was used to have many litters and then dumped. That may explain why she doesn't want dogs all up in her personal space, but she totally ignores them on walks and through barriers, she just does not seem to want to play very much but this may change as she gets more comfortable, especially now that she is in a foster home! But it would not surprise us if Zara's ideal happily ever after involved her as the only child and center of attention! She deserves to soak up tons of love in her golden years and she will return it in spades!\n\nZara's loooves her foster mama and her foster mom loves her right back. Haley thinks that Zara is the coolest and best dog!\n\nShe says that she is so friendly and loving, housebroken, she is easy to walk on a leash, was an angel for her bath, loves car rides so gets to go on lots of errands with her foster mom, and really craves being next to her person and will sleep at your feet if you are there. Zara is so good she even walks with booties to protect her little paws from the salt and she does so well on them! Most dogs would NOT tolerate that! But Zara never complains. She is an angel.\n\nZara does cry at first when left alone, so an apartment may not be ideal but she is currently being fostered in a town home and it is not so loud, and will stop after a bit. But she may have that separation anxiety, and in time that gets better too.\n\nAll in all, Zara is a wonderful and deserving lady! We can't wait to get her into her forever home! \n\nZara's fee has been generously sponsored by a local business, Small Oven Pastries! We thank them so very much for that, and not only that, but Zara's adopter will receive a beautiful gift basket of coffees and pastries as well. Wow! Better get to that application....",

Please read our \u201cINTERESTED IN ADOPTING?\u201d section below for guidance. ~\n\n\nAria\u2019s a female Jindo mix that's 1 year old and weighs about 30 pounds. She was rescued from the Haman shelter in Korea and now she's with us in NYC to find her forever home! Once she's comfortable, Aria\u2019s best described as sweet, gentle, and well-mannered. She likes getting brushed, relaxing in her crate, and spending time with her foster. She would do best with a patient adopter that can help her build more confidence outdoors and around strangers. Aria is making progress every day and would love to open up to you. Apply to adopt Aria! \n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014---------------------------\n\n\nINTERESTED IN ADOPTING?\n\nPlease check our Adopt page (www.koreank9rescue.org/adopt) and our Adoption FAQ (www.koreank9rescue.org/adoption-faq) to learn more!

They had been living with their actual mother dog and owner up until recently. (Falcon is in the blue-collar and Semper in the red collar)\n\nBoth are very sweet and loyal boys, they like to follow you around the house and be included in all your daily activities. Falcon is a bit on the shy side at first, but one he is comfortable with his family, he will open up and become a snuggle bug! They are housebroken as long as you don't leave them alone for long periods of time. They also both do well with other dogs and we cannot see them caring about cats. They are good with kids and will fit in well in a household with kids 10 and older.\n\nThis dynamic duo have already been neutered and are up to date on vaccines. They are being fostered here in New England so they are available for a Meet and Greet!! Please fill out an application to adopt these sweet brothers!",

King's previous owners loved him a lot and said that he is affectionate and friendly and loves to play fetch. This smart boy already knows sit, down, shake and come but also looks forward to learning more! His previous home did not have any other animals, but we have introduced him to play group and he seems pretty tolerant of other dogs being around. It is very clear though that he prefers the attention of people more than anything. He is a high energy boy, so if you're looking for a couch potato, this probably isn't the dog for you. If you like being active, walking, hiking or playing ball, King might be the perfect adventure buddy! His previous owner said one of his favorite things about King was how loyal he is, and we love how eager he is to hang out with our volunteers and learn new things. If you want to bring King into your castle, schedule a virtual adoption counseling appointment today!",

This 10 year old German Shepherd loves playing with her tennis ball, and if you dont throw it for her fast enough, she will do it herself! Kuriyana came in with another dog who has already been adopted, and in play sessions she is a bit assertive with other dogs, but could probably live with one as long as they dont mind shes a bit sassy. Kuriyana has shown us that she already knows sit, down and shake, but shes very motivated to learn even more! Kuriyana is on a couple of medications that are pretty common for older dogs, but we can go over those a bit more if youre interested in adopting her! To set up a virtual adoption counseling appointment, please contact us at vcas.us/scheduling and see if you want to take this lively lady home.",

            "description": "weight: \nestimated age: \n\nThis dog recently arrived and is just settling in.  If you are interested in adopting, you MUST come in person during adoption hours and fill out an application.  Adoption hours and address are viewable on the website at www.smallmiraclesrescue.org\n\n\n---FAQ---\n\nIs This Dog Currently Available?... This dog is available at the Small Miracles rescue facility in Ellicott City.  To submit an application, please come meet this dog in person.  You can bring your application with you, or you can fill one out when you come in.  Dogs will be removed from PetFinder only when they have an approved application or more than three (3) interested applicants.\n\nWhere did this dog come from?...  We rescue dogs from 100% kill shelters in West Virginia and on occasion from Kentucky.  On rare occasions we accept owner surrenders.  Due to the nature of the shelters they were rescued from, we often do not know the dogs' history.\n\nHow Old is this dog?...  We look at a dogs' teeth to estimate its age, and then the age is reevaluated by our veterinary staff when the dog is spayed/neutered.  If an age is not posted online, please feel free to inquire.\n\nIs this dog Good With Kids?...  We occasionally know for sure if a dog is good with kids because it came from a home with kids.  This is rare.  We always suggest you bring your children in to meet the dog if you are seriously interested in adopting.  Dogs may like some kids and may dislike others.  Dogs are individuals, just like kids are.\n\nIs this dog Housebroken?...  Advice from a veterinarian:  Even if a dog is housebroken at my house, it does not mean that it understands not to pee at someone else's house.  It ONLY understands not to pee at my house.  Some dogs make the connection that they should only pee outside.  Some must be retrained when they come home.  All we can tell you for sure is whether/or not a dog's crate is clean when we come to walk them in the AM.  All this means is that they are crate trained and waited to pee until we took them outside.\n\nWhat is this dog's Temperament?...  We do not have a clear picture of a dog's temperament until we have allowed them to settle in for a few days.  Even then they are living in a shelter environment with many other dogs and a lot of daily activity.  It can be difficult to say a dog is \"calm\" or \"nervous\" when the shelter environment is playing a big role in that behavior.  We only rescue FRIENDLY dogs who have no known bite history.  If a dog is at Small Miracles, it likes people and has a good temperament.  We always suggest you meet the dog to see if it is the right fit for your lifestyle. \n\nWhat are your Fees?...  Base adoption fee is $325 for adult dogs and puppies.  To this, we add a $30 microchip fee, which we register for you, and a 6 month supply of heartworm preventative.  Heartworm preventative costs $40-60 depending on the weight of the dog.  This means that a large dog will total $405.00 and an extra large dog will total $415.00.\n\nWhy can't I adopt a FREE dog?...  Our adoption fee covers many procedures which cost much more for us then the amount we ask for from you. We spay/neuter all pets, and we give them their first round of vaccines (canine distemper, bordatella, Rabies if age appropriate).  At a typical vet clinic this would cost you $500 at minimum for the surgery, and each vaccine is roughly $35 each.  Even if your adopted dog does not have all of its shots due to the mandatory waiting period between booster shots, we offer vaccinations at the low cost of $20/shot.  We test all dogs for heartworm disease and tickborn illnesses such as Lymes.  We never euthanize a heartworm positive dog, and treatment routinely costs us $3000/dog.  We collect a fecal sample from every rescued dog and run a microscopic parasite test.  Any parasites found will be treated with two rounds of the appropriate dewormer.  We treat all dogs for fleas and ticks with Advantage.  If a dog has significant dental disease or \"very dirty teeth\", we will perform a dental cleaning when the dog has its spay/neuter surgery.  A dental cleaning with extractions would cost you upwards of $400-600 at your local vet clinic.\n\nALSO NOTE... Small Miracle is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization.  We survive off of our adoption fees and donations from the community.  We are a non-profit animal rescue and do not receive income from tax revenue as some county shelters do. \n\nFor more information including Adoption Hours and Rescue Address, please visit our website at www.smallmiraclesrescue.org",

            "description": "weight: 64#\nestimated age: 10 months\n\nThis dog recently arrived and is just settling in.  If you are interested in adopting, you MUST come in person during adoption hours and fill out an application.  Adoption hours and address are viewable on the website at www.smallmiraclesrescue.org\n\n\n---FAQ---\n\nIs This Dog Currently Available?... This dog is available at the Small Miracles rescue facility in Ellicott City.  To submit an application, please come meet this dog in person.  You can bring your application with you, or you can fill one out when you come in.  Dogs will be removed from PetFinder only when they have an approved application or more than three (3) interested applicants.\n\nWhere did this dog come from?...  We rescue dogs from 100% kill shelters in West Virginia and on occasion from Kentucky.  On rare occasions we accept owner surrenders.  Due to the nature of the shelters they were rescued from, we often do not know the dogs' history.\n\nHow Old is this dog?...  We look at a dogs' teeth to estimate its age, and then the age is reevaluated by our veterinary staff when the dog is spayed/neutered.  If an age is not posted online, please feel free to inquire.\n\nIs this dog Good With Kids?...  We occasionally know for sure if a dog is good with kids because it came from a home with kids.  This is rare.  We always suggest you bring your children in to meet the dog if you are seriously interested in adopting.  Dogs may like some kids and may dislike others.  Dogs are individuals, just like kids are.\n\nIs this dog Housebroken?...  Advice from a veterinarian:  Even if a dog is housebroken at my house, it does not mean that it understands not to pee at someone else's house.  It ONLY understands not to pee at my house.  Some dogs make the connection that they should only pee outside.  Some must be retrained when they come home.  All we can tell you for sure is whether/or not a dog's crate is clean when we come to walk them in the AM.  All this means is that they are crate trained and waited to pee until we took them outside.\n\nWhat is this dog's Temperament?...  We do not have a clear picture of a dog's temperament until we have allowed them to settle in for a few days.  Even then they are living in a shelter environment with many other dogs and a lot of daily activity.  It can be difficult to say a dog is \"calm\" or \"nervous\" when the shelter environment is playing a big role in that behavior.  We only rescue FRIENDLY dogs who have no known bite history.  If a dog is at Small Miracles, it likes people and has a good temperament.  We always suggest you meet the dog to see if it is the right fit for your lifestyle. \n\nWhat are your Fees?...  Base adoption fee is $325 for adult dogs and puppies.  To this, we add a $30 microchip fee, which we register for you, and a 6 month supply of heartworm preventative.  Heartworm preventative costs $40-60 depending on the weight of the dog.  This means that a large dog will total $405.00 and an extra large dog will total $415.00.\n\nWhy can't I adopt a FREE dog?...  Our adoption fee covers many procedures which cost much more for us then the amount we ask for from you. We spay/neuter all pets, and we give them their first round of vaccines (canine distemper, bordatella, Rabies if age appropriate).  At a typical vet clinic this would cost you $500 at minimum for the surgery, and each vaccine is roughly $35 each.  Even if your adopted dog does not have all of its shots due to the mandatory waiting period between booster shots, we offer vaccinations at the low cost of $20/shot.  We test all dogs for heartworm disease and tickborn illnesses such as Lymes.  We never euthanize a heartworm positive dog, and treatment routinely costs us $3000/dog.  We collect a fecal sample from every rescued dog and run a microscopic parasite test.  Any parasites found will be treated with two rounds of the appropriate dewormer.  We treat all dogs for fleas and ticks with Advantage.  If a dog has significant dental disease or \"very dirty teeth\", we will perform a dental cleaning when the dog has its spay/neuter surgery.  A dental cleaning with extractions would cost you upwards of $400-600 at your local vet clinic.\n\nALSO NOTE... Small Miracle is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization.  We survive off of our adoption fees and donations from the community.  We are a non-profit animal rescue and do not receive income from tax revenue as some county shelters do. \n\nFor more information including Adoption Hours and Rescue Address, please visit our website at www.smallmiraclesrescue.org",

They are local dogs, and their owner passed away a year ago. The landlord has been caring for them, and finally reached out for help. That\u2019s how they got to us. Our vet thinks Kiera is 5 years of age. She\u2019s got a lot of spunk. She does walk with a limp in her back leg- but it does not slow her down. Our vet took x rays and said she has an old knee fracture that appears to have healed without medical intervention, hence the limp. He stated he does not recommend surgery, but just management with medication. Kiera is still Mischievous like a puppy- leave treats out and she\u2019s helping herself! So her foster mom does crate her when she leaves, otherwise she gets into things. \n\n",

This very friendly two year old American Pit Bull is as friendly and social as his name sounds. Through no fault of his own, Bubba was about to be dumped by a a very irresponsible owner, when a Good Samaritan stepped up to help him. He is such fun to be around and does extremely well with other dogs and and kids. He is potty and kennel trained, and like most of his breed, he is a big cuddle bug. Bubba is a medium dog and weighs around 50 pounds. He can walk on a leash, but does need some work with heeling. However, Bubba is smart and wants to please, so with a little practice and patience, he will make a good walking companion. Bubba can easily jump a chain link, so he is going to need a home with a six food wooden fence. If you would like to meet Bubba, please contact wendee@sterlingtile.net",

I am a friendly but protective girl. I love my foster family and will protect you against strangers or non dog people. A home familiar with mastiffs is preferred. A fenced yard is ideal due to my size and timid ness with new people especially men. I would do best in a home with older kids and friendly dogs bigger than 30 lbs. I am a big girl who wasn\u2019t taught much for manners but am learning how to not jump up to greet my humans. I would ideally need to go through a training course with my new adopters so I can blossom into a well behaved giant. I am a beautiful girl with lots to learn and would love a home of my own.

Princess has a litter of pups and now she has weaned those pups and is available for adoption. She is a very sweet girl! We estimate her age at about 1 year. She is spayed, dewormed and up to date on all of her vaccines. She is heartworm negative. \n\nPrincess is located in Fort Collins, CO. \n\nWe do not adopt out of state. Adoption fee is $350\n\nHer mate, Andre (dog howling in picture), has been adopted so she is a little down waiting for her own furever family.\n\nIf you would like to setup a time to meet Princess, please email us at info@redbarnveterinaryservices.com or TEXT us at 970.226.0454. TEXT will get a faster response. \n\nThank you!",

Inquiries requesting additional information will not be returned, due to limited volunteers. Thank you for your understanding **** \n\nHi there. \n\nMy name is Laila, but I sometimes go by Silly Girl or Goofball. I am a 2-year-old Terrier mix looking for my soul mate. My foster mom says I am super smart, energetic and a love bug. I call myself fun-loving, but I don\u2019t mind being a couch potato at times. \n\nI even know a few tricks; don\u2019t worry I will teach them to you. I am not looking for much just someone that will take me on walks, plays with me (I love toys) and doesn\u2019t mind when I want to snuggle. My favorite past time is to pay tug of war with your socks and running off with them to shake the monsters out, but don\u2019t worry I will give them back to you as soon as I am done. I don\u2019t mind cats, but I am not a fan of other dogs because I want you all to myself.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAll PETronus Rescue dogs receive basic vaccinations (distemper/parvo, bordetella, & rabies), spay/ neuter, and microchip prior to adoption. We also treat any know medical issues, including heartworms.\n\nOur dogs live in foster homes while they wait patiently for their forever families to find them. This is beneficial in that they learn house manners, crate training, housebreaking, etc while they wait and we are also able to get a very realistic picture of their energy level, temperament, etc so that we can place them in a home that is the best fit.\n\nOur adoption fees are $200 for dogs over 1 year of age and $250 for dogs under 1 year of age. Puppies receive 3 rounds of puppy vaccinations.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our amazing dogs, please fill out our adoption application here http://bit.ly/PRAdoption and we will be in touch!\n\n",

I look pretty silly in these pictures but I kept wanting to look at my foster mom and not at the camera.     I was born Sept 20, 2020.    I am a big boy. I weigh 54 pounds as of Jan 26th  and it is estimated I will be over 110 as an adult.  I am mostly white with medium coat.   I have the double dews of the pyr and the intelligence of both breeds.   I caught on to leash training and crate training fairly quickly.    I have a sweet temperament and usually I have a pleasant, happy look on my face.   Sometimes I still have puppy \"pee pee\" accidents so I will need continued work in that area.   I get along very well  with other dogs but would do fine as an only dog as I love attention and being petted.     I am used to cats and think ALL cats like me.     I have been given two puppy vaccinations and dewormed.     I will be neutered and rabies vaccinated this week.    My foster parents are seeking a home with very recent or current Great Pyrenees or Anatolian ownership,     If you are able to come HERE  to meet/adopt me, drop an email and ask for the application for adoption.      IF YOU ARE READING THIS, I AM AVAILABLE.",

I have a happy personality, I love to snuggle, receive belly rubs and wrestle.  I'm about 1 year old and 60ish pounds.  My owner moved out and left me all alone to fend for myself.  We aren't sure how long I was living alone, the important thing is that life is behind me now.  I am loving having my foster mom around and my fur siblings.  Mom calls me an itch because sometimes I have trouble settling which is another word for saying I'm a busy girl.   I like to know what's going on in the house, so I'm up and down when there is movement, remember, I'm still a puppy.  My breed is a guess but I have some of the characteristic looks of a Ridgeback, the eye color,  the wrinkles on my head, my body color and the webbed feet.  The Boxer idea comes from the wrinkles on my head but mainly because I am all paws when I play.  In addition to being called an itch I also have the nickname of the bulldozer.  When mom moves I move right along with her, most of the time she doesn't move as fast as me and I bump into her.  She said if she fails it will be my fault.  I say she just needs to move faster......geez...  Me and little kids wouldn't be a good match, I hear they aren't very steady on their feet.  I love to snuggle after I'm done with my antics of boxing and nibbling on your hands, which mom says hurts so we are working on me not doing that.   I've been doing well not counter surfing but there isn't much for me to see there.  I did pull a towel off the counter that had some glasses drying on them, boy was mom mad.  I think that's a benefit, she has less glasses to wash and dry.  She tells me I'm like a cement block to move, I'm not a 6 lb lap dog....WHAT???  that's news to me.   I get to sleep with her but she struggles to get in bed because of course I want to be as close to her as I can get.  I hog her side of the king side bed.  I have no idea what personal space is with anyone and I love to give kisses, even to the other dogs.  I snore and sometimes I moan when I'm relaxed and sleeping.  I talk and play bow when I want attention usually with one of the other dogs.  I am a sweet girl who would love to have someone love me as much as I would love them.  Someone to explore life, teach me how to take nice long walks, not jump on you when I'm excited and not jump on the counter to help you cook.  No cats, no small dogs and no senior dogs because I do not know how big and powerful I am.   Apartment living is not for me I am too big and busy.  I am housebroken here but I use the dog door that I have access to all the time.  I am only crated when mom goes out which is not very often.  I would love a somewhat active person/family because I do get bored.  While I'm not high energy I'm no couch potato either.  I need some daily run time, walking is nice but it doesn't give a big happy girl like me enough exercise.  Living with a senior person wouldn't be in their best interest, remember my nickname of the bulldozer.  Please visit our website for our meet/greet/adoption process, www.crazypawsdogrescue.com          Love, Hannah\n\n",

She slowly warmed up to us and we learned that she LOVES people (although she's a little awkward with dogs and should not go to a home with cats) once she's comfortable with you. She's just returned from a foster home where she learned all about snuggles on the sofa and picked up new tricks like sit paw and down . At just a year old, she shows incredible promise.",

Our volunteers say he is very sweet and a little shy to new people. Just needs some basic training which our volunteers are working on. Not sure why the owner told us he was a German Shepherd mix, he is small and looks like a black lab. He is all black with a small bit of white, 43 lbs and 9 months so probably wont be too large of a dog. Mo'i is going through training but would do best in a home with Shepherd experience.\nIf you are interested in meeting Mo'i, which means King in Hawaiian, please contact AdoptAnimalNetwork@gmail.com",

Luckily, he is super laidback and doesn't respond to her foolishness. Another dog might not be so patient. Good with cats? unknown, will not be adopted to a home with a cat Good with children? No young kids under at least 13 and up. Activity Preference: Needs a couple walks a day., Needs in-house activities, Up for a long hike any day. IQ: Smart Frankie's favorite things\nFrankie is good at: meeting people, meeting dogs, staying in a crate, behaving in the house, going for car rides, walking on a leash Ideal home: someone at home most of the day, a fenced yard\nSpecial Need: Frankie will take any chance she can get to eat any soft household items or toys. Her previous owners were very lucky that she always passed what she ate without the need for surgery. She has eaten towels, pillows, blankets, socks, clothes, soft toys. This is why she cannot even be alone with a dog bed and why we think a home without children would be safest for her.\nMeet Frankie\nFrankie is a sweet loving girl, 2.5 years old. She is house trained, crate trained and walks on a leash. She does well with normal commands (sit, stay, leave it) and sleeps in her bed at night through the night. She is playful, loves throwing her ball outside and going for walks. She's a big lap dog and loves to be pet or rubbed. She is such a loving, sweet girl and we want the very best home for her and for her future.\n\nPLEASE READ: Adopters will not be considered without completing an application. Please visit www.AmericanBulldogRescue.org to apply! Remember - Adoption is always the best option! If you can't help by adopting a homeless pet, please consider making a tax-deductible donation to American Bulldog Rescue, 4 Terry Drive, Suite 1D Newtown, PA 18940 or paypal AmericanBulldogRescue@verizon.net. We cannot place dogs in homes with children under 10 unless that dog has lived with kids or is in a foster home with kids. Thank you.To be considered for adoption, you must apply using our free, online application. Our dogs are fostered in our volunteers' homes, not in a central shelter/location. Only approved applicants are put into contact with the foster family to setup a meeting with the foster dog.

He is very smart and very willing to please and really enjoys his training games! He has lived with a female pitty but does not have an appreciation for the males so is not a candidate for dog parks. He has no destructive tendencies or separation anxiety, but he will try to run the household without a strong human leader. This tendency comes out as possessiveness over food or his people. For this reason he would do best in a home with at least one dog-savvy, active adult. Not sure if he's right for you? He's also looking for a foster! Email us about this amazingly handsome guy today!",

Union is great with other dogs and does not mind cats. He is going to be a great fit for just about any lifestyle offering love, activity and attention. And talk about gorgeous! He has a luxurious gold coat and one beautiful blue eye. Husky dream boy! You will be the envy of your friends! Huskys need activity and wide open areas. They can jump fences and can be escape artists. Make sure you are set up for the breed. If you are interested in Union please fill out the application at finalvictoryrescue.com.",

Her full blooded crested (female) mated with her male golden mix. Oscar is currently 26lbs and growing. Both he and his brothers are incredibly sweet natured babies though. They will lay next to you and beg to be pet for hours if allowed. They would rather be loved on than play. Since Oscar is the biggest of all of siblings he has come with some bullying behavior. He tends to not like to share his food but we are working with that and because he is such a people pleaser he immediately cowers when corrected. Oscar has short hair everywhere that a true hairless crested would- the texture of his hair is just coarser. \n",

He is housebroken and will bring you his leash when it is time to go out. He listens very well in the home and knows many commands. He is friendly with children, but has not been tested with other pets. Unfortunately this sweetheart is heartworm positive. He is currently in a foster home so an appointment must be made to meet him. His adoptive family must provide a quiet, calm, loving home while he is undergoing his heartworm treatment and is ready for his adoption to be finalized. If you can share your home and love with Bender, please submit an adoption application at humanesocietycc.org",

Sadie has done great adjusting to the shelter and has done fantastic with the shelter staff. Sadie also does great with other dogs after she has had proper introduction. She has never been around cats and is not yet housebroken. But don't let that sway your decision. Sadie can definitely be trained with some time and patience. With Sadie's temperament we believe she would do great with kids of all ages but may need some lessons in manners. She has been spayed and brought up to date on vaccinations through the shelters spay neuter program.\n\nHer adoption fee is $27.50 and she can be microchipped for $8.25. Due to the outbreak of Covid-19 our adoption policies have changed. All adoptions are by appointment only. Call to set up an appointment to meet the animal. Dogs are $61.50 and puppies are $59 unless otherwise noted. All cats and kittens are $44 unless otherwise noted. Our system automatically updates petfinders every two hours.

We know that special someone is just around the corner!\n\nLaiya is a 5 year old Pitbull & her eyes tell it all; She is as loving as she looks & melts when you talk to her or show her any type of affection. She is a loyal companion that bonds heavy to her people & just wants that special person to give her the chance she deserves. Laiya does not prefer cats & would do best with a laid back, male dog or as an only pup so she can be spoiled like the diva she is! She loves going for car rides & is the most polite little copilot! Laiya is a sunbathing queen & will lay out in the sun as long as you let her; She would make a great travel or vacation buddy! She does get a little extra wiggly when she's excited, so older children that are more stable on their feet would be ideal! (Ages 5-6+) Otherwise, she smothers them with kisses! :)\n\nLaiya is crate trained, house trained, spayed, microchipped, & up to date on vaccines. She is heartworm negative & ready to be loved in a home of her own!\n\nTo be considered for adoption, please complete an application below & we will contact you to schedule a meet & greet!\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/83106888643163",

I have made a lot of progress with my kennel but I would rather be with you than alone. I\u2019m generally a soft spoken low-moderate energy guy, but will let you know when I\u2019m done outside. I love to hangout on laps, chew on bones and treats, and play with toys. I can\u2019t wait to meet you!\n\nOur adoption fee is $260 for dogs over 5 months of age and includes all vaccinations, spay/neuter, micro chip implantation and registration/transfer, heartworm test and much more. Puppies up to 5 months of age are $275 and this includes all sets of puppy vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip implantation and registration and more. To adopt, go to www.fosterpetoutreach.org to complete an application.\nPlease note: Foster Pet Outreach tries to limit our adoptions to an area within approximately 60 miles of Peoria, Illinois.",

My name is Ophelia and I am very sociable and friendly with people. I am large and do need some refinement on my manners (I sometimes like to jump up and say \"hello\" and can pull on my leash). I still have lots of puppy to my personality and enjoy playing, especially in the snow! Although I like most other animals, I would do best in a home as an only pet with lots of attention. Please call the Mason City Stray Animal Shelter at 641-424-3617 for more information.\n\nAdoption fee covers the following veterinarian\u00a0services: spay/neuter surgery, age appropriate\u00a0vaccinations, flea and dewormer treatment, feline leukemia/FIV test in cats, heartworm test for dogs.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnimals listed with the Mason City Stray Animal Shelter will be held for 7 days from the \u201cEntry Date\u201d to give the opportunity for an owner to reclaim them.\u00a0 If not reclaimed, the animal will be made available for adoption to the public.",

A rescuer reached out to us with this message: \u201cGood morning, they sent me these videos of this little dog who was abandoned with everything and his little blanket at the entrance of a place that sells crepes and hamburgers called sinful in Buenos Aires Sur, on Cucapah avenue ... they tell me that it has been there for days and He does not move at all from there, he looks very sad, if someone had the possibility to help him please.\u201d We sent one of our rescuers to go get him and he is now enjoying the good life in his loving foster home. We don't know why Francis was abandoned on the streets- but we know he will know nothing but love for the rest of his days! Francis would do best in a home without cats as he likes to chase them, and can be a bit dominant with other dogs so a dog his size would best for a companion. He is so loving and grateful for every ounce of attention and every head scratch. Apply to adopt Francis today!\n\n\n*Please kindly note: We do not respond to inquiries as we are a very small team! The submission of an application is the first step in our adoption process and is required to schedule a meeting, without exception. All of our dogs are housed in private foster homes. Please complete application below, and include any questions in the final section. We do not do out of state adoptions, and a homecheck, adoption interview, and adoption fee are required. For more information about our adoption process, please visit: https://www.muttscouts.org/adopt2 \n\nhttps://fs6.formsite.com/themuttscouts/form5/index.html\n\nMutt Scouts is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dog rescue dedicated to helping homeless, abused, and abandoned dogs. We are committed to providing proper socialization, training, and medical care for each animal we save, no matter the cost. \n\nPlease visit our website for more information about our organization:\nhttps://www.muttscouts.org/\n\n",

            "description": "Due to COVID-19 precautions, all animals for adoption through Homeward Trails can be met by appointment only. Copy and paste the link to access the sign-up genius for an appointment: https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet for dogs and https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet1 for cats.\n\nFor animals in FOSTER homes, please submit an online application and an adoption team will reply with next steps. We thank you for your patience as we work to keep saving lives during this difficult time. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out our dog adoption questionnaire and e-mail it to elenahtar@gmail.com\n\nPLEASE VISIT THIS WEBSITE TO FIND THE ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE:\nhttp://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-forms/\n\nAmos loves the beach! \nHe is a very special dog. Amos is very sweet, loving and affectionate, tested so far with moms and teens. He's a short, stubby pup and very strong. He has a 1000 watt smile! And he must be young because his doggy breath is still sweet and clean - estimated age about 2 years. Despite his strength, he allows his humans to pick him up and put him in the bath, or lift him up onto the couch for a snuggle - his legs are a bit short for him to do it himself. He loves to snuggle and give slobbery kisses, lean on you and lie on your lap for head scratches and belly rubs. Amos is house trained and only does his business outside. He is crate trained and very quiet - he sleeps alone in his crate all night, quiet and dry until morning. Because Amos is completely blind, he spends most of his time being very quiet and listening to what is going on around him. Amos has no problem navigating despite his blindness. When Amos does sometimes bump into things, he takes it like a tank - he takes the hit, moves to one side, and keeps on going. With a little help from his person to alert him to stairs or guide him away from the street, Amos has no problem going for a walk to do his business, and can climb stairs easily (four or five observed). Amos is being treated for his heartworm diagnosis (treatment will be provided by HT and requires a rest period) so his walks are short currently. \nBeing blind, Amos does get spooked by other dogs and it is recommended that he be an only dog, or that he go to a home where the other dog can be trained to leave Amos alone. \n\nAmos loves love! And seems to have no fear of people, only enthusiasm for everyone. He is very grateful for any attention then goes back in the crate when he needs to with no complaints. He is the perfect dog for an affectionate, patient person/family willing to help him figure out how to navigate a new home. \nAmos is heartworm positive. This requires some treatment that we will provide and a period of rest. \n\nAdoption Coordinator: Elena\nLocation: Foster Home\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $475. This fee INCLUDES spay/neuter and microchip. \n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\nWe also provide free online workshop with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria/Falls Church/DC area. Start your new dog out on the right foot with this valuable, expert guidance FREE!\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program",

His foster needed time and patience teaching him the house rules but he has done really well. He is crate trained, house broken (actually whines to go out) and knows the basic commands. He has been around wee kids for shorter durations and is inquisitive and careful around them. . We think he is @2-3 years old. He weighs @40 lbs. 2/2/21 12:03 PM",

            "description": "Hi friends. My name is Watkins. Everyone keeps telling me what a cool dog I am!! \n\nMy foster mom says I'm pretty close to perfect! I'm potty trained (so easy). I don't mind my crate (I'd rather sleep with my humans). I love all dogs (super easy). I'm great with people of all ages (sometimes a tiny human that walks on all 4 visits my foster mom and dad, I'm working on playing more gently with him).\n\nI have a LOT of energy! As long as I am able to play hard and get my energy out I am a really good boy. I get into a little trouble when I am bored and have not gotten any exercise (I'm an adolescent, it's who I am).\n\nI LOVE tennis balls! If I had my way I would just carry one around in my mouth all the time. After I chew them so long that I break them, I start to eat pieces and need them taken away because my foster mom says they might not be so good for me to eat. I'm ok with that, they seem to keep showing up when I need them. Sometimes I even throw them down the stairs so I can chase them when the humans are making dinner and can't throw it for me.\n\nMy perfect family is one that either has another dog I can run and play with, I like to wrestle pretty hard, or has enough time to make sure I get plenty of activity and exercise to keep being the amazing dog that I am!\n\nAre you my people? I'd love to meet you. What type of adventures are we going to go on together?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nAll our Warrior Dogs will have all age appropriate medical care and vaccines, a microchip, and spay/neuter before adoption unless age is a factor with a puppy younger than 6-12 months at the time of adoption. If that is the case, the spay/neuter will be covered in the adoption fee and the owner will be responsible to have the procedure completed at a Warrior Dog Rescue Veterinarian at the appropriate time.\n\nPlease note that the majority of our dogs in rescue are from shelters where they have been found as strays or abandoned. Their breed description is based on our very best educated guess based on physical characteristics and their dispositions. If they came to our rescue as an owner surrender, the breed description will be listed as provided by the previous owner.\n\nAdoption Fee - $450\n\nTo apply for this pup, please submit an Adoption Application at http://warriordogrescue.com/adopt/adoption-application/",

HE NEEDS A HOME WITH FEMALE DOGS ONLY, NO MALE DOGS.\nHowever, Henry was found near death, malnourished and dehydrated about 6 months ago on Texas Star Golf Course. Trinity GAP arranged for him to go to our vet where he stayed for almost two months. Through it all he has remained one of the sweetest dogs you will ever meet. Henry just has a sweet soul. He is a very special dog to all of us who have been part of his long road to recovery. Henry loves people, children and other female dogs his own size. We are looking for a home with a single female large dog for Henry to live with. Henry loves to play with his dog sister, go for walks and snuggle. He is potty trained, walks well on a leash and has good dog manners. Henry is heartworm negative, neutered and totally vetted. He has been through so much in his young life, and we are determined to make sure he has a great home and family to love him. He will require a home with a 6' wooden fence. If you would like more information on Henry, please email wendee@sterlingtile.net",

We know we get a bad rap sometimes but WE are VERY nice dogs. Everyone who meets us says so. We've been hanging at a used car lot for the last 7-8 years; ever since we were tiny pups. We've recently been set free and we are ready to take on the world together! Where one goes the other MUST go; we are bonded. We love to be outside but are really grooving on the inside soft bed situation, are very chill but if you want to go for a long walk or maybe a little jog, we are down for that too. Hopper needs to lose some pounds anyway. We were kept in a crate for 13 hours each day. We've only been off the car lot for one week and it's been GREAT! We've met a lot of dogs and no issues, we've gone for car rides and that's ok too. We have had no accidents in the apartment, we've been hiking ( so cool!) and we walk like the champs we are on the leash. Got checked out at the vet and had some shots.  Fecal and thyroid came back good. Hope to hear from you soon!\n",

She does not do well with other dogs and we suggest she go to a home without cats. She is a loving girl who can go to a home with older children (12+).

She is approximately 8 years old and went to her temporary foster home on 1/2. She needs all vetting and received her vaccinations today and tested hearworm negative...YAY!! We were told she is not spayed so we will get her pre-surgical bloodwork done and pending the results will get her scheduled for spay surgery and some dental work, too. Roxy is good with cats and with kids but can be dog friend selective. She is currenty in a temporary Illinois foster home but has a couple of long term/forever foster/adoption offers...she is a lucky girl!!! 1/14/21 UPDATE: Roxy was spayed today, had her teeth cleaned, had a few small bumps removed and was microchipped and she did great!!! She will be moving to her longer term/potentially forever foster in about a week or so.1/30/21 UPDATE: Roxy arrived at her Indiana foster home a little over a week ago and she is doing fantastic. She absolutely adores all of her foster skinbrothers and loves nothing more than being in the middle of all of their activities or just cuddling with them. Roxy will crate up like a dream and sleep in her crate all night with no accidents however she is struggling a little bit with getting her pottying outside routine down during the day. Foster mom and dad are working on that and have seen some improvement already!",

Yes- another pup who was sadly hit by a car. Cupid has been a model patient, but it's time for him to continue his recovery in a quiet home. He's friendly, sweet and easy to leash and walk. Keep in mind that he won't be doing any marathons any time soon, unless they're on Netflix. Cupid may need additional treatment, so it's important that he has a soft place to recover away from the hustle and bustle of the noisy shelter. Celebrate Valentine's day early with Cupid!!",

Victoria hasn't met any other dogs just yet due to her injuries, but this little doll is very friendly with all of her human visitors. She walks well on leash, but can't go far as she is currently in a cast. Ask about fostering or adopting Victoria today!",

            "description": "This is Buddy. A Shepherd mix. He has beautiful eyes. Buddy is high energy. He will need a family that can help him burn some energy.  He is 2 years old. Buddy would benefit from some training classes. He's short on manners but when hot dog chunks used he all of a sudden can hear with those big ears of his. He loves going for walks but like I said needs to be taught everything. He's getting much better already. He needs discipline! He's eager to learn just no one has ever given him orders. I would not at this time think he should be with smaller children as he will knock them over. Children probably 12 and up would be best. A child who can take him on walks will become his best friend. All dogs can learn manners. He's smart and catches on quickly. A chunk of hot dog will get him in his crate and then I don't hear a peep out of him. He does his business outside. Buddy does NOT like cats at all. So definitely no cats. So if you have it in you to help Buddy become a great dog then you'll be fit for him. It'll take some time and patience, but he'll learn. He is neutered, UTD on shots, microchipped and has his rabies vaccine. Buddy's adoption fee is 300.00.   \nBeing fostered near Wisconsin Dells and Adams-Friendship. \n\nUpdate from foster 1/13/21 :\nBuddy has come so far on learning. Most of his pent up energy is when he's coming out of his crate. He has learned that a door will not open for him if he's jumping up. He needs to sit, then the door will open and he's doing good. He has learned to sit, settle and lay down. He's even started playing with a tennis ball. Walks are getting better all the time. If he pulls, I stop, then he stops. Once he stops pulling he knows we'll continue our walk. This boy has a potential to be GREAT.\n\nUpdate from Foster 1/19/21:\nBuddy. A 2 year old Shep mix who's coat looks that of a chocolate lab. Buddy is neutered, UTD on shots, microchipped and has his rabies vaccine. Buddy is high energy meaning he loves to run and going for walks is his favorite. He does chase cats. I would recommend a home without any. Buddy is very playful with other dogs but because of his size I would recommend a home with a larger dog. Buddy is totally potty trained and keeps his crate clean and neat. He lays quietly in his crate. Older children are recommended. 12 years and older as he might knock a smaller child over just trying to play. He's learning to walk well on a leash but tends to pull now and then. His eyes are beautiful!! Buddy has learned alot in his foster home and continues to thrive. He's very treat motivated and loves to learn new things for treats  ? . Buddy would love to be in a home by Valentine's Day. He's not a barker unless he's telling you he needs to get outside. If you can be his Valentine apply to meet him. His adoption fee is 300.00.  He's being fostered near Adams-Friendship. Apply for Buddy at lastpawrescue.org \n\n\nApply at lastpawrescue.org \n501(c) approved. Wisconsin agriculture number is 285589-DD",

This 6 yr old neutered male Lab/Pit Mix is ready to find that furever family. At 85lbs, Romeo is a big boy who needs a dedicated person to love and care for him the way he deserves! While Romeo can be nervous at first when meeting new people, he is quite loving and affectionate after he warms up. He would do best in a home with older kids, or in a home with no kids. Romeo has done well with dogs in the past, but does need a home without cats.\n\nRomeo has skin allergies that he is currently being treated for. We recommend regular vet visits to develop the best long term allergy control plan for him. \n\nIf you are that patient and dedicated person who wants to give Romeo the fairy tale life he deserves give us a call at 518-885-4113 to schedule an appointment. All meets by appointment only. Available at the Saratoga County Animal Shelter.\n",

            "description": "Pup Pup was one of five dogs surrendered by the same person to a crowded county shelter. The dogs had all been left outside, and neighbors complained about their barking. With this kind of start in life, it was no surprise that--upon his arrival at our shelter--Pup Pup had absolutely no idea how to walk on leash. But more importantly, he *did* know how to love and receive love from our volunteers. He's a sweet kid who had a rough start, but is ready for his second chance (INSIDE this time!) with a fun-loving family of his own.\n\nPuppers is around 40 pounds and 1 1/2 years old (est birth 5/19). He spent the holidays on a trial visit with a prospective home. While he didn't turn out to be the right dog for them (and in particular, their skittish kitty), the family offers some great insight for future suitors:\n\n\"Pup Pup settled into the house very quickly once we brought him home. It seemed like he was probably used to living in a house since he only had one accident the first morning and let us know whenever he had to go outside. We had to keep him from getting into some things like the garbage can in the bathroom and Christmas tree ornaments, but other than that he seemed to be decently house trained. We'd have to coax him to go in his crate at night, but he did pretty well after crying the first few minutes. He also did very well on car rides, sitting patiently in the back seat.\n\n\"Pup Pup is a very active boy who plays hard and naps hard.  We tried to take him on at least one walk and play with him in the yard a couple times a day.  He really enjoyed playing fetch in the yard with me in the mornings before work, and quickly learned to sit before I threw the ball instead of jumping to get it out of my hand. He had no trouble at all keeping up on 3-mile walks, and still had plenty of energy to spare when we got back home. On the days when we weren't able to take him on as long a walk, he definitely seemed more restless and prone to mischief. We think that he would be happy in a home with another playful dog to help him meet his activity needs on top of regular walks.\"\n\nIf you think Pup Pup might be a good fit for your home, we'd love to hear from you! Please visit www.STAF.org to find out more about our adoption process.\n\n\u2022  All of our animals are spayed/neutered and current on shots.\n\u2022  We do not do same-day adoptions; we ask that you return for a follow-up visit before taking an animal home.\n\u2022  You must be 21 years or older to adopt from STAF.\n\u2022  We require a 4-foot-tall physical fence for homes with children under the age of 11. We also may require a physical fence for specific dogs on a case-by-case basis, depending on each dog\u2019s behavior and exercise needs.\n\u2022  Due in part to increasing coyote activity/incidents in the area and the difficulty of predicting how a dog will respond to invisible fence training, we can not adopt to homes with invisible fences.\n\u2022  We do request vet and personal references.\n\u2022  We can facilitate adoptions within a 75-mile radius of our Cincinnati-based shelter.\n\n",

I'm very kid friendly and there isn't a human that I've met that I don't love immediately. I enjoy cuddles and giving kisses. It's cold outside but I've been adjusting really well. I go potty outside and I'm not afraid to walk through some snow to find my spot. I also enjoy mind games and treat puzzles where I have to use my brain in order to get the treat inside. It helps to keep me occupied. I really like going on walks. It's like Biblo Baggins says, \"I'm going on an adventure!\" Maybe my foever human will like going on adventures with me. \n\nI really like to chase cats, so I don't think being in a home with them is a good idea, for me or them. I do really well with other dogs as long as they aren't in a crate when I'm around them, so when my foster mom leaves she puts me in a separate room. \n  I'm losing my hearing some, so I promise I don't just have selective hearing! You might just have to talk a bit louder. Sometimes you'll find me making a bed out of your clothes basket, and I'm not picky about the clothes inside of it being clean or dirty, I'm just looking for a nice, cozy place to lay that smells like my humans. Once I'm sleeping, I sleep hard, so you might have to touch me to wake me up. I sure look forward to meeting my forever family soon, and get used to their smells!\n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $275.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

Neighbors left food out for him, but no one knows who left him there or where he belonged. Finally, we were called to help. He was scanned and didn't have a chip or ID tag. We had Juno vaccinated, neutered and examined by our vet. He's a healthy young boy without any issues. He has a sweet friendly personality and has been fine walking on a leash and meeting other dogs on the street. Juno is very gentle, calmly takes food from your hand, and rides well in the car. For Husky lovers, Juno is the ideal dog! He would do best with someone who has had large breed dog experience. Like most Huskies, Juno will need a lot of exercise, so someone who jogs, hikes or likes to go on daily long walks is a must. Juno would love a nice, secure backyard to play. Juno is under 2 yrs old and weighs about 100 lbs. Juno has not shown any behavioral issues, but we still would not put any large breed dog in a home with very small children or cats. If you live in the Los Angeles area and would like to meet Juno, please complete our adoption application found on dexterfoundation.com Adoption donation $300",

He is a very special rescue as he overcame severe neglect and health odds to survive. Despite that, he is very sweet and loves humans and dogs. He is crate trained and learning manners. We will be looking for a home with a fenced yard or active adopter because he loves to run around and play. \n\nHe was rescued after being abandoned in Puerto Rico. He was extremely sick and we spent months caring for him medically. He is finally healthy and ready for a special family that will love and adore him. He is available for adoption in Northern Virginia/DC/MD. We currently cannot do home visits in light of Covid-19 risks, so no homes with cats please since we cannot test whether they get along. \n\nPlease apply at www.Project-SecondChance.org. Our adoption fee is $500. Review our adoption procedures on our website BEFORE reaching out to us. Check us out on Facebook or Instagram for more information about our rescues. \n\nFB: @projectsecondchanceforsatos\nIG: project_second_chance\n\nIn lieu of an application fee, this rescue is participating in a support local campaign and asking that you shop at a local business in Alexandria VA to show community support. We believe that helping local small businesses through the pandemic is important. We kindly ask that you attach a receipt for $25 or more spent at: \n\n- The Dog Park, 705 King St, Alexandria, VA 22314. You can also purchase a gift certificate by phone at 703.888.2818. You can also be twice as giving and designate the $25 for the PSC rescue food fund at the store. \n\n- Hops N Shine, 3410 Mt Vernon Ave, Alexandria VA 22305, www.hopsnshine.com\n\n-PSC Etsy Store: https://www.etsy.com/shop/ProjectSecondChance\n\n- Olde Towne School for Dogs, https://www.otsfd.com\n\n- Brut Champagne & Wine Bar, https://www.brutwinebarva.com\n\nWe love our community!

Unfortunately he has not been treated well though you couldn't tell by his happy, bouncy personality. It was discovered that he has more than a few bullets in him which is terribly sad. He will always have a little trouble walking but that doesn't keep him for going! He is house trained and knows commands. He does well with other dogs. We aren't sure about cats. He just needs to be loved as much as he loves people! www.carerescueok.org",

            "description": "**WE ONLY DO HOME VISITS FOR ADOPTIONS NEAR BROWARD & PALM BEACH COUNTIES**\n\nCheck our New Years' baby, Rockwell ChiPoo (Chihuahua Poodle) He is lively and fun. He does take time to accept new people and will bark BUT baby talk works well to soothe him. He is 2 and a half years old and 10 pounds. He may not be totally hypoallergenic so if you have allergies to dogs, he won't be a match. Rockwell needs an adult home that will help him through his initial fear then he will give hugs to ask for attention. He comes around to love within an hour and he does NOT bite except at the vet when he is held down. Rockwell needs more work on socialization with new people. He does bark, so if you are in a high-rise situation where you would be passing people all the time and you are not experienced with how to help him overcome his fears, then Rockwell is not for you. He thinks he is going to be hurt so this may take a while for him to get over his fear. He is loving and cuddly once he trusts you but every new person, Rockwell will go through this fear until he is properly desensitized. You will need to continue with nonaggressive training in order for him to have a peaceful life and not incidents of him getting into danger! He is always following you around and instantly rolls over for belly rubs! He sleeps next to you as you with a subtle smile of appreciation. If you are looking for a little buddy, please check Rockwell! Rockwell's adoption fee is $350 to go towards his vetting (vaccines, spay/neuter, heartworm/Ehrlichia/Lyme test, fecal test, pre-op blood work, dental cleaning, and microchip as well as grooming if needed). If you are interested please fill out the adoption application For additional information regarding our adoption process, please check our FAQ's Page. \n\n *All dogs in the care of Get a Life Pet Rescue live in loving foster homes while waiting for their perfect match. They don't live in cages or crates (unless there is a medical reason to do so.) They are treated as family pets while in our care. * All dogs in our care are fed premium brand holistic food as well as supplements and vitamins specific to each dog's needs. We don't buy inexpensive bulk dry kibble, our rescues are fed premium wet food diets as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation program to ensure maximum health.*All of our rescues receive complete quality vetting including full dental cleaning with pre-op bloodwork, spay/neuter, vaccines, and grooming. Dogs in need of specialized medicine will be seen by specialists, such as full cardiac workups, ophthalmologist visits, all suspicious lumps, and bumps are biopsied, and every medical need is transparent to potential adopters. *Once you adopt from Get a Life Pet Rescue, you become part of our compassionate family and we are here for you if a problem with your precious dog arises.",

            "description": "Perry is a nine month old, 85 pound St. Bernard mix that was turned into an emergency clinic after he was hit by a car. The owner had no money to do the surgery needed to repair his broken leg, so he was surrendered for euthanasia. Luckily the vet on duty did not want to do that and instead gave him pain meds, stabilized him and late into the evening started contacting rescue friends to see if anyone could take him by the time the clinic closed in the morning. It was the week of Thanksgiving and rescue was scarce, so it was ALR or nothing. We emailed x-rays to the surgeon we work with at Northlake at 11:00pm and his responded immediately that he could work him for surgery the next day!\n\nThe vet took him there herself and when the surgery was done, picked him up and has been fostering him. They have dogs, cats and kids and realized quickly that he was not very socialized. She has been taking him to the vet clinic when she works and he has gotten comfortable with people, but still reactive around other dogs. We are waiting for the surgeon to tell us that he can resume normal activities and then we will send him to our boarding facility and try to work him into our pack. A lot of times, reactivity in dogs is due to fear of the unknown. He has not had any experience with other dogs, so to him they are a threat. We just have to teach him that dogs are OK. Bottom line is that we are committed to cover the training that he needs to get over his fears. We are looking for an owner who will partner with us to guide him through this process. He is house trained and crate trained and a wonderful dog with tons of potential. If you would like to foster to adopt Perry, Please go to www.atlantalabrescue.com to fill out an application.",

            "description": "Blackie is a 57 pound, eight (8) year old lab. His name gives away his coat color, but his coat sparkles and shines just like his relaxed personality. Blackie is the epitome of a lab and eager to please. He is the ultimate companion- whatever that may be! He loves keeping you within eyeshot and getting belly rubs while snuggling up for a Netflix marathon. Blackie loves to meet people and other dogs he passes during his walks, but never greets anyone with a bark - only a tail wag! He is great on a leash, doesn't pull or tug, and is house trained! He is quiet in the house and comes immediately when you whistle for him. He such a good boy! If you are intrested in Blackie, please to go www.atlantalabrescue.com and complete an applicaiton.",

We were lucky to get her into a foster that doesnt have another dog and she is the perfect pet otherwise. Very sweet and calm. Housetrained from day one and loves her crate. She is good on a leash and ignores the dogs in their yard that bark at her while on walks. She is a little too interested in the cats next door, so probably a home with no cats or dogs would be best. If that is your set up, you will not find a better dog. If you are interested in adopting Merry, please go to www.atlantalabrescue.com to fill out an application.",

He has completed his heart worm treatment and he is kennel trained so should be easy to transition to an income dog.  He is dog selective so it is required to meet and greet with any other dogs in the home.  \n\nThis dog is being fostered near Jacksonville, AL.   You must be willing to drive part if not all of the way to pick up this dog for adoption unless transportation to another state has been arranged.  Please contact us with any questions. \n\nPlease visit Rockin' P Rescue, Inc. to submit an online adoption application.  www.rockinprescue.org\n\n\nAdoption contributions are as follows: \n* $300.00 for a dog 6 months and under\n* $250.00 for a dog aged 7 months to 1 year \n* $225.00 for a dog over one year",

Fill out an application here to get the ball rolling...\nhttps://pethavenmn.org/adopt/adoptable-dogs/dog-adoption-application/\n\nHere is more about Diesel!\n\nNickname: Deezy\n9-year-old, 60-pound Labrador mix\n\nHouse-Trained: Deezy does great on a schedule and will usually give a verbal cue when he needs to go out. \n\nCrate-Trained: Does well \u2013 no blankets or towels in crate with him. \n\nOther Dogs: Does well with slow introductions and some time to get to know one another. Once he knows the other dog, he is very playful and would do well with a dog with a similar playstyle. Deezy is leash reactive, meaning he is vocal when he sees other dogs and pulls on his leash. \n\nKids and Cats: We were told he did well with kids and cats prior to coming to Pet Haven. Would need slow introduction. \n\nHealth: Deezy's allergies are looking much better and we should know more as time goes on. He would also benefit from a teeth cleaning. He is currently on GI prescribed food but may need to switch depending on allergy findings. He is also currently being treated for Lyme\u2019s disease. \n\nDespite his old dog lumps and bumps (which are nothing to be worried about per his vets) Deezy is an incredibly sweet and loving dog. Vet techs and vets alike mentioned what a good dog he is and how polite and sweet he is! He is a great mix of snuggle bug and energy. He loves getting in a few walks every day, playing with rope toys, taking part in what his family is doing, and playing with his foster sister!\n\nPatience with Deezy is key. That is how he builds his trust. Sweet Deezy came from a home that did not have time or resources for him have kids arrived and he found himself in his kennel more than any dog should have. He was rescued by a family member who intended to keep him forever until unfortunately, they found out they were severely allergic to him. He is now searching for his forever home that will be full of love, patience, routine and stability. \n\nDeezy is a bit of a barker and a vocal dog with whines and grumbles (in the MOST endearing way), and so apartment / shared-wall living is not an option for him. And while he would love a fenced yard for his golden years, it is not required. Deezy has benefitted greatly from slip leash training and this should be continued in his forever home. He is a wonderful, wonderful dog and truly an amazing companion. He deserves a loving home that will take care of him! \n\n\nHis adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm/Lyme test, all age-appropriate vaccinations (distemper, rabies, & Bordetella), HW and flea/tick preventative, and microchip implant and registration. \n\nThere is no guarantee of age and breed as a rescue animal's history is unknown. All ages and breeds are best guess.\n\nAdoption fees INCLUDE a mandatory sales tax of 7.525%.\n\nDue to post-adoption services provided, it is Pet Haven's policy to only place dogs into homes within a 75-mile radius of the Minneapolis, MN city center.\n\n",

He did test positive for Heartworms and he is currently undergoing treatment. He was also underweight and we are working on that too. In spite of all this, he loves people and attention. He is also very smart. He makes great eye-contact and really just wants to please. He will be neutered after his HW treatment is complete. He will need to be on HW preventative the rest of his life too. He would make a great family pet. If you would like to meet him, please contact our shelter at 870-269-5200 or visit him at 17379 Highway 9, Mountain View, Arkansas. You can also go on-line at schspets.org and complete an adoption application.",

He loves to play and then take long naps in the sunniest spot in the house. He does great with his foster brothers and sisters and the 2 resident dogs.\n\nHe did have some hesitation with men when he first arrived in our house but is doing much better now. He seems to be gaining confidence with all men but will show fear every once in a while. Boaz will go in the kennel but it isn't his favorite spot to be.\n\nAbout Me:\n\nI'm Boaz and my favorite thing to do is nap in the softest sunniest spot in the house. I do like the occasional walk outside and a chew toy or bone to entertain me. At night I will sleep through the night in my kennel but I like to be near my humans so they let me sleep in their room.\n\nI can't wait to find a forever home because I have so much love to give.",

He wouldn't make any eye contact with our volunteers and would just shake when they came around. He wouldn't even play with toys. After about 3 weeks of working with Raider, he finally started coming around and enjoying human contact and playing with toys (his bone is his favorite) . Once he learns to trust he loves to snuggle and give kisses. His favorite times of the day are breakfast and dinner. He LOVES his food. Raider would do best in a home as the only pet and without younger children. He has been fully vetted, up to date on all his vaccinations, neutered, and microchipped. The only thing left is finding Raiders forever home. \n\nHis adoption fee is $150.00 which includes being up to date on vaccinations including rabies & bordetella, microchipped, dewormed, on flea/tick preventative and neutered.\nWe are a FOSTER based dog rescue therefore there isn't one central location with open hours to see our available dogs. They are all in loving foster homes enjoying learning how to be a furry family member. If interested we only set up meet and greets AFTER approving adoption applications with interested adopters as to not waste anyone's time.\nAll current/past pets MUST be up kept to date on vaccinations as well as being spayed/neutered to adopt from our rescue.",

I'm looking for a home with no kids, and I must meet any potential furry friends in the household before I go home. I do attend playgroup here at the shelter, but I can be selective with who I get along with. I will benefit from a home who can walk me daily and provide a nice comfy area for me to crash on by the end of the day! I'm an absolute goofball and your world will be filled with laughter when you take me home. I'm also housebroken and love car rides! Ask an adoption counselor to see me today!\n\nGo-GetterWant to get more exercise? Action is my middle name. My 'let's GO!' lifestyle will keep you motivated to get outside and move. I've got tons of energy, and just like the sun, I'm burning and working 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I'll run for miles, chase a ball for hours, and still want to play at the end of the day. \n\n Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: White Weight: 79.2lbs Age: 4yrs 9mths 0wks Animal has been Neutered",

Fill out an application here to get the ball rolling...\nhttps://pethavenmn.org/adopt/adoptable-dogs/dog-adoption-application/\n\nHere is more about Woodrow!\n\nJust under two-years-old (birthdate approx. 4/20/19), 100-pound Great Dane \n\nHouse-Trained: Yes, he will pace and go to the door when he needs to be let out. \n\nCrate-Trained: Yes, but he dislikes it and much prefers to be near people. \n\nOther Dogs: Has been attending doggy daycare and doing great! Has a more playful, puppy-like energy when meeting dogs one-on-one. He does best with medium to large dogs with a mellow and patient personality. \n\nCats: Not Recommended\n\nKids: Woodrow is good with school-age kids and teens. \n\nFenced Yard: A tall fenced yard would be great as he can easily leap over a standard fence, but otherwise he has been doing fine on a tie out when outside. \n\nWoodrow is a sweet and affectionate boy who loves to be around people and thinks that he is a lap dog. When cuddling, he will often lay his head on your chest. Otherwise, he will burrow his head under your arm. He has a magnetic and playful personality and enjoys playing fetch and tug. When playing or looking for attention, he has been known to occasionally jump with people his size but takes correction well. \n\nWoodrow loves to show his smarts and picks up new tricks and commands with ease. Along with continued training, daily exercise, physical and mental, is something he will need. He loves being around people and will lean in to being pet. We are recommending interactions with children under 13 be supervised and that he maintains mellow energy. He is a gentle giant but could accidentally hurt them during play or excitement. \n\nWoodrow would love to find a home where his human(s) are home most of the time and have large breed dog experience. He is a cuddly sweetheart who cannot wait to find his forever home!\n\n\nHis adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm/Lyme test, all age-appropriate vaccinations (distemper, rabies, & Bordetella), HW and flea/tick preventative, and microchip implant and registration. \n\nThere is no guarantee of age and breed as a rescue animal's history is unknown. All ages and breeds are best guess.\n\nAdoption fees INCLUDE a mandatory sales tax of 7.525%.\n\nDue to post-adoption services provided, it is Pet Haven's policy to only place dogs into homes within a 75-mile radius of the Minneapolis, MN city center.\n\n",

Poor thing got bounced around a bit before coming to us; she is unsure about what has happened to her old life.   BJ is shy but has shown she bonds deeply once she knows you.  \n\nOnce she trusts you she LOVES to cuddle with her person and be with them as much as possible.  BJ knows sit and will come when called; she is good on the leash and has a low energy level.  She\u2019d love to have a new family that is home most of the time like her previous senior person was.  She cannot go to a home with kids under 15 as she has never been exposed to them and chaos/loud noises are not her thing.  BJ is house trained, treat motivated and would move the earth for her person.\n\nBJ does not ride well in the car and gets quite anxious and is a flight risk until she is sure about her surroundings.  She will need to be kept on leash at all times when on walks, needs a secure 6\u2019 fenced yard and her new family will need to be careful with her around open doors so she doesn\u2019t spook and take off.\n\nDue to some bad experiences in her past and not getting the opportunity to socialize with other dogs when she was young BJ is picky about other dogs around her and she is not good with small animals; she really needs to be the only animal in the home.   \n\nStart off 2021 with a new best friend. BJ would love to have a new best friend to shower with love.\n\n\n",

            "description": "Dillinger is one big, happy goofball!  Whoever let this bright and bubbly boy go is, quite frankly, a fool.  Dillinger was found as a stray in a rural area who was so happy to be brought to safety.  He's only about 3 years old and was taught some manners in his young life, but no one ever came looking for him.  Dillinger is a little powerhouse!  He sits and lays down when asked, and takes treats very gently, but he can use a bit of leash-training.  He tries to restrain his excitement while out for a walk but he's just too darn happy!  Dillinger loves checking things out, running and playing, and meeting new friends.  He whines for attention like a little puppy and just loves people, but he'll need a home with older kids because he could inadvertently knock a small child over while playing.  Dillinger seems to like larger dogs but needs a home with no small dogs or cats.  He'll keep you laughing and bring you lots of happiness if you give him a chance!  File#29908  12/5/20\nCall 609-693-1900 or email:  office@ahsppz.org to meet Dillinger.\n<p>\nIf interested please visit our Forked River Shelter. We are open Mon. - Fri. from \n12:00 P. M. - 6:00 P. M.; and Sat. & Sun. 12:00 P. M. - 5:00 P. M. for directions call 609-693-1900. There is an adoption donation required. The society cannot accept personal checks but we do accept Visa, MC, AE, Discover and cash. As part of our adoption process, we must have proof of residency. Homeowners must show proof of ownership; landlord approval is required for renters before an adoption can be approved.And as always we thank you for your kindness in opening your heart & home to a Society orphan.",

He can be wary of strangers at first but he quickly warms up to you once he realizes you are a friend and not a foe. He'll let you know he likes you by leaning into your hand for pets. If a lap or leg is available then he will snuggle up against that. He will also give you a couple kisses if you ask him to. Moki is also a great guard dog! He will alert you to new sounds outside or inside the house. His mortal enemy is the roomba and the blender is a close second. He barks appropriately and only does so to warn you of any impending danger! Once the threat is eliminated he is a pretty chill guy. He spends most of his day sleeping on or near his favorite person. Currently he lives with 4 larger dogs and does great with all of their varying personalities. He tolerates his playful Husky sister, and leaves the grouchy and shy dogs alone. In his mind however he is the boss and size doesn't matter. He likes to be where the action is and his need for affection and attention takes precedence! He is a smart guy! He quickly learned the dog door and is house-trained. We do not know how he would behave around cats or children.",

He and his siblings were born into a home that turned them loose on their property and did not provide much human interaction.   They came to us nearly feral and with time and patience,  Rusty has come around and is ready for adoption into a home of his own.  Rusty would do best in a home without young kids, he is not aggressive in any way but would be scared of their fast moving and louder noises.  A quiet home with another more confident dog would be ideal for him.  He is extremely loving and walks up to us now to nudge his muzzle into our hands for some attention. \nRusty is crate trained and working on house training.",

            "description": "Back in the 80's, we loved the sitcom \"Cheers\". If you haven't heard of it, Google it and we would like to introduce you to our version of the character, Norm. Now, the looks are not even similar if you squint, but every time Norm entered the bar in the show, folks with erupt in a wave of hoots and yells. THAT is why our Norm is Norm. Your house will never be the same with Norm in it and every time a friend comes by, they will be unable to resist shouting \"Norm!\" and waiting to receive the hug and kisses that will always come in tow with this sweet and amazing and hilarious boy! Norm is about the cutest, wiggliest, funniest and biggest ham of a little Pittie boy who is about a year or so old and weighs aorund 40 lbs full grown. He is a face that cannot be described in words and an energy that is simply contagious. Norm cannot wait to find his own family who will love going lots of places and doing lots of things. He is big energy in a small package and would do best as a solo dog. He is quite the athlete and could likely keep up with anything you throw his way. Norm loves to do and play and is likely to be a best Velcro buddy with the face every mother could love. He is a good boy in his crate and likes to use the outside facilities. When your friends start calling and showing up at the door for visits more frequently, rest assured, they too have fallen in love with Norm as much as you have. Run, not walk, to meet this package of yum!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

            "description": "Ruthie is a very special lady to all of us here at Prairie Paws. She came in as a stray so we don't know much about the first 11 years of her life, but as we've gotten to know her in her 12th year, she has shown us that she is willing to learn a new way of life and gives thanks by showering you with kisses! 12 may sound like a big number, to Ruthie it's not about years under her belt but life experiences that's she's learned along the way, like how to walk well on a leash, and how to make someone fall in love with her, and how to use those big beautiful eyes to sucker you into giving her all the treats! When interacting with her, you wouldn't be able to tell that's she's a day over 2 because she's still just as playful as a puppy and just as eager to love you. She is hard of hearing, but the good news is you never have to worry about calling her to you, she's what we call a velcro dog- meaning she'll never leave your side, ESPECIALLY if you have some tasty treats. You know what they say, you lose one of your senses, and the others grow stronger. That's especially true for her, she can sniff out a treat from a mile away! Lately we've noticed that Ruthie has been sniffing around a lot, we think she's sniffing out her new family. Give us a call so we can set up a time for you to meet Ruthie and find out if you're the family she's been sniffing around for!",

Our phone number is 618-665-3005. The shelter is open to the public 1-3 Monday-Saturday. Sundays we are open 1-4 to the public. If those times don't work, please call to set up a time to visit.\n\nThe typical adoption fee for dogs is $150. It includes vaccination, deworming , spay/neuter, heartworm testing on dogs of age and microchipping, which is now mandatory by state law. Some dogs we discount to as little as $50 due to sponsorship. Some dogs we ask a higher adoption fee, which helps us recoup expenses on heartworm treatment on other dogs.\n\nAll cats are spayed/neutered/vaccinated/flea treated/dewormed and microchipped prior to adoption. Cat adoption fees range from $60-$100. We spay/neuter/microchip/vaccinate and deworm all kittens and cats, prior to adoption. Our shyer/less adoptable cats are classed as \"barn cats\" and are free with a completed/approved barn cat application, which can be found on our website.\n\nFor updates on adoption events and more pics of pets available, go to our website, www.claycountyshelter.com or look for us on Facebook.",

He can be vocal when he spots a new person from his crate or the yard though and has a very big bark. He isn't sure about visitors and requires guidance on how he is supposed to greet new people. Gizmo has been quick to warm up to everyone he has met and once he knows someone he is always happy to see them again. Gizmo is learning to ask for affection and really loves having one on one pets and cuddling. He can be more reserved if there are other dogs around getting attention as he generally defers to them. Gizmo has a very sweet, kind demeanor when he is comfortable and is a very loving boy. Gizmo can be a rambunctious and rowdy boy though and enjoys playing with people he knows. He is still learning he can't jump on people to initiate play. Gizmo has not been around any children at this time.\n\nGizmo was surrendered with another dog and is currently living with other dogs without concern. He can be a rowdy boy but generally defers to whatever the other dogs are doing inside or in the yard. He is not a confident boy and prefers to be a follower if that is an option. Gizmo likes to romp with the other dogs in the yard but if no one is playing he will also entertain himself. Gizmo has been around dogs 35 + lbs and has NOT been tested with cats.\n\nGizmo is a sweet country dog that is looking for a home that will teach him how to be part of the family.

            "description": "Macadamia is a beautiful Sable German Shepherd estimated around 2 years of age. Macadamia was found as a stray therefore we do not know his history or background prior to arriving at the shelter.\n\nMacadamia is a smart, goofy young guy who is still learning how to navigate the world and what is expected of him. Macadamia can be vocal meeting new people especially when he is behind a barrier - crate, fence, etc. He has done well when properly introduced on leash and is learning how to make new friends. Once Macadamia knows someone he shows himself to be a playful and rambunctious boy who wants to be in the middle of whatever the people are doing. Macadamia is absolutely obsessed with chasing the water hose and is slowly figuring out actual toys. Macadamia has not been introduced to any children and is not currently recommended for a home with kids under 13. Macadamia is a loving and close bonding boy who is going to require a home committed to his ongoing training and socialization.\n\nMacadamia does live with other Shepherds currently but is heavily supervised in his interactions. He is not sure if he wants to make dog friends and he lacks any semblance of good social behavior with other dogs. Macadamia has been able to acclimate to sharing the yard with one other large, young Shepherd however he has had some scuffles. He is currently best suited as an only dog but it is absolutely critical he receive socialization with other dogs to help him overcome his behavior. Macadamia is NOT cat friendly.\n\nMacadamia is a young Shepherd that is looking for guidance, patience, and structure in a home that will help him learn what is expected of him.

            "description": "Meet Hank!! Hank is a six year old male Rottweiler mix who weighs around 50 pounds. He is fully vetted and ready for his forever home.\n\nHank is a friendly dog looking for a home that will allow him to shine. Hank had a sad past, but is looking to put it behind him. He prefers a home where he is the only dog so that he can receive all of the love. Hank is currently in a home that does not have children or cats so we do know how is with either.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Hank please submit an inquiry directly with Greater Charlotte SPCA by visiting charlottespca.org/adopt.\n\n***Because our rescue is composed entirely of volunteers and we require a home check for each of our adoptable pets prior to them going to their new homes, local applications will take precedence. We will accept out of town applications, but any family further than 60 miles from Charlotte is responsible for finding a representative of a rescue local to them that is willing to perform the home check. All out of town applicants will also have to be willing to drive to Charlotte to meet/pick up the pet as soon as the application is approved.***",

I do okay with medium sized female dogs. To see more animals for adoption, please visit the CARA Website\n\nOur adoption fees are:\nDogs: $155\nCats: $95\nPuppies under 4 months: $115 plus S/N Deposit: $100\nKittens under 4 months: $70 plus S/N Deposit: $100\n\nAll pets available for adoption have been spayed or neutered (unless under 4 months please read about our adoptions\nhere\n), are current on vaccinations and preventatives, and micro-chipped.

He was passed around between 4 friends who didn't really give him the time of day. The fourth person put him on a balcony and left him there for two months in the Los Angeles summer heat.  Dobby has now been with us for a couple of months and he has already come very far.  He loves to sit on the couch and snuggle and he loves to play with the other dogs.  However, Dobby can still be unsure of somethings and takes time to warm up.  He is not yet potty trained but we are working on it. Dobby needs to go to a home with another dog and would probably be fine with cats.  However, he should not be in a home with children because their movement are too much for him.  He is fully vaccinated, microchipped, and neutered.",

            "description": "Funk is a handsome German Shepherd estimated around 4 years of age. Funk was a stray therefore we do not know his history prior to arriving at the shelter.\n\nFunk is a big boy with a pretty goofy personality once you get to know him. Funk has done well meeting new people in his foster home however he can be more cautious meeting people while out and about. He does not appreciate being rushed and is not the sort of dog you run right up to and start petting. He appreciates having a chance to check out new people first and then deciding to ask for attention or not. Funk can be a big teddy bear with those he knows and has a very sweet personality once he warms up to someone. He is still a playful, energetic boy though and loves to romp in the yard. Funk is eager to please and thrives with clear guidance. Funk has not been around any children at this time and is currently not recommended for a home with children under 13 years of age.\n\nFunk lives with other German Shepherds in his foster home and does great. He loves to play chase games and romp with the younger Shepherds in the yard. He does well minding his manners and respecting the boundaries other dogs. He seems comfortable navigating a variety of ages and personalities from inappropriately playful young Shepherds to grumpy seniors. Funk has not been around any dogs smaller than 35 - 40 lbs at this time and would not be recommended for a home with smaller dogs.\n\nFunk is a beautiful guy who is looking for a home that will give him some guidance and love as he figures out where he fits in. If you're the home for Funk please email Tierhavenrescue@gmail.com for an adoption application or visit Tierhaven.rescuegroups.org for FAQs",

She is still growing so she will need a home looking for an XL dog with a personality just as big! She is very sweet, fantastic with other dogs, good with cats (she is pretty scared of them!). She is VERY strong and will need a physically active home that has the time and energy to put into her training. She is an incredibly sweet dog and LOVES people, though she will absolutely knock down small children in play. She is such a wonderful dog with a great brain and SO MUCH LOVE to give to her new people that we are sure she will be scooped up in no time! Her adoption fee is $295 and that includes she is spayed, microchipped, and up to date on all vaccines, flea/tick treatments, and heartworm preventative. If you are interested in adopting any of our animals please fill out an application on our website www.lastchanceranch.org Primary Color: Brown Secondary Color: White Age: 0yrs 10mths 0wks",

He has a medium energy level but does get the \"zoomies\".\n\nGaloot wants to be an only dog.  He is good in the house, tolerant of children, and rides well in the car. He knows how to sit, shake, lay, and up. Galoot is learning manners on the leash like \"no pulling\" and takes corrections well. \n\nThis young big boy is fixed, UTD on shots, and has current rabies. He is being fostered in Ramah, NM.\n\nIf you would like to meet the Big Galoot or have questions please contact Susan Mayne at elmorromaynes@gmail.com",

Please go to our website, complete an online application (if you haven't already) and indicate which animal(s) you are interested in. Once approved, you will be contacted to schedule an adoption appointment. Kindly call the shelter if you have any questions at 609-309-5214.\n\nBrody was a transfer from the Trenton Animal Shelter, but now is a resident at SAVE. Brody has got all the staff and volunteers making googly eyes at him. In addition to being stunningly handsome, Brody is a smart, young, joyful, and high energy guy that knows basic commands like 'sit', 'stay', and 'no'. He would benefit from an active household where he will be kept busy with tons of enrichment and playtime. He does well with other dogs and even had a play date with Matilda. Since Brody is so energetic, children under the age of 12 would not be recommended due to his size and high level of energy. If Brody is your kind of dog, please make an appointment to come see this stunning young dog.\n\n\n\n Primary Color: Brindle Secondary Color: White Weight: 67lbs Age: 1yrs 1mths 0wks Animal has been Neutered",

He enjoys chasing after a bouncy tennis ball and particularly likes getting his neck scratched. Toad is looking for a home where he can be the only pet, and would do best with children over 10.",

            "description": "Belle Waselle is an approximately 3 year old female beagle that weighs \n34 pounds.  Belle is an all around sweet girl with personality galore.  She loves to romp with her foster brothers and sisters. Belle can be mischievous in the sweetest way possible but can also enjoy a good nap next to you or entertain herself with a toy or bone. She has enjoyed playing in the snow and going for walks. Belle's fosters are working on her house manners and she is learning fast.  She isn't a huge fan of the crate but is coming around learning that it is an okay place to be.  She is house broken and is very open to training.\nBelle Wasale is a bit skittish around loud noises and is cautious in new environments but she recovers nicely and quickly. Belle is always ready for ear scratching, pets and \"Good, good Girl\". \n\nBelle Waselle is up to date on shots and preventatives and is microchipped.    Her adoption fee is $250 plus any additional donation you feel appropriate.  Our adoption fee is set to a level to make adoptions happen.  They do not cover our costs. Thank you for your generosity and interest in our dogs!   \n\nAll dogs adopted locally through SGDR receive a free six-week session of obedience classes and a lifetime of behavior support through our Project REWARD program with trainer Charlotte Blake.\n\nYou must have an approved application before being able to visit a dog.

Please visit our website to learn more about our adoption process at newhoperescue.org. \n\nThis dog is being fostered with New Hope Dog Rescue (Saskatoon).  If you are interested in adopting please fill out an Adoption Application. Meet and greets are by appointment only and done so after an adoption application has been submitted. A successful applications will be contacted by the foster home to discuss further. We are volunteer run so please be patient.\n\nVallee is my name, I was born on November 11, 2020. I\u2019m a happy pup with a smaller mom but my future size is unknown as I\u2019m a mixed breed pup. \n\nI\u2019m working hard on life expectations with a foster home who is getting me on the right track learning all things puppies need to learn. My new family will need to keep it up \u00a0so I can perfect what I\u2019m learning. I am doing well with house training, although I do need to be taken out on a regular basis. \n\nMy favorite thing in life is to climb on my foster parents all the way up to their face and get snuggles. Anyone who will hold me and love me I adore. I like little kids around but really do enjoy my adult cuddles and being around people. I am learning right and wrong from my two foster siblings and they are fun to be around. I think it would be great to have a dog sibling in my new home. I can\u2019t wait to meet you, if you would welcome me into your arms I will be a loyal friend. I am fully vet checked, first shots, and microchipped.\u00a0\n\nVallee has been microchipped, dewormed, current on age appropriate vaccines and has received a health check from a vet. adoption fee is $495 (200 is refunded upon proof of spay).\n\nTo view more dogs go to http://www.newhoperescue.org/adopt/available-dogs/\n\nDisclaimer: in most cases we are guessing the breed mix. These are best guesses on our part. For puppies it can be extremely difficult and we are also guessing on what size they will be. \n\nNEW HOPE DOG RESCUE is not a shelter. Our dogs are placed in loving foster homes. WE NEED FOSTER HOMES TO HELP MORE DOGS - CONTACT US TODAY!!!\nDefinitions:\nPending - means that we are working through the adoption process with the 1st applicant. We usually don't add the pending until we are pretty sure the adoption will go through (like at the home visit stage)\nAdopted - you know!! A happy ending for a homeless dog.",

            "description": "Evie, is a beautiful, loving, people-oriented, girl looking for a family who will make her the center of attention!  We believe her breed to be a Black Lab \u2013 Boxer Mix.  She weighs about 65 lbs,  is about 3 years old, is very well behaved (we sent her through a structured training program with a professional trainer),  and is an overall sweet, amazing,  girl. \n \nEvie loves being with people and will follow you wherever you go;  she is not fond of being left alone.  She listens very well, is professionally trained, and aims to please.  She loves to play tug of war and ball, retrieving a tennis ball when thrown.  However she will tear apart soft toys (probably to get the squeaker out\u2026as dogs often do!!).  Evie also greatly enjoys going for long walks. And, walks very well on leash.\n \nWe feel Evie will excel in a home in which someone is home most of the time (including during non-COVID times), a family absolutely committed to providing her the love and attention she deserves.\n \nAn ideal home for Evie is one with solid dog experience, particular with larger breed dogs. Another calm but playful dog might be good for Evie,  but she would do very well as an only dog.  Evie would love a secure fenced yard to run and play, and definitely a comfy chair to cuddle and nap.\n \nWe feel Evie would do best with children over the age of 10 simply due to her size and playfulness!\n \nBAARK Dog Rescue is based in Barrington, Illinois, and adopts only locally, that is, within 25 miles of our location. If you are interested in applying for adopt Evie, please contact  BAARKDogRescue@gmail.com or 847-852-0895 for an application\n",

Pongo was very nervous when he first came to our shelter, with positive reinforcement training he has started to trust people more and enjoy being handled. We recommend that you look up certified dog trainers at: www.ccpdt.org before meeting him so that you and him can continue working together on his positive reinforcement training. Pongo is sweet, silly, and fun. He loves balls and running through the grass. We think that with a patient and loving family, Pongo's personality will shine and he will be a wonderful companion. Pongo is neutered, microchipped, negative for heartworm, and started on vaccines and flea/tick prevention. Please reach out to our Director of Animal Behavior to discuss Pongo's behavior more and set up an appointment to meet him: behavior@bcspca.org or 215-794-7425 x113",

It\u2019s hard to go through treatment for that at the shelter, so I was lucky to come here with a few dogs! I successfully completed my treatment and am finally ready to find a forever home! I am a sweet, happy guy that gets along with people, dogs and even cats!  I am stunning with my bright eyes and shiny coat, and can totally rock a coat or jammies. I am active and now that I can get outside, I really like to! Toys and bones are awesome too! I used to get very nervous in the crate, but I am getting better and better now that I can get a little more exercise.

            "description": "Rosie is an 8 year old basset/border collie/shepherd mix, to the best of our knowledge. She was reluctantly given up by her family, when they had to move.  If you are looking for that special someone that is house trained, crate trained, loves to go for walks, and does well with both baths and nail trims (once she gets used to you), then Rosie is your gal!  Rosie only uses her crate to take a nap in now, at her foster home. She does well with submissive older dogs. She is good with cats and kids that are dog savvy. Rosie does prefer to dine alone. Rosie is not a huge fan of car rides. Rosie will need another calm dog that respects her space in her forever home as well as a physically fenced in yard for her adoption requirements.  She is being fostered in Parish, NY with cats and dogs. Her adoption fee is $200. \n\nIf you would like to be considered for adoption, please submit an application: https://nybasset.org/basset-hound-for-adoption/adoption-application/\n\n\nPlease consider making a donation towards our veterinary expenses: https://nybasset.org/make-a-donation/\n\nAll basset hound/dogs are up to date on vaccinations, altered, and placed on heart worm preventative prior to being adopted.\n\n*Our P.O. Box is located in Buffalo. Our fosters are located throughout NY State.\n\nTo donate toward his/her care, to apply for adoption, or to see other homeless bassets in need please go to http://nybasset.org/\n\nThe first step in the adoption process is to fill out an adoption application which can be found at the above website listed at the top of the page under adoptions.\n\nABC Basset Hound Rescue is in need of foster homes in NY state. We use foster homes throughout the state of New York. To apply, please go to https://nybasset.org/foster/\n\nThank you for your interest in adopting a basset hound.",

We will, however, be limiting the number of persons in the kennel area at one time, and we appreciate your patience.\n\nVisits with cats and/or critters still require that an appointment be made in advance. To schedule your appointment, please call us at (703) 792-6465, or email us at animalshelter@pwcgov.org.\n\nAll persons will be required to wear a face mask when visiting the PWC Animal Shelter.

We think his peripheral vision isn't good. Zeb loves kids, he just doesn't like to be disturbed when he's sleeping or startled,  so that's why we say no kids. Zeb loves leash walks and car rides. He does better with women than men. He was in a home for a few months but he would growl when they'd wake him up to go to bed in another room and his dad liked to play with the ball with him inside at night and when he tried to take the ball from him Zeb bit him so he was returned.  He's an old guy that just doesn't want to be played with like that.",

Once we meet (I just need a few dates! and lots of treats) I warm up quickly then enjoy pets and attention and sitting for treats. I've even been known to roll over for belly rubs now from my favorite staff and volunteers!  I love long walks and I walk really well with this new harness I have, and I do all my business when I'm on a walk.  I need an adult only family that can help teach me that life is safe. In return, I'll play with you, learn new things from you, and be the most attentive dog on the block (not to mention the most HANDSOME, I don't mean to be immodest but have you seen my pics!!!).\n\nIf you are an adult only family who has the time and patience to work through my fears, I'd love to meet you. Our behavior manager would happily answer any questions you may have.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting any of our adoptable dogs, please fill out an application. To apply, please visit our web site: https://www.mlar.org/adoption-overview \n\nE-mails regarding adoption are not considered an application. \n\nOut-of-state applicants (outside of PA/NJ/DE) will not be considered, unless there are special circumstances.

            "description": "Zion is a shy, sweet boy! He is around 1 year old and looks to be a possibly a Shepherd and Collie mix. He is a little shy compared to his siblings and mama Wisdom, but warms up with time. Zion will need a home with another dog sibling to keep him company and learn from. He gets along great with the two dogs he is fostered with and after watching them interact with people, is slowly opening up and seeking out affection and cuddle time from his people. Zion has a lot of energy and loves to do zooms around the yard. He would be most comfortable in a home with a yard and an active family that can work his young dog energy out. He is still working on house training and crate training in his foster home. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting Zion, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue.

Im said to be a huskador (husky and lab mix), but I have the coolest colors of my pack. My birthday is 10/1/20 and I'm growing fast! I love to play but I really love to snuggle too. My foster mom says I am super smart too! I know how to sit and I go right in my kennel at night but I do like getting a treat for it. And I haven't had one accident in my kennel! There have just been a couple of times in the house but that's when my foster people don't get to the door fast enough but I'm learning! And I live in harmony with the other dogs and cats in the house! Applications can be found at www.carerescueok.org! Adoption area is 20 miles from Tulsa, OK",

            "description": "This pretty lady is Sable, and she is a very timid but very, very sweet girl! She weighs about 25lbs, is 1-2 years old, and while we dont necessarily know her breed mix...she likes to curl up into a little ball resembling a fawn when she sleeps. Sable will do best in an all-female home. She was previously in a home with males (it doesnt matter if its adults or children), and she didnt really begin to thrive until she moved to a foster with no males in the household. In addition, a quiet home with little traffic/visitors, and minimal household members would be best. Sable gets stressed when there is a lot of commotion, so would also need a home with either no kids or older kids (15+). She does take some time to adjust, but once she settles in she really loves sitting on/next to a warm lap every chance she gets! And Sable LOVES sleeping! She can nap, nap, and nap some more! She also likes having a spot on the couch or bed where she can retreat to if she needs to feel safe/secure. Sable loves making a nest out of blankets, especially fleece ones. She loves kongs (filled with peanut butter, of course!), bully sticks, and any kind of treat! She is still learning how fun balls and toys can be, but we are confident shell learn in her own timing. She really enjoys car rides, and she doesn't mind baths! She does great on walks and walking on-leash, but if you have to miss a day of walking she really doesnt mind. She'll just nap a little extra that day! Sable will need another doggie friend in her forever home to help her confidence + show her the ropes, but she really prefers other mellow dogs. Hyper dogs can freak her out/confuse her, and she tends to bark at them. She also alerts her foster family when there are any visitors, as they do make her nervous (when the mail comes, someone gets close to the fence, walks by, etc.). Sable can jump very high, so a 6ft(+) fence will be required in her forever home. When it comes to potty-training, Sable won't ask to go outside so potty breaks do need to be offered to her. She does great with a good, consistent routine established by her people. We know that Sable needs a very special home, but if you give her just a few weeks of bonding time she will definitely open up and begin to show her sweet, cuddly side more and more. She just needs a patient mama/BFF/sidekick and a low-key home. She is SO incredibly sweet and has so much love to offer. Lets find Sable the forever she deserves! \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Sable, please submit a general adoption application at https://newleashdogrescue.com (or private message us if you are already preapproved!). \n\n**Sables $200 adoption fee includes her spay, vaccinations, heartworm test, and microchip.",

It's her way of greeting every time she hears or sees her human friends, and if she's near a wall, you'll hear thump, thump, thump. This loving, gentle girl has been getting along well with her Great Dane dog buddy in her foster home. She also loves playing with her toys, both soft or hard ones. She has a neurological issue in her hind end that interferes with her ability to walk well, so she can walk nicely on her leash, but only slowly. As a house-trained girl, she can free roam in the house, and has done well when home alone. And she answers to 'uh uh if asked to back off from any activity. Pepper Anne just hopes for lots of love in a very low-energy home. Come meet her and she'll wag and wag to greet you. Follow her on Instagram: celenas_fosters.",

He loves to be petted, and if you stop petting him, he'll gently remind you with a paw on your hand. He also loves to nap at your feet or in his bed - his favorite place in the whole world. Chewy loves a nice walk and he's very eager to meet every dog he sees, happy to calmly sniff them. At home, he is mostly content hanging out on the couch watching Netflix with you, although he's been a big help with the yard work (sleeping on all the tools)! He would love a doggie housemate, and should be great with kids. But he is a bit too eager to meet and chase a cat, so should do best in a cat-free home. His incredibly gentle demeanor and kind, calm disposition will win you right over. He is a breeze to have in the house. He rarely ever barks, is great on walks, and is a perfect angel sleeping on the couch and free roaming at night and while his fosters are away. It would take a lot to bother this easy going guy! If you're looking for a shorty to snuggle with or an empath and a confidante to share your worries with, give Chewy a visit - he may be your perfect match!",

He arrived in Minnesota on January 2nd. He is a strong, beautiful, sweet baby looking for a forever home. He loves kids. It took him about a week to be comfortable playing with our dog. It took him about a week to be quiet and comfortable in his crate. He hasn't had any accidents in the house, enjoys car rides, likes to go for walks and is doing great on a leash now that we have a harness that fits him. Emmitt loves cheese, belly rubs and chasing a ball in the snow.\nIf you are willing to give Emmitt the time he needs to settle in and you think Emmitt is the sidekick you are looking for, apply at tailsrescue.org to meet him.\n\nI am ready to find my new forever home.\nPrior to adoption I will be altered, vaccinated, health checked, dewormed, and micro-chipped.\n\nAdoption Fee $500 +taxes/fees\n\nIf you would like to meet me please fill out a pre-adoption application at www.tailsrescue.org\n\nHappy Tails Adoption Center is open on Sundays from 12-5pm. We are located at 7940 University Ave NE, Fridley. Dogs are at events based on the availability of their foster family. Please fill out a pre-adoption application so we know you are interested in meeting/adopting one of our animals. The breeds of our dogs and cats are a 'best guess.' We often do not know what mix they are and have to base it on what we think they look like, and base it on breeds often found in the area they came from. Most of our dogs who have gotten DNA tests done are 4-10 breeds mixed together. Because their breed mix is a guess we cannot guarantee a 'full grown size' of many of our younger animals.Interested in adopting me? Click here to fill out an application!Happy Tails Rescue Minnesota is located at 7940 University Ave NE, Fridley MN 55432. We are open for adoption events from 12-5 every Sunday. If there is a certain animal you want to meet at one the events please fill out a preadoption application to directly contact their foster family or check our Facebook page to see if they will be there! Their event attendance is based on the availability of their foster family.\nHome visits (video tours or in person) are required for all dog adoptions. All of our cats and dogs are INDOOR pets and are NOT to be left outside unattended (even in a fenced yard), or running loose!",

He is doing very well considering he spent his life inside only and have never been outside. He had never walked on a leash. Shiloh has been busy acclimating to life in his foster home.  Look at him now, he goes for walks on a leash, goes potty outside, cat and dog friendly. Shiloh has made wonderful progress\u00a0and will be a very loving and sweet addition to a lucky family.\u00a0But he is still learning to trust humans and can be jumpy around fast moving people, particularly small kids. He will need a stay-at-home person (even after the pandemic) and is not suitable for apartment living. Shiloh is in search of an adult home that will continue to show him all the wonderful things the world has to offer. He is 1\u00bd years old and weighs 9 lbs. \n\nPlease contact Patricia olveiry@yahoo.com or complete our application on our website, 1LuckyDogRescue.org.",

            "description": "Hi everybody! I am Ginger and I am glad you came to meet me. I am a female short hair collie mix that is about 3 years old and I weigh about 60 pounds. You might have seen my story of how I was listed to be euthanized at a shelter until Purple Power Animal Welfare Society (Purple PAWS) stepped in and rescued me. I am the famous momma that delivered 11 puppies in the car while I was traveling from Oklahoma to Kansas.\nI am very friendly and the thing I want the most is to be with my people. I absolutely love being by your side and getting pet, and belly rubs. I am house trained and do not have accidents as long as you take me outside every few hours. I will come and ask to go out when I need to go. I have had the run of the house since I came to live with my foster family and I have never been destructive while at my foster home.\nI have never met a person that I do not like. I get along well with other dogs if they do not growl at me and I like to play tug-o-war with them (and you). I might need a slow introduction to become friends with another dog. I am living with cats now and we get along well (I mostly just ignore them). I do NOT get along with the chickens. I am learning to walk on a leash and am getting good at not pulling (unless I find a smell that needs investigated). I know \u201csit\u201d, \u201cgo potty\u201d, \u201cgo to the house\u201d, \u201ccome\u201d, and \u201cstay\u201d. I will bark when someone comes to our house but once I meet them, they are my good friends.\nI am an active girl and need lots of exercise. I really need a farm or large fenced yard where I can run and play. I would not do well in an apartment or home without a fenced yard. I like to play with a dog friend but I would also do well as an only dog. I would be a great jogging partner.\nI am a healthy girl and I am up to date on all of my vaccinations and I am ready to find my furever family to love. If you think I might be the girl of your dreams you can apply to adopt me at purple-paws.org.\n The adoption fee is $200 and that helps pay for my vaccinations, spay, and other expenses.\n\n\n",

Oh that face, is so perfect and handsome! \nAre you looking for the perfect companion? Look no further, Obi is the dog for you. Obi is about 6 years old, weighs 63lbs, and is crate trained and house trained.\nObi is a medium energy dog with decent manners.\nObi has done well with older kids in one of his foster homes. \n\nHe is always right by one of his foster human's side and is happy cuddling with his people or going for hikes/walks.\n\nWe'd recommend Obi have a home without other dogs to start. He gets along with some dogs but had an incident with a Chihuahua who came barreling into his yard uninvited. (Chi was OK. Obi was not happy.)\n\nHe is neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped. He's housebroken too! \nObi is looking for his furrever family to spoil with lots of kisses and cuddles. \n\nApply at www.luckylabrescue.com",

More information on me coming soon!\n\nAnimal Rescue of the Rockies believes that every pet should find a wonderful, caring home. To ensure each pet finds the best possible home, we ask that you fill out our Adoption Application so we can learn more about you and your household.

Our adoption fee covers the following:\n\n- Spay/Neuter, Microchip\n\n- DAPP vaccinations as age appropriate for dog - adopter shall be responsible for all DAPP boosters after adoption.\n\n- Rabies vaccinations as age appropriate for dog - adopter shall be responsible for any rabies vaccinations after adoption.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out an adoption application by clicking here . We want our pets to go to a lifelong new home, so thank you for your patience during the adoption process!\n\nPlease email ARRColorado@gmail.com for more information, as we can not accept calls at this time.

He is a happy, friendly, obedient boy with medium energy and good leash manners (he walks nicely on the leash and likes to stay next to his person). He was the longest resident at a rural GA shelter when a BarkVille volunteer saw him and offered to foster him so BarkVille could save him.  When Pete first left the shelter he was frightened of everybody & everything, would not walk on a leash, and had to be picked up to go outside.  He has come a LONG WAY since then, but is still scared of brooms, mops, rakes and will cower if you raise your hand.  He has been working daily with his foster family to overcome his fears and although he is still a little timid and shy with new people, he loves to give hugs, go for car rides, run around outside, and play with all the other dogs in his foster home. He is looking for a home with a fenced yard where he can play outside with his people and his dog friends.  He is housebroken, crate trained, neutered, fully vaccinated & microchipped.  He was HW+ when he came to BarkVille and is currently available for a foster to adopt situation until his HW treatment is complete and he is medically cleared for adoption. If you are not familiar with Heartworm disease, dogs get it from mosquitos and it is not contagious. It is easily prevented & highly treatable, but requires extended rest during treatment.  \n\nFor more information about Pete, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org. If you would like to adopt this sweet boy, please submit an application for him at https://www.barkvilledogrescue.org/applications",

            "description": "We all need a little HOPE for 2021, how about a lot of HOPE??!!!\n\nMy name is HOPE and found myself abandoned at an empty field house at a local school that is no longer in service. A kind lady saw me and started feeding me for a few days.  I quickly bonded and wanted to follow her car home each day and this was a concern of hers, as I was probably safer there at the field house. \n\nOn News Years Day 2021 while feeding me, a neighbor happened to see her doing this and stopped to ask a few questions. As luck would have it this neighbor just happened to have the number to a volunteer with BFF Pet Adoptions. One phone call and my 2021 is off to pretty darn good start!!\n\nI was taken into rescue and give the spa treatment, a much needed bath, flea prevention, my ears were cleaned and I now have a warm safe place to sleep and a full tummy in the care of BFF. \n\nI am up to date on my vaccines, have been spay, microchipped and am heartworm negative and on monthly preventative. My adoption fee is $175.00.\n\nI am a large girl, born round April 2020, so most likely will have some more growing to do. I weigh about 66 lbs, so just saying if size is an issue, WE ARE NOT A MATCH!!\n\nI am very sweet and very smart, I do pretty good with the \"sit\" command, I know down(as in laying flat on floor), leash walking is a work in progress, but I do fairly well at that if guided and know what is expected of me. I like to jump up on people, but when told \"no\", I usually retreat. I am strong willed and I need and desire training. I need a family that will give me regular exercise and be patient and committed to me for the rest of my life. This training is how I will bond with my people. \n\nI am am a leaner, typical of the hound, meaning I want to be close and will lean up against you when possible. I want to be close to you. Coonhounds are happy to lay around and chill, but also can be rambunctious without regular exercise. Heelers are, as a rule, HIGH ENERGY, they are a working breed and need a job and form strong bonds and can become possessive.\n\nMy ideal home would be one with a committed family, older children, a large fenced area and some activity to help work off energy. I do love the water, so a pool would be a plus. \n\nPLEASE DO YOUR HOMEWORK ABOUT THE BREED OR BREEDS BEFORE YOU ADOPT A PET. The fewer surprises the better FOR ALL!!\n\nIf you think we may be a match, there is an application process that doesn't lock you in to adopt, it just gets the process started. There is also a home visit required and that can be done, location is not an issue.\n\nPLEASE REMEMBER WHEN ADOPTING A PET, IT CAN BE A 15++ YEAR COMMITMENT. ADOPT RESPONSIBLY!!!!\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "If posted, Andy is still available. Please read entire post and apply if seriously interested and you can meet his needs. Andy needs a savvy owner who enjoys training and working with a smart partner. \n\nName: Andy\nAge: 2 year old\nGender: Male\nBreed: Aussie mix\nWeight: 45 lbs\n\nAndy is a good looking teenager who has had a few homes already. He will need an experienced owner willing to work him so that he can learn good doggie manners and become a balanced boy. Andy can be reactive to new people and some dogs. He loves to train, play with his toys, go for walks/car rides, and chew on his treats. He is still a teenager who needs lots of exercise and training. Andy has displayed separation anxiety so he will need an understanding owner who can help him him cope and won\u2019t leave him all alone until he can handle it. Based on Andy\u2019s history and current needs, he is not suitable for condo or apartment living and should not be expected to visit dog parks. He is also not recommended for homes with children, cats or other dogs. While he has been great with some dogs, he really needs to build his confidence and get settled before another dog shares his living space.\n\nIf you want to adopt Andy and you can meet his needs, please fill out an adoption application http://aussierescuesandiego.org/foster-and-volunteer/adoptionapplication/. Please answer every required question, otherwise your app will not submit. You will receive an immediate confirmation once it has been submitted. Please allow up to 48 hours for us email you personally. If you do not receive confirmation within 48 hours, email us at Adoptionsaussierescuesandiego@gmail.com.",

Hey there, I\u2019m Russa and people say my head tilts are the best because of my adorable ears, doe eyes, and squishy face. People can\u2019t help but photograph me when grab my stuffed animals. They say I\u2019m just too cute. I love toys that squeak and will sit for treats and take them very gently. I\u2019m a great mix of fun and chill but at 2-3 years old I\u2019m still leveling that out so just like all the other pups out there, I\u2019d love to take some doggy classes to bond with my human. I\u2019m a good girl and even crate trained and like to hang out with my foster homes resident dog. A secure fence would be great so I can have lots of safe zoomies and outside fun with my people. If you have room in your heart for a gorgeous girl like me, apply today. I bet you can\u2019t resist my sweet puppy dog eyes.\n\nOur adoption fee is $260 for dogs over 5 months of age and includes all vaccinations, spay/neuter, micro chip implantation and registration/transfer, heartworm test and much more. Puppies up to 5 months of age are $275 and this includes all sets of puppy vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip implantation and registration and more. To adopt, go to www.fosterpetoutreach.org to complete an application.\nPlease note: Foster Pet Outreach tries to limit our adoptions to an area within approximately 60 miles of Peoria, Illinois.",

These dogs are expensive to feed and keep healthy, so please keep that in mind when applying! He is 5 years old and Great Danes don\u2019t live past 8-10 years old. He\u2019s a sweetheart!! \n\n\nAdoption fee is $450 and includes neuter, vaccinations and microchip.\n\n Adoption application and all information on our adoption process at LittleWolfRescue.org",

He\u2019s very energetic and loves to play. \nHe is nippy due to his nature, so no young kids in the house hold. \nHe\u2019s fine with other dogs, has not been cat tested, but probably wouldn\u2019t do well with them.\nHe is fully vetted. Up to date on all shots, microchipped and neutered. \nIf interested in him, please fill out an application at danteshope.com",

She weighs in at 6.5 lbs and had a cancerous lump removed when we got her.\n\nSuzy came to us with Babycakes, a 4-5 year old male Maltipoo who we believe may be her son. He weighs 7.5 lbs. Babycakes can be a bit feisty to other dogs when food is in the area. He is also active, loves to be walked, cuddled, and played with. \n\nSuzy and Babycakes were most likely trained to a pee pad in their former home. They are not whole house trained at this point but will go out whenever they are let outside. Please consider adopting this bonded pair of pups!",

He has been neutered and received his vaccinations.  \nSo if interested in Buzz, let us know and please fill out an application at 12hillsdogrescue.org.",

He came in to rescue with Dina (now Suzy), a 10-year-old Maltipoo who we believe may be his mom. She is also very active, loves to eat, but above all likes to sit next to a person, preferably under a throw on a cold day. Dina had a cancerous lump removed when we got her. She weighs in at 6.5 lbs and Babycakes weighs 7.5 lbs. \n\nThey were most likely trained to a pee pad in their former home. They are not whole house trained at this point but will go out whenever they are let outside. Can you give this bonded pair of pups their FURever home?",

            "description": "Emmeline was a transfer from Spokane Humane Society because she needed diagnostics they couldn't do at their clinic. She is 3 years old, and was an owner release to SHS with a history of \"over 2 years chronic vomiting\". Never been to a veterinarian as far as we can tell (ie, not vaccinated, not spayed, and at no point  did they go get this dog's life-long GI issue even looked at, let alone treated.\n\nHumans are the best.\n\nShe was 37# at presentation and should be 50-60. SHS did blood work, which showed normal liver and kidney function. When we got her up to Chewelah Veterinary Clinic, we did radiographs of basically the whole dog, which showed a severely distended esophagus and basically empty intestines. This is a condition called megaesophagus in which her esophageal muscles stop working and don't move food down to the stomach. It just sits in the esophagus, and falls back out through the mouth with gravity if the head is lowered. Given Emmeline's age and the duration of issues reported, this is most likely a congenital issue which has been worsening over time with lack of treatment.\n\nWe started on feeding in an elevated position and remaining upright after feeding - so far so good, and no regurgitation since starting upright feeding the end of November. Unfortunately, there's not really a way to reverse the changes in her poor, stretched-out esophagus, so she'll be a bit of a dietary management challenge for life.\n\nThe area outlined in green on the radiograph here is her esophagus, which SHOULD be a direct tube about 3/4\" diameter from mouth to stomach. Not, you know, half the diameter of her thorax.\n\nEmmeline has bulked up to a much healthier 50 pounds, and has now been spayed and vaccinated. She's recovered well from surgery and is ready to find her permanent home. She gets along well with other dogs and with cats, no problems with horses and is scared of turkeys, but she will chase chickens. She loves car rides, and thinks the entire couch belongs to her.\n\nIf you're interested in finding out more about Emmeline, adopting her, or donating toward the cost of her care, please contact Jes at docjesadams@gmail.com, or 509-690-7343.\n",

            "description": "Approx. DOB: 12/17/19 Approx Weight: 32.5\nAdoption Fee: $250 includes a 2 week trial to ensure everyone's happiness!\nNick and his brother Saint had a pretty tough start to life. They were picked up by animal control in a small rural MO town. Both boys were extremely skinny and had some skin issues.\nNow that they are Furry Kids' they are on the road to recovery! Nick is a super friendly dog and really loves people! He does need to be fed separately at this time, this can be worked on with him but we are guessing due to his initial starved state that he holds food as a precious commodity. He loves toys, gets along with the cats he has met and enjoys walks and car rides.\nChildren ages 6 and older please and a fenced yard to keep him safe while he plays and pottys.\nI have been neutered, vaccinated, heartworm tested negative, wormed and microchipped. If you are interested in adopting me, please complete the adoption application located at www.furrykidsrefuge.org/adoptadog and a dedicated volunteer will get back to you as soon as possible.\nFurry Kids' Refuge is in need of good quality dog and puppy food with meat as the first ingredient. You can drop off donations at our weekly adoption events at the Lee's Summit Petco (1860 NW Chipman Road, Lee's Summit, MO), Saturdays only from Noon to 4:00 p.m. Donations are tax deductible as allowed by law.\nWould you like to foster a Furry Kid? Furry Kids' Refuge will supply the food & vet care while you supply the basic house rules & love.......win-win for all!! Just visit our website http://www.furrykidsrefuge.org/category/fostering/ for more information. Thanks for your support!",

            "description": "RANDOLPH DUKE ~11 months old. Good with dogs. Kids TBD. Not good with cats.\n\nGSRA adopts to residents of VA, NC, and SC\n\nRandolph is a dog who loves life and won't let his rough past keep him down! Though we don't know much of his history, we do know he did not have much consistency in his former homes and was treated more as property than a member of the family.\nThings have changed for this pup and he has had a chance to show his goofy personality and good natured soul. Randolph is a happy go lucky dog who is truly a family dog and just wants to be with his people - wherever you are, he will be! He his perfectly content sitting in your office while you do work, laying in the kitchen while you cook, or snuggling with you on the couch while you catch up on trash tv.\n\nRandolph is still puppy age and therefore very playful - thankfully, he has a dog companion here in my home and they keep each other occupied much of the day! Randolph is very courteous of other dogs is quick to be submissive to gain a playmate. He shares toys and treats with no issues and shows no signs of resource guarding.\nRandolph is house trained, is not a chewer and is very respectful of your home and belongings - he does know what his toys are though and will DESTROY a dog toy with a squeaker - you have been warned! He is the best sleeping buddy and and snuggler.\n\nRandolph LOVES to go outside - he does good in car rides - especially if he can stick his head out the window! He still pulls a little but nothing severe - he has a harness that works pretty well. I have not run with him but have a feeling he would be a great running buddy. He also loves water.\n\nRandolph is crate trained and can be left up to 6 hours. When I first started fostering him, he would cry for 30 minutes or so, but within two weeks, he has improved nearly 100% and goes in with no problem with no whining. Due to his past, he has separation anxiety and this was not unexpected behavior.\n\nRandolphs weird fact: he has a licking fascination...I've seen him lick table legs, aluminum posts, blankets, the weirdest things... he's unique!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: It is GSRA policy that we do not adopt dogs under the age of 1 year old to families with children under the age of 8 years old.\n\nFor more information on our adoptable pet list please visit: Adoptable Pet List\n\nPlease join us at our next Event(s):\n\nCurrent Scheduled Events:",

He had old wounds that had become infected. The family did some finagling and was able to get him to the vet and relinquished him to the shelter. The vet worked with his wounds there for 9 days. Fast forward...With wound care continued, he is healing nicely and has gained some weight. He's been working on his social skills and making good progress. He loves people and doesn't quite get 'personal space' yet, but he's getting there. He does really well with leash-walks. He's a good guy and has the potential to make a great best buddy!",

Tonka came to us from the streets of Tijuana where he was living on the streets.  He is a super sweet happy boy who loves nothing more than hanging out with his family and playing an occasional game of tug of war.  Tonka has gotten along with most the dogs he has met (and he has met many dogs!), however a select few it took him a bit of time to warm up to.  He is a moderately active dog who would love to go on adventures with his family.  He is good in the car and also is cratetrained.  Tonka had cherry eye which was repaired in Mexico and might require artificial tear medication as he ages.  \n\nPlease email right away if you would like to learn more about this dog......and visit our website www.siarescuers.org to learn more about our rescue group.   Adoption fees range from $200-$400 for dogs.  THE DOGS SHOWN ON THE SITE ARE IN FOSTERCARE - WE DO NOT HAVE A SHELTER TO VISIT.  EMAIL is the best way to reach us.We are a volunteer run, very small organization - so please be patient when waiting for a response, but feel free to check back in if you haven't heard from us in a day or so - thank you so much for considering a rescued pooch!",

They had been living with their actual mother dog and owner up until recently. (Falcon is in the blue-collar and Semper in the red collar)\n\nBoth are very sweet and loyal boys, they like to follow you around the house and be included in all your daily activities. Semper more mellow than his brother but still insists on being part of the action and loves to be near his people. They are housebroken as long as you don't leave them alone for long periods of time. They also both do well with other dogs and we cannot see them caring about cats. They are good with kids and will fit in well in a household with kids 10 and older.\n\nThis dynamic duo have already been neutered and are up to date on vaccines. They are being fostered here in New England so they are available for a Meet and Greet!! Please fill out an application to adopt these sweet brothers!",

            "description": "Layla is a sweet, cuddly, playful and smart 6-8 month old baby. She is a typical puppy- loves making friends at daycare, running zoomies, playing with toys, chilling by you on the couch and generally curious. She is also pretty attentive and listens to her person (for the most part- she is still figuring out her new name and what some of the words mean). She knows how to sit, and immediately learned wait when mommy was putting food in her bowl. She should be easy to train. She is still a tiny bit mouthy when she gets excited (as most puppies are), but immediately understands when told to stop. She LOVES her crate and will go there herself when she tires out. She loves exploring the backyard and watching the birds and chasing bunnies. And let's not forget running zoomies. She would do best in a home where she has a place to run, or will be exercised well. She would make a great running buddy. We are still working on her house-training. But a good schedule (probably 3-4 times a day) and the fact that she is crate trained means she will get there soon. She sleeps through the night without needing to go out. She is a fantastic family pet, and ideally would love a family with a play buddy. She lives with 5 other dogs in her foster home and does great with them (even with a few grumpy housemates).",

            "description": "Meet Murphy!\n\nThis handsome Red Heeler mix pup is about  2 1/2 years old and finds himself in need of a new home through no fault of his own.  A change in living circumstances made his family (who adopted him from JoJo's as a young puppy) unable to keep him.  \n\nMurphy is getting along great with dogs of all sizes in his foster home.  He likes children, but we think toddlers would be too small to be happy with this active boy.  Heelers like to heel, including toddlers, so older children or an adult household would probably be best for Murphy.  Another dog or two to play with or an active person who enjoys playing with and training their pups would be great for Murphy.\n\nHe loves car rides, we do not know if he likes cats or not, he is housebroken but may need watching when he first changes homes, and crate trained.\n\nAlthough Murphy is a good boy, smart and willing to please, he does need work on manners.  If you have a heart for heeling breeds and know how to work with them, we'd love for you to meet Murphy.  He's going to make a wonderful addition to the right home.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Murphy, please email us at jojosdogrescue @gmail.com and we will send you an application, or download one from our website www.jojosdoghouse.com.  Adoption fee is $175 and includes neuter, up-to-date vaccinations, microchip, and parasite treatment and prevention.  Thanks for choosing adoption!\n\nPlease visit our Facebook page JoJo's DogHouse (non-profit) to learn more about us and see many of the dogs we have rescued.  We hope you'll join JoJo's family of adopters!",

She will need someone who can give her the space and time she needs to warm up to you.\nSweetie has to be kept on a leash at all times outside. She is a escape artist. She can climb, dig, and chew her way out of most anything. With this being said she can not be unleashed at all outside or unsupervised. I do crate her during the day which she is ok with. She has not had any accidents in the create or house.\n\nIncluded with adoption: Age-appropriate vaccinations, up to date heart-worm preventative, heart-worm test if over 6 months, insurance for 30 days, microchip with registration, and spayed or neutered- if not already, a voucher is provided. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry",

He does well with other dogs, particularly dogs that love to play.  Once he is cleared from heart worm he would love to have someone to play with.  He is still learning about leash manners (he is getting a crash course in this as his activity is currently restricted to leash walks for potty breaks), he is very smart and is learning tricks quickly.\nFerdinand is on medical hold until he completes heart worm treatment",

She had waited a long time to get adopted earlier in the year, and then after a few months in her new home some unfortunate circumstances landed her back in the shelter, so we would really like to help her find a loving forever home for keeps. \n\nRosie is a sweet girl with an adorable face and a sharp mind. She is a bit timid at first, but she\u2019ll love you once she knows she can trust you. She would do best in a quieter home where she can settle in and feel safe and comfortable, and a home where she can be the one and only animal would be best. She knows some commands, can be left home alone loose in the house without issue and is an all around wonderful companion who still has some pep in her step. \n\nRosie is 6 yrs old and is a healthy and vibrant girl. She has a tendency to get urinary tract infections so she is on a special prescription food that keeps her healthy (C/D Hills Prescription Diet).\n\nWe are partnering with the Kennebec Valley Humane Society to find Rosie the perfect forever home and human. If you are interested please fill out our online adoption survey: https://www.olddogsnewdigs.com/adoption-survey/  We are also looking for a foster home for her while she waits for her forever home so if you are interested in fostering Rosie please email us at woof@olddogsnewdigs.com. Otherwise please help us by spreading the word about Rosie so we can turn her luck around. Thanks!!!\n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior pets have a history of being kept up to date on vaccines, annual exams and recommended bloodwork. We also do home checks to make sure that your home environment meets the needs of the particular dog you are interested in.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adoption, please fill out our online adoption survey at https://www.olddogsnewdigs.com/adoption-survey/\n\n",

IT WILL HELP IN FINDING THE RIGHT MATCH FOR HIM.\n\nFletcher was found hiding under an 18-wheeler out in the country in the freezing rain and is quite lucky a couple found him.  Fletcher is only 11-12 WEEKS OLD.  He weighs 22 pounds,  This means he will likely be a LARGE dog.  With mixed breed dogs we can only guess what their breeds are by looking at shape of the ear, coat, muzzle length, etc.  Fletcher is a big of a puzzle.  We do believe he has yellow lab in him, but his ears are more terrier.  The vet put \"terrier mix\" on Fletcher's paperwork - partly because of his ears.  You just have to fall in love with him, that's all.\n\nFletcher needs a family where someone is HOME most of the time.  We are hoping to find someone who has raised a puppy before and has the commitment and ability to work with him on training and socialization.  We want a family that will consider Fletcher a real family member.\n\nFletch is a typical, curious, high energy, playful pup.  He loves the chase part of \"fetch\" but doesn't yet want to give it back.  Fletcher does not have any of the behavior characteristics that would indicate any type of abuse and, given a few minutes, will think you are his pal.\n\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION PLEASE EMAIL can.adoptions@yahoo.com",

She's also a big-time lover and likes giving kisses at bedtime to her foster parents. We'd expect her to be timid at first until she gets used to her new home and new family, but we've seen her warm up quickly and believe she'll do the same with her forever family once she gets comfortable. Cubbie loves other dogs and would love to find a forever family that has a fur sibling for her. We believe training will be a big asset for her as she could use some confidence building. We will continue to update her bio as we learn more about her. You can find Cubbie on our website at www.nwtlb.org, No Wagging Tail Left Behind.",

A vet tech down south found her underneath her deck a few months ago.  We know she had been on the run for a while because she was skinny, covered in fleas and ticks, and practically feral at the time. The vet had to trap her to get her out.  \n\nOnce they got her out and to the vet they realized she had a broken front leg which appeared to have been injured for a little while. Back at the clinic, Beth quickly warmed up to the staff.  The vet repaired her leg (see photos of her with her external fixator in place and healed).   Now she loves to run and play!   \n\nDuring Beth's cat test she did chase after the cat a bit.  We are pretty sure she just was curious and wanted to play, but she will need slow and proper introductions to a feline companion.  When tested with a 12-year-old child she absolutely loved her.  She was a little more standoffish with a younger child but not at all concerningly so.   She would do fine with any age as long as there was proper supervision of interactions. \n\nDue to Beth's anxiety, she is looking for a home with another dog(s).  In her foster home, she is really making progress by being able to key off of the other dog in the home.\n\nIf you would like to be considered to adopt Beth, please complete the adoption application for Beth online here:\n\nhttp://www.doubledogrescuevolunteers.org/adoption_application.php?dog=Beth\n\n(please reach out to KateS@doubledogrescue.org if you run into any issues with the application process).\n\nFor specific questions about Beth, please contact Katherine at KatherineM@doubledogrescue.org.\n\n",

She will paw at her foster mom for pets.\nThis adorable senior girl's life was turned upside down when her owner died and she ended up in a shelter.  After being there for 6 months our rescue stepped in and she is now relaxing in a foster home. Even though Mya is 13.5 years young she is spunky and a typical chow.  Mya loves to go for walks and enjoys the company of her foster mom.  Her perfect home would be in a quiet household, no children, potentially another dog if their personalities meshed and someone with breed experience.  Mya is not a cuddly dog.  She is a typical chow and is independent.  She is deaf and has some vision impairment.  If she startles she may bite out of fear.  We are looking for a chow savvy patient person who will allow Mya to adjust to her new surroundings on her terms.  Please do not say you have chow experience if you do not.  \nA physical fenced in yard would be ideal for Mya. \nAdoption donation and home visit required.",

Despite the odds being against him, he still has a chance to end his life on a high note. Reginald is a quiet and loyal dog who simply wants to lay at the foot of your bed. He loves attention, but is content to sleep all day as well. All he asks for is your company and a roof over his head. Reggie doesn't like being left alone unless he has a dog to keep him company. We can only assume he gets nervous because he doesn't want to lose what he so recently acquired.. a place to call home and people who love him.\n\nReggie is potty trained, knows basic commands, and is up to date on his rabies shot.\n\nHe is a 6-7 year old lab mix. His adoption fee is $175",

At approximately 1 yr old, he's full grown at 35 pounds, and we think his regal stature is part Jindo and American Eskimo dog.  He had a rough start in life after being injured by a car.  After two surgeries, he's a bundle of energy and loves to go on walks.  He will be a great running, walking or exercise companion. He is a pleasant playful puppy that will entertain himself at times playing fetch with himself and his beloved toys.  He loves playing with other dogs and even likes pigs but is not great with cats. He would do well in a family with kids over 10 years old because of his previous injuries. He's very smart and obeys many commands and he will walk on water for you if you have a treat or special toy in your pocket.  Please consider adding Teddy to your family, he really deserves a loving home.\n \nOur adoption fee covers our dogs being spayed/neutered, microchipped,vaccinations and dewormed. and flea treated. please contact us or go to www.openarmsrescue.org and fill out the online application 760-470-7643",

Not animal hoarding, she was an only pet, but her living conditions were horrendous and she had very little space to maneuver. She was ghastly overfed and we've been very successful in getting weight off of her. She's now starting to feel the weight loss and able to move around easier.\nNo hikes, runs, dog parks, pets, cats, kids or craziness for this girl.\nShe's 10+ and ready for naps, sunbathing and lazy days.\nThe perfect fit would be an older female who just wants to give Bonny all her time and love. Bonny can be with men, but does get a little nervous. Certainly nothing that couldn't be overcome with time. She is anxious/nervous around young kids and does need to be an only pet.\nIf you feel you can give Bonny the best home, please contact us with some info on yourself and your living arrangements/situation.",

She was adopted by a lovely family and after a short time, their other dog decided that she did not want Ella in her space and has started issues with Ella.  Jealousy and growling and starting fights has been going on for awhile. \nElla's Needs are:\n\nFenced Yard and a Furry Non-Alpha Playmate\nShe loves walks, dog parks, people \nShe knows some commands and is pretty good on a leash\nOlder kids - no babies or toddlers\n\n** All of our Wigglers are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, hw tested/treated, and on preventatives. Most of our adoptable dogs need fenced in yards or an exercise regimen. Please read their description above closely. Our adoption fee is $350.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.German Shepherd dogs, as well as the other herding breeds that we have in rescue, are highly active, energetic, working breeds. They require considerable vetting, exercise, socialization, training, leadership and mental stimuli in order to be well-adjusted, well-balanced, and well-mannered dogs. Even if you exercise and play with your dog daily in your fenced yard, you MUST still take your dog out on daily walks and outings in order to work on his/her leash skills, manners, and social skills. These breeds make great additions to active families who will pamper them, but who will also work with them, as they are smart dogs who need leadership, structure, plenty of activity and mental stimulation. If you are new to German Shepherds (and other herding breeds), please research the breed to make sure this is the dog for you. We ask that you consider the time and financial commitment that your German Shepherd (or other herding breed) dog will require before applying for one. Please review the section on our website (www.heartlandgsrescue.org) 'Is a HUGS Dog Right for You?' for additional information. Estelle is a gorgeous, 30lb girl who is very sweet, but a little shy at first. Estelle was found at an abandoned house that had crumbled to the ground. Underneath concrete and carpet Estelle had built a little nest for her and her five puppies. Lucky for her, rescuers were able to get everyone out safely. Estelle is incredibly sweet and she was immediately grateful and relieved to get to safety with her babies. Estelle and her five puppies have been thriving in their foster home together and are ready for foster to adopt homes of their own. Estelle is a smart German Shepherd mix and it shows in her personality! Although Estelle was found in an abandoned house with her puppies just two short months ago, she has already made a lot of progress from scared, untamed girl to devoted lap dog in that time. Although she's come a long way, Estelle will need a patient, committed adopter as she continues learning how to be a loved, indoor companion. Estelle is shy and quiet at first, but once she feels comfortable in your home, she will want to be physically touching you at all times, and she will use her hound voice if left alone. Estelle is quite the little athlete, and can clear the back of a couch (her favorite way to 'snuggle attack' her foster dad) or a four door fence with ease. Estelle is working on crate training, and at night will voice her displeasure with the crate for awhile before settling down, even though she willing lays in her crate with the door open during the day. Estelle is good with other dogs, and currently lives with two foster sisters and one foster brother, although she needs slow introductions (because of her fearfulness) and is still figuring out what this whole 'play' thing is... Estelle is picky about her toys, preferring a particular ducky stuffed toy she's had since her first foster home, and raw bones - the meatier the better! Pig ears and snouts are also acceptable to Estelle's discerning palate, and she makes quick work of them! Estelle is potty trained, although if you ignore her signs of wanting to go outside, she may have an accident. If you're looking for the perfect oversized lap dog who will be your devoted shadow once she warms up to you, Estelle is the girl for you! The adoption fee for Estelle is $275, all of which goes back into offseting our high-cost vetting expenses and rescuing more dogs. We are a 100% volunteer-run rescue group and rely on adoption fees and donations to continue saving lives. Adoption fees include spay/neuter, current on age-appropriate vaccinations, fecal, deworming, flea/tick and heartworm preventative, heartworm tested if old enough (and treated if positive), and microchipped. Please visit http://heartlandgsrescue.rescuegroups.org/info/adoption for more information about our adoption process and requirements, and to apply. Like any of our dogs, Estelle would make a great addition to an active home that will provide the love, structure, good leadership, activity and mental stimulation that her breed needs. Because of that, Estelle's ideal owners will have prior GSD, or other herding breed experience. Even if you exercise and play with your dog daily in your fenced yard, please remember that you MUST still take your dog out on daily walks and outings, in order to provide sufficient stimulation, ward off boredom, and work on leash skills, and manners. Please review the information in the 'About Us', 'Important Considerations' and 'Adopt' sections on our website menu, as it contains useful information about the breed, adoption fees, the adoption process and our requirements, and how meeting the dogs works.",

A kind lady saved me and sent me to 4 Paws shelter so that I can find a warm heart and home to call my own.   I am noted for a lot of energy so will need some training and definitely a home with a fenced yard so that I can run around.   They say that I would make a wonderful best friend if someone would have a little patience and I promise to try if someone will give me a chance.   If interested, PLEASE FILL OUT THE APPLICATION on the website of www.4Paws4U4Ever.com under How To Adopt.  I would love to be part of a family.",

His family brought him in, saying they could no longer keep him. Rocco is about a year old and weighs 54 pounds, He is house-trained, his family said. He knows sit, and is good on a leash -- until he spots another dog nearby. He should be an only pet in the household. Rocco is now neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, heartworm tested negative and will be microchipped upon adoption. Come meet him in Run 876 using ID#626673.\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

I am very sweet but need a little training.   I keep my cage nice and clean so know how to potty outside.   Would you like a best friend and loyal companion?   If so, please look at me and, if interested, PLEASE FILL OUT THE APPLICATION on the website of www.4Paws4U4Ever.com under How To Adopt.   I am waiting for the right family to come and find me.

She is a high energy girl and needs a family who will invest in training her.\n\nIf you think you would be interested, please complete our no obligation application and we can start the process at www.luv4k9s.org. Select Available Dogs then scroll down to application, complete and submit. \n\nA physical secure fence attached to the residence is a requirement to adopt a dog from our rescue. Invisible fence doesn't meet this requirement. No exceptions.\n\nOur adoption area is primarily OHIO. We will consider KENTUCKY, AND INDIANA AND CERTAIN AREAS OF MICHIGAN, WEST VIRGINIA, AND PENNSYLVANIA if it\u2019s the best fit for the dog.\n\nWE DO NOT SHIP NOR ARRANGE TRANSPORTS.\n\nTHE APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED BEFORE WE CAN START THE PROCESS. \n\nIT CAN TAKE AT LEAST 2 WEEKS TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION SOMETIMES LONGER DEPENDING ON VOLUNTEER AVAILABILITY AND NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS RECEIVED SO PLEASE BE PATIENT. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different, and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. \nHomes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for:\n1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (ex. a 4 month old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break) \n2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old, to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise.\n3.) Socialization: The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home.\n4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded tenfold, for years to come.\nPlease do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy. Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time consuming and can be expensive. All Dogs Require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well-trained, well socialized dog is more than worth the effort put in to get them there. \n\nOur adoption fee includes spay/neuter, routine shots, rabies, worming, microchipped, heartworm testing and they are on monthly preventative. Visit our website www.luv4k9s.org for more information and to complete an application.\n",

Even though I am the perfect lady, it would be best if I am the only dog in the house! While I am a dainty princess, I can still scale a six foot fence without any problem! Interested adopters should keep this in mind and never leave me outside unattended. I sure do enjoy making new friends, and I can't wait to meet you!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting me, please complete an online application at https://form.jotform.com/201174641622144.",

London came to us from another local shelter.  \n\nLondon is in search of her forever family.  She lived with kiddos (ages 4 to 13) and other pups in her previous home.  She loved to be around the children but was a rough player with the other doggies.  \n\nLondon has been very sweet with all of the staff and quickly became a volunteer favorite!  She has the biggest wiggly butt we have ever seen!  London loves attention, is great in the car, and loves to play with her toys.  London has a strange habit of chasing shadows and lights.  We are hoping she will out grow this.  London would love a home with a fenced in yard and a family that is home often.  She reportedly was sad to be alone in a previous home and suffered from separation anxiety.  \n\nPlease go to our website, www.crcpa.org, and complete an application if you are interested in learning more about Miss London!  If you have the patience for this beautiful baby, we are sure she will repay you with her love.",

He was rescued from death row at Miami Dade Animal Shelter by Paws Fur Recovery and is currently being treated like a king in foster with his new foster mom Morgan while we find his new furever home! He absolutely LOVES his hooman companions. He is very low maintenance and enjoys napping his life away as long as he is right by your side. He is ridiculously sweet and is well behaved. Loves rolling around out in the grass in the sunshine. Car rides are his favorite, he will jump in with literally anyone! Fully house trained, no accidents ever. Truly a great dog. Neutered. Vaccinated. Up to date on all shots and prevention. Will you give this dopey guy his new furever home??? How could you say no to that face??? \n\n\nPLEASE READ:\n\n*** At this time adoptions are only able to be carried-out in the Treasure Coast, Florida area (Port Saint Lucie, Fort Pierce, Stuart, Jensen Beach, Palm City, Hobe Sound, Indian River, Vero Beach, Sebastian, etc). We will not respond to inquiries or applications submitted outside of a 50 mile radius.\n\nWe are a local volunteer-based rescue organization, not a shelter. Due to high volume of inquiries and limited resources we are not able to respond to all inquiries submitted whether by phone, email or petfinder. If you are interested in Frankie  please fill out an adoption application on our website and we will respond to candidates that are the best fit for Frankie\u2019s personality and the personal needs of both the dog and the potential adopter family.\n\nYou may fill out an application for Frankie  here:\nhttps://pawsfurrecovery.org/adoption-application\n",

I also have a neck injury. I weigh about 30 lbs. My people have to carry me outside & support me while I potty. I bark when I need to go outside. Right now, I'm on \"bed rest\" until early/mid Feb. After that, I will be neutered. Nittany Beagle Rescue is looking into getting me a cart for after I'm off of bedrest. I can't wait! Also, Nittany Beagle Rescue will be consulting with a veterinarian who specializes in integrative methods to see whether I would benefit from some of their services like acupuncture & an underwater treadmill. I'm a very happy fellow & I'm in a great foster home who can take care of me as long as needed - so no worries there! I like to cuddle next to my person when sleeping on the couch! I need to be crated when I'm in a car - otherwise, I try to move around a lot. I am available for adoption once I'm a little better.",

Since I can be jumpy and startle easily, I would do best in a home without youngsters. I seem to really like other dogs so I may do well with a compatable canine companion. I'm a bit reserved at first but I really love to have my ears scratched and I adore being petted! I'm an old soul- wise and low-key. I am loving and loyal- I will make someone an excellent companion! I also enjoy my walks with all the great volunteers at the shelter. Kennel staff say I seem to be housebroken. I currently weigh in at 80lbs.",

His paws are spotted so we think there may be a tad bit of collie in him somewhere.  Staff reports Fluffer is indeed, 100% a leaner and not only that, he LOVES to be HUGGED!  Who doesn't need a hug right now?  Fluffer is young, maybe 1 or 2 years old and appears house trained.  \nWe're still learning about this boy but he's fully vaccinated and will be available for adoption once he is neutered.\n\nAdoption fee for dogs is $85.  He is already fully vetted and ready to go. \n\nThe shelter is open for adoptions MON-FRI, 9 to 5 (except holidays).  Currently, masks are required to enter the shelter.  Located at 2019 S. 3rd Street, behind Price Chopper, at the intersection of 4th & Marion.  Please consider donating some good quality dry or wet dry dog food or good quality treats, hard sturdy dog toys or laundry detergent if you may be popping by the shelter.  Staff uses these items every day of the year.",

            "description": "Emmitt is a five year old male boxer or boxer mix. This brindle-coated boy weighs around 45 lbs. Emmitt came into our care after he was surrendered to a local animal control in bad condition. He has been recovering as a foster at All Breed Grooming, Boarding, and Daycare. Emmitt is currently on a prescription food, but it\u2019s made a big difference in his appearance! Emmitt is good with other dogs and probably kids too. His favorite toy is a big stuffed frog. Emmitt is happy to meet new people and that includes you! To adopt Emmitt, apply at ITVrescue.org.\n\nAll of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heartworm tested and treated if necessary.\n\nPlease realize that many of our animals are kept in foster homes. Please complete an adoption application at http://itvrescue.org/adoption-application/ in order to meet with one of our animals. There is no obligation in completing the application, but it helps us find an animal that is most appropriate for your family.  The ITV Rescue Center is open Tuesdays 12-5; Wednesdays 12-7; Thursdays 12-5; Fridays 12-5 and Saturdays 10-5.  The Rescue Center is located at 1417 N. Stockwell Road.  You are welcome to come to our rescue center during open hours to see all of our great adoptable animals. Thank you for your interest in our animals!\n\nNOTE: Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

            "description": "Tye Dye won my \"Wiggle Butt of the Month\" award as she's the wiggliest butt on the East Coast. Happy to meet everyone she meets, her tail wags, and it wags her, and she smiles and is so happy when someone wants to pet her. It's impossible to spend time with Tye dye and not grin an ear to ear grin, as she's so cute, friendly and simply irresistible that she'll turn the grumpiest of faces into a laugh. So cute! Tye Dye's teeth are clean and bright, and she needs some TLC for her mange. Better nutrition and medication under our care is clearing her up. She's all personality, cuddles, fun and love, our Tye Dye. Perhaps named after seeing how bold and bright she is. Nothing (not a little skin issue, or at the moment not having a home) is going to stop our little girl from loving life . There are so many sides to her that she is not a boring dog to be with. There is so much personality packed in this one little 40 pound mangey dog with gentle, soulful, excited and naughty eyes. At one moment, she can be sitting peacefully and tenderly by my side, enjoying caresses, at the other, she literally wiggles...I love that versatility, I love her take on life. Imagine what a companion she would be in your life...She will be the Sun that will brighten your days and nights this winter. Tye Dye needs you and you need her...She's ready to share it all with you, share her kisses and tail wags in exchange for helping her grow up into the fabulous adult dog she's destined to be. She's an awesome pup, ready to wag his way into the future with you and leave the throw away mama dog life behind.\n\nAll dogs will be altered, microchipped, and receive age-appropriate vaccines prior to adoption. Please note that the listed location for this dog may not be accurate due to technical limitations of this database and we have transportation options available within 6 hours of NYC (so don't let location hold you back)!\n\nInterested in fostering or adopting?

Davey was a local owner surrender when it became clear his exercise needs surpassed what they were able to give him. He is a very active guy, even compared to his other Cattle Dog foster siblings!\n\nDavey is friendly with dogs (big and small) who he has a chance to warm up to and who know how to take proper breaks during play. He is good around dog savvy cats but may chase if they are flighty but there\u2019s no aggressive intent. Davey enjoys the company of humans that give him time to warm up to them. He loves HIS humans and will smother them with love. He is wary of strangers but coexists with them just fine, assuming they give him space.\n\nDavey likes playing fetch most of all! He loves off leash hiking on logging roads, using his snuffle mat or other enrichment toys at meal times, training/learning new tricks, parkouring on the furniture, playing with appropriate dog friends, cuddling, and winding down in the evenings with something to chew on. He is a total clown who will make you smile with his antics!\nDavey dislikes leisurely leash walks, busy city life, nail trims, sitting still..\n\nDavey has lived with dogs, cats, and kids.\nHowever, Davey would do best in a kid free home so his adoptive family can really work with him during his youth but would do great with kids later in his life when he\u2019s not so rambunctious!\n\n**DUE TO THE HIGH VOLUME OF APPLICATIONS WE RECEIVE, INQUIRIES MADE BELOW THROUGH THE PETFINDER WEBSITE WILL NOT BE SEEN OR RESPONDED TO. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING DAVEY, PLEASE FILL OUT AN APPLICATION. YOU CAN COPY AND PASTE THE LINK BELOW UNDER \"ADOPTION APPLICATION\" INTO YOUR WEB BROWSER. \n\nDavey is neutered, microchipped and has received age-appropriate core vaccines. Davey is being fostered in Mount Vernon and the adoption fee is $330. If you're interested in meeting Davey, please fill out an adoption application on our website: pnwcdr.org/adopt \n\nPlease note: We do not do DNA testing on our foster dogs. The breed description is our best guess based on the dog\u2019s appearance, mother\u2019s appearance, paperwork, etc. \n\nAdoption Process: \n- Adoption Application\n- Phone Convo \n- Meet & Greet \n- Home Visit \n- Application Approval \n- Adoption Fee & Contract \n\nAdoption Application: \npnwcdr.org/adopt",

            "description": "Meet Parker \n\nName: Parker\nSex: Male (Neutered)\nAge: approximately 2 years\nBreed: German Shepherd\nLocation: Tulsa\n\nHouse & Crate Trained: Yes\nDog Friendly: Yes\nKid Friendly: Unknown\nCat Friendly: Unknown\n\nParker was surrendered to a vet clinic because he kept getting out and running away from home. He is a very sweet boy who loves affection. Parker would love to find a home with another dog to play with and to show him 'how to dog.' He's mild-mannered and shy, but really feeds off the energy of other dogs and (busy) people. He wants to do things, but oftentimes can't or doesn't know how to instigate. \n\nParker needs a home where he will not be left alone outside for any amount of time. It is hoped that his neuter surgery will reduce his desire to roam, but there is no way to know for sure. When in the backyard, he has been caught fiddling with the back gate and looking for other ways to escape.\n\nParker is a good boy and will make a great dog for an adopter. He's so sweet and pure-of-heart that he whimpers when the squirrels refuse to come down and play with him \n\nIf you're a previously-approved adopter, please message us to set up a meet & greet. If you'd like to get approved for adoption, please submit an application here: https://oklahomagsr.org/application/",

He is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4516895.\n\nVaughn was found as a stray and is very fearful of people. He seems nervous of the leash, but once in the play yard did take treats if the handler threw them and ignored him. He would probably do well with some non-punishment based training to help him learn that people are awesome. Because of his behavior with people a dog introduction has not been done, so it's unknown how he reacts to other dogs. Vaughn is still young at only two years old and there's a lot of hope he can overcome his current behavior issues. Suspected to be a german shepherd lab mix he could end up being a great running or hiking partner and may even be a great candidate for dog sports like canine scent work. He just needs an experienced adopter or foster to do some training to help him address his fearful behavior first.\n\nVAUGHN\n\n(MCACC A4516895) may not be available for adoption to the general public, but can be saved by a New Hope Partner, contact the shelter to find out.\n\nTo visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show, and we have seen that you can generally show up and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog and the shelter will squeeze you in, except from 12-3PM or closer to the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

I am an 8 month old staffie terrier mix full of love and cuddles and weigh approximately 25 pounds but still growing. I am dog and kid friendly. I am microchipped, UTD on my shots and on heart worm and flea prevention. I\u2019m almost potty trained and am crate trained. My foster mommy says I\u2019m smart and well mannered. I love relaxing as much as I love to play. My neuter is scheduled for January 27, 2021. Can\u2019t wait to meet my family??\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

            "description": "BRANDI is ready for her forever home!  She is about 72LBs, sweet and friendly once she warms up and feels comfortable.  She is selective with dogs.  We think she would do best in a home with just one adult or with a couple. Brandi is a great dog, but needs some training and exercise, and a safe place to call her own. Decompression time and a routine is really going to help this girl shine. She will make a great companion for someone with Rottie experience.  Brandi is a 3 year old with a docked tail.  ADOPTION DETAILS:   Each dog is spayed, neutered, (unless medically on hold) up to date on shots, dewormed, and microchipped. At this time, due to the size of our rescue, adoptions are limited to NORTH CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA, VIRGINIA and +/-6 hours from Raleigh, NC. ADOPTION FEE: Our total adoption fee is $250, including a non-refundable $25 application fee.   Fee can be paid using the \"DONATE\" button on our website (www.RottweilerHeartsRescue.org) - please indicate in the notes that it is for an application fee, and the intended dog. If you have any questions, please email our adoption coordinator at Rottiehearts@gmail.com!",

I'm a Black and Tan Coonhound, 16 months old and 70lbs. \nDon\u2019t let my large size fool ya, my favorite thing to do is cuddle with my person. I love to sleep in bed with my people and curl up on the couch for movie time! I get along very well with other dogs and kids. I would be an excellent addition to your pack!! I'm house broken, kennel trained and walk on leash like a real pro. I\u2019m also pretty sharp on my basic commands and love to show off my tricks. I love to shake your paw for tasty carrots! \nBasically if we\u2019re being honest, I'm the perfect dog! I\u2019m such a happy and sweet boy. Though I am still a bit of a puppy so I do need exercise too! I hope to meet my forever family soon!\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

No cats. Older children or adult only home. \n\nGina was rescued off of a local classified page by a Good Samaritan who released her to rescue when they found out this little one needed some extensive dental work. \n\nGina is 14 years old and is a miniature poodle. She is extremely obese and her foster family has been working on getting the weight off with weight management food and gentle exercise. Gina has an asymptomatic grade 2 heart murmur which we are hoping will improve once she is back to a proper weight, which for her is probably around 19-20lbs. At her intake she weighed a whopping 37lbs, so she is definitely morbidly obese and needs a home that will continue her weight loss journey. \n\nGina is a well mannered, sweet girl who is 100% reliably housetrained, gets along with all other dogs, and loves to be with her people. She doesn\u2019t bark, or chew. Her only naughty habit is that she likes to chase cats. She might do well with cats who are dog savvy, as she isn\u2019t aggressive about it, but she would do best with no kitties in her forever home. While she gets along with other dogs, she prefers her people and would do just fine as an only dog with someone home most of the time. \n\nGina has been spayed and had a dental and is up to date on shots and microchipped. She is ready for a retirement home to call her own.\n\nYou can find our application on our website or email cavaliercrazyrescue@gmail.com if you\u2019d like to apply to make her part of your family!",

Read BIO, please!\nMEET Calvin!  \u2013 When Calvin first joined our rescue, he was skittish and unsure of everything but his foster dad. Now that he\u2019s been with us for a while, he has relaxed and has proven to be quite the sweet heart! His foster family says that he doesn\u2019t know how to play, no matter how often they encourage him to play.  He can still be leery about new experiences, but does need someone who will be patient and let him learn to trust at his own pace.  Calvin is a very active dog, weighing around 75 pounds (give or take a few pounds) and would do great with an active family.  Our ideal adopter would be someone who loves to hike, someone who is able to spend a great deal of time at home with him to provide the attention he needs and deserves.  Calvin loves and does well with other dogs.  He is currently living with two smaller dogs but it would be great if Calvin\u2019s adopter had a canine companion that can show Calvin the ropes.  Based on his reactions on walks, Calvin would do best in a home without cats and his adopter should note that he fixates on squirrels, whether in the yard or on walks;-).  We don\u2019t know how Calvin is with children but are requiring any children in the home be at least 13 years old and are dog savvy.   Calvin is a healthy boy but does need a slow bowl for his meals as he tends to be overenthusiastic about eating, which can cause digestive issues. \n\nCharacteristics: sweet, athletic, lover\nBackground:  Pulled from overcrowded Texas shelter in July 2020\nEMAIL US for an adoption application for Calvin",

We have learned more about Lacey as she has had the fortunate foster family to take the time to empathize, understand and learn what lifestyle she needs to for her to be a well- balanced happy pup.    Lacey will shine brightly in the right home and with an experienced dog owner.  She will need to be in a home with no kids and no cats and plenty of time to continue helping her decompress and build confidence and social skills. \n\nLacey has so much love to give and genuinely wants to please.  She enthusiastically embraces any opportunity for a walk or outside adventure, and at 1 1/2 years old, this pup needs some adventures!   Lacey is comfortable in the house and is as happy to snuggle in as she is to adventure out.  Both would be a daily requirement.  She definitely wants to be near her people. She keeps a watchful eye and will relocate her cozy spot as you relocate yours.    Lacey is crate trained but needs to be in a home where she spends most of her time with her trusted humans.  She could easily earn free roam of the home. \n\nLacey has shown the ability to greet other dogs and people appropriately when walking on leash, although leash walking is a relatively new experience for her.  She is a quick study and is eager to please, but definitely still needs some guidance.    She also needs direction and support when greeting certain new people as she has a protective, distrustful reaction to some folks.  Time, commitment and positive experiences will help Lacey\u2019s stranger danger diminish and her happy, social side come through.\n\n*Important information - Lacey needs to be loved and appreciated in a calm and gentle environment.  She is a social pup, and loves people, but we have learned that there must have been something in her past that created some confusion and high reactivity when highly aroused.  We learned this the hard way and she now has a bite history after being put in situation she wasn\u2019t ready for.  Lacey is a good dog, with an unfortunate past of people failing her.  She has so much love to offer and we know there is the right person(s) to give Lacey the chance she needs to not only show you how great she really is, but to give her the support she needs to learn how to keep balanced energy.  \n\nWe also have set aside some funds to contribute to a private trainer to help Lacey\u2019s journey be a successful one with a committed, loving family. \n\nThis pup is ready to get comfortable and find a place to call home.  Ms. Lacey is about 1 \u00bd years old and ab out 40 pounds. \n\nLacey is being fostered in Williston, VT \nApply here: http://longtraildogs.org/adoption-application/\n",

            "description": "Hi! I'm Cotton! You're never too old to look for your furever home, right? I have been around the block ... I'm 15 years old after all. But I still have love to give and I'm ready to settle down!\n\nI'm on the small side (about 18 lbs) and I've actually recently lost some weight the vet told me to lose! I'm a maltese mix and am hypoallergenic. I would prefer to be in a home with adults only.\n\nSome of my favorite things are exploring outside, belly rubs, and naps. I'm very gentle and I'm told I'm very soft. One of my least favorite things is the crate. It's just pretty lonely there. If you let me stay out of the crate in my dog bed, I promise to behave!\n\nWhat else should you know? Hmm. Well, I am partially blind and I'm deaf. So if your smoke alarm accidentally goes off, I won't get too worried! And even though I'm partially blind, I learn to find my way around pretty well!\n\nI'm very good on the leash and I don't mind other doggies! Sometimes I get so happy to be outside that I even like to do a little jog and will give you a smile. \n\nI would prefer to be with someone who likes to be home a lot with me - quality time is my primary love language! What's yours? \n\nIf you are interested in me, click Apply for Adoption!\n\nIf you're on Adopt-A-Pet or PetFinder, please visit https://www.hopeanimals.org/ to apply!\n\n\n** Please note that due to COVID-19 and stay at home orders, we are not having our usual adoption events. The first step in the process is to submit an online application. Virtual meet and greets over the phone/computer will be set up before selecting the best fit for adoption. Thank you!",

Chris loves everyone and every dog he meets and couldn't be sweeter. In fact, many people call him an angel. He loves cuddling, taking long walks, napping, playing with his people, and all of the treats. While he LOVES all foods, he is very patient and well behaved around people with food. Chris knows how to sit on command, come, is fully house trained, very easy to take on walks, and knows to sit to wait for his food. I honestly can't say enough about how perfect Chris is he is impossible not to love and would do well in any loving home where he has a comfy bed and lots of cuddles!

Since coming into rescue, he has learned that life goes on, and that there is a new life ahead of him. Ruger is friendly to new people and very affectionate and playful with those he knows and loves. Like most Akitas, he is not interested in sharing his home with another dog and would do best in a home with no other dogs, cats, or, small children.\n\nWant to Get One Step Closer to Adopting your New Furry Family Member?\n\nVisit our website at www.akitaangels.org.

Luckily lab rescue got me outta there & set me up in a foster home. I\u2019ve gotten baths to help my skin recover & good food & exercise to get me in great shape for my new home! I love going for walks on a leash but i still need to learn not to pull & bark when I get excited but I will figure it out with practice. \nWhen I met my foster sister lab I wasn\u2019t sure what to make of her b/c I didn\u2019t learn appropriate doggie manners. I sorta came off like a bully but she is fun to play with and she is teaching me doggie manners. We share toys & get along fine. My foster mom thinks I\u2019ll get along with most dogs but I do like to play wrestle which some doggies might not like. I\u2019d be ok as an only dog though. \nI\u2019m a good boy in the house. I like snoozing on the sofa and LOVE all the toys but I don\u2019t destroy people things. I only want my toys.\nI haven\u2019t met cats up close yet but I bet they\u2019d be fun to chase. My foster mom thinks if a cat swiped at me with claws I\u2019d back off pretty quick but I do love chasing things so maybe better without cats. \nI can\u2019t wait to find my forever home. I\u2019m staying in Key Largo & would love to meet you! \n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please go to LRRoF.org NOW and fill out an application.\n\nThanks so much for your interest in our rescue!\nYour support, both through adoption and donation is always essential to us and our Labs. Donate today!\nWe're about matching the right dog with the right family. All applicants will be assigned an Adoption Counselor who will act as their liaison. In addition, a phone interview, home inspection and vet reference (if applicable) are required for eligibility to adopt from Labrador Retriever Rescue of Florida.",

BUT, I was a pet at some point because I already know sit and paw. Guess what else... I am also potty trained and I keep my crate clean. Kind of a big deal I am told. People are wonderful! I love to give kisses and cuddle. Car rides are fun too! I think I would LOVE adventures!! I can be a little selective with my dog friends so doing slow intros makes me feel the most comfortable and I tend to like male dogs more. I am about 3 years old and weigh about 50lbs. My coat is a beautiful brindle. Some other things I like are toys, treats, and playing dress up. I am looking for a permanent home.\n\nOur adoption fee is $260 for dogs over 5 months of age and includes all vaccinations, spay/neuter, micro chip implantation and registration/transfer, heartworm test and much more. Puppies up to 5 months of age are $275 and this includes all sets of puppy vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip implantation and registration and more. To adopt, go to www.fosterpetoutreach.org to complete an application.\nPlease note: Foster Pet Outreach tries to limit our adoptions to an area within approximately 60 miles of Peoria, Illinois.",

Despite all this, he's one big pile of mush who thinks he's a little itty-bitty pile of mush-his favorite place is a lap and his favorite treat is a belly rub. He trusts and loves people and gets along well with other dogs. This brave boy is definitely ready for his second chance.",
