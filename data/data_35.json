Submit an adoption application here:  www.misunderstoodmutts.org/adopt\n\nPearl is shy and timid at first, but once she settles in she is a sweet and affectionate lap dog. She loves to snuggle and burrow under blankets, but also likes to explore the backyard and go on walks. \n\nPearl has been learning how to be a dog from her foster brother, and would do well with a doggie companion. She\u2019s fine with cats. Since joining her foster home, Pearl has been crate training, potty training, and learning to walk on a leash, and progressing really well. She\u2019s very nervous on car rides and in new places, so she needs a patient human to continue to grow her confidence  exposing her to the world.\n\nPearl is approximately 1.5 yrs old and weighs 8 pounds.  She is fostered in Bellingham, WA.  Her adoption fee is $425.\n\nWe are unable to adopt into Canada unless you have the ability to cross the border.\n\n**Only completed applications will be considered.

He is current on vaccinations and is heartworm negative.\n\nHe is not doing well, he is barking and jumping in his kennel so people cannot see his true self. Please keep sharing Kurt, HE SERIOUSLY NEEDS OUR HELP!\n\nMeet Kurt! His good looks have created interest but he has had no visitors.\nYou see Kurt is reactive to other dogs in the Shelter and has to be the only dog in the household. Kurt is young and may adjust to other dogs with training. Kurt is very treat and praise motivated!\n\nWhen you look into Kurt's eyes you see a gentle soul. When you spend time with Kurt you will find he is smart, loyal, loving and can be a playful funny goofball.\n\nOn Kurt's outing he walked great on leash, loved the water, likes to both run or walk and is game to just chill on the grass next to you for a couple belly rubs. Kurt knows, sit, shake and wait. Kurt loves car rides and pupichinos! He is mostly quite the polite gentlemen. See video in comments.  \n\nKurt will on occasion jump for treats or play so will be better suited for older children.  \n\nHugging Kurt and receiving gentle kisses in return made my heart swell. Kurt is truly a wonderful dog.\n\n",

I have been described to be very friendly. **Please apply on our website at indy.gov/activity/adopt-a-pet. Go to the website, click on the adoption application link, enter the information and hit submit. After the application is submitted a staff member will contact you within 48 hours. You can include multiple animals you are interested in on one application. Thank you for your interest in adopting one of our FABULOUS PETS! We hope to see you soon, The IACS Adoptions Team.",

Tulip is house trained and gets along well with other dogs. She enjoys going for car rides and especially likes an occasional drive-through snack! Tulip is a mellow, affectionate lady that walks well on a leash but would also enjoy a fenced yard for exploring. She has undergone surgery to remove various lumps and bumps but is now in excellent health. \nPlease contact us if you would like to know more about Tulip!",

As it was obvious when she arrived that that she recently had a litter and her milk was starting to dry up.\n\nShe loves everyone she meets! She's super sweet and very lovey-dovey. She likes to give kisses and enjoys being around people! Happy, playful, tail-wagging sweetheart is who she is. She did well with other dogs on leash. \n\nMiss Paris is about 5-6 years old. She is a stunning blue brindle girl with the cutest ears! She weighs about 48lbs.\n\nShe was far too interested in the chickens at her foster home so we don't think she'll do good with small animals. (However, she hasn't been cat tested)\n\nWe would love to see this joyful girl go to a home where she will be spoiled by her forever family. Ideally a family that doesn't mind puppy kisses or a doggy shadow in the home. As we are willing to bet like many pittie/staffe type dogs she will be a velcro doggie and follow you around the house. If you'd like to adopt Miss Paris please apply at our website listed below...\n\n\nAPPLY AT: www.NBArescue.com",

He is dog selective (but I haven't had any issues at all) he will stay in a crate when I am away or outside. He is food motivated so it will be important to not over feed or overtreat him too. He would do best in a home where he could be with his owner most of he day. He likes to be close to his owner. He should not be placed in a home with children. He's ready to be someone's lap dog. He is selective even with people. \nSubmit an application online at: https://oneloveanimalrescue.com/pre-adoption-application/",

Unfortunately she didn't come from a good home and was left caged for hours on end for months and they gave her up because she was acting like a puppy who didn\u2019t have an outlet for her energy.\n\nShe's a very happy girl but definitely a busy girl who is jumpy. She's at that puppy stage where she wants to put her mouth and teeth on everything toys, hands, and sometimes things she's not supposed to. \n\nShe'll need some training with repetitive redirection by placing toys in her mouth to show her what to chew on. She's very playful and love toys so the redirection tactic works well with her. She seems to be teething so with some patience and determination she\u2019ll be the best pup!\n\nDelilah is she already knows sit and listens very well and quickly to that command. She also is crate trained! She knows how to sit and stay and wait for you to put her food bowl down and waits for you to give her the okay. She\u2019s a fast learner and just wants to please you!\n\n She is mostly potty trained but still has some accidents. Delilah loves people and wants to meet everyone! She just needs a family that can give her and outlet for her energy and work on training with her.\n\nBecause she still needs training she isn\u2019t a good fit for a home with small children but older children that can help with training or play fetch with her in the backyard would be great! She loves to play fetch!!!\n\n Please submit an application via www.NBArescue.com",

My ID number is 336175\n\nI am available for adoption; however due to my breed my adoption will have to be facilitated through a rescue organization. Please see the front desk staff or contact the Shelter at (248) 858-1070 for more information.\n\nMeet Pickles! Talk about a TANK!!! Pickles is the coolest, most studly dude at the Shelter! He came to us, after being found wandering the streets, assembling his posse...just kiddin! Pickles is uniquely colored, happy to meet people, strong and looking for just the right person! He looks forward to joining a home where his new owner will be dedicated to continuing his training! Pickles is a great guy, who deserves to be in an awesome home!\n\nThe following descriptions describe behaviors that were observed during testing and/or veterinary examination: Evaluated for temperament with 336121 (female), and 335966 (male). Did very well with both. He is a large, strong dog with no leash training. He WILL PULL. Recommend basic training for this dog 1/8/2021\n\nAmerican Pit Bulls are a misunderstood breed; for this reason, we implore adopters to these beautiful dogs to be very vigilant in training and socialization. This breed is very energetic and will need daily exercise. Because of their strength and energy, apartment living may not be the best fit. This breed can be loving, loyal and very smart. \n\nThe above behaviors and personality traits have been observed while at the Shelter. If this animal was relinquished, information is gathered from the owner regarding behavior. Our wonderful volunteers spend time with these animals and give input on behaviors and traits. However, this description may not be all inclusive to how this animal will act in a loving forever home. Introduction to established family pets should be slow and monitored always. The same goes for children and other family members. Adopting a pet is a big decision and should be thoughtful. We suggest researching different breeds to match traits and personalities to your lifestyle. When adopting a pet, please know that this pet will be with you for their lifetime; patience and consistency will make for a successful adoption.\n\n**Age is estimated** \n Primary Color: Tan Secondary Color: White Weight: 96.5lbs Age: 1yrs 0mths 1wks Animal has been Neutered",

Goose is one of the happiest, friendliest dogs you could ever meet, and is always making the volunteers and staff smile with her goofy personality. Her favorite pastimes include doing \"zoomies\" around the yard, playing with toys, and trying to find a way to get closer to you. She's an expert at giving kisses and snuggling, so if you're looking for a cuddle buddy, this girl is the best! Goose has met other dogs and has shown to be playful in short spurts, but she will need to be the ONLY animal in her next home, as her play style can quickly escalate and may cause a tussle. Goose's ideal home is one with a yard where she can run, jump and play as your one and only. Goose is the type of dog who will cheer you up on the worst of days and be your loyal best friend for life. If you're reading this and its describing what you've been searching for, Goose is waiting for you!\n Primary Color: White Secondary Color: Black Weight: 65lbs Age: 1yrs 0mths 3wks Animal has been Spayed",

Holle is house trained, walks well on a leash, and has some obedience training. While Holle loves to play with puppies and other dogs, she really wants to be an only child. Holle finds sharing her toys simply annoying and she will be best suited in a home where she has all the things, love, and attention to herself! Holle is around 40 lbs and is currently located in Greeley. Her adoption fee is $400. REQUIREMENTS: 1. Only dog home 2. Fenced in yard 3. No BSL areas.  You can apply for Holle at https://milehighcanine.org/forms-and-applications/mhcr-adoption-application/.",

DELLA is a gorgeous young Australian Cattle Dog mix looking for a furever home with an endless supply of peanut butter-filled Kongs. She is 10-12 months old and 26 lbs. Della is an active girl that loves to run and play and needs a furever home with a physically fenced yard. She'd also make a great running/hiking companion. Della is housebroken and still working on crate training. She is okay with kids, but we don't recommend herding breed dogs to homes with small children who may not enjoy being herded. She's fine with other dogs, no cats for Della. We prefer to send herding breed dogs to homes with some herding breed experience. We don't recommend herding dogs to first-time dog owners, and will not send her to an apartment.\n\nAll of our fully-vetted adoptable dogs go to prospective homes for a one-week trial foster-to-adopt period to make sure the dog and home are the right fit before an adoption is finalized. We only adopt dogs into homes where all current pets are spayed/neutered and current on vaccines and heartworm and flea and tick prevention. We do check veterinary references to make sure adopters are compliant with standard veterinary care.",

The world was big and scary but she tackled her fears one step at a time! Now that she has blossomed into a confident girl, she's on the search for her forever home! \n\nMaisie can be a bit shy when meeting new people however, does great meeting new friends when rewarded with treats! She is very food and toy motivated and works hard to please her people. Maisie does best with boundaries so she can know what to expect from her foster family and avoid any sort of guessing games. She is working on her obedience training and her future family should be committed to expanding her list of known tricks! She loves to learn and gains more confidence with every new command. She does fantastic in her crate and is potty trained. She enjoys going for walks and playing in the backyard. Maisie LOVES toys and will pull every toy out of the toy bin before selecting the perfect toy to play with. She likes lounging on the couch with her foster family and playing fetch with her toys, although she's still working on bringing them back! Maisie prefers to eat in her crate, but comes right back out after she's finished to continue playing. While Maisie is a bit nervous in the car, she's getting more and more comfortable with each ride. Small children's loud noises and quick movements can be quite intimidating, so Maisie is looking for a home with older children who can be respectful of her space during her acclimation period. She would love a home where she can be your one and only pet.\n\nMaisie is a happy and playful pup who can't wait to find her forever home. If you want to make her a part of your family, apply online today! Her adoption fee is $250.",

            "description": "Darling Beth is available for adoption again! <3\n\n\"Beth seems to match the energy of the room. In my house she is very active and tries to play with my cat all the time. But when the cats are out of reach, she seems to be calmer. She is a big hugger, loves belly rubs and snuggles. She also will follow her person everywhere and loves to go places with them.\"\n\nBeth originally came to us when she had her babies in the shelter. Sadly, the shelter is no place for newborns, and she lost all but two by the time they came into rescue with us. Thankfully her pups Rip and Chief Rainwater have been adopted and are doing great in their new homes. Beth ended up being heart-worm positive so she stayed with us a few more months before eventually being adopted. Here, she became a Colorado girl and has a best friend in the form of a cat. Beth is really missing another doggie playmate which is why she is coming back into rescue. She can be pretty energetic, and her owner doesn't feel she can give her the exercise she needs. It was decided that she would come back with us, so we could find her a more active family with another playful dog. \n\nBeth is a 2 year old female Labrador Retriever mix. We are not sure what else she is mixed with. She currently weighs around 70lbs and won't be getting much bigger. Beth is a people lover. Actually she loves everyone, people and animals alike. She is friendly when meeting new people. She is a social butterfly and does great in public settings. Beth's playful is on the more active and playful side. For the most part, she matches the energy of the household, though. Beth has excellent house manners and can be trusted with free-roam of the house. She has not chewed up anything in her fosters home. \n\nBeth isn't a fetch player, but she does like chasing the dogs as the go fetch the ball. We are unsure if Beth is a water dog or not. Beth isn't a big fan of toys, but does like to chew on bones. Beth has not shown to have any signs of food aggression in her foster home. She also does not resource guard things. Beth will give you hugs when she gets excited. Beth rides well in the car, and does good on road trips. Beth does well on walks, but could use some more working with. She gets easily distracted by squirrels and tries to take you with her to go meet them ;) Beth can be vocal at times. When her fosters or away or at night, Beth has free-roam of the house and does great. Beth is potty trained, but does not have any experience with being kenneled. \n\nBeth is a really amazing girl, and anyone who adopts her is going to be so in love with this girl. Before you apply to adopt her, here are some things to note\n\n-Beth does great with other dogs. She loves to play with them. It would be best if her new family had another playful dog in her new home. However, if her family were on the more active side and home most of the day she would be fine as an only dog. \n\n-Beth does good with cats. She does try to play with them, especially if there are no doggie friends present. \n\n-Beth does great around kids of all ages. With that said, they need to be respectful of her space. She would not appreciate being lied on, her ears/tail being pulled, etc. \n\n-Beth really needs a home with good sized yard, and/or active people. She likes to watch what's going on outside and will bark if anyone or anything is on the other side of the fence (good guardian). She loves to chase bikes at the dog park. If a bike rides by on the opposite side of the fence, she will race it (and she always wins). \n\n-Beth is being fostered in Englewood, CO. Adopters are responsible for picking up their new dog, even if they are out of state. \n\nHopefully at this point you have decided that Beth is the girl for you! If that is the case, you can apply to adopt her at https://www.pyrpawsandfluffytailsrescue.com/adoption-app\n\nHer adoption fee is $225 and that will include her vaccinations, spay, and microchip. It will also include her heart-worm treatment. She will also be current on heart-worm and flea/tick prevention.",

I am an 11-12 month old Pittie that came to SVASC as a stray and was never reclaimed, so now I'm hoping to start over fresh with you. What do ya say? \n\nWhen I first arrived at SVASC, I was terrified of everyone and everything. It's hard coming to a new place with all sorts of scary noises and smells. Thankfully, shelter staff are willing to take things slow and let dogs blossom at their own pace... and that's really what I did! After about 2 weeks here, I am a totally different dog and am full of spunk. I am still pretty nervous around new people, but I do warm up and am worth getting to know. Please just give me some time when you meet me and don't get too scared away by my bark. I promise that I'm a big love!\n\nI do get on pretty well with other dogs and may even be more confident if there was another confident, well-socialized, and established dog in the home for me to learn from. I would love to meet any future pals before going home please. I would do best in a home without any small kiddos or kids younger than teenagers. Once I warm up, I have all the energy of a young Pittie and turn into an adorable wrecking ball, so I would likely not be suited for a home with small kids. \n\nMy adoption fee is $125 to an approved adopter. If you would like more information on me, please give SVASC a call at (540) 943-5142 or stop by the shelter during open hours. SVASC is located at 1001 Mt. Torrey Rd. Lyndhurst, VA.\"",

Oskar currently lives in a home with 3 other dogs; and frequently has service dogs-in-training spending time in our home so he\u2019s met many dogs over the past year.

He could benefit from some positive socialization and a good diet plan.  This big guy will need lots of exercise/playtime and a warm bed at night.  We recommend a supervised meeting with Max for any resident dogs prior to adoption. \n\nPlease note:\n\nAt this time, our dog kennels are open for general visitation without a prior appointment. We will, however, be limiting the number of persons in the kennel area at one time, and we appreciate your patience.\n\nVisits with cats and/or critters still require that an appointment be made in advance. To schedule your appointment, please call us at (703) 792-6465, or email us at animalshelter@pwcgov.org.\n\nAll persons will be required to wear a face mask when visiting the PWC Animal Shelter. This requirement complies with Governor Ralph Northam's Executive Order No.63 (https://bit.ly/2AnqGXd).",

My name is Topaz. I am heartworm positive, but don't let that deter you! I will be completely healthy again very soon. Since I have heartworm right now, I'm available through the foster to adopt program.\n\nSince Topaz is heartworm positive. He/She will need to be treated in at our clinic in Princeton.\n\nHeartworm treatment consists of 3 injections. The first injection will be in roughly 30 days after coming into rescue. The the 2nd and 3rd injections happen 30 days after that. When a dog is going through heartworm treatment, they should be on \"restrictions\", meaning a lot of lap time, crate time and always on a leash. Heartworm disease is NOT contagious, it is transported via mosquitos.\n\nHere is a great article explaining what heartworm is and how it's treated: https://www.heartwormsociety.org/pet-owner-resources/heartworm-basics\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal.\n\nAll Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs).\n\nRuff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue. Animals are located in homes throughout Minnesota. We do not have a facility where animals are kept.\n\nRuff Start Rescue Adoption Policies: http://www.ruffstartrescue.org/info/display?PageID=11744",

I love to learn and have already learned a lot at the shelter - I respond well to snacks and attention, so training will be lots of fun.

Cari can be very shy at first but once she warms up to you, she is all about belly rubs. Cari does not get along with other dogs and is mildly tolerant of cats, as long as they leave her alone. Cari does not get along with farm animals and her prey drive is high. Cari would do best in a home with either no animals or older cats that will give her space. Cari loves to snuggle and get wrapped up in blankets on the couch and bed. Cari is housetrained and will sit on command. Cari is looking for her new forever home after finding out life on the farm was not for her. Cari is up to date on her rabies shot.\n\nContact information:\n\ntext/message: 704 978-8614\nemail: kvrchoticky1@gmail.com\n\ntext is the best way to contact me\n\nWe are located in Asheboro, NC but would be willing to meet someone if interested.\n",

This dog is also tested with other dogs, kennel-trained, and housebroken. We would love for you to meet this dog and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: While we typically host weekly Saturday adoption events, in order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment and/or adoption handoff. Appointments and handoffs are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, adoption appointments and handoffs are only offered for individual animals. When adopting at an appointment, please be aware that you will be taking the animal home that day. We can not hold animals to be picked up at a later date.\n\nDue to CDC's recommended COVID-19 protocols, we are highly encouraging foster homes and adopters to speak with one another via phone or video chat to ensure compatible matches and limit in-person contact. If meeting in person, our foster homes are encouraged to wear masks, socially distance, and choose an outdoor meeting spot. Should you want to proceed forward with the adoption, all adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees are to be completed electronically. Quick and low-contact animal handoff is also being encouraged amongst foster homes and adopters. As always, we include a one-week trial period with all our adoptions.\u00a0***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption!

He loves playing with his canine friends & toys at his foster home and has become the sweetest little snuggle bug. Rhino is very food motivated and earns the way to his heart. A home without children and without lots of visitors coming and going would be ideal for Rhino.

            "description": "Melvin is a 2-year-old English Bulldog rescued from a high-kill shelter. This dog is current on vaccinations, microchipped, 4dx/heartworm tested, and spayed/neutered. This dog is also tested with other dogs, kennel-trained, and housebroken. Melvin would do best in a home without young children and medium to large-sized male dogs. We would love for you to meet this dog and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: While we typically host weekly Saturday adoption events, in order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment and/or adoption handoff. Appointments and handoffs are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, adoption appointments and handoffs are only offered for individual animals. When adopting at an appointment, please be aware that you will be taking the animal home that day. We can not hold animals to be picked up at a later date.\n\nDue to CDC's recommended COVID-19 protocols, we are highly encouraging foster homes and adopters to speak with one another via phone or video chat to ensure compatible matches and limit in-person contact. If meeting in person, our foster homes are encouraged to wear masks, socially distance, and choose an outdoor meeting spot. Should you want to proceed forward with the adoption, all adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees are to be completed electronically. Quick and low-contact animal handoff is also being encouraged amongst foster homes and adopters. As always, we include a one-week trial period with all our adoptions.\u00a0***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption! If you would like more information on our organization please visit our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org.",

            "description": "Jig is an 80 lb. shepherd mix who made the trip to Michigan from Humane Society of the Delta in Arkansas. He is a majestic boy, a gentle giant and great with humans of all shapes and sizes. He is a bit of an introvert and likes lots of alone time throughout the day. That all changes when it's time to go for a walk -- he gets SO excited and will jump up as soon as you make a move for your coat. And jump is not an exaggeration, he really gets some air! \n\nJig loves all the interesting sights and sounds outside and sprints to find the source when he smells something interesting. Although he enjoys being introduced to new people, he is not a fan of most dogs he meets while out and about, and shows his fearfulness by barking at them.\n\nJig can't get enough of digging treats out of his snuffle mat. It's one of his favorite things to do. Every now and then he gets in the mood to play and when he does, he's all in! Some of his favorite things to do are playing tug of war, chasing balls, and trying to catch treats in the air.\n\nJig is heartworm positive and will have his first treatment at the end of January, and will need a family who will support him through his second treatment at the end of February. Costs for the treatments are paid for by Hearts of Hope.\n\nJig is a super sweet boy who you can't help but love! He is neutered, chipped and up to date on vaccines. His adoption fee is $250.",

Don't know why. It just has a mind of its own! I also have these super cute, old man eyebrows. They're pretty adorable and sure to melt your heart! I am also a very affectionate dog, and LOVE to cuddle. I'd rather cuddle with my person than just about anything else. I like other doggos and those kitties, too, and wouldn't mind having a furry playmate--as long as they're low-energy, like me. My foster's teaching me all about this crate-training thing. I'm very eager to please and working hard to get it down, and I know I'll have it perfected soon. I'm smart like that. I already know \"sit\" and \"shake,\" and not to pull on the leash, and I won't freak out or destroy your things when you leave me to do your human things. Yep, I'm a good boy. If you've fallen for my adorableness and charm, fill out an application so we can meet! ...",

Wally's been good with other dogs while at the shelter and with us, but we don't know how he'll be around any feline friends. He loves people, though! Keep in mind, Wally's a hound, which means he thinks with his nose first, needs a six foot privacy fence for safety, and absolutely LOVES going for walks. He's still working on his leash skills and house training at this time, but with his intelligence, he'll have them mastered in no time. To meet Wally, fill out an application today! ...",

She doesnt love her crate and is smart enough to get out of it when left alone. She is mostly housebroken, shes only had a few accidents in her foster house. Roxy loves to snuggle and always wants to be with her humans. She would love someone that is home more than they are gone. Roxy is a strong girl, and due to her size, a house with no little humans would be best. She can jump a fence so a 6 foot fence or leash work is required. Roxy is still working on walking on a leash and is very strong so someone that can handle her and work with her while shes is learning work will be needed. Roxy is great with her canine foster brother. \n\nHer fosters favorite thing about her is how smart and responsive when learning new things \n\nIf you are interested in Roxy please apply at https://www.nickelcitycaninerescue.org/adopt-a-dog or message the rescue if you are already pre-approved.",

He absolutely loves to ride in the car! Speaking of cars they are super exciting to Copper and he has a tendency to want to chase them so he would benefit from a fenced in yard or leash walks. Before coming to HSOW Copper tore both of his ACL ligaments in his knees. Because of this if he over does it he will limp some. For this reason Copper is looking for a home where he can be a couch potato with short walks and playtime outside and maybe lots of car rides! He is on joint supplements to help keep with the arthritis from his previous injury. He doesn't do well with cats and would need to meet any potential dog family members.

Luckily, a good Samaritan brought them to the emergency clinic then they were transferred to us for continued care. \n\nJan and Marcia are the perfect pair.  They love each other fiercely and will cuddle, play, and groom each other.  They also love people and adore being pet and picked up.  Their sweet and gentle nature make them so easy to love!\n\nUnfortunately, Jan was found with extensive burns across the right side of her face.  We do not know what happened to her.  Luckily, her skin is healing well, but her damaged eye had to be removed surgically.  She is much more comfortable now!  She also had several mammary tumors removed surgically.  She has heart disease and her remaining eye also needs medicated drops to treat dry eye. We require her adopter to have a close relationship with their vet to monitor her health closely. Despite all of her medical conditions, she is still full of life and deserves to find a home that will spoil her and her sister!\n\nAre you looking to add these sisters to your life?  Call the Saratoga County Animal Shelter at (518) 885-4113 ext 0 to make an appointment.",

She has lived in a home for 9 months but has been surrendered along with ,Nubby because they are too active for the senior dogs in the home. We're told Niecee is good with other pets and likes kids. She is settling in at the shelter, and while she's coming around, she is nervous and will need an adopter who will be extremely patient with her while she adjusts. Because she is so nervous and cautious at this time, we are recommending kids for her be at least 12 and older, but this could change when she's more comfortable. Niecee needs a secured fenced in yard, for supervised exercise and playtime, and the rest of her time should be spent indoors.\n\nNiecee is current on basic vaccinations including Bordetella, been dewormed and is microchipped. She has tested Negative for Heartworms. \n\nNiecee has already been spayed and her Rabies vaccination is current until May 2021..\n\nFor more information, please contact the City of Corsicana Animal Shelter at (903) 654-4928. The shelter is open Mon, Tues, Thurs and Fri from 12:00pm - 6:00pm and on Sat from 12:00pm - 4:00pm.",

These boys are extra special and are looking for extra special homes. Trigger, Jordan, and Sherman are the 3 surviving puppies of 5 born to the litter with Mega Esophagus. Once the breeder and his vet discovered what was going on, it was too late for 2 of the pups. But he was able to sustain these three boys until he could find a rescue to accept them. Once with MHCR, the boys took a trip to CSU in hopes their Mega E was the operable kind. It was not. ?. The good news is, when properly managed, puppies and dogs with Mega E live long and wonderful lives. Their forever families will need to understand Mega E and embrace the routine of upright feeding. Luckily, we\u2019ve been fortunate enough to secure Bailey chairs for the pups that will accompany them to their forever homes. Please, do your research. Make sure you have the time and commitment to care for these pups! We know their cuteness may cause uncontrollable urges to apply - trust us - we get it! They\u2019re irresistible! https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/megaesophagus.  You can apply for Sherman at https://milehighcanine.org/forms-and-applications/mhcr-adoption-application/.",

These boys are extra special and are looking for extra special homes. Trigger, Jordan, and Sherman are the 3 surviving puppies of 5 born to the litter with Mega Esophagus. Once the breeder and his vet discovered what was going on, it was too late for 2 of the pups. But he was able to sustain these three boys until he could find a rescue to accept them. Once with MHCR, the boys took a trip to CSU in hopes their Mega E was the operable kind. It was not. ?. The good news is, when properly managed, puppies and dogs with Mega E live long and wonderful lives. Their forever families will need to understand Mega E and embrace the routine of upright feeding. Luckily, we've been fortunate enough to secure Bailey chairs for the pups that will accompany them to their forever homes. Please, do your research. Make sure you have the time and commitment to care for these pups! We know their cuteness may cause uncontrollable urges to apply - trust us - we get it! They're irresistible! https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/megaesophagus.  You can apply for Jordan at https://milehighcanine.org/forms-and-applications/mhcr-adoption-application/.",

Snowy was rescued from death row after being dumped at a high kill shelter by his former person. This beautiful boy is so sweet despite everything he's been through. He loves when you pet his fluffy coat and scratch behind his ears. Snowy has been doing very well in his foster home and is slowly gaining some much needed weight. His forever family will need to be patient with him and provide him with a schedule so he can get the hang of home life, but he really is learning things quickly. He has been good with other dogs and didn't seem to mind cats. He has strong breed tendencies and will be an amazing guardian for his family. Snowy will need a forever family that is familiar with guardian breeds and a large fenced yard for him to stretch his legs and patrol. His ideal home will be on the quieter side without a lot of traffic in and out. We adore this fluffy marshmallow and have promised him the loving forever family he deserves... could it be yours??\n\nInterested in adopting?

Boone is an 8 month old male mixed breed puppy who was pulled from a hoarding case with 20+ other dogs, and is now looking for the perfect forever home! \n\nBoone and his litter mates are all very sweet dogs who simply need an owner who can help them learn \"how to be a dog\". By that, we mean some of the skills and experiences that most dogs learn throughout their lives are often lost on dogs who were living in situations like this. They were likely not exposed to the majority of the outside world, and all they knew was how to survive alongside their pack mates. Because of this, Boone will require a patient, loving and understanding family who will devote lots of time and attention to his needs. While we realize it's sad to think about the life they lived before, it's important not to dwell on that, and to simply give him the best chance at becoming a happy, healthy adult dog by simply focusing on the future! \n\nBoone will require training as he does not yet know how to walk on a leash, or any commands quite yet. He is also not potty trained yet, but we recommend utilizing a crate to help him with this transition. With plenty of consistency and reward, we know he'll catch on! Basic obedience classes in a setting with an instructor who is skilled at working with shy dogs is also recommended. \n\nBoone will likely do best in a home with another dog. He is used to living in a pack, and will probably follow the lead of the dog that he lives with. We also think he'll do fine around children and kitties as long as he's properly introduced.\n\nIf you have the time, patience and love for a dog who needs a little extra TLC, Boone would be happy to join your family! Boone is neutered and fully vaccinated. His adoption fee is $150.00",

            "description": "Nubby- Male/Neutered Lab/Rottie Mix  Color: Black & Tan 10 months old 58 lbs.\nID# D-40054\n\nNubby is a 3-legged dog who was found as a stray at about a month old, with only a nub for his right front leg, (most likely born that way). He has a very sweet demeanor, loves people and gets along with other well mannered dogs. He is hesitant and timid, he needs confidence building, especially since he's trying to adjust to living in the shelter. He and his sister, Niecee were given up by their owner after 9 months because they were more active than the senior dogs in the home, which was causing the senior dogs stress. Nubby loves kids but needs a family with lots of patience and understanding to give this guy time to fit in and adjust. He needs a secured , fenced yard for some supervised exercise and play time, and the rest of his time, needs to be indoors. He appears to be housebroken. We have listed the best age of kids for him to be about 10 years old. \n\nNubby is current on basic vaccinations including Bordetella, been dewormed and is microchipped. He has tested Negative for Heartworms. \n\nNubby is already neutered and his Rabies vaccination is current until May 2021..\n\nFor more information, please contact the City of Corsicana Animal Shelter at (903) 654-4928. The shelter is open Mon, Tues, Thurs and Fri from 12:00pm - 6:00pm and on Sat from 12:00pm - 4:00pm.",

She loved the kids in her home and does well with women and other dogs. Bailey is house trained, crated when alone, and although she\u2019s shy at first when things get overwhelming, she\u2019s loyal and affectionate with her family. Bailey needs an adopter who will know she\u2019s scared at first and go slowly and have patience while she learns people can be trusted. Bailey so badly wants someone to be consistent and kind and love her. Ideally a fenced yard, but if not, someone who walks or has another canine companion. Please go to http://www.homewardboundrescue.com/dogs/ for the application. Bailey is arriving from out of state Feb. 6th and ideally could go right home for a trial then. Her fee of $450 plus tax covers spay, shots, heart-worm test, worming and chip.",

Chamilla is a little shy and cautious, very soft and gentle personality, acts as though someone treated her poorly before as she seems to wait for someone to hurt her. She does follow the other dogs with something similar to hero-worship, she is comforted by them, and does require a fenced yard for her safety as she is scared until she knows she\u2019s home. If you sit down she climbs into your lap and tucks her head under your chin. This poor girl was previously a stray so not a lot is known. She appears to be house trained but is in a foster who knows dogs well and has a routine and is crated when alone. She tries so hard to be brave, and we see her blossoming. Cats are unknown, although we haven\u2019t seen a reason to suspect she\u2019d be bad. Please go to http://www.homewardboundrescue.com/dogs/ for the application. Chamilla is arriving from out of state Feb. 6th and ideally could go right home for a trial then. Her fee of $450 plus tax covers spay, shots, heart-worm test, worming and chip.",

We are thinking this beautiful girl is a Labrador Retriever mix around 1 year old.\n\nMisa is friendly with all of us humans but may act a little shy at first, but give her just a little time and she will best your new best friend! She is also shy around children and thus don't recommend her for a family with young active kids but an older child (teenager) in the home might be fine if patient, relatively quiet, and not overbearing. She is friendly with other dogs and would make a great addition to a household as the only dog or as a buddy to existing family dogs. Misa is only mildly interested in cats and for the most part tends to ignore them.\n\nWe don't know much about her upbringing and a potential adopter will need to go slow with Misa, work on socialization, give her plenty of exercise, and provide training and structure as she transitions to life in a forever home. She would do best in a low-key household without much foot traffic.\n\nMisa needs an adopter who is committed to keeping her world small until she starts to settle in. The adopter should plan to limit visitors to the home, leave the dog at home (crated - not loose!) rather than taking her to parties, soccer games, dog parks, etc, and focus on building a bond through structure and moderate obedience training.\n\nShe doesn't appear to have much training and is just getting started on house training, crate training, and leash training and so far, so good! A fenced yard would be ideal so Misa could run and play safely, but if that's not available she'll need lots of leash walks and opportunities for off-leash play in a fenced area.\n\nMisa is a happy girl who just wants a loving forever home. Can you make her dream come true? Fill out an application today and let her know that you'd love to have her join your family!\n\nMisa's story: She was found as a stray with two littermates.\n\nAdoption Fee: $585\n\nTo apply for this dog, fill out an adoption application on our website: www.sosarl.org/aa/\n\n**Additional info you should know - For most of our dogs, we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each of our dogs as an individual and do our best to describe and place them based on personality not breed label. Some dogs may not yet be in New England, nor ready for immediate adoption. There may be additional vetting, quarantine, waiting periods and/or fees depending upon your state of residence. If you have questions or concerns on any of this, you can discuss this with your Adoption Counselor.",

            "description": "**Adoption Pending**\n\nMeet Bubba! Bubba is an 8 month old male mixed breed puppy who was pulled from a hoarding case with 20+ other dogs, and is now looking for the perfect forever home!\n\nBubba and his litter mates are all very sweet dogs who simply need an owner who can help them learn \"how to be a dog\". By that, we mean some of the skills and experiences that most dogs learn throughout their lives are often lost on dogs who were living in situations like this. They were likely not exposed to the majority of the outside world, and all they knew was how to survive alongside their pack mates. Because of this, Bubba will require a patient, loving and understanding family who will devote lots of time and attention to his needs. While we realize it's sad to think about the life they lived before, it's important not to dwell on that, and to simply give him the best chance at becoming a happy, healthy adult dog by simply focusing on the future!\n\nBubba will require training as he does not yet know how to walk on a leash, or any commands quite yet. He is also not potty trained yet, but we recommend utilizing a crate to help him with this transition. With plenty of consistency and reward, we know he'll catch on! Basic obedience classes in a setting with an instructor who is skilled at working with shy dogs is also recommended.\n\nBubba will likely do best in a home with another dog. He is used to living in a pack, and will probably follow the lead of the dog that he lives with. We also think he'll do fine around children and kitties as long as he's properly introduced.\n\nIf you have the time, patience and love for a dog who needs a little extra TLC, Bubba would be happy to join your family! Boone is neutered and fully vaccinated. His adoption fee is $150.00",

If you see a pet you are interested in please call the Franklin Township Animal Shelter at: (732)-873-2500 ext. 6255 and leave a message with your name, phone number, and the name of the pet you are interested in.\n\nYou must leave a message so that we can return your call to schedule an appointment. Listings are updated on a weekly basis.\n\nDon't be fooled by his serious expression, Dutch is a sweet and social dog around 10 years of age. He was surrendered to the Franklin Township Animal Shelter due to his old age --but he is a healthy, active dog who enjoys playing fetch and tug of war! Dutch knows basic commands and walks relatively well on a leash, but can be stubborn when he sets his scents on something. He would benefit from additional training in this area. Dutch can go to a home with older children, and cats if he is introduced to them properly. He can go to a home with other dogs, but would have to meet them first.\n\nOur adoption fee for dogs, cats, kittens, and rabbits is $60 per pet with a discount available for adopting two animals together. Cats, dogs, rabbits and kittens from the Franklin Township Animal Shelter are spayed/neutered. Cats, dogs, and kittens are microchipped, and up-to-date on all age-appropriate shots prior to adoption. Cats have also been tested for feline leukemia and FIV and dogs have been tested for heartworm. \n",

She\u2019s consider it a bonus if they had kids or another dog. Sarah was previously a stray so not a lot is known. She appears to be house trained, but is in a foster who knows dogs well and has a routine, and is crated when alone. She is outgoing and enjoys making friends. Cats are unknown, although we haven\u2019t seen a reason to suspect she\u2019d be bad. Please go to http://www.homewardboundrescue.com/dogs/ for the application. Sarah is arriving from out of state Feb. 6th and ideally could go right home for a trial then. Her fee of $500 plus tax covers spay, shots, heart-worm test, worming and chip.",

Calliope is ready to find a soft place to enjoy her golden years. She has a friendly, super sweet personality and loves lots of petting. She will be happy to sit at your feet while you watch tv and her tail will wag non-stop as she accompanies you on a daily walk. Regular meals and a few tasty treats will keep this girl content and devoted.\n\nThank you for your interest in adopting from Lab Rescue OK!\n\nThe FIRST STEP in the adoption process is to fill out a Adoption Application at www.labrescue.net.\n\nProcessing of a application usually takes 5-7 days. \n\n*** Labs are not placed on a first come, first approved basis.

His adopter saved him from euthanasia but in reality should not have adopted him. We commend the owner for trying! Tank is now temporarily living with a new family but apartment life is not ideal for Tank. Tank lost some toes at some point in his life but that has not kept him from playing and going on walks. Tank is an American/English Bulldog mix, approximately 6 years old and weighs about 55 pounds. The ideal home for Tank would be a home with older respectful children. His foster mama has a son that Tank adores!! Tank is not fond of the fosters dog so a home without another dog would be best. Tank is neutered, house trained (he goes to the door when he needs to potty!), currently up-to-date on vaccines and is microchipped. If you would like to give Tank his final and forever home, please call Mary at 346-253-8909. Application and small rehoming fee is required.",

He has already learned how fun going on walks can be! Now he's working on 'sit' and on perfecting his house-training. He's also crate trained but if it's OK with you, he would rather sleep with you. Jimmy gets along really well with other friendly, playful dogs, but his exuberance might not endear him to older dogs. You can see more pictures of this jolly pup in his online album at https://imageevent.com/newrattitude/jimmy .\nOur adoption fee is $175 for adult dogs or $225 for puppies under 6 months old.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog,\nPLEASE READ THE DETAILED ADOPTION PROCESS information on our website\nat www.\nNewRattitude.org/adopt/\n\nFrom there, you can access our adoption application or contact our Adoption Team for more info.",

He is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4499290.\n\nDoesn't Fabio have the most soulful eyes? When Fabio first came to the shelter, he came in with some wounds and they were not sure if he was hit by a car. He has recovered perfectly from his wounds and now he's ready to go home. He used to be shy when staff or volunteers took him out of his kennel to go for a walk but now he knows when someone comes, he gets to get out and sniff and explore his surroundings. He walks easily on a leash. He can be coaxed with treats, he loves them, and then he continues on. He knows how to \"sit\". He didn't like it when another dog did a face-to-face introduction and the shelter recommends that he be the only dog in the home. Fabio should go to a home with older children that understands he's been through a lot in his young life and needs to decompress and get used to a new home and new family. If you would like to meet Fabio, please bring the family and come and see him soon. Fabio has been at the shelter for over 60 days now and he is showing signs of stress by jumping up and down in his kennel. He cannot take being in the shelter much longer and would love to go home!!\n\nIf you are interested in saving this pet, please reach out via this link: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/BPAZ/Dog\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG.",

            "description": "Parker is a 5 yr old male shepherd/golden retriever mix that weighs 78# (vet says he needs to drop 5#).  He is a very handsome dog, and also very nice. Parker is friendly with the people and dogs he has met.  He gets along with the cat \u2013 although the cat thinks that his bushy tail is a toy for him to play with.  The cat will sit on a chair waiting for Parker to walk by so he can bat at Parker\u2019s tail \u2013 Parker ignores this attention.\n\nHe really enjoys his frequent trips to the dog park. At the park, he is very independent and will join up with a group chasing a tennis ball \u2013 often carrying it back to the person throwing it.  He will wander with a group of dogs, but usually not rough house or run with them. Although he does not come when called at the dog park, he will come when called at home. He gets along well with the resident dog - rough housing sometimes, play boxing, running, parallel sniffing.\n\nParker likes his food.  The two dogs are fed in separate rooms to allow the other dog enough time to eat.  The cat\u2019s food in on the mantel where Parker can\u2019t get at it.  He takes treats very roughly, so just to be safe he probably should go with older kids.  However, he does \u201csit\u201d when asked and easily catches a treat thrown to him. During the summer he would take tomatoes off the vine \u2013 green and red tomatoes.  Smartly, he left the hot peppers and herbs alone.\n\nAt night or nap-time Parker sleeps on the carpeted floor at the foot of the bed - sometimes he moves to the bare floor probably because he was hot.  He can get up on the bed, but doesn't sleep on the bed or even nap on the bed - perhaps because the resident dog has taken the spot.  He is usually somewhere in the same room with his foster during the day \u2013 laying by the desk or the couch. Thus far, he has only been left for 4 hrs, and is so well behaved that he doesn't need to be crated. Foster thinks he would be OK for up to 6 hrs, but not longer. \n\nDoesn't bark a lot - but will join in with the resident dog at barking at a noise outside the house.  Parker\u2019s bark is more of a talking noise. People walking by the house frequently comment on how good looking he is.  He usually greets people, often putting his feet on the top rail of the fence (a 4-foot fence). Parker likes to ride in the car, usually sitting in the front seat.  After a good run at the dog park he usually curls up in the back seat.  Opening the garage and the back door is all the invitation he needs to jump into the car. Walks nicely on leash. Does some shedding - not bad - might need some brushing.  Laid back, friendly to all, he is easy to have around. \n It appears that in the past he somehow injured his head because of the small scar on his lower eye lid, a kink in the left ear and an unusual look to one eye.  His left eye looks like it has a cataract - something the vet calls a partial incipient cataract ( covers less than 15% of the lens and doesn\u2019t affect vision)-  he has good eyesight and can chase balls and catch a tossed treat.\nParker came from Texas, and had a cough that was initially treated as kennel cough. The cough persisted, and with more testing he was ultimately diagnosed with lung worms (not common in MN).  The worms are gone (a  Baermann fecal test for Lungworm done on 11/12/20 was negative) , but there has been some scarring and inflammation to his lungs.  He is treated with a daily dosage of Prednisone, probably for his lifetime, which means he drinks a fair amount of water. This medication requires a prescription, but is relatively inexpensive.  The dose of prednisone is 20 mg/day, and with a script is very reasonable at CostCo - with membership, 30 tabs (a 1 month supply) is $8; without membership is $14 (you can use the CosCo pharmacy without a membership).  He should also be on a heartworm preventative year round. \nParker is neutered, and current on distemper and rabies vaccinations. He tested negative for heartworm disease. His microchip is registered to Second Chance. The adoption fee for this sweet, mellow, easy going dog is $295. Call 651-771-5662 if you have questions or would like to meet Parker. A vet reference is required.",

I'm now looking for a new home that will treat me like family. I am about 30 pounds and fairly young. I am very gentle and sweet, but can be a bit reactive when the other dogs are barking at me. Other than that Pet Savers doesn't know much about me. Could you be the one to give me a chance?\n\nFee $150If you are interested in adopting, please visit petsaversshreveport.org and find our adoption application under the 'Dogs' tab. Completed applications can be emailed to our Adoption Team at petsavers@petsaversshreveport.org - all adoptions require a vet reference. Please let us know if you have any questions or if you would like to set up a meet and greet with a specific dog.",

READ CAREFULLY. \n\nAll of our rescue are in foster homes and family pets.Thank you for choosing to adopt not buy. \nKoda is a two-year-old purebred Rottweiler. He is neutered, up-to-date on vaccines, microchip and house trained.  He needs an experienced Rottweiler home only. He needs a fenced in yard only no exceptions. He needs a large young playmate, he cannot be an only dog. And we prefer a home with no cats because while he is good with 1 of my cats he chases the others a d he does have a prey drive.  He is extremely protective of his people so he needs socialization to be continued after adoption. We do not know his exact past but he does suffer from some anxiety and is currently on anxiety meds which helped him a lot. He is fostered with four other dogs, three cats and three children ages 14, 11 and 6.  We do not want to place him in a home with children under the age of 5. He is a super cuddle bug at night time and must sleep in bed with you. He is almost perfect with his crate training. Before putting in an application you must speak with his foster. If The adoption proceeds you will put in an application and set up multiple meetings once your application is approved. \n\nHis adoption fee is $400.00 \n\n",

            "description": "Big Dog Lovers- Meet Toby!  This big goof ball is a one year old 70 pound mastiff/lab mix who can't understand why he is not called a lapdog!  Toby is playful with his foster fursiblings and kids.  As he doesn't know the meaning of personal space and may excitingly knock them down, over age 10 please.  Toby loves to run in the yard and then crash on his dog bed for an afternoon snooze. His leash skills need work (he gets nervous with street noises) we would like him to have a yard.  Toby will need some work on his manners but is smart and has come along way from the rural world he was wandering around it.  Toby would make a great buddy for your buddy.  He is housebroken and crate trained.  \n\nToby is neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative and up to date on age appropriate core vaccines. Adoption fee is $350. As with all rescue animals, breed determination cannot be validated without genetic testing. Visit www.tinymiraclesrescue.org and click on the APPLY tab for an overview of Tiny Miracles adoption process. Thanks for adopting and saving a life -- you are Toby's hero!",

My foster mom says I\u2019m just the silliest, happiest guy around! I just love everyone! I may have a bit of separation anxiety so someone who\u2019s home more than not would be best for me or at least a dog sibling so I don\u2019t get too lonely. I hate the crate but that\u2019s something I am working on. At bedtime I will curl up next to you and go right to sleep. I love kids but may be a bit to much for little ones as think I\u2019m tiny and might want to sit on them. I am very curious about the resident cat! I like to chase him and squirrels so I\u2019m not the best on a leash yet. But I\u2019m very treat motivated and eager to learn.

I have the cutest black heart nose! The resident dog is teaching me to how to play and be a dog! I like to play with her and chew toys so far. I do well in my crate. I\u2019m allowed to sleep wherever I want but I usually prefer to sleep on the floor or dog bed because that\u2019s what I\u2019m used to. I\u2019m as sweet as can be but might be to big for little kids. If I get excited I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll knock them down. Sometimes I chase the resident cat but most of the time I have no interest. I am working on not pulling hard on the leash! I am very strong! My mom says I should be easy to train because I\u2019m very treat motivated! If you are interested in adopting Gunner please complete an adoption application at www.oarwny.org. If you\u2019re already approved please email us at oarwny@gmail.com",

I would potentially do well in a home with other dogs or children. I am a quirky, goofy guy who sticks my tongue out when relaxed and cries like a little baby when I don't get my way. I really hope someone comes to adopt me soon, I just can't wait to find my paw-fect match!

She likes other dogs, but loves people and human interaction. She can also entertain herself by tossing her own tennis ball!  This easy going girl has lots of personality! We think she will  be a great addition to any family.\n\nWren is a beautiful chocolate color . We think she has the body of a Chocolate lab with a mastiff head! She is about 1-2 years old, fairly low to the ground but weighs 61 pounds. A big snuggler ready for her forever home!\n\nWren will be spayed, microchipped, vaccinated and up to date on heartworm and flea/tick preventative.

I\u2019m a handsome fawn Pug with an amazing personality that you just can\u2019t help but love!\n\nMy foster family describes me as an \u201coutgoing gentlemen\u201d and that is the truth! I am a well-mannered happy guy that loves making friends, human and doggy. I am a social guy and would love a forever home with a human that is home a lot or a doggy friend...or both! I know where to do my potty business. I have an old back injury so sometimes I have a little miss if I don\u2019t get outside fast enough, but this is a rare occasion as I do my very best! I love toys, like I need a large assortment so I won\u2019t get bored. I love sleeping in my crate on a dog bed. My foster family trusts me and doesn\u2019t even shut the door. I tuck myself in at night and at naptime.  \n\nObviously, I am amazing and you will love me so fill out an application ASAP to meet me: Biggie, the gentlemen Pug! \n\n",

She's a smart girl and knows sit, but will need someone to be a strong leader for her. She would do best in a home with older children (12 yrs +)\nRoxi seems ok with cats although slow intros with cats in a home are always required, and if there are other dogs in the home a meet and greet will need to be arranged. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting please email dogadoptions@thesanctuarypa.org to fill out an application and questionnaire.\nPlease be aware that we are all volunteers and we do not pre-approve applications nor do we hold onto applications, so please make copies of our application and questionnaire in case another application is chosen and you want to submit an application again in the future for another available dog.\nWe are open every Saturday to the public  from 10-2 to meet our dogs. Dog adoptions will not take place during that 10-2 timeframe and applications will only be taken on our available dogs that day. \nAlso please do not bring your own dogs during our Saturday open hours.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: At this time we are following CDC guidelines and practicing social distancing and wearing masks in our buildings \n\nHope to see you soon!!",

This is probably because this is where he feels safest, you see Presley has a fear of well EVERYTHING. We aren't sure why Presley jumps at his own shadow but needs a family that will boost his confidence, and run his anxious energy out. Long fast paced walks or runs will be best for his mental health. He is FULL of energy and will act ten feet tall barking at neighbors and other animals defending his perimeter.  He is potty trained but needs you to remind him to go and stand with him until he does. Otherwise his buzzing energy gets the best of him and he forgets. He will most likely always be a very skittish boy who loves people and hates loud sudden noises. He doesn't have much interest in toys or fetch but will settle down for a good chew showing he's still a young pup. Presley will not thrive in a home with shared walls as he howls and cries for some time after you've gone. Presley is 3 1/2 years old. \n\nInterested in adoption?

We believe Jade would do best as an only dog as she is can do some guarding of her toys ( she loves toys) and loves all  the attention. Please go to stlsdp.org to fill out our online application if interested. Adoption fee is 300 .\n\nUpdate , Jade requires a fenced in yard and was found to have a very small heart murmur.

He would enjoy someone home most of the time since he likes to always be nearby. He is blind so a fence or a leash are a must for him. He is good with children over 12 years old. He is good with other dogs and cats. He walks nicely on a leash too. Our adoption area is within 150 miles of Valparaiso, IN. If interested in adopting submit an application at www.teambarc.com. His adoption fee is $350.Visit www.teambarc.com for more information and our online application. Follow us on Facebook and Twitter!",

His foster says he loves other dogs and is very gently with their children as well. He'd be the perfect family dog to make your home complete.",

Jax loves people and loves attention. His foster home includes an aussie female and beagle male mix. They both love him and love their playtimes. There are also 2 cats - Jax would love to chase and play with them, but they are very dog savvy and don't really give him a chance. He is learning to give them their space. There are also 2 horses and he gets along with them as well. Jax stays in the house when his foster mom is home as well as overnight. He stays outside in a pen when no one is home. Jax is good on a leash - jumps in and out of the pickup on command. -He knows sit and is learning stay. He is very gentle for his size. He does love to run outside but always comes when called.Fostering and transporting to places where there is a need for adoptable animals, saves lives, its that simple. \n\nIMiami Animal Alliance's goal is to be the premium go to place to find your new family member!

Peanut has been well loved since she was a puppy, earning her name by snuggling into the crook of her owner's elbow. She's a very friendly dog who has been around kids and seems okay with other dogs (plays with a family member's dog). She's housebroken and free roam in the house. Some of her favorite things include playing fetch, going to the lake, and dressing up. She knows several commands. She's described as lazy with bursts of playfulness and a big baby. Peanut's adoption fee includes spay, microchip and vaccines.For more information about this animal or our adoption process please visit our website at SouthJerseyRegionalAnimalShelter.org",

He was rescued after being abandoned in the country and brought into the rescue to get medical attention and learn how wonderful it is to be an inside dog and to be loved the way he should. He loves playing with all and any toys he can. He has been working on his puppy manners and does sit and down with some encouragement and takes the treats very well. He currently plays with his sister, Dream and two other dogs. He has no problem keeping up with them. He lives with two human foster siblings as well and they love on him lots. So he is used to action in a busy household. Magic has learned stairs and with little help can get on the couch for cuddles. He is being crate trained for sleep, naps and potty time.\nWe will continue to work on potty training in the coming weeks. \n\nMagic has had his 2nd round of shots and will be ready to meet you by the end of January. \n\nMagic's 3rd round of shots and neuter are included in his adoption fee.

He loves to be with his foster Mom and play play play with his foster brother. He is an active puppy and will need an environment with a large yard and plenty of mental and physical stimulation. He likes his people to be home, and would like a big brother or sister that will help show him how to dog.\n\nNewton knows sit and down and is working on no and leave it. He has started introductions to the leash and enjoys exploring in the back yard. He is improving on his house training and sleeps all night in his crate. He also has morning and afternoon naps in the crate, as well as an hour or 2 \"office\" time with his foster Mom. He is all puppy and will help with the laundry, sleal your slippers and your heart.\n\nNewton needed to get caught up on his shots and get rid of some unwelcome hitchhikers picked up when his litter was dumped in the county. He is doing great now and ready to find his furever home.\n\nApplications are at https://bit.ly/codys_adoption_application.\n\nCody's does not adopt puppies under the age of six months into apartment homes.",

            "description": "Diego and Dora were found as strays together and we don't know if they were raised together (they aren't very old) or just become extremely bonded. But they do seem to need each other!\n\nBeautiful Dora is approx a year old. Even being out on her own with her friend Diego, she has such a sweet, happy and easy going manner. That's not to say she doesn't like to play because she does and still shows that puppyness! Diego has such a loving spirit and really loves being around people. He is a pretty chill guy mot of the time but only being about 9 months old (he's a big guy), he still gets pretty excited about everything. Both of them do well with other dogs, always waggin their tails in welcome and they seldom bark. They both know to wait to go potty outside and are very gentle taking treats and food.\n\nThis is from their trainer/foster: \"DIEGO needs DORA more then she needs him. She will at least go potty without him, but then she wants right back in with him, and the reunion is as if they spent days apart. DIEGO, however, cannot function without his sister. They are so dependent upon each other, its sad to see them always looking for the other when I pull them one at a time to work with them. Their lives have not been very consistent, so the bond between them is even stronger. Having each other is something they could always count on. I cannot separate them, I feel like that would be detrimental to their psyche and would forever change who they are. There has to be someone out there, with 3 or 4 kids, that needs a couple of playful pups....\"\n\nWe do offer a foster to adopt program and working with our trainers if you feel you have a home that would benefit from having a great \"two for one\" new family members!

            "description": "This sweet girl is Cheers, she is a Beagle mix we believe around 2 yrs old. She was in dire need of rescue along with her puppies sadly, and our foster went in to help her. She is actually the mom to the NY Countdown litter, yes the ones that look like labby pups, lol. She did a great job with her babies and now she is ready to come to WI and find her very own family to love her. She is doing fairly well with her house and leash manners and may need just a little tweaking with this is all. She is a love of people she is a girl who loves to be coddled and loved on. She does fine with other dogs and loves to play around some or find a nice cozy spot to relax and take a snooze, she is a pretty lowkey girl. She is now ready to come to WI and find the good life here, if interested in this little girl an online application can be found at SandiPaws.org\nThank you for your interest in a Sandi Paws Rescue, Inc. Please visit our site at sandipaws.org for more information on our organization or to fill out an application to adopt one of our pets.

I know basic commands like sit, stay and down. I am hoping my new family will teach me more commands. I like to learn and I am a smart boy. My foster family says I am a loveable boy and I sure do enjoy attention. I'm happiest when I can account for my people and they are with me. I can get nervous when I don't know where my people are and hope my furever family will work with me so that I can learn to be more confident if my humans aren't with me. \n\nDid I mention that I'm a good kisser? Do you have room in your home for a friendly, smart boy who wants to make his humans happy? Please click on my link for more info and let my friends at Demi's know that we should have a playdate.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website - https://demisanimalrescue.com/demis-adoption-application/ \n\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, mircochipped, heartworm tested (if over 6 months old) and up to date on vaccinations (combo shot, bordetella, rabies(if age appropriate) )",

            "description": "Laker, who knows the name Gracie, was adopted and lived in the home for two years before being returned for her bad behaviors. We highly recommend setting up obedience training as soon as she goes home so there can be a smooth transition into your home. While she has lived with other dogs, they did not get along well. She was around one child on occasion and did okay with that child. She likes to guard her food, toys, treats, and is a grouch when she is woken from her sleep. Once past those quirks, she is a loving dog, who wanted her owners attention and time. We are guessing her loyalties to her owner are what made her act like she was the boss of the family/pack, which is a positive if properly trained! DOB 12/30/17 weighs 93 pounds...All pets have lifetime sanctuary at Haven of the Ozarks. If they cannot remain with their adopter, they must be returned to the Haven.\n\nAdoption fees are as follows: \nPuppies under the age of 6 months - $125\nDogs weighing 30 pounds and less - $125 \nDogs ages 6 months to 5 yrs old - $90\nDogs over the age of 5 yrs old - $75.\nCats under the age of 6 months old - $75\nCats over the age of 6 months old - $65",

Since Axel acts like a big lovable puppy full of kisses and hugs, he might not know his own weight with small children. Axel is great on a leash and enjoys his walks, but is still warming up to a kennel.

I won't get any bigger. \n\nEveryone I meet says I'm such a sweet girl. I like to cuddle and give kisses. I'm still working on going potty outside. I do use pee pads and I'll get the hang of going outside soon, I'm sure. I like other dogs and I love soft chew toys. I like it when new humans come to visit cuz they all like me. I sleep all night. I only bark when it's time for dinner just to let you know I'm hungry and I always eat all my dinner.\n\nJazmine is currently on the road to recovery from valley fever and may require surgery to remove an eye on the future.\nThe rescue will pay for her eye removal at our non profit Animal Hospital.",

I love all things in life including long walks with my human followed by a relaxing nap! I am a very well behaved fella who enjoys all the fun toys like bones, Kongs and stuffed everything; but be warned, I love to tear out all the stuffing to find that squeaker! I love humans; older ones in particular and get along well with other dogs! I relish in a good playmate from time to time! I also get along with cats!\nI consider myself quite the smart pup who knows a few commands such as sit, shake, lay down and currently working on mastering stay. I am also house trained and crate trained. I walk really well on a leash and barely pull on the leash while we enjoy a stroll around the neighborhood!\n\nI am excited to find my very own forever family who shares the same things I do in life!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting the handsome, Rivet, apply to adopt at www.causeforcanines.org Adoption fee is $300\nChildren must be 8 years old or older\nMust be an Ohio resident 25 years old or older",

            "description": "Hi friends! Lets get to the meet-n-greet, shall we? My name is Toby and I hail all the way from Tennessee. I came to Nebraska on a plane! Im an easy going guy that loves people and to tap dance. Yes, I have moves! The smart people guess that I am around 4-5 years old and weigh about 30 lbs. I currently am undergoing treatment for heartworm, but will get through it soon. \n\nYou could say that Im a special guy! You see, in my life prior to rescue, I was a stray for awhile and people say I was probably hit by a big metal thing on wheels. I have some nerve damage and hip dysphasia that causes my back end to not quite do what I want it to. It doesnt stop me though! I run around the yard, go on walks, go up and down stairs, and even climb up on a stool to get on my chair. My foster mom has been taking to a nice vet that does chiropractic adjustments. They are helping me not hurt so much so I can work on getting strong. I probably will always have some issues, but regular adjustments and exercise will help me be the best I can be! \n\nI get along with kids and other dogs, but they will have to understand I have some limitations. I love to be lifted into your bed at night so I can cuddle up, but will sleep on the floor if you have a comfy bed there. I have moved around lately, so I do have a little separation anxiety when you leave. I do whine and bark while you are out, so an apartment probably wouldnt be the best house for me. Kennels are ok, but Ive been good when foster mom leaves me out and seem to do better while you are gone. I am potty trained, but sometimes I have a hard time holding it for a long time. I feel bad when I have an accident, but with my nerve issue when I have to go, I have to go.\n\nFrom his fosters: Tobys zest for life is contagious! He loves baths and being pampered. A good blanket for him to snuggle into is a necessity. Toby is probably the sweetest Beagle you could ever hope to meet. There is something really special about this little boy. Please consider him for your forever dog! \n\nToby is neutered, current on shots, microchipped, and currently undergoing heartworm treatment. If interested in adopting Tennessee Toby, please fill out the application at www.bassetandbeagle.org. His adoption fee is $350",

            "description": "My name is Cooper and I am searching for my forever family! My ideal family would be loving and let me snuggle on the couch and possibly in bed with them. A family that will play ball and take me on walks and help me lose some weight. You see, in my short 2 years I have been allowed to gain too much weight, like a LOT of weight. I should be around 45 pounds and instead I am a whopping 80 pounds! \n\nI love all people, especially if they pet me but I would prefer kids that won't tease me or hang all over me. I will paw at you to let you know I need love! I love to run around with toys and play fetch. I'm good with all dogs. I'm living with a pack of foster fur siblings that range in age from puppy to senior but I can occasionally get a little growly if food is involved. My foster mom feeds us in our own kennels so that no one has any problems; however, I am good when we all sit for treats. \n\nMy foster mom was told that I can play a little rough with cats and I like to sit on them but I haven't done that with her cat. I am house trained and recently I have been using a doggy door to go outside to potty. I have figured out how to slide the sliding glass door open if I need to go in or out and the doggy door is locked but my foster dad gets upset because I don't close it behind me! I am ok in a kennel, right now I sleep there at night, but it is not my favorite place to be. I will only go in if a treat or food is involved and I will give a couple of barks to let you know that I am not happy about being in there before I settle down. \n\nSince my foster mom has put me on a diet, i have started to counter surf. I try to do this when she's not looking because I really don't like to upset her, I am a pleaser at heart. I am up to date on my vaccinations, neutered, microchipped and ready to go to my forever home. If you think that could be you, please apply at www.bassetandbeagle.org. My adoption fee is $350.",

An appointment is not required. \n\nIf an adopter wishes to bring a current pet for a meet/greet, please send vet records showing the pet is UTD on all vaccines prior to your visit to blackdogclub@outlook.com\n\nThe adoption fee includes spay or neuter, microchip, age-appropriate vaccines, rabies vaccine, fecal test, deworming, and heartworm test. Dogs are treated if heartworm positive. All dogs are UTD on heartworm/flea/tick prevention. All dogs are health screened and vaccinated by our vet, Family Pet Animal Hospital or Quality Care Animal Hospital.\n\nWe do not know if our dogs are house trained. They are crated overnight. \n\nShorty 2 is a recent addition to the BDC family. His pictures are deceiving.... he's a dwarf. This dude is so stinking cute. He looks just like a yellow lab on a Basset Hound body. Shorty is a very loving boy that craves attention. He tested well with small children. He walks good on a leash and enjoys playing with toys. We do feel he would do best as the only pet. Estimated DOB: 01/20/2019. Current weight: 48 lbs. \n\nThis pup tested heartworm positive at the shelter. Blackdog Club's protocol for treatment is 30 days of Doxycycline and heartworm prevention, then 2 injections 24 hours apart. This cost is covered by our organization.",

Even if a dog is surrendered to us and said to be good with cats there is no way to be sure the dog will be good with your cats.

And while he's loving his foster family, he sure would like a family to call his forever.

He's a calm pup overall and always greets his people with a wagging tail when they walk in. As for a forever home, his new family needs to be patient with Logan because he is shy sometimes. But once he gets to know you, he's a friend for life! This sweet pup deserves the perfect forever home. Could it be with you? Apply to adopt Logan today!

            "description": "KIRA wiggles over to greet you :-) She loves to play and is very affectionate.  She's beautiful and smart. Gorgeous blue eyes.\n\nHer adoption fee includes her spaying, vaccine series, rabies, deworming, microchip. She was born Sept 26, 2020.\n\n** Do you live in our adopting area? ** Do you have another young playful friendly male dog of similar adult size? ** If yes to both questions, then please proceed with the application process below! :-)\n\nWe have specific adoption and Covid rules listed below.\n\nRevised adoption policy\nDue to Covid -19 pandemic and social distancing requirements, we've revised our adoption policy. \n\nFirst, please email (desertpawsnm@gmail.com) to inquire before you fill out the online application to see if the pet is still available. (Please do not call or text). We'll send you a link to the application.\n\nWe are unable to do multi-dog/cat meetgreets or adoption events at this time or bring multiple animals to your house to choose from, so please only inquire if you're serious about adopting this particular animal. If you're just shopping around with several shelters and rescues, please let us know this. \n\nIf your application is approved (which \"could\" take up to one week) then we will contact you to set up a Zoom chat or ph call to answer questions/clarify anything and set up a day/time to bring the pet to you. \n\nSince we can't come into the home/yard due to Covid-19, we ask that you send us pics /video of your home/yard/living area/current pets. \n\nWe will discuss with you about meeting your other pets. At the meeting/adoption at your house (outside) please wear a mask (as will we), keep to a properly distanced social distance and have hand sanitizer and your own leash.\n\nWe adopt locally to Central Abq, Santa Fe, Los Alamos and Rio Rancho. No out of area adoptions inquiries please. No young children for our adoptions please. Puppies MUST adopt to families that have another young friendly playful dog of similar breed size when grown. \n\nThe animals are fostered and our foster families like to know their fosters are happy, healthy, and cared for during their lifetime. We appreciate staying in touch periodically (just a pic, holiday card, social media, pics/videos  etc will make our work worthwhile :-))\n\nOur volunteers and adoption board are working diligently with an overload of inquiries since Covid to match families and forever pets. Our workload on the reservations has also increased. We're sorry, but if you email us with questions that are already answered here or fill out an application that does not fit the parameters of our procedures we will not be replying to you. Thank you for your understanding on this!\n\nThank you - we look forward to hearing from you and having another furbaby united with a furever family!\n",

I'm pretty flexible about what kind of home I want - are you more of a couch and TV kind of person? That's cool. I love the couch. Do you want a friend to take for long walks in the park? I love walks, too! I'm a flexible and friendly pup, and I'm sure we have lots of things in common! Adopt me, and let's find out what interests we share.",

She will likely always have unique dietary needs and require medicated baths as a result of her skin issues.\n\nDelilah is recommended to be adopted by a family with older, dog savvy children. She would need canine siblings who are not possessive over toys.\n\nShe is house broken and crated trained. She is working with her foster mom to learn how to share her toys with other dogs and on general training. She is very food motivated so she really enjoys training!\n\nStay tuned as we learn more about this sweet girl!",

Some of our pets are in foster care and not located at the shelter. If you are interested in a specific pet, contact the shelter at (618) 939-7389 to arrange a meeting.\n\nEeyore has heartworms and will be starting treatment soon. He would greatly benefit from having a quiet home to recuperate in rather than trying to rest in a noisy and stressful shelter environment. If you would like to provide a foster home, or foster-to-adopt home, during Eeyore's heartworm treatment, Helping Strays will provide everything you need; the medical care, crate, food, etc. Foster-to-adopt would be a great way to get to know him.

Jack and Jill are happiest when they are with each other, so they will need to be adopted together. These sweet seniors are excited to find a home where they can be loved and spoiled the way that they deserve.  They should go to a home with no children under the age of 7.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Jill and her friend Jack, please fill out an application! They would love to meet you. Jill's minimum adoption fee, which includes the fee for Jack, is $325 plus a $12 fee (per dog) for rabies registration for McLean County residents. \n\nShe has been spayed, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm checked, dewormed, and is on flea and heartworm preventatives.\n\nTo be considered for adoption, you must first submit the application found at: \n http://fs16.formsite.com/WishBoneCanineRescue/adoptionapplication/index.html\n\nFor information about this dog's breed(s), visit: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/abc.htm\n",

These sweet seniors are excited to find a home where they can be loved and spoiled the way that they deserve.  They should go to a home with no children under the age of 7.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Jack and his friend Jill, please fill out an application! They would love to meet you. Jack's minimum adoption fee, which includes the fee for Jill, is $325 plus a $12 fee (per dog) for rabies registration for McLean County residents. \n\nHe has been neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm checked, dewormed, and is on flea and heartworm preventatives.\n\nTo be considered for adoption, you must first submit the application found at: \n http://fs16.formsite.com/WishBoneCanineRescue/adoptionapplication/index.html\n\nFor information about this dog's breed(s), visit: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/abc.htm",

Bacon does not care for cats and would do best with older children. He would benefit from leash and basic obedience training.\n\nBacon is six years old and weighs 45 pounds.\n\nBacon's adoption fee is $200; he is microchipped, up to date on vaccines, and will be neutered prior to finalizing his adoption. Some of our pets are in foster care and not located at the shelter. If you are interested in a specific pet, contact the shelter at (618) 939-7389 to arrange a meeting.\n\nBacon has heartworms and will be starting treatment soon. He would greatly benefit from having a quiet home to recuperate in rather than trying to rest in a noisy and stressful shelter environment. If you would like to provide a foster home, or foster-to-adopt home, during Bacon's heartworm treatment, Helping Strays will provide everything you need; the medical care, crate, food, etc. Foster-to-adopt would be a great way to get to know him. Finalizing the adoption would be done once treatment is complete",

This is their story. mom is the sweetest, best temperment gal.  All dogs in our program are current on all their shots and micro chipped.  Also included is one FREE group session with our amazing trainer to his Street Obedience Class is included and not to be missed.We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them.

He was rescued from a little make shift shelter in that town. *** Diego has an old, old injury to his right left elbow. 4 vets have concluded that he is pain free, and that we can leave it alone, or amputate the leg, but it cannot be surgically repaired. If the adopter chooses to amputate, we will do that.*** Diego is super sweet and good natured. He is around 2 years old and will be a an absolute joy in anyones life. Diego weighs 18 pounds.  All dogs in our program are current on all their shots and micro chipped.  Also included is one FREE group session with our amazing trainer to his Street Obedience Class is included and not to be missed.We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them. An adoption fee, application, and contract are required. All our dogs can be met with an approved application.  We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them. Thank you for looking at a rescue dog for your next family member!

            "description": "Manthanne is an approximately 5 month old female Catahoula Cur mix who weighs approximately 35 pounds.  Manthanne and her Mom came into Cafa after being found wandering near the plant nurseries on Forrest Hill Louisiana.   Manthanne plays well with all dogs she meets.   She is a beautiful pup with crystal blue eyes and red and black leopard pattern fur which are both common of the Catahoula Cur breed.  \n\nThe Catahoula Leopard Dog is a medium-large, short-coated dog, known for its many varied coat and eye colors and patterns. The word catahoula is of Choctaw origin and is translated to mean \u201csacred lake.\u201d Catahoulas are the only breed of dog to have historically originated in the state of Louisiana. The breed requires firm guidance and early socialization, as they can be independent, territorial, and protective. For the same reasons, they do not allow mistreatment and will assert themselves in self-defense. Once they know their place in the family unit, they are affectionate, loyal, and gentle. Also called the Catahoula Hog Dog, they are used as stock dogs, bay dogs, tree dogs, watchdogs, guard dogs, and of course as loyal companions.  \n\nShe is learning to figure out how to walk on a leash.   She will require basic obedience, crate, leash and house training.  She is a super smart and friendly pup who will make a great pup for a loving home. \n\nAdoption fees details:\u00a0\nPuppies - Adults $ 550, Seniors $375. These adoption rates include transport from Alexandria, Louisiana to designated New England adopter pick up locations and NE foster homes using either Rescue Road Trips, Pets LLC or CAFA Transport. If you do a search you will see that this is a very reasonable adoption fee and comparable to other rescues.\u00a0Adoption\u00a0fee breakdown:Adoption Fee: \u00a0 $ \u00a0365.00Transportation Fee: \u00a0$ 185.00MA and NH only--Quarantine fee if applicable: \u00a0$125.00\n\nMedical details:\nAll our dogs are altered (spayed or neutered), DHLPP, rabies, Bordetella, Heartworm tested with negative test results, microchipped, treated for parasites and on monthly heartworm and flea and tick prevention. A health certificate is issued by a licensed Louisiana veterinarian.\n\nAdoption details:  \nIn some instances, a meet and greet is not possible before adoption unless we have a foster home in New England available. Available for a Meeting confirms the dog is in a NE Foster home and available for a meeting in the city state provided. \u00a0Most times our dogs get adopted before a foster home becomes available - and if so, they go straight to adopters home. Foster parents talk to adopters and feel confident that this will be a match before our dogs are transported up. Also if by some chance it is not a match we have a safety net in place as we ask that adopters to let us know that it is not a match and we direct you to take the dog to a foster home or boarding kennel once that is arranged. If necessary, we will ask you to foster the dog until a foster home can be arranged.\u00a0\nTransport details:Rescue Road Trips (rescueroadtrips.com), Pets LLC (petsllc.net) or CAFA Transport will deliver our precious pups on commercial rescue animal transport to designated locations. \u00a0The fee is 185.00 which IS INCLUDED in your adoption fee already.**Rescue Road Trips, was featured on The Today Show - view it at http://www.today.com/video/today/55034556#55034556\n\nMA and NH RESIDENTS:\nIf you are a Massachusetts or New Hampshire residence, an additional fee of $125.00 will apply due to State quarantine fee requirements. If the dog is in a foster home in MA or NH, this fee will be added in the adoption fee regardless of where the adopters home is located making the total adoption fee $675.00 for puppies and adults $500.00 for Seniors, otherwise the full adoption fee for all other states is $550.00 for puppies and adults and $375.00 for seniors. This includes a 48 quarantine, recheck by a MA licensed veterinarian, and issued a MA health certificate.\n\nVisit all our available dogs at www.cenlaallianceforanimals.comWe update and add dogs frequently.\n\nWe hope to help make a difference in a rescue dogs life into loving responsible homes.",

My favorite pastimes are playing tug of war with my people or a good game of fetch. I'm very good at it, and I love it when there is more than one toy so I can drop one at your feet and chase the other. I usually bring it back too! \n\nI am a little shy around new people. I take a bit to warm up but once I'm comfortable I am the most affectionate and loving girl you will ever meet. I would do best in a home with an experienced dog owner who has no other pets but me and no kids. I also would like a house where I have lots of rubber toys and a big comfy dog bed to sleep in! \n\nIf you would like to meet me, please fill out an online application at sarlnh.org.",

I am Goku, pleasing pup extraordinaire. I am a slightly timid young, 18 month old Silver and White Siberian Husky boy with those glacier blue eyes we all love. I and my Shepherd best friend were left behind when our family moved. I was very sad, but now we are in great foster homes and life is so much more now.I am crate and house trained and enjoy being with the family, especially on car rides. Car rides are the BEST! I LUV DEM! When I first meet you I am a little cautious but I warm up quickly, especially if there are Cheerios involved. I don't think I would like cats or small dogs, but I do like elementary aged children because I am a people too. Other big dogs scare me a little at first so I like to keep my distance. But I would be happy in both an active or more relaxed home. No first time owners and prefer large dog experienced furever homes. I can't wait to meet you!Go to BAYAREASIBERIAN.org for contact information on the foster dog.",

Meet Roma\n\nRoma is a very shy but sweet 6mo old puppy. She spent the first few months of her life in less than ideal circumstances causing her to be fearful of most things. She is now with a foster family and has been doing her best to overcome her fears of being outside.\nRoma needs a family with a lot of patience that can help show her how to be confident.\nShe would not do well in a home with young children since she is easily startled. She's met various dogs with no issues. She does well ignoring the pet rabbits at her foster family, and has seen cats but is not interested in them.\n\nRoma currently knows the commands; sit, kennel, go potty, and touch.\nShe does take a while to warm up to a new family and still isn't 100% comfortable with her foster family but is doing her best. Roma LOVES other dogs and is most confident with the security of an older dog to teach her how to behave. We cannot rehome Roma to a home with another dog under a year old to avoid over attachment to another puppy.Go to BAYAREASIBERIAN.org for contact information on the foster dog.",

            "description": "Scroll down to learn more about this pet:\n\n***\nBichon and Little Buddies is open only\n\nby appointment with a completed application.\nDogs in foster homes require an appointment and approved application to meet. The application is online at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog If a dog is listed as available, then we are still taking applications - no need to email or call to ask about the status. Note: The forms that Petfinder or Adopt-a-pet has to inquire about the dog is not our application application. Our form must be filled out to be approved to adopt a pet.***\n\nCovid-19 Precautions:\n\nUntil further notice, Bichon & Little Buddies will be doing all meets and adoptions by appointment only. To be able to control the number of people at the shelter at one time, we will be suspending our open hours on Thursdays. If interested in adopting, please fill out the pre-adoption application and we will set up a time for you to come meet the dogs you are interested in.\n\nAbout this Dog:\n\nName: Sammy\n\nBreed: Shih Tzu-Poodle type mix\n\nApproximate Age: 7 yr\n\nGender: Male\n\nWeight: around 20 lb\n\nAdoption Fee: $400\n\nWhy in Rescue: Owner Surrender\n\nGeneral Profile: Please fill out the adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog if you are interested in meeting one of our dogs.\n\nSammy sadly lost his home when his owner wasn't able to care for him any longer. He has been with us for awhile since he wasn't adjusting well and didn't want to bond with the caregivers at the shelter. But he has made huge strides recently, and now happily goes for walks with volunteers. He is very food motivated, so treats help! He is a timid dog, so will need a patient adopter who will help build trust and a loving bond with Sammy. He will need work on housetraining, especially after being in the shelter, but he is worth the effort. He was very loved by his previous owner and we know she misses him and would love for him to be with a loving family. He is going to need a home with no young children. He did live with another dog, so may do well with another small dog. If interested in meeting Sammy and learning more about him, please fill out the pre-adoption application so we can see if you might be a good fit for him.\n\nWe do our best to evaluate the dogs while they are with us, but they sometimes act different in the shelter environment than they do in a home. If you are interested in any of our dogs, please fill out the pre-adoption application and we will set up a time for you to come and meet them.\n\nIf considering adopting a former breeding dog, the following article is good to read to help you understand the special needs these dogs may have. http://www.nowisconsinpuppymills.com/mill-survivors.html\n\nAdoption Procedures:\n\n1. Completely fill out the pre-adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog. We will be checking with your vet if you have had pets, calling your landlord (if any) and checking a personal reference, before we contact you about visiting the adoptables. Any missing information may have us moving onto another application.\n\n2. If you application is approved, we will contact you to come meet the adoptables that you are interested in.\n\n3. If it is a match, you will complete the adoption contract and pay the adoption fee. Please be prepared to take your adopted pet home when you come meet him/her. In most cases, you will be able to take the pet home the same day. If all the vetting hasn't been done yet, we will hold the pet for you until the vet work is completed.\n\n4. If you have filled out an application and we haven't contacted you within a week, we may have missed your application, the pet may have been adopted by another applicant, or you may have been missing information on your application. You may contact us to find out the status of your application at this time. Please give us a week to process your application before contacting us!\n\nThe adoption fee through Bichon and Little Buddies Rescue is $200 - $475 depending on the age of the dog, which includes Wi State Sales Tax. Included in this fee is your new companion who will be spayed/neutered, have a current Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (as required by state law), current on age appropriate vaccinations, heartworm tested and started on preventative, microchipped, and dewormed. Other medical needs will also have been taken care of, such as dentals and treating ear infections.\n\nTo assist you and your new pet in adjusting to life together, you will also receive an 8 week age appropriate obedience training course at For Pet's Sake Dog Training for $50 (up to $200 value). You may opt to take Puppy Kindergarten, Adult Beginners, Small Dogs Big Hearts, or Shy & Reactive Dog Class. You must start the class within 90 days of adoption for the reduced fee. For more information on the classes visit www.forpetssake.cc\n\nAll dogs are seen BY APPOINTMENT ONLY. Many are in various foster homes getting extra one on one attention getting them ready for their new homes. The first step in adoption is filling out the pre-adoption application. Bichon and Little Buddies is run by volunteers who have full time jobs in addition to the hours they spend with the rescue dogs. Having an application on file assures us that the potential adopter is really interested in adopting a dog. It also assists us in placing dogs in homes where both the dog and new owners are happy. The application puts you under no obligation to adopt a dog from Bichon and Little Buddies.\n\nThe Dog Pre-Adoption Application can be found at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog\n\nThanks for thinking about adopting your new pet!More important information:\n\n***We are a Wisconsin based rescue and do not ship our pets. If you are considering adoption you must be willing to drive to meet and adopt the pet, as well as bring the pet back to us if the adoption doesn't work. We adopt primarily in WI and IL, but will consider applicants in MN, IA, and MI.***\n\n***Please do not set up an appointment to meet the animals until you are ready to take your pet home. If the meeting results in a match, you can often take the dog/cat home the same day or within a couple days if the medical care hasn't been completed. We are not able to hold pets for adopters beyond this time. Thanks for understanding.***\n\n***While we hope all of our adoptions lead to permanent homes for the animals we place, sometimes things just don't work out. We do have a 30 day trial period. For the first 30 days, if you or Bichon and Little Buddies decide that the adoption isn't a good match for either the humans or the pet, the adoption fee will be refunded minus $50 within 30 days of the return of the dog. Bichon and Little Buddies also requires adopters to return the pet to us at any time that they are unable or unwilling to care for the animal anymore.***\n\n***We do not show dogs/cats without an appointment. The first step in adoption is filling out the pre-adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog Please do not call/email until AFTER you have filled out an application.***\n\nBichon and Little Buddies is a State Licensed Rescue # 268555-DS",

She will wait until you take her outside to go potty.  She sleeps a lot and gets along great with other dogs! Gets along with all humans big and small! Doesn\u2019t really need a leash because she doesn\u2019t really go anywhere since she\u2019s blind.\n\nIf interested, please submit an application via our website at www.anassafehavenrescue.org.\n\nDisclaimer: All information we know of Ms. Magnolia has been provided. If you are able to see this profile, then the puppy is still available. Emails asking if this dog is still available will not be answered. We apologize for this but we receive too many emails when we post our dogs. Please refer to our website for additional information regarding our adoption process.",

            "description": "Scroll down to learn more about this pet:\n\n***\nBichon and Little Buddies is open only\n\nby appointment with a completed application.\nDogs in foster homes require an appointment and approved application to meet. The application is online at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog If a dog is listed as available, then we are still taking applications - no need to email or call to ask about the status. Note: The forms that Petfinder or Adopt-a-pet has to inquire about the dog is not our application application. Our form must be filled out to be approved to adopt a pet.***\n\nCovid-19 Precautions:\n\nUntil further notice, Bichon & Little Buddies will be doing all meets and adoptions by appointment only. To be able to control the number of people at the shelter at one time, we will be suspending our open hours on Thursdays. If interested in adopting, please fill out the pre-adoption application and we will set up a time for you to come meet the dogs you are interested in.\n\nAbout this Dog:\n\nName: Momma Spice\n\nBreed: Chihuahua\n\nApproximate Age: 1-2 yr\n\nGender: Female\n\nWeight: 10 lb\n\nAdoption Fee: $400\n\nWhy in Rescue: Texas Transfer\n\nGeneral Profile: Please fill out the adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog if you are interested in meeting one of our dogs.\n\nMomma Spice came to us from Texas with her puppies who are busy finding homes of there own, so now she is looking for a special home to call her own. Spice is a very sweet girl, but she takes time to warm up to new people. Once you are her friend though, she will love you forever. She is going to need an adopter who understands that it may not be love at first sight as far as Momma Spice goes, but don't worry, it doesn't take too long for her to figure out who is a friend! A Chihuahua experienced adopter may be best for her as well as a home with no young children. We don't have a history on her, so don't know if she was housetrained or lived with children or other pets. We keep telling her better days are just ahead, maybe you can make little Spice have the best year yet!\n\nWe do our best to evaluate the dogs while they are with us, but they sometimes act different in the shelter environment than they do in a home. If you are interested in any of our dogs, please fill out the pre-adoption application and we will set up a time for you to come and meet them.\n\nIf considering adopting a former breeding dog, the following article is good to read to help you understand the special needs these dogs may have. http://www.nowisconsinpuppymills.com/mill-survivors.html\n\nAdoption Procedures:\n\n1. Completely fill out the pre-adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog. We will be checking with your vet if you have had pets, calling your landlord (if any) and checking a personal reference, before we contact you about visiting the adoptables. Any missing information may have us moving onto another application.\n\n2. If you application is approved, we will contact you to come meet the adoptables that you are interested in.\n\n3. If it is a match, you will complete the adoption contract and pay the adoption fee. Please be prepared to take your adopted pet home when you come meet him/her. In most cases, you will be able to take the pet home the same day. If all the vetting hasn't been done yet, we will hold the pet for you until the vet work is completed.\n\n4. If you have filled out an application and we haven't contacted you within a week, we may have missed your application, the pet may have been adopted by another applicant, or you may have been missing information on your application. You may contact us to find out the status of your application at this time. Please give us a week to process your application before contacting us!\n\nThe adoption fee through Bichon and Little Buddies Rescue is $200 - $475 depending on the age of the dog, which includes Wi State Sales Tax. Included in this fee is your new companion who will be spayed/neutered, have a current Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (as required by state law), current on age appropriate vaccinations, heartworm tested and started on preventative, microchipped, and dewormed. Other medical needs will also have been taken care of, such as dentals and treating ear infections.\n\nTo assist you and your new pet in adjusting to life together, you will also receive an 8 week age appropriate obedience training course at For Pet's Sake Dog Training for $50 (up to $200 value). You may opt to take Puppy Kindergarten, Adult Beginners, Small Dogs Big Hearts, or Shy & Reactive Dog Class. You must start the class within 90 days of adoption for the reduced fee. For more information on the classes visit www.forpetssake.cc\n\nAll dogs are seen BY APPOINTMENT ONLY. Many are in various foster homes getting extra one on one attention getting them ready for their new homes. The first step in adoption is filling out the pre-adoption application. Bichon and Little Buddies is run by volunteers who have full time jobs in addition to the hours they spend with the rescue dogs. Having an application on file assures us that the potential adopter is really interested in adopting a dog. It also assists us in placing dogs in homes where both the dog and new owners are happy. The application puts you under no obligation to adopt a dog from Bichon and Little Buddies.\n\nThe Dog Pre-Adoption Application can be found at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog\n\nThanks for thinking about adopting your new pet!More important information:\n\n***We are a Wisconsin based rescue and do not ship our pets. If you are considering adoption you must be willing to drive to meet and adopt the pet, as well as bring the pet back to us if the adoption doesn't work. We adopt primarily in WI and IL, but will consider applicants in MN, IA, and MI.***\n\n***Please do not set up an appointment to meet the animals until you are ready to take your pet home. If the meeting results in a match, you can often take the dog/cat home the same day or within a couple days if the medical care hasn't been completed. We are not able to hold pets for adopters beyond this time. Thanks for understanding.***\n\n***While we hope all of our adoptions lead to permanent homes for the animals we place, sometimes things just don't work out. We do have a 30 day trial period. For the first 30 days, if you or Bichon and Little Buddies decide that the adoption isn't a good match for either the humans or the pet, the adoption fee will be refunded minus $50 within 30 days of the return of the dog. Bichon and Little Buddies also requires adopters to return the pet to us at any time that they are unable or unwilling to care for the animal anymore.***\n\n***We do not show dogs/cats without an appointment. The first step in adoption is filling out the pre-adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog Please do not call/email until AFTER you have filled out an application.***\n\nBichon and Little Buddies is a State Licensed Rescue # 268555-DS",

Rescued from shelter.\n\nMy name is Bubu but I have been called many things including Bubba and old guy. I answer to most things and just love to come to you for attention. When my foster picked me up they weren't really sure of my age. Well, I'm definitely an older gentleman, probably about 10 years old, but I don't like to admit it or act like it. \n\nI really don't know who my parents are or my breed, but my foster Mom calls me a Heinz 57, whatever that means. She thinks there is min pin, French bulldog, and lab, but I can tell you I\u2019m 100% cute!  I am a healthy dog and I have the vet records to prove it. I have many more years to enjoy. I don't take medication and I am a real gentleman.  \n\nMy favorite thing I love to do is get petted, go for walks and eat soft morsels of food. My foster Mom thinks I am just the sweetest old man ever and I like to reward her compliments with filling my bed with all her lose clothes and toys she leaves for me. Don't worry, I don't do anything with them. I just love to hold them close. \n\nShe also has two other dogs that I think are okay. The small one I don't care about, she leaves me alone, but the larger one can make me nervous so I will give her a little growl sometimes to get her to go away. My foster Mom doesn't like that though and tells me to stop. I will listen because if I don't, she won't pet me, or let me sit with her, so I chose to listen.\n\nI am looking for someone to give me the best years of my life where I get as much attention as I please.  I would love to go on daily strolls and possibly car trips to check things out with you. I don't mind other dogs as long as they respect my space but would be fine being the only one for you. \n\nIf you can make sure that I have my regular dog food mixed with wet food and get some dog jerky for treats, we may be a match made in heaven. I just love that and even though my teeth look great, I would prefer to eat my food that way.  I am ready to be spoiled and comfortable for many years to come and make you the happiest human ever.  Please won\u2019t you fill out the application now and ask for BuBu?  You won\u2019t regret it \u2013 I promise, Love, BuBu\n\nNote: Bubu is located in Nevada County, CA and we will not fly this boy.\n\nIf you wish to adopt, please fill out our IMPS Min Pin Adoption Application\nIf you have previously submitted an Application form, there is no need to re-apply.\nFor more details, contact Rebecca: minpinlove_imps@yahoo.com  \n\nIMPS is a non-profit rescue organization that does not have a viewing facility to which you can come and meet the dogs available for adoption. All of our dogs are in loving homes in foster care. Arrangements can be made with the foster parent; however, it is a requirement that the Adoption Application be completed and approved first.\n\nIf you wish to adopt, please fill out the IMPS MinPin Adoption Application go to:  http://www.minpinrescue.org/home.html \n\nPlease visit our website by going to: http://www.minpinrescue.org",

            "description": "Rugar is about 3  yrs old, but acts younger.  A chocolate lab mix. He came from the rodeo as a working dog. We think he spent a lot of time in a kennel because he HATES to be in one now. We  try to walk him at least 2 miles a day. He pulls on a leash and could benefit from a no pull harness. Off leash, he will wander and needs a fenced yard. Rugar is afraid of the dark,  probably from being at the rodeo, and has some separation anxiety.  He needs a home where someone is home most of the time.  He will scratch doors and get out of crates when left alone.  \nRugar is being fostered with 5 other dogs  from a pug to a 70 lb hound. He does fine with males and females. Rugar will guard toys and bones from our dog that steals from others. He only reacts when she actually tries to take it from him, and is easily redirected. We also have  several cats.  He will chase a cat if it runs. If it doesn\u2019t run, he will slobber all over it till it wishes it had.  He likes toys that squeak, He is very food motivated which helps with training.  He knows \u201csit\u201d.  \nWe don\u2019t have kids in the house but I would recommend a home with children over the age of ten. He\u2019s not aggressive, but he will jump when excited. He sleeps on the couch next to the wood burning stove. He\u2019d try to counter surf and get into the trash, but he hasn\u2019t in two weeks. He improves daily and is a very quick learner. He would do best in a home with dogs, cats and older children. He would also be fine as an only dog.\n\nPlease use\nTo adopt - https://form.jotform.com/92314840069154",

Typically if training is started early and consistent, the pup can be almost trained by 6 months of age, however, it can take up to a full year or more to fully house train depending on the dog.\n\nAdoption fee is $175, includes: neuter, all dhppl and rabies vaccines, deworming, microchip with free lifetime registration and 30 days free \"pet\" insurance.\n\nPLEASE READ our adoption policies/requirements before submitting a application, thank you!\n\n\n*Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable. For the large majority of our dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

TIPPER is such a looker! He is not a large Beagle but a solidly built Beagle, all 40 pounds of him. He is estimated to be about 2 to 3 years old and is just so handsome. He has clean teeth and GREAT bloodwork! He has an ear infection that we have already started treating. Unfortunately, he is heartworm positive, but he will be fully treated. He has been given medicated baths. Since everything looks so good on Tipper, we have just neutered him and all went well.  He has been dewormed, given doses of Heartguard Plus and Nexgard. \n\nBecause he is heartworm positive, we are NOT offering him for regular adoption till he completes heartworm treatment  in May. What we WILL do is approve a foster-to-adopt home for him where the family fosters him through heartworm treatment and is given priority to adopt him, once he completes heartworm treatment. Our fosters must complete the same adoption application we require of regular adopters and be approved. \n\nIf you are interested in fostering-to-adopt Tipper, offering him a forever home, foster-to-adopt is the only way to have him in your home before he completes heartworm treatment in May. We have 3 of our dogs in foster-to-adopt homes right now. Please email Diana at dmoore2003@bellsouth.net and request our adoption application. We can arrange a greet and meet after your application is completed, returned to us, and approved. \n\nWe must tell you that our Beagles are very popular and are adopted or fostered-to-adopt very quickly. So, if you are interested in Tipper or any one of our Beagles, you should apply now. \n\n",

            "description": "\n\nThis dog is being fostered in Dallas TX and must be adopted within the Dallas, North Central Texas or the southern Oklahoma area.\n\nNAME:              Rio\nGENDER:         Male (Neutered)\nAGE:                  About 3-6 years\nWEIGHT:         4.5 pounds\nDOGS/CATS:   Gets along with other small dogs, Unknown with cats\nCHILDREN:     Should be fine with older, mature children (13 and older)\n\nSay hello to Rio, a handsome, 4.5 pound boy with the softest reddish-tan coat.  He is between 3-6 years old and so sweet and loving!\n\nIn late October, we received a call asking if we would be willing to help with a hoarding situation where there were over 30 Chihuahuas.  We drove 1-1/2 hours south of Dallas and took several of those dogs into our program.  Rio was one of those dogs.\n\nRio fit right in with the other dogs in his foster home and gets along well with all of them.  He loves to snuggle and nap with them while his foster mom is working.  He has discovered some of his foster siblings\u2019 small, plush toys that fit in his mouth, and he loves to carry them around and play fetch with them.\n\nRio adores his foster mom and loves to give her kisses!  He loves snuggling in her lap or getting up on the back of the sofa and resting his head on her shoulder while she watches TV.  He also likes to sleep in the bed with her at night under the covers.  He is a good bed buddy!\n\nRio is potty trained and will do his business outside (if it\u2019s not really cold or raining) or use a pee pad.  He has had a few accidents in the house, but this has gotten better as time has gone by.  He is a well-behaved boy and listens to verbal corrections.  If he is unsure of a situation, he can become a little anxious but is easily reassured.  Because he has the potential to be a \u201cdoor darter,\u201d Rio is crated when his foster mom leaves the house.  And while he is fine being crated if his foster mom is at home, he will howl for quite a while when his mom leaves.  For this reason he is not apartment appropriate.  As he has become accustomed to being crated when his foster mom leaves, the howling has lessened some.  He will climb out of an expen.\n\nRio is between 3-6 years old. He is generally a calm, quiet and well-behaved boy.  Because of his small size, he must never be left unattended in the backyard and the yard must have a secure, wooden fence.  His ideal home would be calm and moderately active, with a family who spends a lot of time at home.  A work at home family would be perfect!  Rio does not bark a lot, but will if he hears a noise or the other dogs bark.  We believe he would do best in a home where there is another small dog.\n\nRio is being fostered in the Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas area. Our CRT adoption form can be found at: http://www.chihuahua-rescue.com/adoption-application/\n\nRio is spayed, micro chipped, up-to-date on shots, HW negative, on heartworm prevention and recently had a dental.  He is ready to join a loving family \u2013 could that family be yours?\n\nThis dog is a CRT rescue. Reference checks, adoption contract and $270.63 adoption donation required ($250 adoption donation and $20.63 Texas Sales Tax). Note: as of 1-1-20, the Texas State Comptroller office is requiring all rescue groups to collect sales tax on adoptions, even though we are all 501c3. We are all fighting this, but for now, have been told it is non-negotiable.\n\nAs part of our mission to reduce the number of unwanted and sick dogs, we require that all current pets are spayed or neutered, current on vaccinations and taking heart worm prevention. Applications will not be considered if one or more of these requirements are not met.\n\nAfter filling out an adoption application (found at http://www.chihuahua-rescue.com/adoption-application/), please email DFWCoordinator@chihuahua-rescue.com if you are interested in this dog. Please be sure to read about our adoption process and then fill out an adoption application before emailing the contact person.\n",

He can be a stubborn young dog, just like most bully breeds, so he will need consistent, positive reinforcement training.  He is working on improving his manners every day. He has been better and better about going into and staying in his crate. Henry is very good on a leash, especially when he is wearing a harness. He is low to medium energy and really loves to snuggle and sleep.  We are hoping that people with bully breed experience will apply.  Please submit your application at www.humanetomorrow.org.",

My name is GILBERT (Gilley)\nI will be 3 years old in April and for the last 2 years I have been looking for a home. \nRecently I was able to visit a family and they were AWESOME, but we found out that I am just not a good fit for small kids. As a matter of fact, I think I might do best with an adult or adults who like to walk, hike, hang out, go for car rides, cuddle (I love Cuddles),  play with me outside, watch tv with me... again, cuddle!!\nBut no kids!\nI don't mind cats. I made friends with a cat who stood his ground and we became buddies. If the cat runs... game on... I am will chase!! \nSo, that is all about me. I am a handsome and fun loving boy. If you would like to meet me, please contact my friends at Sugarbelle Foundation sugarbellefoundation@gmail.com\nThey will send you an application. There will be a vet reference, home visit, and adoption fee. :)",

I might be very shy at first, but once I come to trust you, you'll be my person! My foster mom calls me her shadow! Wherever she goes, I go! \n\nI'm great on the leash and I love to play with toys! My FAVORITE activities are napping and snuggling. I LOVE when my humans work from home. That means I get to snuggle on their laps all day! Oh and I love car rides and going places with my humans. You need to go on a coffee date? I'm your man. My dream would be to travel the world in one of those doggy carrier backpacks.\n\nI'm looking for my furever home and I hope that's you!\n\nAlfie is a Male Chihuahua / Terrier Mix that we estimate to be around 1.5 years old and weighs 11 lbs.",

Gronk was adopted to a new family in Oct. 2020 and they spent a lot of time teaching him things and absolutely love him - but unfortunately they have recently turned out to both be allergic to him and he is going to need to find a new home, much to their displeasure.\n\nGronk has been living with another dog and getting along extremely well, he acknowledges that the other dog is the boss and seems quite happy in his new home - it may be difficult for him to move so new owners will need to be aware of that.",

While this big guy has some more to learn he is eager to make people happy and at 3 years old he still has a lot of puppy energy yet! Damion's perfect home will be with an experienced owner that wants to be active! Damion is super friendly and loving. He adores other dogs, is a good playmate and would love to have a home with another large high energy dog that wants to PLAY! He seems like he might like to 'play' with cats but that might too much for any kitty! He's pretty rambunctious for little tikes but older kids will enjoy that he loves to play ball! Damion will need plenty of exercise in order to be a good boy. He is up to date on vaccinations, neutered and microchipped. His adoption fee is $250.00",

Daisy is an 11 year old, 19 lb Cockapoo. She is a curious gal and very affectionate and loyal. She does well with other dogs and new people she meets, and walks well on leash. She and her sister Abby Rose are bonded and they love to cuddle and play together. Her sister Abby is a little nervous around new dogs, so a home with just them two would be ideal. \n\nDaisy has a spring in her step and shows a lot of youth beyond her 11 years. Daisy is house trained and is very easy going around the house. She would love for her owners to be home more often than not. She would also do best in a home with a yard and a family that understands the grooming requirements of her breed. \n\nAdoption fee is $350 which includes her spay, microchip, vaccines current, deworming, flea treatment, grooming and dental.

Because her owner works most of the day, she spends her time locked up in her crate and does not get the love and affection that she deserves. She just wants to be able to roam the house with her family and be a cuddle bug. She is all up to date on her shots and is spayed. LET'S FIND HER A HOME!!!!

She is very smart and learning quickly...she already knows sit, down, and paw!Nala is afraid of loud noises and is nervous around people she doesn't know, so a home without small children may be best. She loves being outside and running around in a backyard, however! Nala can get overwhelmed out on walks and is looking for a quiet environment to help her stay focused and calm! She has enjoyed playing with other canine pals, so a home with another active friend may be great for her! Nala is a great gal with specific needs, which makes her one of our last-to-be-adopted pets, affectionately known as our Unfurgettable Friends!

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n\nHi everyone! My name is Ollie, aka Happy Puppy.\n\nI was dropped at a shelter right before Christmas, it was going to be the worst Christmas ever. The people that left me at the shelter had never even given me a name, I was just the dog in the backyard. But they were all I knew and they were my family.\n\nTurns out this was the best Christmas ever! A lovely lady from Animal Allies of Texas picked me up and I got to spend Christmas inside. The lights were beautiful, and there was wrapping paper to play in, and kids and people that gave me pets and smiled at me. I was in Heaven.\n\nI was given a name, Ollie. My very own name. But sometimes my foster mom calls me Happy Puppy, and I've heard her call me a velcro dog. I'm not sure what that is, but I love her so much and am so thankful that she saved me that I stick by her side all the time. She says I'm a good boy. I follow her around and couldn't be happier. I watch her cook, I sit with her when she's working, I play in the backyard with her.\n\nI am very protective of her. I'm learning that other people are nice too and I don't have to protect my foster mom from everyone. I bond very strongly with one person and need to be introduced slowly to others. I need to be in a home with someone that will continue to socialize me.\n\nI also don't like it when mom leaves, was I abandoned again? I get anxious when I can't see mom but I am getting better as I get more confident.\n\nThere are kids in my foster home. They are fun too, but my foster mom is best.\n\nThere are also two cats in the house, I'd never met a cat before. They are cute and fuzzy, but no one told me that had daggers on their paws. I really want to be friends with them and don't understand why they don't always like to play with me. I get a little upset at this and I tell them so, I'm learning to give the cats their space.\n\nI've also made friends with my foster dog sister. She's a lot bigger than me but we play in the backyard and go on walks. Walks are the best. I'm learning what a leash is and still have to work on my leash manners. I say hi to all the dogs in the neighborhood, a little too loudly according to mom. But I want to please my foster mom so much that I listen well and do what I'm told when corrected. I love chews so much, who knew that the world contained so many tasty treats. I will sit by mom while she's working on her computer all day, chewing on a chew and napping. I'm still in the puppy stage and don't always know what I can and can't chew on. But I promise I'll do my best.\n\nI was born with a twisted pelvis. It doesn't cause me pain or stop me from doing anything, I can run and jump with the best of them. But you will see me hold my back right leg off the ground sometimes.\n\nI have a little bit of growing to do, but I'm going to be on the small side. Small enough to be picked up and carried around, which is also the best. I fall asleep in my foster mom's arms. I honestly don't know how I got this lucky.\n\nThe only thing I need to complete my perfect life is a forever home. I need to be with someone that will continue to work on my training and socialization. I want to be the best dog for you. If you would like to meet me please contact AAT. I'd sure love to meet you!\n\nAnd if you would like to volunteer to save more lives and foster cats or dogs, please go the Animal Allies of Texas website and inquire. If it wasn't for the kind lady who sprung me from the shelter, I might not be here to tell my story. Animal Allies of Texas (AAT) will educate you on what it takes to be a Foster Parent.",

It is true, my pictures do not do me justice. I am a very smart and energetic pup, and I am learning some basic manners. My people are teaching me to walk on a leash and I love to sit for tiny dog biscuits. I am crate trained and happily go into my crate with a treat when my fosters parents are running people errands. I have NOT had one accident in the house, and I know what to do when we go outside. I like to bark when anyone new enters the house or whenever the garage door opens!\n\nSince I am young and still learning to respect boundaries my forever home needs to have an experienced pet owner in it. My foster mom says that I would be a great running partner because of how well I am doing on a leash and I have such fun running off my energy (I like to sleep soundly through the night). I have not been introduced to these things called \"cats\" and I have no idea how I will respond to them. Since I am a large puppy, bigger kids would be great to play with. I would probably knock over a little human. If I had the opportunity to play with a dog my size, I think it would be a lot of fun!\n\nI am looking forward to finding my forever home, because I really like attention and being petted and loved on. If you would like to meet me, please contact AAT. I would sure love to meet you!\n\nAnd if you would like to volunteer to save more lives and foster cats or dogs, please go the Animal Allies of Texas website and inquire.

He is a Blue German Shepherd color wise, which you don\u2019t see very often.\n\nBlu arrived into our care after his owner passed away suddenly and the surviving owner wasn\u2019t well enough to care for Blu. Fortunately, he reached out to us for help. \n\n\nBlu seems to really enjoys having other dogs to play with. He loves to be near his people as well. When he naps near you he will make sure to be touching you in some way with his nose, foot or head. He gets anxious when he knows his human is leaving the house but once left alone in the house he will snooze on the couch and await your return. \n\nBlu seems to  prefers positive praise over treats as he isn\u2019t very food motivated; which is good because this handsome fluff ball needs to lose a few pounds. Haha! He is at 115 lbs and our Vet would like to see him around 95-100 lbs.\n\nHis energy level is perfect for any adventure: jog at the park, afternoon on the couch, swim session at the dog park- He  just wants to do what you want to do.  This boy sure loves to visit Starbucks and get a puppuccino and pets. His favorite activity is visiting his dog friends for play time.  Blu is super social and has done well meeting dogs of all genders and sizes. He is potty trained. His recall is good and will only get better with practice. Blu is currently working on his leash manners. At bed time he likes to sleep next to his human. Though, as the night goes on, he gets hot and finds a cool spot on the floor nearby.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this handsome boy , please visit our website and apply today!\n\nhttps://www.washingtongsd.org/adopt\n\nPlease note that we require a secure fenced yard.\n\nOur hours are by appointment only. IF WE FIND YOU TO BE A GOOD MATCH YOU WILL BE CONTACTED typically within 72 hours. YOU WILL HEAR FROM US ONLY IF WE FIND YOU TO BE A GOOD MATCH FOR ONE OF OUR RESCUE ANIMALS AND OUR ADOPTION GUIDELINES/PROGRAM. WE MUST REVIEW A COMPLETED APPLICATION BEFORE A POSSIBLE APPOINTMENT IS ARRANGED. NO EXCEPTIONS.

            "description": "Male, 9 years, pit bull X, 76 lbs\n\nJack Spade will make a wonderful family dog. Although he does have a few small behavioral issues (details below) that I believe would improve with a more experienced handler, Jack's overall demeanor is very calm and loving. Jack still has lots of pep in his step, and is rather active for a senior dog. He loves his walks, and seeing other people. His favorite place to be is cuddled on the couch surrounded by family. Jack does not jump, bark (even at the doorbell), and is 100% house trained. He is very well mannered overall, although we think perhaps sometimes has hearing issues, so can sometimes \"ignore\" commands. He likes the car, and has already learned to sit calmly on car rides. Jack also likes his crate and is happy to chill in there with the door open or closed on a regular basis. He is great with kids, very loving, but likely would do better with older children to start, who can read his signs around comfortability. \n\nOne issue we have seen is that Jack can show aggression in heightened situations. Whether he becomes too excited through play with kids or other dogs, or overstimulated when he sees other dogs, he seems to have no awareness of his size, and can either scare, or injure (unintentionally through his body weight, never biting) those he is playing with. He has also shown aggression with other dogs in the home (never outside). We introduced him to an extended family pet and there were several acts of aggression (without injury). That being said the more comfortable Jack gets, the less this is an issue. \n\nFinally, Jack is extremely strong, and pulls on the leash during walks. An experienced handler could likely curb this behavior quickly with focused training. There appears to be evidence of prior leash training, which may just need to be refreshed. \n\nJack would make an incredible companion for someone looking to minimize the work involved in training a new dog. He is very loving and relaxed overall and would easily slip into routine.\n\nOur rescue is called BARCS. We are a registered Non Profit.\nOur Website is www.barcsrescue.com. All our animals are posted on the website and updated often. If you would like to proceed we need an adoption application to be filled out. They can be found on our website. Once we receive your application, we will contact you to arrange a meeting with the pup you are interested in. \nWe look forward to hearing from you\n",

Please apply to adopt or foster Morgan at\nrescueridge.com\nand your information will be forwarded to the person who has him. Please share widely.\n\n\"Hello friends so my friend's sister unexpectedly passed and she left behind her 7-year-old husky/border collie. He was a rescue from Carolinas when he was 16 months old. She, unfortunately, cannot keep him because she has cats. He isn't cat friendly but likes dogs and kids. He's around toddlers. His name is Morgan he's about 70lbs, loves car rides, loves people, and walks. He's up to date on his shots and neutered. He was very spoiled while with my friend's sister. It's an urgent matter as my friend's sister wants to put him in a shelter. I don't have a picture right now, working on that. My friend isn't computer savvy. He's brown and white and has one blue eye and one brown eye. The dog is in west orange NJ. My friend's name is Frances and she can be reached at 973-477-2826. Serious inquiries only. Thank you. \"",

Blue came in with a form of non-contagious mange and the owner said he has had that since he was a pup but never treated it. He is coming along nicely and is doing very well. He has bonded with me right away and likes to be where I am at. He is in a decompression mode but has settled in very well for the first 24 hrs. he was in the recliner with me and fell asleep and laid in bed with me last night and is in the house with 5 other dogs where he is learning that everything is OK. He is very striking and handsome. He has such a wonderful Blue color and I am not sure what all he might be mixed with. This guy will need some extra loving to get him to feel safe but he's a gem.\n\nAbout Me: My sister Lady Blue and I are so happy that our former not so nice owner brought us to a holding shelter in AL. Instantly, the holding shelter staff started to give me lotions and meds for my skin condition. I feel so much better. I wish I could tell everyone what breeds I am but I do like all the guessing. I have heard of Texas Blue Lacy dog, Char Pei, Lab, and Weimer. All are very good guesses. Once I get established and feel that I am loved, I am going to be the best dog you could ever hope for. I am looking for a family that will take some time with me to make sure I feel secure and loved and I am going to blossom. So, if you are looking for a handsome, good looking, blue dog, please lets meet and see how we connect. Thanks, Blue",

I have no idea what that means but I do know that I don't always listen to her. Blah, blah, blah, NO, ZOZO!!!! blah blah.... that's kind of what she sounds like. Ahhh well...... I love my foster momma anyway!! Anywho.... apply to adopt me today!!! Zola's adoption fee is $200. She is up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, spayed, and microchipped.\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, microchipped and if over 6 months of age, heartworm tested and on heartworm preventative in their foster home.\n\nWe require an approved application to meet any of our dogs. We do not have a shelter location and will not arrange a meeting without an approved application.\n\nWe strive to make sure the bios provided for our dogs are complete and accurate; we do understand that mistakes happen, however, so if you absolutely cannot find the answer to your question in the dog's bio, you can contact us for more information.\n\nWe require a home visit for each dog we adopt out, so we adopt within a 2 hour radius of Dayton, OH. If you are outside of this radius, we encourage you to contact your local rescue or shelter.",

DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF APPS/INQUIRED WE RECEIVE, WE WILL NOT RESPOND TO APPS/INQUIRES THAT DO NOT MEET THE CRITERIA FOR THIS DOG. Thank you! \n\nMeet Blondie!\n\nBlondie was found as a stray in Cleveland. She had been staying in an abandoned house until she was caught. Blondie was very scared and shut down at the kennel. We pulled her and she went right into a foster home. At first she wouldn\u2019t move much from her safe spot on the couch other than for potty breaks and to eat. It\u2019s pretty clear Blondie was neglected for a long time and only used for breeding and then dumped when they had no more use for her. Slowly but surely she started coming out of her shell and wagging her tail. She really loves to cuddle. She is the perfect lazy couch potato dog. She is shy when meeting new people but will warm up. She is crate trained and potty trained. \n\nBlondie is about 3yrs old, spayed, current on vaccines and microchipped.\n\nAdoption fee is $250.00. \nAdoption application & home visit required.  Blondie requires a fenced in yard. Adopters must live within 30 miles of Cleveland. \n\nIf interested in Blondie fill out an app on our website www.muttsinarutrescue.com",

            "description": "Sweet little Indy is a playful Pitbull/Heeler Mix. She is about 11 weeks old (born about November 01, 2020) She weighed 15 pounds on her 10 week checkup. We except her adult weight to be approximately  50 to 65 LBS..  She and loves to run, play, and wrestle with her foster siblings. She has a beautiful, soft coat with adorable freckles and spots. She has a very expressive face and a playful personality. She can be scared in new situations and needs to be reassured that everything is okay. She is playful and loving to adults and children (over 8) and kind to cats (but she does like to bark at them). Indy has a big voice and lots of opinions. She needs very ACTIVE humans who will take her on daily walks and outdoor adventures. She will make a great companion dog as she is loyal, loving and always making sure her humans are okay. She follows her foster parents everywhere and always wants to be part of the action. She is a SNUGGLE bug and expects to sleep in your bed.. She is working on being potty trained but still has accidents. She is a PUPPY. Please have time to properly potty train her. She will need a home with a submissive but active doggy sibling for her to play with. She doesn't like to be left alone. She needs lots of love and chew toys and needs to be an inside dog with outside privileges. She will benefit from consistent training and positive reinforcement. Due to breed / size restrictions in rental property,  Home Owners Only Need Apply! A secure 6ft plus fenced yard required.  Indy is spayed,  microchipped and up to date on vaccinations. Are you ready for some puppy love? She is waiting for her forever family.

            "description": "Meet Gemma. This sweet young girl is another local gal, who was abandoned in an apartment building. She was very thin upon arrival, but never once did she not completely love and trust us.\n\nThis girl is on the quest to find her furever home! She is in foster now and they LOVE her. She's smart, learns tricks quickly, super trainable, and all around a great gal! Gemma needs a home without any other animals. \n\nLooking for someone to be your one and only? A dog to teach tricks to, take walks on, travel with? Why not Gemma?! This girl deserves the best second chance and we are committed to giving that to her! \n\nShe learned the tricks in her video within a week of the foster having her. She is around 30lbs, so maybe 40lbs at a perfect healthy weight. \n\nGemma is UTD on shots, preventative, micro-chipped, and spayed!\n\nGemma's adoption fee is $250, and adopters must live within 175 miles of the Quad City Area.\n\nIf interested in meeting Gemma you must fill out the online application at www.k9kindnessrescue.org/adopt/application\n\nGemma and K9 Kindness Rescue thank you for considering adoption through rescue!",

He came from a bad situation where he and a momma dog with 5 puppies were outside all the time. The momma and 3 of her puppies and Pina were caught and brought to rescue. There are still 2 more puppies to be gotten. Pina is a very laid back, easy-going, good size dog. You go up to him and he just lays on his back for you to pet him. He slept in bed with me last night and was in the recliner yesterday just sleeping away. He has had a little bit of non-contagious mange by his eyes and nose that is healing up wonderfully. If you are looking for an easy-going dog that loves attention, Pina should be on your list to meet.\n\nAbout Me: What a difference a month makes!!!! Just a month ago I was outside all the time and with a momma dog and her 5 pups. Mary came and got almost all of us. She was not able to catch 2 of the pups but said she will be going back to get them. We went to a rescue where there were all kinds of dogs and then loaded on a van and now I am here in MN. I am in a house with just 5 other dogs. I like that better. I can lay on the couch or a recliner or on the bed. These soft places are so much better than the ground all the time. I am only 7 months old but am an OLD soul and love to lay around and get petted and give out love. I had some sores around my eyes and nose but they are feeling so much better. Are you looking for a good, medium-sized, easy-going dog? I would love to meet you to see if we could be a match. Have a great day and I hope to meet you soon. Pina",

Meet Copper, a 3.5 year old, 75 pound Black and Tan Bloodhound. If you know and love the Bloodhound breed, you will adore Copper! He is a well rounded and happy boy who is ready to be part of a family. Copper is seeking a home with similar size and energy level dog friends, a securely fenced yard and supervised outside time with leashed runs, walks and hikes. While he is quiet most of the time, when he finds his voice it is impressive, and you can't miss it. Copper loves to play with other dogs and he runs with his ears flying in the wind. When he's tired he likes to snooze on a soft dog bed. Copper already knows Sit and is working on some other basic commands. He is housetrained and rides well in the car. If you are looking for a happy and loving hound to join your pack, Copper is ready to follow his nose right home!\n\nInterested in adopting? Take the first step and complete an adoption application on our website: http://aarf-tn.com/adopt/adoption-apps/\n\nIf you have questions that are not covered in the profile, visit the Pet Inquiry Form: http://aarf-tn.com/contact/pet-inquiry-form/.\n\nTHIS PET IS FOSTERED IN TENNESSEE! We do list and adopt our pets nationwide. Typical transport cost to the Northeast is $160. Due to interstate adoption regulations, we are not able to adopt to RI and MA state residents.\n\nA.A.R.F. (All About Rescue and Fixin' Inc.) http://aarf-tn.com/ is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) no kill animal rescue organization located in the Upper Cumberland area of Tennessee. A.A.R.F. is comprised of unpaid volunteers and survives only on public donations. Thank you for thinking adoption first!\n\nPrior to adoption, all canines and felines are spayed or neutered, have received their age appropriate vaccinations, have been de-wormed for common parasites, and have received treatment for prevention of fleas and ticks. All canines over the age of 6 months have been tested for heartworm. All canines are put on heartworm prevention as soon as possible - this means dogs as soon as they are tested negative. Puppies are put on prevention immediately. All felines, regardless of age, have been tested for Feline Leukemia/FIV. Each animal receives a health check by a licensed veterinarian prior to adoption. Anything else found will be treated by our organization prior to adoption.",

She is on the shy side but warms up quickly. She was surrendered to AFC  because she barks to much!  This is why we don\u2019t leave dogs alone all day! Coco is a SNUGGLY LAP DOG. Coco previous person snuck her into an apartment and they were found out do to the barking.  She wants to follow you everywhere you go! She could be happy as an only dog with someone that works from home or that can take her along to work. If Coco likes you she really, really likes you, she loves to bounce off of your legs for attention and loves to give you kisses.   She will go into the back yard and run laps by herself.  She enjoys the company of other dogs but she gets along better with male dogs so no females. She LOVES to play with people, toys and other dogs in that order! She will require regular brushing and occasional professional grooming. Coco is happy to go outside to do her business. We use the command \u201cgo potty\u201d and she follows us right out the door. She will need to be leash trained. Coco is spayed, microchipped and up to date on vaccinations. Children over 10-12 years of age.  She is ready for her forever loving home!

            "description": "THE FIRST STEP IN THE PROCESS IS SUBMITTING AN APPLICATION. WE CANNOT ANSWER EMAILS ASKING ABOUT A DOG'S AVAILABILITY. IF IT IS LISTED WITHOUT THE WORD \"PENDING\" IT MEANS IT IS AVAILABLE.\n\nPLEASE COPY AND PASTE THIS LINK TO OUR APPLICATION:\nhttps://tlps.wufoo.com/forms/the-little-pink-shelter-adoption-application/\n\nMary-Kate and Ashley. Kylie and Kendall. Venus and Serena. Add \u201cPenny and Precious\u201d to the mix and you get the All-Time Top Sister Pairs!!! Penny and Precious were dumped together way out in the country in very rural Arkansas, 2 sweet sisters whose dire situation was lost on them. Thankfully a kind woman took them in and cared for them for a bit, thinking maybe someone would come looking for them. But of course, no one did. So we got them into our program at the shelter we like to call \"The Group Home\" and they have been amazing us ever since.\n\nWe really want to keep these two beautiful sisters together simply because they are truly joined at the hip. They're the kind who \"finish each other's sentences\", take every step together without even thinking about it, seem to have inside jokes together and even seem to read each other's minds! Because of their bond, we're not sure whose hearts would break more if they were separated: theirs or ours. We're looking for a person or a family whose hearts can open wider than they ever thought possible to let these two sweet girls stay together for life. We know whoever does, will understand immediately just how special and beautiful their bond is.\n\nPenny and Precious are super social with everyone -- they just love people, love to be petted and, if you think you're sitting in that chair alone think again because before you know it, \"someone's\" little paws will be in your lap nudging you to let her climb up, while \"someone else's\" little nose might be nudging you for another belly rub!  They're still puppies, still have their moments of puppy zoomies, and that means double trouble (in the cutest way).  But they're never underfoot and know how to give you space when you need it.   And of course they'll always be able to amuse themselves if you're too busy.   \n\nPenny is the tri-colored girl and she\u2019s a bit more the \u201cbrains of the operation\u201d. Precious is mostly golden-and-white and is very much the little sister: she\u2019s physically smaller, she\u2019s a bit more the instigator at playtime, and she is very comfortable taking Penny\u2019s lead. We guess they're about 10 - 12 months old and they\u2019re very healthy girls. Penny weighs about 45 pounds and Precious weighs about 35 pounds. We have no way of knowing if they're actual littermates, half-sisters (female dogs can have multiple mates) or just sisters-from-another-mother, but we do know they're soul sisters who deserve to stay together. If your heart and home - - and pockets - - are big enough for 2 beautiful, loving sweethearts, please visit www.pinkshelter.org for more information about the adoption process. Full vetting AND spay included in their adoption fee. Transport fee is additional $140 each. IF YOU HAVE AOL or YAHOO PLEASE CHECK YOUR SPAM FILE FOR OUR RESPONSE\n\n",

Olive was bought by her previous owner from a street vender selling her in a tiny cage. She was then passed on to a different home and eventually to a foster family with our rescue working on getting her a Forever Home. Little Olive ad bladder stone that was the size of her bladder and she had surgery to remove the stone.  Surgery was successful and she eats prescription food in order to not have further stones. However, Olive has issues with urination. The vet states she is unable to control her urination to a certain degree. She is able to wear diapers, but there is always work with her to try and train to use the potty pad. Olive is an intelligent, sweet little girl with a lot of personality. She does well with people of all ages. We are looking for a specific Forever Home and Family for Olive. We hope she can be either an only pet or that an other dog would be similar in size and not an alpha dog. We are searching for an adopter who either has experience with dogs who have had bladder stones and incontinence issues or who has the time and energy to learn.  We are looking for a Forever Family and Home where Olive will be happy and settled and enjoy a long life ahead of her. If you feel you are that special someone or family to offer Olive a Forever Home where she will have the time and resources spent on her and where she can enjoy life, feel free to apply to adopt her. Adoption donation: $300\n\nNo out of state applications and applications required prior to meet and greets.\n\nAll of our animals are fixed, chipped, and up to date on vaccinations. \n\n LIKE our Facebook page for news, events, and new animals. www.homelesstoforever.com and www.Facebook.com/HomelessToForeverFoundation",

IF IT IS LISTED WITHOUT THE WORD \"PENDING\" IT MEANS IT IS AVAILABLE.\n\nPLEASE COPY AND PASTE THIS LINK TO OUR APPLICATION:\nhttps://tlps.wufoo.com/forms/the-little-pink-shelter-adoption-application/\n\nMary-Kate and Ashley. Kylie and Kendall. Venus and Serena. Add \u201cPenny and Precious\u201d to the mix and you get the All-Time Top Sister Pairs!!! Penny and Precious were dumped together way out in the country in very rural Arkansas, 2 sweet sisters whose dire situation was lost on them. Thankfully a kind woman took them in and cared for them for a bit, thinking maybe someone would come looking for them. But of course, no one did. So we got them into our program at the shelter we like to call \"The Group Home\" and they have been amazing us ever since.\n\nWe really want to keep these two beautiful sisters together simply because they are truly joined at the hip. They're the kind who \"finish each other's sentences\", take every step together without even thinking about it, seem to have inside jokes together and even seem to read each other's minds! Because of their bond, we're not sure whose hearts would break more if they were separated: theirs or ours. We're looking for a person or a family whose hearts can open wider than they ever thought possible to let these two sweet girls stay together for life. We know whoever does, will understand immediately just how special and beautiful their bond is.\n\nPenny and Precious are super social with everyone -- they just love people, love to be petted and, if you think you're sitting in that chair alone think again because before you know it, \"someone's\" little paws will be in your lap nudging you to let her climb up, while \"someone else's\" little nose might be nudging you for another belly rub!  They're still puppies, still have their moments of puppy zoomies, and that means double trouble (in the cutest way).  But they're never underfoot and know how to give you space when you need it.   And of course they'll always be able to amuse themselves if you're too busy.   \n\nPenny is the tri-colored girl and she\u2019s a bit more the \u201cbrains of the operation\u201d. Precious is mostly golden-and-white and is very much the little sister: she\u2019s physically smaller, she\u2019s a bit more the instigator at playtime, and she is very comfortable taking Penny\u2019s lead. We guess they're about 10 - 12 months old and they\u2019re very healthy girls. Penny weighs about 45 pounds and Precious weighs about 35 pounds. We have no way of knowing if they're actual littermates, half-sisters (female dogs can have multiple mates) or just sisters-from-another-mother, but we do know they're soul sisters who deserve to stay together. If your heart and home - - and pockets - - are big enough for 2 beautiful, loving sweethearts, please visit www.pinkshelter.org for more information about the adoption process. Full vetting AND spay included in their adoption fee. Transport fee is additional $140 each. IF YOU HAVE AOL or YAHOO PLEASE CHECK YOUR SPAM FILE FOR OUR RESPONSE",

While you can tell she's been spoiled she wasn't taken care of medically. She is 10 lbs and ~8 years\u00a0old.\u00a0\u00a0Poodle needed a much needed dental. The dental xray showed she needed six teeth removed. She had mammary tumors in every mammary when we got her. She's had half removed. The report came back not cancerous. She is scheduled to have the rest removed on January 29th. The estimate is $800. She had giardia which is an intestinal parasite. She does randomly show back pain. Nothing showed up on her xray but her muscles are tense sometimes per the vet. We give her gabapentin when needed. The pill must be crushed or she will not eat it. She currently takes dasuquin ground up. She refuses a chew. She also takes Welactin fish oil. She would benefit with Adequan injections. She possibly may need back surgery in the future. The adopter should be prepared for the expense. She will need to be kept very slim to not add extra stress on her back. She does have one luxating patella but it does not cause any issues. She is heartworm negative, spayed, and microchipped. She's had numerous exams. She's up to date on vaccinations, flea prevention, and heartworm prevention. She needs regular grooming. She saw the ophthalmologist\u00a0vet. He diagnosed her with keratitis. This is scarring of her eyes from allergies. She will be on Keterolac\u00a0eye drops twice a day for the rest of her life. She doesn't care for the drops but allows you to do them. She possibly might need some lashes removed but the vet thought the drops would be enough. We will check in a few weeks.\u00a0\nShe will only eat can food. We tried several dry and she'd rather starve.\u00a0She seems like a little diva. She hates dogs over 20 lbs with a passion. I don't see this changing since she's been around nice ones since August. She acts like everyone is beneath her. She does not like any chews. She will eat treats though. All pills must be crushed or she will refuse the food. She uses a potty pad when needed. She does love the baby pools and mud. In the beginning she was extremely nervous in the car. I assume after being dumped. She's much better now and even wants to stick her head out the window for air. She's good at the vet. She walks good on the leash and loves walks. I see her on a dog bed glaring at her servants. A few times if we reached for her she's been nippy. I assume she's painful. I would instead get her on a leash and then I have no issues. This rarely happens. Due to this I'd recommend no children. She comes to me to be picked up when coming back inside without issues. The issues usually are getting out the car or a crate.\u00a0She is located in New Orleans, LA but we adopt out of state.",

Hazel family was told she was a Dachshund/ Min Pin mix and they expected her to be about 16 pounds. At 7 months she is already 28 pounds! Due to Covid, Hazel has not been socialized outside the home.

Our veterinary partner estimates that Quinell is 3 years old at the time of intake in January 2021. Quinell is good with people and other dogs. Quinell was dumped at a small, rural shelter with his sister. He was emaciated, suffering from a severe skin infection, weak and barely able to walk. This poor guy's entire life has been nothing but neglect, abuse and cruelty. The day Quinell was surrendered was probably the best day of his life! Quinell is at our veterinary partner receiving lifesaving medical treatment, and he will soon be ready to start the rest of his life. Quinell doesn't want to waste one minute of the happy life we promised him, so if you would like Quinell to join your family, please apply online to adopt Quinell (TX) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

            "description": "Meet Creed\n\nCreed is a 4 year old bull dog mix with a very friendly personality. He likes everyone he meets and is very good with dogs and cats however does become possessive of objects when comfortable in a home. So he might be better as an only dog. He is house trained. Creed also loves to play with his toys. He is medium energy and loves playing, hugging, and going for walk and greets everyone along the way. He does all this without being a particularly needy guy. Creed does prefer living with a man and we hope to find him that perfect home. We have placed Creed in a home with a women and man and he gravitates toward the man and becomes possesive. For this reason we are going to require him going to a home with a single man preferable a little active. Sometime in the past he was injured and it was not treated so his one rear leg does not have full use and never will. This does not stop him from going on walks. We put a doggy boot on that foot during the day if he is going to be out and about so that he does not rub the toes on that foot raw. It is easy to put the boot on and he will leave it on without any problems. He seems to realize it keeps the foot from being rubbed and makes it easier to walk and play. He is an all around fabulous guy who needs a buddy to hang with. To see how well he uses his leg you can watch the short video.\n\nFor more info call Pet Adoption League.208-366-1359\n2/1/21 2:43 PM",

She was a stray and was very underweight, but has put on some good weight now that she's under better care. She is good with other dogs but will need slow introductions and shouldn't be homed with another dominant female.  She enjoys people, but doesn't need to be glued to their side. Squeaky toys, rolling in the grass, and playing with other dogs are her favorite things to do.  She's her best self after a few good walks to help her use up her energy.  She only knows sit so far, but is treat motivated and ready to learn. Can you show this sweet girl a loving forever home?\n\nIf you're interested in Minnie, reach out to Rose at RoseC@doubledogrescue.org",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Larry is 2 years old at the time of intake in January 2021. Larry is good with people and other dogs. This adorable little guy is lucky to be alive as his owner sentenced him to death when they locked him in a crate in their backyard and moved away. They just left him there with no food, no water, no shelter and no way to survive. But Larry's torturers underestimated the kindness of strangers, and when the neighbors heard Larry's cries, they made sure that he was rescued. It wasn't Larry's turn to die, and now Larry is a Rescue Dogs Rock NYC pup. He has received the medical care he required, and now Larry will land in a fantastic forever home where he will never, ever experience abuse, neglect or cruelty. In fact, Larry will forget his past and know nothing but love, happiness, soft touches and kind words. If you can give Larry that life, please apply online to adopt Larry (TX) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

He looks to be about 10 months old and likely a German Shepherd mix. Chance and his brother, Trey, were found as strays and have been living in the pound for the last two months. While we don't know much about Chance, he seems to have the potential to be a model canine citizen. He's affectionate, outgoing, even-tempered and like most puppies, can be hyper at times but settles quickly. He does well in outdoor playgroup with his brother and other pups. Beyond playtime with other dog friends, Chance loves to go for walks and runs and play fetch. He has had some exposure to visiting children and gets very excited to see them, but we can't be sure how he would do living with kids full-time since he hasn't been with them much. Chance can be a little vocal and sometimes demand barks.\n\nAs with all of our rescue pups, we would recommend that Chance and his new human(s) attend some dogs training classes together. They are a great way to help teach him essential commands, reinforce these skills, and get some socialization time with other dogs -- all while continuing to enhance the bond between pet and parent. He's still just a puppy, so he will need some practice with house-, crate-, and leash training. Chance appears to be an intelligent dog, so he seems like he would respond well to training.\n\nReady to take a \"Chance\" on this sweet pup? Fill out an application today!\n\nMedical Note: This dog tested positive for exposure to ehrlichia while in SOS foster care. This does not mean that this dog had ehrlichia. This dog is/has been asymptomatic while in SOS care and was preventatively treated with a 28-day course of doxycycline. Please see here for more information on ehrlichia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehrlichiosis_(canine). Please check with your vet if you should have any questions or concerns about this condition, and discuss any concerns you may have with your SOS Adoption Counselor.\n\nAdoption Fee: $585\n\nTo apply for this dog, fill out an adoption application on our website: www.sosarl.org/aa/\n\n**Additional info you should know - For most of our dogs, we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each of our dogs as an individual and do our best to describe and place them based on personality not breed label. Some dogs may not yet be in New England, nor ready for immediate adoption. There may be additional vetting, quarantine, waiting periods and/or fees depending upon your state of residence. If you have questions or concerns on any of this, you can discuss this with your Adoption Counselor.",

I am a little chubby and could lose a few pounds.\n\nI live with a bunch of other dogs and am good with them.  I especially like puppies.  \n\nI have had a tough life up to this point.  I'm about 6 years old and I lived outside my entire life. I'm really glad to be able to sleep in a warm, comfortable home now especially in this cold weather.   Remarkably, I'm still a happy, sweet boy.  \n\nI went to the vet this week and got my vaccines and got a bath and a nail trim. \n\nIf you are interested in giving me a loving home, please contact my foster mom at dmmarson@hotmail.com.\n\nThanks.\n\nBobby Boy",

Her favorite things are snuggling, going on walks, kisses on her cheeks, and getting all the attention and love she deserves; Dorothy is a little princess.\n\nAt home, she spends a good time of her day snoozing next to her foster dad in the home office; he says she is a great co-worker!\n\nDorothy is house trained (knows to use pee pads if needed) she doesn't chew on things and is good roaming free if left alone; she doesn't love her crate, but she uses it sometimes.\n\nShe likes people in general, but a family of adults only would be best since she has some sensitive areas she can get snappy. Dorothy has some sensitive areas where you need to approach softly, like her ears.\n\nDorothy loves car rides, walks nicely on a leash, and she will chase a squirrel if she sees one!\n\nShe would do best in a home where she is the only pet in the house since she doesn't like other pets much.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Dorothy, you can contact her foster mom at denisev4@icloud.com\n\nCould you be Dorothy's new person? The Adoption Fee for Dorothy is: $275.00 + $45.00 for a health certificate if going over state lines (required by law). TRANSPORTATION HELP! If you see a furbaby that would be a match for your family, please don't let distance stand in the way of your adoption. LPDR can work with you to have a volunteer transport to assist with transportation or refer you to a paid transport.",

He's guessed to be a 2 year old hound mix. Spudd says I am a sweet boy and I currently weigh about 66 lbs. \n\nSpudd would be a perfect running or biking partner, he loves the outdoors and has a beautiful stride. Click here to see him in action! \n\nI was found on the side of the road by a good Samaritan who saw my need to go to the vet asap. She noticed I had a GPS and personal collar on. She went home to gather some towels and when she returned I was waiting for her but missing my GPS and personal collar. The Good Samaritan could not imagine what I thought when the owner arrived but then turned around and left me on the side of the road. Animal Control was called and took me to the vet where I was checked out with only a case of road rash on the left side of my body. So, this is the beginning of my journey with OPH. \n\nSpudd does very well on a leash and LOVES to sniff everything when going on walks. Spudd has not had any accidents nor marked in the house and will go to the door when he wants to go out. He has been introduced to the Foster's 3 personal dogs and 1 cat with no reaction. He does not seem to recognize commands like Sit yet but learning Outside and Potty easily and now working on Come. \n\nBecause of his height, he is the perfect candidate to be a counter surfer! Spudd accepts the crate with little protest (whines) but will settle within minutes. He does not jump on people and loves to be around people. He has not been introduced to small children.\n\n His loves to go on walks and the only reaction on walks was the sound of a diesel truck. He has yet to interact play with the Fosters personal dogs or with toys. Spudd is a gentle soul who loves to be scratched. Spudd is waiting for an adopter who will give him a loving home forever now matter what... Is that special someone you?\nTo adopt this dog, or any OPH dog, fill out the simple online application at https://ophrescue.org \nOperation Paws for Homes, Inc. (OPH) rescues dogs of all breeds and ages from high-kill shelters in NC, VA, MD, and SC, reducing the numbers being euthanized. With limited resources, the shelters are forced to put down 50-90% of the animals that come in the front door. OPH provides pet adoption services to families located in VA, DC, MD, PA and neighboring states. OPH is a 501(c)(3) organization and is 100% donor funded. OPH does not operate a shelter or have a physical location. We rely on foster families who open their homes to give love and attention to each dog before finding a forever home.",

            "description": "Urgent will be going to shelter February 1rst. It is an urgent call. Never been around children or cats. From the lady who adopted him 2 years ago:\n\n\"Sam is a 4-year-old Great Dane/Greyhound mix. He is black, with white sprinkles, and weighs in at about 75 pounds. He loves to run, walk, and play with his toys and bones, and other dogs. As a puppy, Sammy was attacked by some older dogs, leaving him with some subtle scars you may notice on his neck. When I first got him, he was skittish, and not at all trusting. But, with time and patience, he has come into his own, developed an amusing personality, learned to trust me, and considers himself my protector. Sam is smart, stubborn, funny, athletic and enjoys conversation. By conversation, I mean he likes to talk. He talks when he\u2019s hungry, when he wants to go out, or when he just wants some attention. (I have never had a dog do this before.) He has a loud and deep bark that would scare away any intruder. Sam has a sensitive stomach and is allergic to chicken. I give feed him about 6 cups a day of \u201csensitive stomach\u201d dry food, along with 6 or seven hard-boiled eggs, throughout the day. Sam has his boundaries. For example, he prefers not to be bothered when he\u2019s trying to sleep. It makes him grumpy and grumbly. Oh, and he has an underbite that can make for some messy eating. But he does clean up after himself. Pet his face, rub his ears and muzzle and he\u2019ll be yours forever. He is up to date with his vaccines. \"",

            "description": "OUR ADOPTION PROCESS AND APPLICATION ARE AVAILABLE AT WWW.SOHODOGRESCUE.ORG AND OUR ADOPTION FEE IS $275\n\nDutchess is a very cute Border Collie/Great Pyrenees mix who is ready for her forever home!  She is just 5 months old, weighs 33 pounds, and she has a black and white coat complete with freckles and a full tail.  Dutchess is housebroken, crate-trained and she is quickly learning her basic obedience commands.  Dutchess rides beautifully in the car and is getting used to walking on leash.\nDutchess loves people and she is already a professional snuggler!  She is a medium energy, medium Velcro young girl who loves belly rubs, playing with her toys and just hanging out with the people in her life.  Dutchess also enjoys playing with other dogs.  She has not been cat-tested.\nThe ideal home for Dutchess is active and loving, shared with a family who is ready for a new best friend.  She is still a puppy at heart, and so it is important that her new family commit to additional training so that she can be the best dog ever!  A fenced yard is important, another dog is fine with her, and children over the age of 10 are welcome.  If you are ready to welcome a Dutchess into your home, apply today!  Dutchess is fostered in Nashville, TN.\n",

My name is Kisses and I am a 3 month old, 15 pound Shepherd mix girl looking for the perfect family to call my own. I am a typical playful puppy with lots of energy, so I am looking for a family who is active, ready to play,\u00a0and has plenty of toys to\u00a0keep me entertained. I am working hard on potty training and kennel training, so I need someone who can provide me with the structure and training necessary to help me grow into the best pup I can be! I am great with other dogs and humans of all ages. In fact, I would prefer a home with some playful dog or human siblings, as well as a fenced-in yard in which we can play together (no apartments for me please). If you have been looking for a new love of your life, then why not apply for me, Kisses?\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Lincoln is 2 years old at the time of intake in January 2021. Lincoln is good with people and other dogs. Lincoln was cruelly abandoned in a backyard when his owners moved away. He was locked in a crate with no chance at all of survival without food, water or shelter. Fortunately, neighbors heard Lincoln and tried to get the authorities to step in and help him. When no one came after one day, two days, three days, our volunteer removed Lincoln and brought him to safety. We can't change the horror of Lincoln's past, but we can definitely change his future. If you can open your heart, home and life to Lincoln and give him the fantastic future we promised him, please apply online to adopt Lincoln (TX) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

Im house trained.  Im pretty much the sweetest guy you'll meet.  I love to cuddle and sleep with (or on) my people.  I may follow you around the house because I just love being with you.  I think car rides are the greatest!  Im an excellent boy for my baths too.  My dad taught me so much about being a great dog.  He spent a lot of time with me and I hope my new person will too.I need an above ground fence so I can play outside.  I prefer not to be crated and I certainly don't want to be all day so maybe someone that's home a good bit;  Another nice dog would be great! \nI am neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, and on hw prevention.   \nJust give a chance and I promise you won't regret it! No small children and no apartments please.\nCopy and paste link for application\nhttps://forms.gle/i6vCT6447Eew8NCg9\n",

Those crystal blue beautiful eyes! Meet Jakob Black or JB as we call him. Appropriately named after a movie character who is equally as handsome as this gorgeous guy! Not to mention they both have the same howl! Jakob was found at large by 3 different community member successfully escaping from each of them to continue his jaunt across the county. Most likely looking for love since we are sure he knows he is handsome and the fact that he was an intact male! When he was picked up and put in to impound not only did that stop his escaping and running around looking for hot chicks it also took care of the intact male part! In the same instance he is now becoming a well mannered young man that is eager for some attention and affection. Jakob likely hasn't received a whole lot of training in his young life however he is an eager learner and is picking up on commands nicely while he stays here with us. He is a very big boy so a family with small children isn't a good mix as JB is still learning how to control his enthusiasm! Jakob does listen however he would benefit from a confident and experienced dog owner that knows how to communicate with an over zealous dog. Jakob keeps a clean kennel and hasn't shown any issue with the dogs coming and going around him. We have not cat tested him yet so we are not sure about the feelings he has towards felines. Jakob has been neutered, vaccinated, micro-chipped and wormed. His adoption fee is $275.00",

            "description": "Merlin is officially available for adoption now.    More than a pretty face, we will only consider a family that has the energy and time for a young high energy puppy.  Merlin is maybe 10 months old and ALL pup and totally deaf collie mix.   He is super High energy but not neurotic.   He now has basic commands using hand signals and crates beautifully.   He no longer attempts to herd the kids but it would be best he either has older mindful kids, or a family with a solid history of working with herding dogs, and fully accepting he may make mistakes and grab pants.  He MUST be formally enrolled in positive trianing classes and He will NEED another young high energy dog to play with him.  This is not negotiable.  He takes dog correction very well, and has been fine with the cats and chickens here at GDU.   He is a special boy that has captured our directors heart and We owe it to him to be picky in his placement.   A physically fenced yard is a MUST.  Underground fencing is not an option.   Please do not email asking for an exception to this.  I assume someone saw him as a gorgeous puppy, did nothing with him, and gave him up when he started herding children out of boredom.  As long as he gets an appropriate amount of exercise, this is not an issue.   He is being fostered at GDU HQ by our Animal Behavior Specialist who absolutely adores him.   If you are interested and meet these qualifications set forth, please fill out an app.  We will not respond to applications which do not meet the stated needs.\nAt the time you are seeing this post, Merlin is still available for adoption. But please know that we may be working on multiple applications already, and any one of them could be approved at any time. Please READ THIS ENTIRE DESCRIPTION and complete an adoption application, if you are interested in any of our animals. Application at www.greendogsunleashed.org   If you send an inquiry to ask if the dog is still available, or just tell us you are interested, your inquiry will not be answered. FILL OUT AN APPLICATION. We can do NOTHING without that. No, we cannot tell you if he would be a match for your family without seeing an application.  PLEASE KEEP READING for info.\n\n*/*/* PLEASE NOTE:  The first communication you will receive after completing an application will be an email response, which will have instructions on how to proceed. Please check your inbox AND spam folders for the next 48 hours, for this email. We will not begin processing an application without the information requested in that email. */*/*\n\nWe are happy to consider applicants from out of state on most dogs. Please read the description to see if this dog is an exception.  If the applicant is approved to adopt, they MUST be willing to come to our location in Troy, VA, for a meet and greet. If all parties agree that the pup and family are a good fit,  they would take the pup home at that time.\n\nFor more information about our mission and for an APPLICATION for adoption, please go to www.greendogsunleashed.com.\n\nGDU does ask a minimum adoption fee of $300.00. This does not even come close to covering all expenses created by animals while in rescue. We are funded solely by the angels and volunteers willing to donate time and finances. This minimum fee includes DAPP, rabies if age appropriate,, heartworm test and preventative, if age appropriate, and flea and tick treatment, as well as neutering or spaying, if the animal is medically sound to undergo surgery.  In an attempt to avoid tummy upset from a sudden change of food, the foster family may include a small, transitional bag of the food the dog/puppy has been eating. And if the dog/puppy has grown attached to a special item (like a toy or blanket), they may send that along, as well.\n\n*/*/*  Young puppies will receive age-appropriate vaccines, and will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Adopters may be required to provide additional puppy boosters and at 16 weeks of age, a rabies vaccine. Future annual vaccines, testing and monthly heartworm preventative are REQUIRED, and will be the financial responsibility of the adopter.",

She is a puppy so she is still trying to learn all the basics but would rather PLAY PLAY PLAY than focus on training! \n\nShe is learning to not chase the cats, she absolutely loves to cuddle and sleep with them, but if they run she thinks it is game and she is more than ready to play!!\n\nShe LOVES other dogs and humans so much that she cannot contain herself. Cuddling is definitely her favorite thing. \n\nLilly will be spayed, vaccinate, dewormed, and kept on heart worm & parasite preventative.\n \nIf you are interested in Lilly please follow the link below to fill out an application! \n\nhttps://catassitanceteamsedalia.wufoo.com/forms/cats-adoption-survey-dogs/",

We're a bonded pair and need to be adopted together. We're currently in a great foster home together, but what we really want is a forever home being showered with love and cherished as members of the family.\n\nWe ride great in the car and get to go on errands with our foster mom. I have a fancy 'ride', I think they called it a stroller, when we go on faster walks with our foster mom's dog.\n\nOur foster mom provided some of our traits that she has observed since fostering us. I need a home with no children. I'm fecal incontinent but I will let you know when I have to outside to urinate. My feces is firm so my foster mom just picks it up. My back right leg is a bit wobbly and weaker than the left so i fall over at times. My front is very stiff from bearing so much of my weight my foster mom massages me daily to try and loosen it up. I don't hear much and I don't have good sight either, but I don't bump into things as I'm able to rely on my nose to guide me. Although I have a good appetite, I'm picky with my treats. I'm also demanding when my meals are being prepared and I bark non-stop. I want to be in the kitchen and can get underfoot which isn't good as I can't see and could get stepped on. I go on daily walks a 1/4 to 1/2 a mile slowly to keep my legs in shape. After that I love riding in the dog stroller for rest of the walk. I do not care to be crated.\n\nIf you're looking for two great dogs, please fill out an online application to meet us.\n\nAdditional information: *Needs Adult Only Home *Special Needs",

Lyka and her sibling, Mia, were both brought in as strays. Lyka has been nervous since her arrival at the shelter, but overall, is friendly and alert. Volunteers report that she walks well on leash and is probably house-trained. Lyka will approach someone new, especially if they have treats in their hand! They also mention that she enjoys petting. German Shepherd Dogs are considered to be very intelligent and can make wonderful canine companions. Lyka, at a young five years of age, is still full of life even though she is considered to be a senior dog. As a senior dog, she qualifies for our Senior for Seniors Program in which if an adopter is sixty years old or more, then the adoption is totally free! As well, past and present military members can adopt for free. Lyka is a gorgeous looking dog who needs a new fur-ever home where she can feel loved and secure. A quieter home with older kids and adults is probably best for her. If you like Lyka, bring her into your home where her uplifting and charming personality is sure to blossom!

We're an older bonded pair and need to be adopted together. We're currently in a great foster home together, but what we really want is a forever home to spend our golden years being showered with love and cherished as members of the family.\n\nWe ride great in the car and get to go on errands with our foster mom. Trixie has a fancy 'ride', I think they called it a stroller, when we go on faster walks with our foster mom's dog.\n\nOur foster mom provided some of our traits that she has observed since fostering us. I need a home with no children - I will bite. I've tried to bite my foster mom when she puts on my harness (never when she puts my leash over my head though). I don't like my front legs messed with. I'm a great walker on leash - no pulling unless my nose has found something I want to focus on. I can keep up with my foster mom's 70 lb Labrador. I'm good in crate/bike dog trailer and I go in with a treat. I love my squeaky toys and chasing my foster mom's lab around the backyard so I have a playful side.\n\nIf you're looking for two great dogs, please fill out an online application to meet us.\n\nAdditional information: *Housetrained *Needs Adult Only Home *Special Needs",

Legend was found in a rural area of Texas literally starving to death. He was dazed and confused and was not going to survive on his own in the middle of nowhere. Fortunately, one of our volunteers heard about Legend and picked him up and brought him straight to our veterinary partner for lifesaving treatment. Legend is a big boy, and in his emaciated condition, his weight was 90 lbs. We don't know if this regal pup was dumped or just lost his way, but his life is back on track and he is headed straight for happiness!

I'm Parfait, a pink-nosed, very peppy 1 year old puppy. My coat is my pride and joy. It's soft and shiny in a gorgeous shade of red, white, and black. And how about my pretty white paws? I can't wait to find someone to teach me to shake! Because I'm still young and totally all puppy, I am a little mischievous. In other words, I need to learn some manners. Walking on leash is new, but I'm doing great so far and only pull a little bit. Because I have figured out how to open shelter doors, I'm known as an escape artist, so my new home will need a little puppy-proofing before I move in. I am just starting to figure out how fun stuffed toys and tennis balls can be. At first I thought it was strange that everyone kept throwing them for me, but now I get it! My CARE friends say I'm exceptionally cute, friendly, and as sweet as can be. If you are looking for a life-long friend, come and meet me today! I will be available for adoption after I am spayed on 2/2/21, but you can fill out a survey for me now.\nAdoption Information: Size: medium / weighs 50 lbs. Children: Yes Dogs: Unknown Cats: Unknown Adoption Fee: $300 This dog will be spayed, microchipped and will have a full veterinary checkup and vaccines.\nIf you are interested in more information or would like to meet this dog, please fill out our online adoption survey: carenorthshore.org/dog-adoption-survey",

He was so filthy, covered in mats, His eye had ruptured and no one even knew it. He had never been anywhere but on the tie out and his shed. How do people treat these precious creatures like this and sleep at night????? \nWell the little sweetheart got picked up and finally got groomed and felt so much better! He just sat and let them do whatever they needed to the whole time. Such a good boy! \nOllie is in the 8 year range and weighs in at approx 10 lbs. His coloring is gorgeous and he's a very mellow boy. He loves his food and is a real cheese hound. \nOllie is located in Freeport NY\nHis adoption fee is $600",

She was in horrific condition and it was obvious that all Lola has known her entire life is neglect and abuse. We are happy to have been able to rescue Lola from her inhumane and savage existence, and she is now at our veterinary partner being treated for a severe skin infection and emaciation. Lola will soon be ready to start the second chapter of her life, and she deserves the best of the best to make up for her past.

Rosie is very low key, enjoys her nap time and likes being outdoors exploring new surroundings.  She has no trouble getting around at all, and when she loses some weight she\u2019ll be light on her feet!  She gets along with people and dogs but she\u2019d really love some one-on-one encouragement along with a few walks to get into shape. Rosie is not a barker or howler. We suspect she has led a neglected life which shows by the condition of her skin.  She has either a flea allergy or a food allergy but we are treating whatever it is and she\u2019s will most likely regrow the fur that\u2019s missing on her lower back.  Rosie also has some hearing loss, but she can certainly hear the dinner bell!\nWe love our seniors. We hope you do too. Rosie just needs a little attention and love and she will thrive.  Could you be her hero?\nApplications at www.pounddogfounddog.org\n\n",

He is 1 year old, weighs 55 pounds, and he has a gorgeous red and white coat.  Baloo is housebroken, crate-trained and is learning his basic obedience commands.  He is a great passenger in the car but his leash walking skills need work!\nBaloo loves people.  He is a high Velcro, high energy guy who loves attention and loves to play ball, play with his toys and run, run, run.  Baloo was recently introduced to agility and he loved it!  He still has a lot of puppy in him, and he will counter surf and jump up on people when he thinks he can get away with it!  Baloo also loves to play with other dogs, and romping and wrestling with other dogs are some of his favorite things to do. When he finally settles at the end of the day, this big goof naps with his pals, looks for someone to pet him, and just enjoys everyone\u2019s company.  Baloo has not been exposed to cats.\nThe ideal home for Baloo is full of fun, fun and more fun.  A fenced yard and another energetic, playful dog are important, children should be over the age of 12, and his new family should be committed to a solid training regimen for him.  Baloo is a big goofy \u201cpuppy\u201d who is ready for a great home with great pals and great training.  If your family would be a great match apply today!  Baloo is fostered in Frederick, MD.\n\n",

            "description": "Personality: Happy Gilmore is named for his super social and wiggly, excitable demeanor. He loves meeting new people but is still learning to not go overboard with his excitement (my human friend give me treats when I greet them like a gentleman and keep my paws on the floor). He is often so wiggly that he hurt his tail from wagging it too hard! Happy is looking for a family that is active and would love to take him on long walks and runs regularly. He would also benefit from a family that can guide him in his manners and learn to be calm. Happy is very food and tennis ball motivated so he aims to please! Happy loves to play fetch and it's a great way to tire him out. In his down time he LOVES to cuddle up with his friends. \n\nHistory: He came to us from the central valley. \n\nDog/Cat Skills: Happy participates in playgroup daily. He often explores the yard and engages in chase play. He has shown a discomfort with more tense, forward behavior, especially from male dogs, and may correct or target them. He has shown to do best with relaxed, social females and does like to engage in some calm wrestle play. He can also become overly excited with vocal play. Happy is best with social, calm, tolerant dogs who can greet and play politely. Happy has shown hyper focus and willingness to chase cats. \n\nLeash Skills: Happy pulls while walking on a leash and would benefit from the use of a front clipping harness. He has shown some barrier and leash frustration with dogs displaying tense behavior, and does not always meet dogs comfortably on leash. We are working on this by redirecting him with treats or toys. \n\nMedical: Happy arrived at HSSV with trauma to the tip of his tail. Due to his habit of wagging his tail vigorously and hitting the walls with the tip of his tail, he repeatedly traumatized the tip of the tail until it became devitalized. He had also caused painful sores along the sides on the last 3rd of his tail from wagging it against walls. To treat his wounds and relieve his pain, it was necessary to amputate a portion of his tail. He is recovering and healing from the surgery very well. Happy is also healing from ear infections that are currently being treated. \n\nReady to meet Happy Gilmore ?

            "description": "Snuggles is a sweet gal who found herself in a home with too many other pets. She and just one other were not getting along, so Snuggles found herself needing rescue. She is a great girl and very snuggly. She is unsure herself and her surroundings and will need an understanding home where she can adjust slowly and build her confidence to be the great, well adjusted girl we have seen glipses of! We were told she was chihauhau/poodle, but there might be some other DNA in there as well. We can't be certain of breeds! We are certain that she deserves a great home with a lap she can snooze on and a home she can blossom in! Because we are foster based, we require an approved application before a meet and greet can be scheduled. We think that is fair to our fosters so every meet and greet has the potential to result in an immediate adoption. The application is available on the rescue website and can be completed online. We work with many rescues and strive to find every rescued dog in our care a great home. Sometimes that means transferring that pet to another location where adoption may be more likely. We currently have partners in New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont.\n\nIf you are interesting in meeting any of our pets, the process is to complete an application. It can be downloaded as a pdf document from our website and submitted by email to WindyRidgeRescue@gmail.com as a scanned document or as photos OR can be completed entirely online. Both links are in the header of our website.\n\nBecause we are foster based, we require an approved application to schedule a meet and greet. We feel that is fair to our fosters and rescues so every meet and greet can result in an adoption.\n\nWe do not have set adoption fees for dogs, but hope adopters will donate generously so we can rescue more. The medical care for every dog can easily exceed the adoption donation. Average adoption fees for dogs in the area range from $175 up to $450.\n\nWe ask for a minimum adoption donation of $50 for cats regardless of age. Each cat is up to date on vaccinations, dewormer, and microchipped. Larger donations are always welcome so we can rescue more. Medical care for each cat easily exceeds the minimum donation.\n\nAs with every rescue, our resources are limited and the need for rescue help is unlimited. Your generosity helps us to rescue more.\n\nAdopting or fostering for a rescue frees up a space where a new rescue can reside.\n\nIf you can't adopt or foster, than please consider donating.",

She is quite an enthusiastic gal and will need someone interested in longterm training with her. Her and her foster are currently working with our dog trainer and her adoption includes free lessons to help with the transition. Ruthie is working on her leash manners. She has been friendly when meeting new dogs but will need slow intro's, as her enthusiasm may not be well received by others. Same with her human greetings - Ruthie is exuberant, so we don't recommend a home with kids. Ruthie would love to live with an active family - hiking, running, swimming, you name it, she's up for the adventure! Ruthie rides well in the car and enjoys trips, even just to run errands with you. She is crate trained and potty trained as well.",

            "description": "Meet fun and sweet Donna! Just looking at that super long tongue of hers should brighten your day! Donna had a rough start in life: she was living with a family until she was 3 m.o. until one day she jumped off a high bed and fractured her spine. The family didn't want to deal with these problems, so they dumped her outside of their apartments. The volunteers picked her up, did all the medical treatments and rehab until she fully recovered. Donna is 3y.9m. old shepherd mix. She is very human-oriented and food-driven (needs to lose some weight for that reason). She's lived in a few foster homes with adults, kids, dogs, cats and even 2 guinea pigs! She can stay home alone (with other dogs) without issues. Good on a leash and potty-trained. She is a quick-learner and knows quite a few basic commands in Russian. She may be a little possessive over her food with other dogs, but otherwise loves to run and play with them. Donna has medium level of activity with two walks, but would benefit from having a fenced-in yard to run around and exercise more throughout the day. She well-socialized and is gentle with little kids. She is curious about cats and may come up to smell them. Donna is about 66lbs and 24.5inches tall at the withers. Vaccinated, spayed and healthy. Donna is flying to the US mid-February and would love to have her forever family take her home!  Adoption fee is $600.\n\nIf you interested in adopting this girl, please fill out an adoption application: https://forms.gle/me4k8pMEdwSxbMwo7\n\n",

I am a 1.5 year old, 70 pound Pit/Dane mix girl and I have been dreaming of a forever home to call my own. While waiting for my perfect home to come along, I have been working hard to make sure I am the best pup that I can be! I am already house trained and kennel trained, and I even know lots of commands, like \"sit,\" \"down,\" \"shake,\" \"speak,\" and many more! I get along great with other dogs, and would love to have a playful dog sibling in my forever home. I also do well with cats and kids, if you have either of those! I love to snuggle and chill in the house, but I also love to go for runs and hikes outside, so an active family would be best for me. Do I sound like your dream dog? Then fill out that application so that both of our dreams can come true!\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

Breed guesses: Black Mouth Cur, Redbone Coonhound, Labrador\n\nThis is his backstory as told by the shelter:\nThis dogs owner died in December leaving this 8 year old with no one since. The daughter was trying her best to keep him fed and watered but live in a kennel and seems that\u2019s how owner kept him was all bottled up.  The city of Senath ACO was zero help. This dog was abandoned inside a house with no electric and still nothing was going to be done. A neighbor was worried he would jump through windows and hurt himself so she asked for help. What fucking city let\u2019s a dog stay like that?  All that had to be done was to surrender the dog over. Anyway \nWe didn\u2019t know type of dog or what we were getting into until we saw the truck coming with tarps over a wire kennel reinforced with chicken wire and this poor dog was riding in that. \nThor came out bouncing and happy to be on ground. Daughter says he was good with the other small dogs in the house her dad had (those dogs died I\u2019m told). \nThor is at least 8 and my best guess 100-120 lbs \nYou can see the injuries on his head and face from trying to get out of kennels \nHe has had zero vetting \nBecky was gracious to offer to bring him to her pound at least has heat food and water. \nThor really needs to be in boarding so I\u2019m looking for donations to help with that. \nI\u2019m praying someone will see the good in this boy.",

Buddy has been a little frightened since he arrived and was trying to get attention. Once he had your attention he turned into a big baby, wiggled all over and very eager to please. Just look at that face, how can you resist? Buddy will sit as soon as he is told and takes treats very gently. Buddy is about 4 years old and weighs 63 pounds. He is current on vaccines, neutered and micro-chipped. He will be tested for heart worms upon adoption. You will find Buddy waiting in run 55 and his ID# is 626942.\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

            "description": "Boomer is a super sweet and goofy boy. He loves to run the back yard and play with his foster siblings. After a good hard play he is ready for a nice nap. He is content curling up by himself or laying with a foster sibling, but his true joy is cuddling up with his people. He does well in the house and hasn't had any accidents. He is crate trained and doesn't cry or tear up things while crated. He has gotten along well with two other male dogs his size in the home. He also does well on car rides. He walks well on a leash and knows how to sit. \n\nBoomer came to us after he became urgent at the shelter. Boomer was impounded by animal control on 11/19/2020 after someone reported that he got out of his fenced yard and bit someone on the ankle while they were working outside. Boomer stayed in the shelter until 1/14/21 where he had no issues with any of the staff or other animals. Boomer went into a foster home on 1/14/21, where he has done phenomenal and has had no issues. Unfortunately due to Boomer's bite record inside the City limits of Sapulpa, he can not be adopted to anyone that lives inside Sapulpa city limits. \n\nBoomer previously lived with children and a small dog. He did well and had no issues with his previous family. Boomer is a very active dog and his new home will require a fenced in yard so he is able to safely run/play. \nWhen Boomer was impounded it was said that he jumped the chain link fence to get out but we can't confirm this. He has had no issues with trying to escape his fosters yard, however a home with a privacy fence is necessary for Boomer. \n\nBoomer's estimated date of birth is 7/14/19, he is 50lbs, neutered, current on all vaccinations, dewormed, on flea/tick prevention, heartworm negative and on prevention. Boomer is also microchipped and will come with a new ID tag when adopted. \n\nBoomer is currently in a foster home. Meet and greets can be scheduled by appointment once an approved application is on file. \nApplications can be found on our website: www.sapulpafurryfriends.org",

I'm new here, but I'm already making a big impression! I'm still a pup, that much is clear so I hope you're ready for fun and games. I need to learn some things like not jumping or using my mouth when I play with you. At this stage of my life, I'm probably too much for a family with small kids, but a busy home with lots of activity is probably perfect for me! Come and try me out and see if you can tire me out!\n\nLeash: Learning\nObedience: Needs training\nContainment: A fenced in yard\nWith other Dogs: Unknown\nWith cats: Unknown\nWith small children: Maybe too much energy\n\nAdoption comes with:\n\n* Mandatory spaying/neutering\n* First license\n* Veterinarian check-up\n* First vaccinations\n* Tattoo\n* Microchip implant\n* 6 weeks of free pet insurance\n* Small bag of dog food\n* De-worming for young pups\n * Literature on responsible pet ownership.\n\n------------------------------------\n\n** IMPORTANT NOTICE **\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, dog adoptions are currently being done by appointment only. Contact 311 to schedule an appointment. Thank you!\n\n______________________________\n\nCome Meet Our Adoptable Dogs...\nWinnipeg Animal Services Agency\n1057 Logan Avenue\nWinnipeg, Manitoba, Canada\nR3E 3N8\n\nPhone: 311 - outside Winnipeg dial 1-877-311-4974 \n\nEmail: animalservicesagency@winnipeg.ca\n\nOur hours for adoption are Monday to Friday from 11:00 am - 5:30 pm\nSaturday & Sunday from 12:00 pm - 4:30pm.\nAnimal Services is closed on statutory holidays.\n\nBACKGROUND\nAlmost all the dogs at Animal Services are picked up as strays running loose on the streets of Winnipeg and therefore they come to us with no known history. For this reason, we are not sure how they will interact with other dogs, cats or how they are with children. We would suggest that if you have younger children you bring them down with you to meet the dogs. We also have an outdoor play area where we can do introductions with any other dogs that live in the home.\n\nAll locally adopted dogs come with a 7 day home trial. If you return the dog within this time period, you will be refunded your adoption fee less the non-refundable deposit.\n\nPlease feel free to meet all the dogs and puppies outside of their kennels, just let the kennel attendants know that you would like a meet and greet with the dog outside of his pen. The dogs are much more relaxed when outside of their kennels. They would love to meet you!",

            "description": "Sammy: hes the goofball of the group. Hes clumsy because his long legs get in the way! He is probably the most active of the 3. His ears always have that adorable dorky look!\n\nSammy was found roaming with 2 other huskies, who we belive are his siblings. The finder brought them home and has done an incredible job of taking care of them and training them! We believe them to be between 1-2 years of age. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHere is some information their foster has shared about him and his siblings: \n\n \n\nAll dogs seem to have grown up together but are not bonded and can be adopted separately. They did better than I thought they would do getting baths as long as you go slow and talk to them! They did so great at the dog park. They are learning different ways to play (when they play together they are boys but my brothers female dog Lucy doesnt play rough) Did not seem to know basic commands but have been working on sit and off (jumping). They are required and successfully sit for 15-30 seconds (depending on my mood) before their food is placed in front of them for breakfast and dinner. Not food aggressive at all! As a matter of fact each dog will stop eating to show you attention if you ask them for it. I was able to put my hand in the bowl while they are each eating without fear. Individually each dog met my cats but completely supervised and controlled. Together they seem to want to play with my 10 year old cat and its just too much causing him to run and them to give chase. I have separate inside time between my cats and the dogs. We are doing much better about accidents in the home. The first week they had 4 plus accidents a day. Now have only had 2 accidents in the past 3 weeks. They (Rogue and Sammy) when left alone and bored they chew on whatever is lying around, definitely need a job to do or lots of fun toys or Kong's! Thankfully they do not constantly bark and dont bark at absolutely everything (park on other side of chain link fence where kids and other dogs walk) but are always alert. They love fetch and we are working on the returning part in the game of fetch.\n\nSammy would love to be part of any family and being a husky would like a family that is active or has a back yard for him to play in.\n\nHe is up to date on vaccines according to his age, has received proper deworming, and comes with additional dewormer. He is microchipped, neutered, comes with 6 months of preventatives, one month free trial of pet insurance, all of our animals receive a health certificate (this states a licensed veterinary saw the pet and deemed it healthy for travel, it is not a promise of perfect health.) Our transports are USDA certified and tfransport is included in adoption fee!\n\n \n\nHe is currently being fostered in Houston, Tx but will be traveling to the PNW 2/6/21.\n\nPlease inquire by submitting an application to mariah@threelittlepittiesrescue.org\n\nApplication link: https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/26842/generic",

Please apply on-line to be added to his waitlist. Boomer is an approx. 2 year old, male terrier mix that was found as a stray. Boomer is very frightened and shy and would do best in very experienced home that can help him gain confidence and learn how to trust. We recommend an adult only, quiet home. Due to Boomer being a stray, behavior towards children, large dogs and cats is unknown. Living with another small, quiet dog is a possibility.",

Coquito's previous people could not afford his medical care and he was on death's door when we rescued him. He was not expected to make it but we have completed months of rehab to get him to a seemingly healthy state. We have done a couple of thousand dollars of diagnostics and treatments. His liver is still enlarged but his liver values are NORMAL He has collapsed trachea but has not had any symptoms since the thyroid meds kicked in. He is on thyroid tabs, joint meds, two eye drops, and supplements. He is doing phenomenally well. We are putting him up for adoption to a qualified home. He is 11 years old, 5.5 pounds, he will potty on wet grass, something chihuahuas are not fond of! LOL!, He cuddles and asks for attention with his paws. Coquito is quiet and good with dogs under 15 pounds. He initiates play with the other dogs. COQUITO IS SPECIAL NEEDS AND WILL NEED DAILY MEDICATION, REGULAR VET VISITS TO MONITOR HIS THYROID! PLEASE ONLY APPLY IF YOU HAVE THE TIME AND FINANCES TO CONTINUE THE CARE WE HAVE PROVIDED. No Children. Check this link for his video playlist His adoption fee is $150 to go towards his vetting (vaccines, spay/neuter, heartworm/Ehrlichia/Lyme test, fecal test, pre-op blood work, dental cleaning, and microchip as well as grooming if needed).\n\nPlease read his daily needs and check pricing with your vet for the thyroid tests and x-rays so you know what to expect.\n\n \n\nHe is calm and cuddly once he trusts you but he will freak out and hold his breath when being held by some people in new environments. This stress causes him to lose oxygen and his tongue turns blue. If he is not relieved from his stress quickly he will need oxygen by a vet. When he is getting his tests ran we plan a couple of hours so he can rest in between tests and not be gasping to breathe. \n\n \n\nFOOD\n\nHe is on Dave's brand low protein and low phosphorus canned food with a teaspoon of Dave's brand joint formula just to get him to eat the low protein food. It is important he doesn't eat other treats except for some veg, because of the high protein is hard for his liver and pancreas to digest.\n\n \n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nHe gets 1/2 Galliprant once a day for arthritis which is a lifelong prescription for pain and inflammation. \n\nHe also needs Gabapentin for pain once daily.\n\nHe is on Thyro tabs 1.5 grams twice a day and needs a thyroid blood test every 6 months.\n\nHis ophthalmologist has him on two eye drops for the ulcers caused by the thyroid issue. Currently, both drops are only for one eye but eventually, it will be for both eyes.\n\nHe is on Sentinal brand monthly heartworm prevention for under 10 pounds. He has not had a reaction to this brand so he must only continue with it.\n\n \n\nSUPPLEMENTS\n\n*He gets pre & probiotics in his food once a day to help with his digestion and fiber in the opposite meal to keep his bowels working..He gets blocked up easily which makes him painful and triggers a nerve that affects his neck and right front leg. \n\n*He gets joint supplements once a day from Zesty paws brand. \n\n*He is not on flea and tick prevention because we don't have a problem and he is sensitive so we give him ECO Flea once a day. He loves it! \n\n*He also gets an immune supplement once a day. \n\n*He gets pulse antibiotic therapy with Clindymysin 4-5 days twice a day at the beginning of each month to keep the oral infection down since he is not able to go under anesthesia for a dental cleaning. due to his collapsed trachea. He currently doesn't have any symptoms of coughing from the trachea. Keeping the infection down is crucial to helping his other organs function better and less oral pain from inflammation. During those few days, he doesn't get the probiotics.\n\n *He gets liver supplements that helped get his liver values in a good range on his bloodwork. This is another precaution so he keeps up his health.\n\n \n\nGROOMING\n\nHe needs to be groomed at home in short periods of time because he stresses and again loses oxygen with the collapsed trachea. Once he trusts you, you will need to gently maneuver him to get him cleaned up. He can't have anything around his neck, because of the trachea. He needs his paws and privets groomed for cleanliness and a better grip on the floor. His chest also gets food on it sometimes so I groom his body to even out his lion's mane! LOL! There are YouTube videos to guide you.\n\n \n\nThis regime is only a fraction of what saved his life. Scientifically and physically she wasn't going to live the first few days we had him. He has been through a battery of tests, treatments, and meds to get him to adoptable status in 6 months.\n\n \n\nHe will need a dedicated caregiver to follow through with his needs and continue with proper vet care at an established vet, not a vaccine clinic.\n\n \n\nWe get a lot of people interested in Coquito's cuteness but they don't understand the commitment. We are no-kill, foster home only so all our dogs are free to run in foster homes sleeping in our beds and getting all their needs met. We are hopeful for Coquito and all our other special needs dogs will all get qualified homes, but if not they can be in our forever foster care program. He will always be safe and properly cared for. Please think this through, get information from your vet on the cost of tests and look online for the cost of meds plus supplements. He has a quality of life with this regimen. Please let me know if you truly feel you can fulfill his needs. \n\n \n\nNEW\n\nRecently he had a stroke at the ophthalmologist and went blind, had a hard time walking and eating. That lasted 3-4 days and he was back to normal. We ran his bloodwork and other tests that all came out fine. His heart is good. It must have been the stress at the ophthalmologist because they had to hold him for the exam. Next time he will get a sedative to prevent the stress.\n\nIf you are interested please fill out the adoption application For additional information regarding our adoption process, please check our FAQ's Page. \n\n *All dogs in the care of Get a Life Pet Rescue live in loving foster homes while waiting for their perfect match. They don't live in cages or crates (unless there is a medical reason to do so.) They are treated as family pets while in our care. * All dogs in our care are fed premium brand holistic food as well as supplements and vitamins specific to each dog's needs. We don't buy inexpensive bulk dry kibble, our rescues are fed premium wet food diets as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation program to ensure maximum health.*All of our rescues receive complete quality vetting including full dental cleaning with pre-op bloodwork, spay/neuter, vaccines, and grooming. Dogs in need of specialized medicine will be seen by specialists, such as full cardiac workups, ophthalmologist visits, all suspicious lumps, and bumps are biopsied, and every medical need is transparent to potential adopters. *Once you adopt from Get a Life Pet Rescue, you become part of our compassionate family and we are here for you if a problem with your precious dog arises.",

He was wandering for a week with a heavy chain around his neck and at one point was witnessed being clipped by a car before one of our BarkVille volunteers became aware of him and was involved with helping a team of good samaritans safely capture him.  They brought him back to their house and contacted animal control, but when they saw the extent of his injuries, they got him vetted, neutered and vaccinated.  They learned that Dallas is Heartworm positive, but thankfully, animal control allowed Dallas to stay in the family's home until his stray hold was up so that he didn't have to be in the shelter. Now that Dallas is available for adoption, BarkVille is looking for a foster home so that we can raise the necessary funds to treat his HW disease and find Dallas the loving, forever home he deserves!\n\nDallas is a super sweet boy and will be a wonderful family dog.  He loves tennis balls and all things \"TOY.\"  He is crate trained, gets along fine with the other dogs he has met and is currently working on his house training.  If you are not familiar with Heartworm disease, dogs get it from mosquitos and it is not contagious. It is highly treatable, but requires extended rest during treatment.\n\nFor more information about Dallas, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org. If you would like to adopt this sweet boy, please submit an application for him at https://www.barkvilledogrescue.org/applications",

Zoey started out a bit more timid than Peanut(who she was surrendered with), but has quickly opened up. She's not the typical lap dog, but does love to be near her human. She prefers to curl up in a dog bed or roam about the house. Zoey walks well on a leash and loves to take strolls down the street. When she gives soft little kisses, it will melt your heart. Her favorite afternoon activity is enjoying peanut butter lick pads. She is good with other dogs.\n\n\nTo set up a meet and greet or inquire about a dog, please first fill out an application at https://savinghoperescue.org/contact. It doesn't obligate you, but it is the first step. We don't get to all of the inquiries but respond to all applications. Thank you for choosing to rescue!",

His favorite game is chasing a toy at the end of a fishing pole which is great fun and burns a lot of energy. His specialty is being able to sleep in any position. Ziggy is smart dog who would love a home with an active owner who will take him on adventures and spend time keeping up his training and keeping him entertained. A fenced yard is a must and another playful dog would be the icing on the cake!\n\n \n\nTo meet Ziggy n the fluff visit our website for more details regarding our adoption criteria and complete the easy online no obligation adoption application at www.dsda.org/adopt. \n\n* Adoption Fees:\n\nPuppies (12 months and under) - $325 (includes tax)\n\nDogs (over 12 months) - $275 (includes tax) \n\nQualifications for Adoption: No dog is alike and each dog has different requirements based on breed, age, energy level and life experiences. DSDA is very careful to place our dogs in homes that we believe are the best fit for the dog based on our experience with each dog. All of our dogs live in foster homes which allows us the opportunity to learn about their individual needs. \n\n\n\tMust be 21 years or older with identification showing present address.\n\tMust have the knowledge and consent of all adults living in the household.\n\tVet checks are required. All resident animals must be spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations and on monthly heartworm and flea/tick preventative (if applicable).\n\tMust receive proof of pet deposit and lease allowing pets if renting.\n\tWillingness and capacity to spend the time and money necessary to provide training, medical treatment and responsible care for a pet.\n\tApplicant is home more than not.\n\tAny poisonous plants must be removed from the yard before the home visit.\n\tHome visit is required. For this reason, we adopt locally in the Dallas and immediate surrounding areas.",

            "description": "Lovey Dove. I am Lab / Pyrenees mix (best guess!). That makes me a big, fluffy love bug. Looking for sweet? I'm your girl. My life started out a little rough. But now, I'm living the good life in my foster home. I'm learning all kinds of things with my foster. I'm working on leash manners. I get along with other dogs. I'm learning to love toys and even play tug. If you're up for a good cuddle, I'm good with that too. In case you're wondering, yes. You've read all of that right. I am an all around good girl. I'm looking for a family to help me continue to learn how to dog. I'd love a fenced yard so I can run and play. My foster mom says I have select hearing which is not too uncommon for Great Pyrenees. \n\n \n\nTo adopt Dove visit our website for more details regarding our adoption criteria and complete the easy online no obligation adoption application at www.dsda.org/adopt. \n\n* Adoption Fees:\n\nPuppies (12 months and under) - $325 (includes tax)\n\nDogs (over 12 months) - $275 (includes tax) \n\nQualifications for Adoption: No dog is alike and each dog has different requirements based on breed, age, energy level and life experiences. DSDA is very careful to place our dogs in homes that we believe are the best fit for the dog based on our experience with each dog. All of our dogs live in foster homes which allows us the opportunity to learn about their individual needs. \n\n\n\tMust be 21 years or older with identification showing present address.\n\tMust have the knowledge and consent of all adults living in the household.\n\tVet checks are required. All resident animals must be spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations and on monthly heartworm and flea/tick preventative (if applicable).\n\tMust receive proof of pet deposit and lease allowing pets if renting.\n\tWillingness and capacity to spend the time and money necessary to provide training, medical treatment and responsible care for a pet.\n\tApplicant is home more than not.\n\tAny poisonous plants must be removed from the yard before the home visit.\n\tHome visit is required. For this reason, we adopt locally in the Dallas and immediate surrounding areas.",

I am timid and I take a little time to warm up to adults. But once I know you, Ill love you. I get along with tiny humans too. They are actually my favorite. I am an energetic puppy that would do well with an active home. I have mastered being calm in the house but I run around like crazy outside. I go in a kennel nicely but I actually graduated to just staying in the bathroom while my humans are working. I am so good in there. At night, I sleep on my dog bed on the floor in a bedroom. Just recently, I mastered going up and down stairs too. And Im great on a leash. Of course, I do have one bad trait. I like to take shoes and toys and pretend to chew on them. I get so much attention! But if no one notices me, I really will chew them up. Haha! At my appointment this past week I was almost 42 pounds. If you are looking for a sweet gentle dog to love, I am your girl.",

She loves toys, and she can usually be found next to a pile of her favorites. Shes good in a crate, and loves to play. \n\nWe believe she spent the first year of her life outdoors, so she is not house trained. She has been working on it at her fosters house, but her adopter should anticipate needing to continue to work on it. Buttercup also startles easily, so a fenced in yard is required. She is a shy girl that would do best in a home with another confident dog and we ask that whomever adopts her be committed to training and working with her on building her confidence.

The vet told her that he would have to have the leg removed due to the size and invasiveness of the tumor. She didn't want to do that so she elected to surrender him to a rescue. We got him to NY from Texas and were horrified by the size of the tumor and the amount of pain he was in. \nEven though he was in pain he was so sweet and loving. We got him into the surgeons office and they agreed that amputation was the only option for our little boy. They kept him and did the surgery that day. Malachai rocked his surgery and was standing up as soon as his anesthsia wore off!!!!! We also suspected that he had bladder stones and that was sonfirmed as well. The vet said that the bladder surgery would have to done at another time because of the dangers of extended time under anesthesia so they will be taken care of in about two weeks. \nYou don't meet many pups with the personality and demeanor of this little man. He is just the sweetest boy in the world. He is already on the move and it seemed he was relieved to have the leg gone that was causing him so much pain. It has been sent out for a biopsy and we know that the lines will be clear around the site of the tumor. He is destined to have a wonderful life. Please say a prayer for this handsome little tripod. \nMalachai has been through so much for a pup that is only 8 years old and around 10lbs. He truly deserves the best that life has to offer. Don't think of him as handicapped, because he doesn't think of himself that way. He is happy and loving and perfect in our eyes. \nMalachai is located in Freeport NY\nHis adoption fee is $600",

This kind person took the time to rescue me and then took me to a shelter where I could receive some much-needed help. Very shortly thereafter, I delivered eight beautiful puppies (2 females and 6 males). I'm a sweet, devoted mom who is now living comfortably in a foster home where I'm receiving regular meals so I can take care of my babies. My foster mom says I know some basic commands and I've learned how to go potty outside. More info to come as I settle in. If you are interested in giving me my furever home, please go to adoptagsd.org and submit an online application. My adoption fee is $300. If you are interested in one of my puppies, they will be available in mid-March. Please submit an online application so the FRGSR team can get it processed.\n\nAlthough we do our best to keep our adoptable animals page as current as possible,the animals you see may already be in an adoption process.",

He was probably not treated kindly by humans at some point in his life so he has reason to be leery. Once Canelo figures out a person is safe he bonds strongly and really loves you. Canelo does really well with other dogs and needs another playful dog in his home. Since Canelo is shy his home should not have young children, they would scare him. He does require a fenced yard so he can safely run and play.   \n\nCanelo is neutered, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm tested, and microchipped.  \n\nIf you are interested in meeting Canelo, please begin the adoption process by completing our adoption application that can be found on our website at www.furfunrescue.org.  If you have questions about Canelo, please contact Rox@furfunrescue.org or call 319-929-6657. \n\nIndoor homes only. \n\nAdopters within an hour of Cedar Rapids, IA only, please. \n\nAdoption donation $250.",

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT HIM PLEASE EMAIL HIS OWNER DIRECTLY AT rehomeval@gmail.com.  \nVal is a Cattle Dog/Heeler mix who needs to find a new home.  He is 6 years old, weighs 50-55 pounds, and he has a black/white/brindle coat \u2013 very unusual!  Val is neutered and up to date on his vaccines.  He is housebroken, walks OK on a leash and loves to ride in the car.  Val also knows several obedience commands.\nVal loves his family but he is a bit standoffish when he first meets someone new.  Once he gets to know someone, though, he is always excited to see them!  While he does well with adults, children make him nervous.  Val is not playful with other dogs and never takes the lead in trying to meet a new dog.  His favorite things to do are all with people \u2013 he loves to run, take walks, go on camping trips, \u201cpatrol\u201d the yard, wade in the nearby creeks and play tug-of-war.  Val will \u201calert bark\u201d when someone comes to the door or when a car drives up to the house.  Val gets along great with cats!\nThe ideal home for Val is a quiet, friendly one, shared with adults who are looking for a loyal, fun-loving dog to share their time at home and their adventures.  A fenced yard is important, regular walks or hikes would be fabulous, cats are welcome, and the best home for him has no other dogs and no children.  He likes a stable, predictable routine!  Val has so much personality and love to share with the right family.  He currently lives in Asheville, NC, and you can contact his owner at rehomeval@gmail.com. \n",

These cuties are from a litter of 8-9 week of Dalmation/English Bulldogs who came into rescue when their owners were no longer able to care for them. All 4 puppies are playful, cuddly, social doggies. They love to be outside playing with their toys and enjoy rolling around in the grass. These cuties can often be found wrestling with their sibling, taking a snooze, or sunbathing in the yard. They are all food motivated, and very smart. These puppies will need families dedicated to training them, providing adequate exercise, and lots of socialization. Knowledge and experience of the English Bulldog breed is important. All 4 puppies are crate trained and currently sleep in their crates at bedtime and when their foster mom leaves. Being so young, they are still working on potty training and will need help in this category in their forever homes. These cuties are happy, go lucky puppies who are eager to learn! If you think you can provide a fabulous home filled with love, exercise, and cuddles for one or more of these precious babies please fill out an adoption application on our website roversretreat.org\n\nPlease note: Adoption fee is $500 and they are being fostered in West Hills, CA.\n",

I am fun and playful, well socialized and love to play with my littermates.  I have recently discovered toys and boy are they fabulous! I am the shyest of the litter. I tend to hang back when all my littermates are running around playing. I am the most laid back of us. \nLike all puppies will need patience and consistency to master house training and manners (typically takes 3-6 months to master). Puppies are a lot of work but so rewarding! \nAdoption fee is $250 it includes spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations, rabies license, microchip, dewormer, heart worm preventative for the month, vet exam. Please go like our Facebook page at http://www.facebook.com/barkandroll . Follow us on instagram/twitter @barkandrollrc to see more pictures of me as well as other dogs in our rescue. You can access an adoption application on our website http://www.barkandrollrescuecompanions.com It usually take 1-2 days to complete the application process.",

She is a bit hand shy due to the severe matting she had when she was found. She prefers to touch carefully and not be handled roughly. Shelby is much more in tune, responsive and tolerant with a male owner. She knows commands such as sit, stay and shake/paw. She is great on a leash and enjoys sleeping on the couch by the heater. She is house broken and does not chew on things. She would do best in a quiet home. She is great with cats and other dogs. She should not be in a home with young children. Older 15+ kids would be fine. She is a healthy older dog that would like a nice warm bed to lay around on through her golden years. She is 11 and is fixed, vaccinated and microchipped. Her adoption fee is $100.",

            "description": "\"I'll be a big dog soon.\" Hey there, my name is Atlas. It won't be too long before I am living up to my name. I'm a Great Pyrenees and Anatolian mix, and you know what you get when you mix those two, right? You get a big dog, maybe weighing about 120 lbs. At the moment, I am 58 lbs, and was born around August 2020.\n\nI was an owner surrender when The Great Pyrenees Rescue Society rescued me. My family bought me for a livestock guardian, and they moved into the city and didn't need me anymore. But I have gotten over it and have decided I want to live with humans.\n\nMy safe place is in my crate. I'm working on my house training and walking nicely on a leash. I prefer to run with the big dogs, and I would be an excellent third dog in a multi-dog pack near my size. The bigger the pack, the better, as I love playing with tug toys with these guys. I love to chew on my toys, and sometimes I chew stuff I am not supposed to, sorry.\n\nI am a little shy, therefore, I would thrive in an active home with older considerate kids and a couple of big resident canine companions to show me the ropes. I am smart, affectionate, and need confident leaders in my family familiar with Pyr/Anatolian traits and behaviors. If you have room in your home and heart for a big dog to be, complete an Adoption Application today.\n\nPUPPIES ARE ONLY PLACED IN HOMES WITH YOUTHFUL, PLAYFUL RESIDENT DOGS.\n\nOur requirements for puppy adoption are simple and necessary.\n\n\tOur puppies are not livestock guardians, they are family pets that live inside the family home.\n\tPuppies must be placed in homes with a youthful, adult resident dog of similar size. This gives the puppy a mentor and a solid foundation for becoming part of the family.\n\tPuppies are only adopted to homes with someone at home at least part of the day. If no one is home for 6-8 hours at a time, please do not apply.\n\tPreference is always given to those with Great Pyrenees experience.\n\tApplicants must have secure, visible fencing and a socialization plan in place.\n\tThe fastest way to be considered for a puppy is to fill out an application. Adoption is not first come, first served. GPRS and its fosters work diligently to find the right fit for each and every unique dog and puppy.\n\tApplicant's personal pets must be current on vaccines & heartworm/flea prevention and be altered.\n\nAdoption Fee: $450 (Adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm test, rabies, distemper, parvo and health certificate for travel). Northwest adopters pay the cost of transport to independent transport service ($225). Adoption applications can be found on our website at https://www.greatpyreneesrescuesociety.org/\n\nADOPTION, FOSTERING, AND DONATIONS are just some of the ways you can help a rescued dog. We have worked hard to cultivate a large network of volunteers to save this majestic breed. While monetary donations are always much appreciated, you can also help by donating your time as a GPRS foster or volunteer!",

If you have a specific question that is not covered in the profile, please send us a message.\n\nStatler and Waldorf are a pair of senior boys who count on each other\u2019s companionship. They were surrendered together to a tiny community shelter which didn\u2019t have the resources to keep them together and take care of their medical needs so WSRH offered to take them in. They are super sweet, around 10 years old, and under 10 lbs each. Both boys need dentals, which we will take care of, but otherwise are healthy and ready to go.\n  \nStatler and Waldorf have been fully vaccinated, neutered, and microchipped. Their adoption donation is $300 which includes 6 months heartworm preventative meds, free microchip registrations, and safety harnesses for both.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Statler and Waldorf, please review the adoption process and fill out the application on our website: http://wsrh.com\n\nAll dogs are available until \u201cAdoption Pending\u201d is noted next to their names.

            "description": "Nala is a beautiful girl that was left at our vets office and has been there for over a year. She is such a sweet girl and didn't deserve to get dumped by her former people. \nNala is 9 years old but in excellent health. She has so many years of life and so much joy to give to a family of her very own. \nNala's only issue is that she absolutely must be an only pet!! We cannot stress this enough! She has a very high prey drive and does not do well with any animals. This means all animals. Cats, dogs, hamsters, gerbils, ferrets, birds, well you get the idea. \nThis precious sweet girl has been living in the managers office at the vet practice and on holidays is there all by herself. Can you imagine not having a home of your own for the holidays? While all the other pups are opening their presents and enjoying their stockings, while they are getting goodies from the leftovers of the holiday feasts she is alone in the office. \nPlease don't get us wrong, she is adored by the entire staff. She spends her days getting spoiled and pampered. But the nights are long and lonely and the holidays are the same. \nAll we wish is for her to have her very own feast and her very own presents. Somewhere she will be safe and loved for the rest of her days. \nNala is what's considered a Pocket Pittie. She is around 32lbs but is probably in need of a little diet because everyone spoils her with cookies. \nIf you are interested in giving this magnificent angel her perfect home please email us for an adoption application at ourbestfriendsrescue@gmail.com\nNala is located in Sayville NY\nShe is fully vetted and will have her teeth cleaned before she leaves to go home. \nShe is spayed, housebroken and microchipped",

From the moment you get home for the day Ollie is a love hound. He greets you at the door with the biggest smile in the world. He loves couch snuggles and a good head scratch. \n\nOllie is dog selective so we feel he'd be best as the only dog in the home. He does best with 2-3 walks a day and gets let out in the yard a couple times a day. He gets free reign while home alone but he is also crate trained. He does well meeting new people when they come to the house but likes to meet his new friends by jumping up into their laps, which we are working on teaching him to stop.\n\nOllie is 5 years old, 45 pounds, neutered, microchipped, and currently being fostered in Portland, OR. Please fill out an application on our website www.goodlif3bullyrescue.org/adoption-application-1 or email goodlif3adoptions@gmail.com if you are interested in learning more about Ollie.",

I am a 3 year old, 60 pound Pit mix boy. I may take a little time to warm up to new people, but once I know I can trust you I am a sweet and snuggly boy. I am looking for a dog savvy owner who can help provide me with the boundaries and training I need to be my most confident self. I LOVE going for rides in the car and promise to be a great copilot if you take me along on your adventures; I would even be a great companion for a truck driver! I do well with smaller dogs with proper introductions, but I would also do great as your one and only furry family member. I am looking for a home without cats or kids, as both make me a little too nervous. I am a smart boy who is already house trained and kennel trained, and I know some basic commands too (just be sure to have lots of treats for my training practice). If I sound like the\u00a0perfect boy for you, then fill out that adoption application; I'll be waiting patiently for our forever to start!\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

I'll follow you around everywhere and I love going on hiking adventures, swimming, supervising yard work or even just hanging out in the house and napping on the couch. (As long as I'm within one foot of my person.) \n\nI'm a really good girl and I've never chewed anything up or run away from home. I'm a big snuggler and will need a home that lets me on the furniture and maybe even in bed with them. I know how to use a treadmill! I get along with other dogs well enough, but mostly I only care about my humans. I go to doggy daycare and have some doggy siblings that I get along well with. Unfortunately, one of my doggy siblings is a herding dog that felt the need to keep biting me, so I finally nipped back and now I need to find a new home. I like boy dogs more than girl dogs. \n\nI don't know how well I'd get along with kids, since I've never really spent much time around them. I'm not a good fit for small animals, like bunnies, since I am a hunting dog and have been known to hunt them. My prey drive isn't strong enough to take me out to a field to flush pheasants though. \n\nBasically, I need a family that is going to spoil me to bits and never wants to go into a room alone again!",

            "description": "The Cable Guy never looked so goodso Jim Careymove on over and welcome the guy would want to come and fix anything in your houseand stay furever! Cable is an adorable tan and white hound come lab mix who is a friend to everything from the dogs to the fences, he doesn't really care he just seems so happy to have landed at SG and living the life of a cared for dog. Cable is about a year or so old and about 50 lbs, a little on the lean side and happy for some extra snacks to fatten up a bit and settle in to a regular routine of care and attention. There is no convincing him he isn't a lap dog and he loves to cuddle as well as give and receive affection. Cable can be a bit shy at first, but more in the teasing and playful kind of way and would fit in easily and begin to show his silly and fun side quickly once he knows he is home. He would do well in a home with another dog to help show the way and would love a fenced-in yard, though it certainly is not a requirement. He is a fast learner who rides great in the car, was quick to figure out how a doggy door works and walks pretty well on leash. Cable is sure to bring laughs galore and be a comedy in and of himself. Turn on that computer and put that app in ASAP!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

She was friendly to all the dogs upon arrival and\ndid not show any shyness or timidity when meeting them. However,\nshe was quite nervous to meet us volunteers after her abandonment\nand mistreatment from humans before. After a short amount of time,\nshe warmed up and started giving all the hugs and kisses. \nMimi is just as happy to play as she is to snuggle up and nap. She has been\nthrough a lot and has remained so tender and sweet through it all.\nOn walks and at home she has not shown aggression, just a little\ntimidity. \nWhen hearing dogs bark or large traffic, Mimi will stop and\nneed some positive reassurance to continue. She is used to walking\nwith other dogs and is especially fond of the medium to large size\nmale dogs for play mates. \nMimi is an absolute delight to have around, very easy going, potty-trained and quite calm. When given the proper love and care Mimi will surely bring so much happiness and joy to you everyday. Mimi is so beautiful and loving and\ndeserves the absolute best in life.\n\nMimi can be on our next flight into Seattle once an adoptive home is found.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Mimi, please reply with some info about yourself/ your home",

Also in typical pug fashion, she loves food and treats. She has decent leash manners and is also a champion at outside potties, even in the rain!! She crates well but I think would also do well left out. She has shown no interest in toys yet. She does give the occasional comical exposed underbite grin. She is such an easy girl to live with, and pleasant to all who meet her, once she warms up to them. Anna will need someone who can love her to confidence, and continue this pampered life she should always have known.\n\nAnna is heartworm negative, and we're treating some minor intestinal and skin issues. She will be home ready after spay, toward the end of 2/2021. Meantime follow her updates on Facebook and Instagram.\n",

I am fun and playful, well socialized and love to play with my littermates.  I have recently discovered toys and boy are they fabulous! \nLike all puppies will need patience and consistency to master house training and manners (typically takes 3-6 months to master). Puppies are a lot of work but so rewarding! \nAdoption fee is $250 it includes spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations, rabies license, microchip, dewormer, heart worm preventative for the month, vet exam. Please go like our Facebook page at http://www.facebook.com/barkandroll . Follow us on instagram/twitter @barkandrollrc to see more pictures of me as well as other dogs in our rescue. You can access an adoption application on our website http://www.barkandrollrescuecompanions.com It usually take 1-2 days to complete the application process.",

Chico is an adorable, low-riding 4-year-old pug mix looking for his very own happily ever after. We were told he\u2019s a Chug, but there might be a little bit of Puggle or something else mixed in there. His front paws have the most adorable \u201cturned out\u201d stance, so maybe he\u2019s training to be a dancer?\n\nSo far, Chico is getting along well with his foster siblings as well as the kids and people in his foster home. He\u2019s a little shy and reserved, so we\u2019re looking forward to seeing him come out of his shell once he gets a little more comfortable. He has been doing excellent with his house manners but does like to climb. Chico sleeps well in his crate overnight and has been a pretty chill and calm houseguest so far. We know he needs to gain some weight and go for his neuter, but we\u2019ll know more about any other medical needs once he sees our vet for his intake exam. If you\u2019re looking for a sweet and chill companion, with adorably large ears, Chico may be your perfect match!\n",

She loves to give kisses.\n\nWe are guessing at the breed mix. We have DNA which should be available by February 01, 2021. The available date is 2/8/2021.\n\nAll dogs and puppies are fully wormed, receive rabies and core vaccinations, microchipped, behavior assessed with other dogs and humans (sorry, no cat testing is done here), spend a minimum of 3 weeks free-ranging within a pack of 30 dogs to grow confidence and trust and may have DNA results. All dogs receive lifetime behavior support and can be returned anytime without a fee.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You MUST complete an adoption application in order to see or adopt a dog from us. The completed adoption application ensures your 'spot' in order of adoption. Emailing/calling with questions will delay your adoption process.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION --> www.petsreturnhome.org/adoption-application",

            "description": "Hellllo friends, it's me - Charlie Chaplin! I'm approximately 12 years old but don't let my age fool you, I am VERY active and strong. I weigh about 80 pounds and I am ready to sniff-sniff-sniff and follow my nose on all kinds of adventures, WITH YOU! I thoroughly enjoy going for long walks. Want a hiking buddy? I'm in, I'm no couch potato! In fact, I do very well in doggie daycare and would thrive in an active home with or without other dogs. Sorry, no cats, they are just too much fun for this ol' hound boy to chase.\n\nI really LOVE being around people most of all and will lovingly follow you around. I love food, second-best to people! OK, maybe it's a tie! I am not food aggressive at all, but when I smell food - any kind of food - I get very excited and will do anything I can to get to the source of that wonderful smell! My foster mom crates me when she's cooking, for some reason she doesn't want my help! She also crates me when she's not at home, this stops me from helping myself to pantry - darn!\n\nSee, I am originally from Kentucky and was found as a stray. My foster mom surmises that I never lived in a home before and that I was an \"outside dog\" so all of the luxuries of a home environment were new to me when I arrived. I have been in my foster home since August though so I have learned so much! Yup, I'm ready for a forever family to take me the rest of the way! So whattya say?\n\nAre you ready for some forever fun, with me?! Great! Please fill out an application today at www.northstarpets.org and ask for CHARLIE CHAPLIN!\n\nNOTE: Charlie is NOT with 11th Hour Rescue but we are helping to network him for an adopter or even a foster home.",

            "description": "Ollie is an active 1-year-old, so he needs to have a fenced yard. Ollie very much loves playing and running around in a fenced yard. He really likes stuffed toys. When you hold him, he snuggles in and wants to be as close to you as he can.\nOllie was a stray prior to his rescue, so he's still learning to walk on a leash and needs work on coming when called in from the yard. Right now, he thinks it's a fun game that inspires you to play and chase him. Ollie also likes playing with other dogs.\nOllie may be compatible with cats. He did not react when introduced to a cat. He would need further testing to see if he'd chase a running cat.\nIf you have kids in the home, they should be 8 or older. Ollie is still a little mouthy, but we're working on that. With a little patience and training, Ollie will be well on his way to great little life-long companion.\nAge: 1 year\nWeight: 21 lbs\nVetting: Neutered, up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative\nTemperament: Good with dogs and possibly cats; ok with older kids (8+).\nTraining: Housetrained, crate trained, knows commands\nEmail for questions: tammys3greys@gmail.com Adoption fee: $300 To ensure we're meeting both pet and adopters' needs, we ask potential adopters to complete an Adoption Application ( www.bit.ly/DH-Adoption ) for caretakers to review. Once approved, we will bring the adoptable pet to your home for a preliminary visit. We are 100% donation funded; unless otherwise noted above, please expect a minimal adoption fee of $250 to cover each pet's basic vetting.",

Once she does warm up, she is playful, bouncy and the snuggliest young lady. She is currently working on her housetraining and how to be loved and part of a family. She rides well in the car and loves her neighborhood walks. Celi is also great at squirrel patrol. She does well in a crate when needed and sleeps like a rock in her foster mom's bed all night. She gets along great with the resident lab and would thrive in a home with another dog. If a smaller family member is what you might like, and you have patience and love to give little Celi, she will surely warm your heart.",

Jack doesn\u2019t care about cats. Russell is a bit too curious about them. The boys are very sweet and love to be cuddled. Because they are small their new family should not have children under 10 years of age. They require a physically fenced yard.  \n\nJack & Russell are house trained, neutered, up to date on vaccinations, and heartworm tested.   \n\nIf you would like to meet Jack and Russell, please complete the adoption application on our website: www.furfunrescue.org. If you have questions about Jack and Russell you can contact rox@furfunrescue.org or call 319-929-6657. \n\nIndoor homes only.\n\nAdopters within two hours of Cedar Rapids, IA only, please.\n\nThe adoption fee for this pair is $400.",

I\u2019m looking for my own family to love, kiss and play with. My foster mom says that I\u2019m very smart, learn new commands in an instant and am a pleaser. I seem to be house trained and knows basic commands. I do love food and tend to jump on the the countertop to get it.\n \nFoster mom and the vet say I was born with \u201cbad conformation\u201d or structure. I get around and play, but I\u2019m sometimes wobbly and hesitant on stairs. The vet says that it\u2019s definitely likely that one day I will need surgery for one or more of my joints, but that I\u2019m not there yet. So my future family will need to be okay with that, and prepared to get me any treatment that I may need, if I end up needing it.\n \nAre you my forever family? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your interest in one of our furry kids! Adopting from Releash Atlanta means you will adopt a dog that has been fully vaccinated, spayed/neutered and microchipped! Our adoption fee is $350\n\n**We only adopt to families in/around Atlanta, Ga (about a 1-2 hour perimeter)**\n\nWe do not monitor our Petfinder email address so if you are interested in any of our dogs, please visit releashatlanta.com to either view more of their profile or to apply! If you have questions, please email adopt@releashatlanta.com \n\nTake a moment and like our Facebook Page for updates on our dogs and the first look at dogs coming into the program! www.facebook.com/releashatlanta\n\nThank you!!",

            "description": "*INQUIRIES SENT THROUGH PETFINDER WILL NOT BE ANSWERED. PLEASE COMPLETE OUR ADOPTION APPLICATION INSTEAD*\n\nSully-IL is in a foster home in Kirkland, IL. Please read ALL the information in his listing before applying. If you would like to be considered as a potential adopter for him, please complete our adoption application at http://www.idogrescue.com/adoption_application. We will review your application & let you know if you made our short list of applicants. We base our adoption decisions on what\u2019s in the best interest of our dogs. Please note our adoption policies are in place for the safety & welfare of our dogs.\n\nWe are all volunteers & have jobs, families, pets of our own to care for. We believe in taking time to go through our thorough process to try to match the dog with the best fit for that dog. Our adoption process may take 2-4 weeks. You must be approved to adopt before we will schedule a meet & greet. We expect approved adopters to visit him in his foster home within a short period of time of being approved to adopt him. Our adoption process involves vet & personal reference checks, phone interviews, a home visit, an adoption contract & an adoption fee.\n\n*We expect to have a lot of interest in Sully. Please do NOT apply unless you meet the requirements listed below. We also will not transport him.\n- Experienced & active family who is willing to take him through formal training to ensure he becomes the best dog\n-Kids 12+ who are used to large bratty puppies\n- Where he gets to exercise his brain through daily physical & mental exercise to burn his puppy energy \n- Fenced yard\n- With a younger, tolerant dog or as an only dog\n- Where he isn\u2019t crated for long periods of time & can he get exercise, attention\n \nAGE: 17 weeks \nWEIGHT: 27 lbs. & still growing - will be a large adult likely around 70 lbs.\nFENCE REQUIREMENT: A physical secure privacy fence is required. No electronic fence or e-collar will be allowed as we feel this would not set him up for success.\nCOAT TYPE: Sully has a soft, wavy coat that is currently lower-shedding. We don\u2019t know whether his adult coat will shed so his new family should be prepared for shedding. His new family should be prepared to brush his coat regularly & have him groomed every 6-8 weeks or so. This is approximately $100 per groom.\nENERGY LEVEL: Sully is a very active puppy! He likes to run around & play with his foster siblings. \nDOGS: Sully loves other dogs. He is a very active, energetic puppy; if his new home has a dog it will need to be an active, tolerant dog. He doesn\u2019t always know when to stop & leave the other dogs alone. If he has another dog in his new home it should be a dog that will be tolerant of his puppy play, but also be able to let him know when it\u2019s time to stop.\nCATS: unknown; no exposure to cats\nKIDS: 12+ years old. Sully is a very energetic puppy, & he does not always know how to play with kids. In his prior home he would bite at the kid\u2019s shirts & try to get them to play. \nCAR: Sully does OK in the car. He can get excited & bark, but once he settles down, he will sit & look out the window.\nCRATE: OK in his crate. He knows that he needs to be in there when the humans leave, & as long as he is getting a treat he will go in. If there is no treat offered he will not be as excited to go in there. He would not do well being crated for large periods of time.\nHOUSE TRAINED: Sully is mostly house trained. He will still have the occasional accident.\nLEASH: Sully walks well on a leash with a harness. Without a harness (just a collar) he does pull more & doesn\u2019t stop if there is something he wants to see, so we recommend a harness for him on all walks.\n \nSully is an F1 4 month old English Goldendoodle puppy who was surrendered to IDOG by his family. They consulted with a behaviorist trainer who felt he needs an experienced owner who can handle his dominant temperament & a family who is willing to put the time in to ensure he gets the appropriate amount of exercise & training in order to be a respectful dog. \n\nHere is what his foster family has to say about him:\nSully is very smart & learns very quickly; he can also learn bad habits very quickly as well. He remembers when he is allowed to \u201cget away\u201d with something & it can become a bad habit VERY quickly. He needs a home that will be consistent & firm with him. He has a very confident personality which can be great. But it can also lead to him thinking he is the boss of things if he does not have an owner that is consistent with him. \n \nSully loves to play! He loves to tug and fetch & will bring a toy back right back to you. He does not always drop it right away. When he finally tires out, he will go lay down & rest. If you are near him, he will sometimes curl up in your lap for a quick nap. You should be OK with a large dog being a lap dog as we do think he\u2019s going to be a big adult. \n\nHe likes to play with his foster dog siblings, but does not always know when to stop, & he does not always get the hint. We have to distract him & play with him to get him to leave the other dogs alone. We think he will do fine in a home as an only dog as long as he has humans that will play with him & exercise his body & mind. If there is another dog in the home, it needs to be a younger, patient dog that will put up with his puppy shenanigans, but also not let Sully bully them.  \n  \nSully is doing well with his potty training. As long as we are diligent about taking him outside, he does not have accidents. When we forget to take him out regularly he has accidents. He is still such a young pup that it is our fault when he has an accident because he is still learning. He will ring the bells to go out when he is calm & relaxed, but when he is excited & playing, he just forgets. He will need a home that will be patient with him as he learns. We do expect that he will probably have a setback when he goes to his new home, so his new owners should expect accidents, & be willing to work with him on his potty training. \n \nSully is a normal energetic puppy! He can be strong-willed, so he needs an owner that will work with him. When he first came to us, he had a hard time being told \u201cno\u201d or not being allowed to do something he wanted to do. He would growl & snarl to try to get his way. He didn\u2019t bite, but he sounded big & tough. He learned that if he acted tough & mean he would get away with things. He was basically a brat when first he came to us. He has learned that he is not the boss now & that he needs to listen.  This can very easily go back the other way \u2013 so he will need an experienced, patient dog owner that will continue to work with him. \n \nSully needs help with his manners. He will put his front paws on the counter, or kitchen table if he thinks there is something up there for him. When he is told to get off, he doesn\u2019t always get down right away \u2013 he will push his limits & make sure you are really serious about it first. He is always testing the waters. He will need to be taken to formal training & worked with until he learns the rules.  \n\nHe will needs to be crated when no one is home.  He does well in the crate as long as he is getting rewarded for going in. When we come home, he will bark & jump around in excitement to get out of the crate. Since we do not want him to think he gets to come out by acting like that, we will usually ignore him until he calms down, or ask him to sit. Once he sits & is calm, we will let him out of the crate. \n\nSully has been allowed to sleep out of the crate at night in the room with his foster parents. He will lay down on the dog bed & curl up for the night. If he hears a noise, he will bark to let you know that something is concerning to him. Once he knows it\u2019s ok, he will go back to bed. His new family should understand that he is still a small puppy & there are things he has not experienced yet. He still has a lot to learn, but we think with proper training & socialization, he is going to be an amazing companion as he gets matures \n\nSully is a typical excitable puppy; he is up for whatever you have planned!! He does jump (we expect this at his young age) As long as his new owners will be willing to work with him, we think he will be easily trained. \n\nSully has learned how to be more affectionate since he has been with us. When he first came to us, he did not like to be picked up, or kissed. He would growl & snarl. Now that he has learned some boundaries & that affection is good, he does great! He does not mind if we pick him up & when we kiss our other dogs on the head, he will come over & stick his head in to get his head kisses too! He needs a home that will continue the training that has been started. As long as the training is continued, he will continue on his way to being an amazing dog! \n\nSully is very food motivated, which helps with training - he has never shown any food aggression at all, but he does like to eat! He will sit & wait until his foster siblings are finished eating. As soon as they walk away from their bowls, he will run over to check & see if there is any food left - he always acts like he is starving, but he is just a growing puppy. He is vaccinated, microchipped, crate trained & mostly house trained. He is heartworm negative & is current on heartworm, flea/tick preventives. He is not neutered yet & we will require his new owners get him neutered by the age of 9 months.\n \t\nIDOG will hold a $100 refundable training deposit to encourage his family to go through training to help him be successful in his new home. Since 2006, we have found that when an adopted dog goes through training with its new family it strengthens their bond & gives the adopted dog more confidence & security. The training deposit will be refunded upon proof of training.\n \nADOPTION FEE: $600 + $100 refundable training deposit to be refunded upon proof of training classes + $200 neuter deposit to by 9 months of age",
