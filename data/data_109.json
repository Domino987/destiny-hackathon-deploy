Or even Sloany Bologna to his friends. \n\nSloan is doing great at the rescue ranch. He loves going for walks with the volunteers and loves going into the yards to play. He loves playing tug-of-war and just running around playing chase. He likes to cuddle with his humans and often rubs up against you while he's out playing, just to give/get some love. He has come such a long way from when we got him, he is ready for a home of his own. \nHe hasn't spent a lot of time around other dogs. He tends to be dog selective and would need proper introductions when meeting. \n\nHis back story: \nWe took Sloan directly to our vet and came to find out that his wounds were not the result of an animal attack or fight but at the hands of humans. The swelling/wound on the side of his head showed signs of blunt force. Meaning he was hit in the head very hard.\nThe wounds on the back of his neck were more apparent to be gashes like those of a stab wound/punctures from an object, very deep and through one side to the other (the force was so hard that even after healing he will forever have a large knot on his neck where he was attacked).\nThe chest area has small wounds healing over, possibly from running for a long period through fields or harsh terrain.\n\n",

Cabo is a 1.5-year-old male Pomeranian/Chihuahua mix that was rescued from SBC after being deemed fearful (we rescued 4 in total as they all came in together). Cabo weighs about 13 pounds and is a little on the shy side when you first meet him. He does warms up to his people but you have to give him a minute and then he is all love. He gets along well with other small dogs, however, large breed dogs may be a little overwhleming for him. We do require another dog in the home or a cat, as he does so well in a home with them. We do recommend a home with children over the age of 12. Cabo has been neutered, is up to date on his vaccinations and has been microchipped.

She\u2019s been all over.....Hillsborough adopted and returned then back to Hernando adopted and returned. It was determined a few months back that Mindy is deaf. When her time was up.....one of our directors went to say goodbye and he just couldn\u2019t leave her behind even though he himself was going in for surgery the next day. Mindy was always well behaved at the shelter and would not be here with us today if not for our selfless director and him believing in her enough to not leave her behind. Mindy is adjusting well in her foster home. Mindy would do best in a home without other animals as she has so much love to give you wouldn't need another! \n\nHer adoption fee is $200\n\nAll of our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, and current on flea and heartworm prevention.\n\nIf interested in adopting Mindy please visit our website www.fureverfriendz.org to fill out an application.",

Petula does pretty well on a leash and is good with baths.  Her foster brothers have taught her the art of chasing squirrels and she loves running with them and playing tug o' war.  She enjoys watching TV, especially football!  She has not yet been kitty or kid tested, but that can be arranged, if necessary.  Petula must be in a home with other medium/large dogs.",

Though shy, she gets wiggly and bouncy when her friends (both human and dog friends) come to greet her! She absolutely loves food, and though initially stand-offish, she quickly recognizes who her friends are by their gentle nature and the delicious treats they provide! She is crate trained and she loves going in it especially if it means she gets to go out and explore with her friends. \nShe is generally uncomfortable in unfamiliar or open spaces, but using the crate we have begun to expand her world to the trails of Dogtown and beyond, and the more experiences she has the more confident and excited she becomes to show how brave and adventurous she truly is! \nThe next step in her growth could be with you where she can experience the calm, comforting, and loving home you are ready to share with her.",

Cali rides nicely in the car and he's crate trained, too. He learns fast and loves training; he knows \"sit and \"down\" and is an absolute star at agility training. Other favorites include solving food puzzles and frozen Kongs as well as snuggling up on his bed with a collection of toys. Caliente absolutely loves toys and playing fetch! He also really enjoys the company of other little dogs and enjoys playing and going on walks with his friends. He does need an adult only home. He needs a while to warm up to a new human friends, especially men, but once he does he can be very friendly and cuddly. He would do best with an experienced adopter who will be patient with him and give him time to feel safe and comfortable.",

            "description": "Location: New Orleans, Louisiana \n\nAnnie was  in a local shelter in Louisiana with her litter of puppies. Cane Haven Rescue pulled them from the shelter to give them another chance at life. Annie is approximately 2-3 years old, up to date on vaccinations, spayed & microchipped. \n\nShe would do best in a home with older children or children who can understand boundaries. Annie is best in a only animal home. While she was still living at the shelter, she was an extremely good mother to the puppies. But when the puppies became old enough to leave momma, she was ready too. \n\nAnnie is house trained, kennel trained & knows her basic commands/manners. She is a strong girl but loves attention, sunbathing, and nurturing her babies. \n\nInterested adopters can fill out an application at canehavenrescue.com. \nAny possible questions about Annie, please email canehavenrescue@gmail.com \n\nCane Haven Rescue will transport any of their adoptable dogs to the right home. We do require adoption fees that are based on the age & health status of the adoptable dog. The adoption fee covers every single dog in CHR with vaccinations, heartworm test, deworming, microchip, spay/neuter & medications. All CHR adoptable dogs are current on their monthly  heartworm and flea medication. A CHR representative will do a home check to ensure the pets are placed in a secure and loving home. \n\nwww.canehavenrescue.com",

After spending some time at the local shelter and a few months adopted into a home that wasn't a good fit for him, he went into a foster home with Prairie Paws Rescue.  Since he's fostered by one of Journey Home Animal Rescue's founders, he's now available through Journey Home. He loves walks and needs daily exercise.  He loves his people but can be unsure of new people. So a dog savvy owner is a must. He lives with 2 dog savvy cats but would prefer all the attention. He is house trained and kennels up easily.  Marlo would do best in a quiet home without a lot of people coming and going. He is 7-8 years old and weighs about 50lbs. Marlo would appreciate a nice quiet home with a fenced yard where he can be the only pet.\n\nIf interested in adopting this pet, fill out an adoption application on our website. https://www.journeyhomeanimalrescue.org/adopt",

            "description": "Buddy is a handsome 3-year-old, 75-pound German Shepherd! He\u2019s a fairly laid back guy who loves relaxing at home with his family, playing in the backyard and going for car rides. He enjoys having other large dog friends and does a great job picking up on their energy level and adjusting his own to match. He\u2019s fostered with large dogs and cats and has done well with everyone. Buddy has gone through a 2-week board and train program and is consistent with multiple commands in numerous environments, however, he has shown anxiety toward visitors in his home in the past. For that reason, Buddy needs a confident handler who has large breed experience and will take the time to build a relationship with him and provide clear boundaries so he knows what\u2019s expected of him. He will require a home without children where he will be given several weeks to acclimate before being introduced to new people in and out of the home. Buddy is both crate and potty trained. He\u2019s comfortable in his crate and will need a family who knows when to let him relax in his crate, rather than face visitors or heightened activity in his home. Four private lessons will be provided as part of his adoption fee to help his adopters continue educating and training Buddy and encourage a smooth transition into their family. If you\u2019d like to learn more about Buddy or make him a part of your family, apply today! Buddy's adoption fee is $250.\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

The fee itself is not negotiable, our vets don't negotiate and thus neither do we).\n\nWE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY ALL OUR DOGS ARE LOCATED IN FOSTER HOMES. This means there is no place for you to go in person to view our dogs. We ask that an application be filled out and we will go from there!\n\nTo Contact Us\n\nMessage us through our website http://www.highplainspaw.org\n\nMessage the Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/HighPlainsPAW\n\nFill out our Adoption Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/adoption-application\n\nFill out our Foster Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/foster-application\n\nEmail us at highplainspaw@gmail.com\n\nCall our voicemail at (402)957-1578",

I came all the way from Texas I have since finished my heart worm treatment. I would love a family of my own. I love to play with my toys and lounge on my chair. I know some tricks and would love to learn more. I walk pretty well on my leash. I love my treats and cuddles. I enjoy walks especially on a fifty foot lead. My downfall is that I do not do well with cats. But other than that I am a pretty amazing boy.",

He does not like redheads and cannot go to a home with other dogs. He has a dominant personality and picks his people. He is loyal to the people he likes and requires a person that will be firm in his handling and training. Myles does well on a harness and rides well in the car. He likes to run and explore and needs a family that will expose him to the outside world and provide lots of exercise. He cannot go to a home with cats or children younger than high school age. \n\nMyles has been with the rescue looking for his forever home for several years now. He is ready to find the special someone that is able to handle a very large and in charge personality. Myles is in his senior years, but has lots of life left to live. He would make a great dog for someone that is understanding and patient.\n\nDue to his personality and issues with other dogs, we require a full family meet and greet and a two week adoption trial in any home he joins. If you are interested in Fostering or Adopting Myles, please contact CVRS at info@colbertvetrescue.org.\n\n",

IF IT IS LISTED WITHOUT THE WORD \"PENDING\" IT MEANS IT IS AVAILABLE.\n\nPLEASE COPY AND PASTE THIS LINK TO OUR APPLICATION:\nhttps://form.jotform.com/90914074231148\n\nAylin is a 3 year old female hound/doberman mix.  She has warm heart and wants to be with her people most of the time She is gentle with people and other dogs, but becomes a playtime maniac with her sisters. She LOVES to play and has such a happy spirit! Aylin knows what she wants and lets you know it! She is the most vocal of the group and she tries to communicate with her people with a variety of \u201cwhistle-whines.\u201d When the water dish is empty, she will bring it to you! She takes treats gently from a hand and never snaps. She likes fresh veggies, especially carrots. And this tall girl is not opposed to helping herself to snacks from the counter or table! Aylin can be shy meeting new people, but warms up quickly. She has not lived with children and has been fine with them with supervision at the dog park, but she really prefers adults and other dogs. She loves to climb into a recliner with her foster parents and take a long snuggly nap and she prefers to be able to lay her head on your shoulder, so be prepared for an occasional lick on your cheek! Aylin has been a complete sweetheart! She will melt your heart when she gazes closely into your eyes. She can run like the wind and would do well with an active family that likes to go for an adventure walk or run.\n\nIf you think Aylin would make the perfect addition to your family, please visit aaharescue.com to learn more about the adoption process and fill out an application.",

My vet thinks I am an American Staffordshire Terrier Mix.  I was found abandoned in a neighborhood  and a good Samaritan took me home.  I am now in a great foster home.  I have already had a couple of litters of puppies but the great people at the rescue fixed that.  No more kids for me.  Yay!  I was so over that!  \n\nI am super cute and my foster mom says I ought to be in pictures. Whatever that means!  I need to be your one and only. I am very picky who my furry friends are.    My foster mom says I am a total wiggle butt and I am all about my toys.  I have a stuffed gingerbread man and I carry him everywhere.  They call him my lovey.  I think there is even a picture of me with him in the photo array.  I am house trained and even go sit by the door in order to let you know I need to go out.  I am also crate trained.  I am leash trained but do not require a crazy amount of exercise.  I also know sit, down and shake.  I am a pretty smart girl.  I do not chew on anything but my own toys and if you will let me I will lick you to death.  Giving kisses to my people are my thing.  I also love kids!  I am a great companion, loving and extremely loyal.  Just so you know, I have not been cat tested so my people are going to say no to a home with furry felines.  If you think I am a good fit for your family please let my people know. \n\nI am spayed, up to date on my vaccinations and microchipped. \n",

Izzy has Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI). This means her pancreas does not produce the enzymes needed to properly digest her food. As a result, Izzy requires a special diet. Enzymes and vitamin supplements added to Izzy's food allow her to properly digest her food and gain the important nutrients she needs to be happy and healthy. EPI is thought to be found most often in German Shepherds, but is not restricted to the breed. She must have a family that understands the special needs of EPI and is able to handle a strict diet. \n\nIzzy came to the rescue as a young puppy and was adopted to a family that eventually sent her to a pound in the Carolinas. She was returned to us with signs of EPI. We began tests and a strict diet, which brought her back to a healthy weight. She is a very smart girl and cannot be left alone outside without a leash or supervised fenced in yard time. She does not do well with cats and cannot go to a home with cats. She is very dog selective and would be best in a one dog family. She is reactive during storms and will react to every storm no matter the size. We do not think she should go to a home with children. She needs an active family that is able to give her purpose and exposure. \n\nIzzy is currently working with her Advocate Sharon and loves to go for long walks in the nature parks. She does well in the car, but can slip out of most harnesses. She will require a martingale collar or no slip harness when walked with her future family. She needs a firm person to train her and work with her personality. She can escape most enclosures and will need to be in a home that is prepared to work with her on this. This girl deserves a chance and requires a very special person to love and cherish her.\n\nDue to Izzy's EPI and determined personality, we require a full family meet and greet and a two week adoption trial in any home she joins. If you are interested in Fostering or Adopting Izzy, please contact CVRS at info@colbertvetrescue.org.",

            "description": "Boaz isnt exactly a new addition to the CHS family. Having been adopted out for the first time in 2017 and recently returned to us, we are now looking for a new forever home for him. Boaz is kind of a complicated kid; he lacks trust in new people when he initially meets them. He is going to be a very loyal companion and an exceptionally good protector. We would not be willing to put him in a home with cats or with kids that are under 16 years of age. This guy is going to need a home where he could stretch his legs and get the daily exercise that he needs. He is very big and very goofy and sometimes has no idea that he is as large as he is. Being a Canaan Mixed breed we would ask that prior to meeting him you please do your research on the breed so that you can understand fully what you are getting into. These guys are known to be protectors of their people, and they will be very vocal, for that reason they are not great at living in the city, there tends to be to much going on and they become overly protective of their property. Boaz also is going to do best in an only dog home. He has a tendency to want to guard objects and stuff from other dogs. He loves a mean game of chase, but we are fairly confident that having another dog in his home would be against what he would actually like to have. He deserves a life of being the most important animal in the home. If you are meeting this kid we ask that you please email animalwelfare@columbiahumane.org and we would be very happy to send you an adoption application. His adoption fee is $250.00 that includes his neuter, microchip, and all of his vaccinations through adoption.For more information call 503-397-4353 or email animalwelfare@columbiahumbia.org",

He loves women and get along with most men but has some triggers with certain men , mainly when crated or kenneled. So that would imply Kenny has \"barrier reactivity\" .  Kenny is not suited for a home with small children, possibly teenagers . Kenny is crate trained, house broken, walks calmly on a leash, knows some basic commands. \n\nOur adoption process includes filling out an application as the first step, second step would be a meet &greet to see if the dog and people are a good fit, if all goes well a home check must be completed. If all seems to be a good fit for both the adoptable dog and home, then the dog will be either delivered or picked up , at that time his or her adoption fee will be collected. \n\n",

Cyrus is a perfect example of these efforts.\n\nFirst, he was rescued from poor living conditions with a group of other dogs. The first stop was the veterinarian's, where he was examined, neutered and underwent heartworm treatment.\n\nSecond came the rehabilitation. Since Cyrus has basically only known kennel life and was poorly socialized, it is taking some time for him to get comfortable with the things most pet dogs take for granted, like the normal sights and sounds of people cooking, cleaning, talking and laughing. He has learned how to use the doggie door and to go into his kennel for meals and treats.\n\nNow it is time for the rehoming portion of Cyrus' journey. This young man needs a patient Forever Family willing to help him relax and settle in. Because he is still timid, he would do best in an adult home with a fenced yard to explore. He is getting along well with his foster siblings so would probably enjoy the company of another friendly dog.",

My name is Coco Jellybean and I am as sweet as my name implies! I\u2019m 8 years old and in excellent health. The cherry on top? I\u2019m also 100% house-trained. When I\u2019m in the house, I\u2019m very mellow and you can usually find me curled up on the couch \u2013 just waiting for you to sit down and snuggle with me. When I\u2019m outside, I love to run and play, fetch the ball, tug on ropes, and romp around the yard. I do enjoy walks and I do well on the leash when it\u2019s just me and my foster Dad. But, when I see another dog headed my way, I have a tendency to pull and I'm very strong! We do continue to work on my leash manners! I'm a smart girl, and am getting better and better. My ideal home would be one with an experienced dog person and one where I can be the four legged queen of the castle - no other dogs or cats or other critters, please. I'm a great excuse to get a great dog but you can't get talked into a second one! Ha! I'm such a wonderful girl, I just don't want to share my space or my toys. I want them all to myself! I just know I would be such a great addition to someone\u2019s family. Could you be the one? ADOPTING TO ILLINOIS ONLY AT THIS TIME",

I'm Blanca, the sweetest girl on the planet. I am a 13 year old pittie mix who is a smooshy, happy girl! I love love love people and love to make new friends. I love to play, snuggle, and keep you company. I'm impeccably house trained, a perfect couch potato to binge your fave Netflix show with, and I love to go for walks and car rides. I'm a healthy senior girl with a touch of arthritis that make a ranch home or minimal stairs a good fit for me. I'm a gorgeous, loving companion who is simply not a fan of other pets, which is why I've been waiting so long to find that special someone to share my golden years with.

Unfortunately his owner could no longer care for him, and when he ended up at the shelter he could not afford the medical care that Chiqui by then needed.  He had puncture wounds in his face and was very thin.  We have taken care of the wounds and he is neutered and on the mend.  He is a nice little dog.  Not house trained but we think he can learn  He gets along with everyone and all the dogs. We noticed a seizure some months ago and have not seen another.\nMore of his back story was that Chi was turned into North central then transferred to low kill  WLA pound with a euthanize date of 11/9 when a volunteer called MCR in a panic due to his sweet personality. We had our puller, Julie, collect him that day and meet up with Anita D who brought him to SLO.  Chiqui does not like crates and will bark if contained. If you have an interest in sweet Chiqui, give us a call at 805-239-4004 or email 4dots@att.net/. Thank you for caring.  UPDATE  Chiqui is now having seizures and a hospice dog",

We are very playful, obedient and enjoy running as you can tell from our videos. We are great off leash and will come on command. \n\nOur Furry Friendz are available for adoption through a screening process which includes but is not limited to: a completed application, 3 referrals, a home visit, and a vet referral prior to their furever home placement. The dogs are Spayed/Neutered, micro chipped, current on all vaccines and on heart worm/flea preventive. If you're interested in adopting, let's begin the Adoption process by clicking the link below.\n\n\nhttps://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/FURF/Dog",

With her skittishness she would do best around kids 7 and older. \n\nTraining: Rosie knows her name, sit, and walks well on a leash (she still gets a little shy about a leash being put on her though). \n\nGrooming Needs: Rosie has a standard husky coat which will require frequent thorough brushing. You should aim for at least once a week, and more when she is blowing her coat, typically twice a year.\n\nFence: Rosie is a flight risk due to her past, therefore a fence will be required for her.\n\nSolo or Siblings: Rosie follows the lead of her foster siblings, and will need that guidance in her forever home.\n\nFrom the Foster: Rosie is a very sweet gal! She came to us when her owner unexpectedly passed away. She lived outside so she learned how to be an indoor dog, but now loves it, especially her favorite spot on the couch. She loves being tucked close to her toys, blankets and in her kennel. She is very timid and is usually on alert. Rosie will need lots of time to adjust to change when she goes to her forever home. With lots of love, training and patience we are sure she will be an amazing dog! Rosie is going to strive best in a home with another dog to help show her the ropes of dog life and a fenced in yard to keep her safe as she is a flight risk. Both are requirements for Rosie.\n\nAdoption Fee: $275\n\nAll dogs coming into Adopt a Husky Minnesota receive care tailored to their needs, including:\nNose-to-tail exam with a partner veterinarian, Vaccinations (Rabies, Distemper, Bordetella), 4DX test to check for heartworm or tick exposure, Fecal Analysis, Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative, Spay/Neuter prior to adoption, Microchip, and are evaluated for temperament and trainability.\n\nProfessional photos of Rosie were donated courtesy of 27Wolf Photography https://www.27wolfphotography.com/",

            "description": "Stallone is 6 years old and full of personality! He's not for the inexperienced despite his age, but if you are familiar with the breed, he will keep you laughing at his antics. Stallone is great in his crate and sees it as his safe space. He is house trained as well. He would do best in a low key home because when he gets overly excited he can act puppyish jumping around. With his size that can be overwhelming. We are not adopting him into a home with children. He loves to play ball, but doesn't always give the ball up. He's good with other dogs but has only been around larger dogs. Cats are unknown. He is a real challenge to walk on leash as he pulls and is very strong. In addition, he tries to chase cars. He is definitely in need of Obedience training in that area. \nApplications are on our website at www.kodisclub.org\n\n**If you are serious about adopting , you must head to our website and submit a completed application . We will not do anything without an app. Due to the small size of our volunteer-run rescue, only the approved adopter may be contacted. It is not first come first served, but the best match **",

She does play with the male dog in the house but no females for her. No kitties for Tulsa. She would do best as an only pet. She is smart as a whip and is learning quickly but needs some obedience training. Tulsa has a pitty face but her fur on her back is that of a wire haired terrier. She's knee height and 50lbs. Tulsa is curious and loves a good adventure. She can be leary of new people but absolutely loves her people. Her adoption fee includes her vaccines, spay and her microchip. She is potty and crate trained. If this looks like your girl, fill out an application: \nhttp://providingforpaws.org/adoption-and-foster-forms.html",

Staff mix\nSex: Spayed Female\nDOB: ~05/31/2012\nWeight: 54 lbs\nEnergy Level: Low\nPersonality Type: Couch Potato!\nGood with: Her person and snuggles\nHistory: Seized by animal control when owner arrested.\nIdeal Home: No cats, no kids (teenagers ok!). Calm home where she can snuggle on furniture with her people. Apartments ok if breed restrictions don't apply! No fence necessary, but is very strong on leash!\nSpecial Info: Walks well on leash but is very strong, may get mouthy when excited. Please note, Baby Spice's adopter will receive one FREE session with our trainer, included in her adoption fee.\n\nPart of Baby Spice's adoption fee has been sponsored! She is available for just $100.00 to the right applicant!\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

            "description": "Meet Aspen! This girl is around  ~6yrs old, and 50 lbs.\n\n Aspen will be loosing her foster family as of 11/19/20 and will return to her boarding if we cannot find a foster, foster-to-adopt, or adoptive family. \n\nShe isn't the dog for everyone, as she will likely need an experienced dog owner.  Her adopter will need strong dog leadership skills and they must know how to be a good observer and handler.  \n\nAspen is not an \u201coff the leash at the dog park\u201d kind of dog.  She is \u201cdog selective,\u201d which means she is not going to be friends with all dogs, but she is also not going to try to attack them while on leash, nor bark/lunge at them when she has a dog encounter while walking or hiking.  She ignores other dogs for the most part.  Aspen\u2019s ideal home will likely be one who is looking for just one family dog and has no cats. She does love humans!!  Although she has met children on/off leash and has at times been sweet to them, a home without small children would likely be the best for her.  This ideal home can sometimes include playtime with some dogs she considers friends.  Providing dog training from the start would be perfect .\n\nMedically, Aspen is super healthy!  Even though she may be 6 years old and is happy/content with being calm, she can also be pretty active/energetic and would make a great hiking buddy and enjoys long walks.  Her blood work is great and she recently had a dental treatment, including removing her canine teeth and several other teeth that were fractured from the time before she was rescued.\n\nWhen she first arrived to the foster's home Aspen seemed to be a little nervous and would whine by the door or in her crate or pant a lot, but with a little love and affection she quickly adjusted and learned the rules fast. She responds very well to \u201cno\u201d and knows which areas she\u2019s not allowed in. She did well with formal training and learned how to not pull on the leash and walk nicely by your side, but you will need to be consistent with it. She only sits when she is on leash by your side with a gentle reminder by pulling up on the leash. \n\nShe enjoys eating leaves from the garden and human food (cooked veggies, rice, sweet potato) over dog food, Probably because they\u2019re soft and easier to chew. She eats hard dog food very slowly because she is missing several teeth, so maybe soft treats and soft food would be better for her.\n\n Aspen sleeps nicely in her crate every night and will go to her crate on her own throughout the day, however she will resist if she knows you are leaving. Sometimes she will run to a corner or under the bed if you tell her to go to her place, but this can easily be fixed with consistent training on leash (when her leash is on, she goes to her place on command). She is not super destructive but has lightly chewed on a few items that were in the yard (boxing glove and yoga mat), but they weren\u2019t destroyed or anything (again, probably has to do with her missing some teeth). She also responds well to \u201cno\u201d if you see her try to grab something or if you correct her for trying to chew on something.\n\nAspen is very independent and likes to explore outside.  Several times she has also bolted out of the door, but if you chase her and yell after her she immediately stops and rolls over on her back. Despite her being a little mischievous at times, she is the absolute sweetest. Even though she likes all people and gets along great with everyone, she has attached onto her foster and will follow her around everywhere. She likes to sleep under the foster's side of the bed and it has become her spot at night, or when she wants to get away from everyone. \n\nShe is housetrained and goes on the same place in the yard.\n\nShe is dominant with other dogs, but lives with a male staffy rescue  and they are best buddies now, even sleeping with each other on occasion.",

He loves to play with his brothers and sisters and gets along well with other dogs. \n\nThe $150 adoption fee includes spay/neuter, micro-chip, up-to-date vaccinations, including rabies. Rex is heart worm negative OR are currently being treated with the slow kill method approved by our veterinarian, on prevention & on flea/tick prevention.\n\nIn order to be considered for one of our beautiful pups, please go to our website and complete and application: https://www.mustluvdogs.org/adoptable-pets.\nPlease note that we are a DUE DILIGENCE adoption organization. Part of our approval process requires, among other things:\n* Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered.\n*The majority but not all of our pets require a fenced yard.\n*Verifiable good veterinary history INCLUDING regular vaccination/visits and Good Heartworm Prevention history is a MUST!\n*Adopter must be able to have time to spend with the pup and be able to provide the pup a safe environment to live.\n*ALL our dogs are expected to be primarily INSIDE dogs.  They MUST sleep inside the home.  We truly understand that some folks have working dogs (i.e. farmers, ranchers,etc); however, the majority of our dogs have had a rough life prior to coming to us & we want to make sure that they are showered with LUV & maybe even a bit spoiled for the rest of their lives. \n\nOther facts are also considered, including whether children or other pets are a good fit with the dog. \n\nMust Luv Dogs reserves the right to deny any applications that we don't think are a good fit with the pup. Our first & foremost concern is the dog's best interest. It is our MISSION to place them in a home that is a great fit for their needs for a lifetime of luv & being part of a family.\n*We will consider adoptions in any area; however, will do not ship or transport a puppy under the age of 12 mos. We will ONLY transport an adult dog on a transport approved by MLD, at adopter's expense.\n* In order to be affordable and afford every family an opportunity to have a pup of their own, we keep our Adoption Fees at a low $150, but any additional donations are appreciated!\n\nPlease note that all of our pets are in private foster homes. In order to reduce any stress or confusion for our pups, we require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meeting for any of fur-babies. Alternatively, you are always welcome to come meet any of our pups at one of our regular Adoption Events. They are always posted on PetFinder OR on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/mustLUVdogs.org.\n\nFinally, THANK YOU for considering Must Luv Dogs for your next pet. \n\n*Most dogs require a fenced area in yard. \n*Apartments okay IF nearby dog park or walking trails.\n*ALL dogs must be INSIDE dogs. \n*We are a DUE DILIGENCE Adoption Rescue.  \n*Must have good Vet history & Heartworm prevention is a MUST!\n*ALL dogs are fully vetted, spay/neutered and microchipped.",

They spent their lives on a chain where they did not receive the proper care, as well as never experiencing what it was like to be a part of a home and treated as a family member. We are hoping to find someone who is familiar with this breed\u2019s nuances and who will truly love Snow White and give her a second chance at a better life.\n\nSnow White is an independent lady who likes the job of patrolling her grounds. As with many German Shepherd females, she is very confident and self assured. She is protective of her family here at the rescue and is very obedient to her handlers. She loves people and really appreciates walks and a good job to work on. She, also like so many of her breed, needs to have a job to keep from going stir crazy.  She is a high power dog that requires experience with working breed dogs and as an owner knows and expects the demands of the breed. Snow is a good girl! She rides well in a car and puts up with being brushed. She is good about having her nails trimmed and ears cleaned out. She is gentle about accepting treats. She is a big fan of treats and loves dinner time very much.\n\n----\nPeach County Animal Rescue is a rescue located in Fort Valley, GA. Our adoption fees range from $250-350+. Although our rescue dogs share a common bond with one another, no rescue story is the same (even when similar). Vetting costs vary depending on their health conditions. All of our dogs are fully vetted: up-to-date on annual shots, spayed/neutered and microchipped with a lifetime registration. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nIf you would like to send in an application for this dog, please use the link below! https://peachcountyanimalrescueandrehabilitation.org/apply-now-2/",

Please watch your spam folders as an application will be attached and this sometimes places it in there. \n\nThis dog is heartworm positive but please do not rule him/her out because of it. There's a treatment that is not as hard on the dog as the one you may have heard of and it's FREE.\n\nThackery is a very sweet boy. His foster family absolutely adores him. He is approximated to be about 3-4 years old. He is currently in a foster home with male/female and small/large dogs. He is very dog friendly. He tends to be most comfortable around smaller dogs or female dogs his size. He is a bit more cautious around large male dogs, but with slow introductions he adjusts to/enjoys having them around! He has not been cat or children tested. However, he would do best in a home where there are no very small children. He has a high energy level that will require some training. He is NOT aggressive in any way towards people... but LOVES to play and get attention so he will try to jump in your lap and lay on you at times.. because of his size (~55 lbs) we say no small children. He is very silly and loves running around with other dogs (once he is comfortable with them). Likes going on runs and will even play with his toys alone. All he wants is to be loved and to find the perfect forever home! \n\nPlease inquire if you are interested or have any questions! \n\nmore pics/videos:\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VvSWtM5I_EvkcagzsWrw9CdkRVZUFlYg\n\nHIS/HER adoption fee is $550 USD and that will pay for TRANSPORT, all his/her shots up to date, neutered/spayed, microchip and rabies.\n\nPlease e-mail MuttsAndMeows@Mail.com for an adoption application. \n\nThis dog is currently in the Houston Texas area.  Once the application is approved and adoption fee paid, transport will be arranged.\n\nBecause this adoption will be without meeting the dog first, we will need to try to be extra careful that everyone (including you) think this will be a good fit.  We will try to give you as much information about the dog as we can.  \n\nLike us on Facebook - search Mutts & Meows - and help even more pets find loving homes.",

            "description": "Mama Dog is a super sweet, approx. 4 year old med sized mixed breed pup. She loves to run and play and gets along well with other dogs and humans. She wants more than anything else to have her very own family to love and snuggle with!\n\nLike many rescue pups, this furbaby is HW+, but is currently undergoing the *slow-kill method of treatment (see more information below).  \n\nAll our adoption fees include spay/neuter, micro-chip, up-to-date vaccinations, including rabies thru date of adoption. This pup is heart worm positive and is currently being treated with the *slow kill method, approved by her veterinarian, on prevention & on flea/tick prevention. \n\n*The slow kill method of treatment, simply stated, is a 30 day regiment of  doxycycline followed by a monthly dose of Advantage Multi for 12 months, then retesting.   Most dogs test negative after one year of following this treatment; however, we always recommend that potential adopters consult & follow the advice of their family veterinarian upon adopting any of our hw+ pups.   Although the fast-kill method is still considered the \"gold-standard\" by the AVA, and may be preferred by some vets; the slow-kill method has proven to be effective in our rescue. The main reason we utilize this method is due to our limited financial constraints and the high number of our rescue pups that are infected.   In the cases of severe infection and if the pup is highly symptomatic, we sometimes use the fast-kill approach instead.   Again, we recommend for you to consult with your veterinarian after the adoption is complete and follow their recommendations.   \n\nIn order to be considered for one of our beautiful pups, please go to our website and complete and application: https://www.mustluvdogs.org/adoptable-pets.\nPlease note that we are a DUE DILIGENCE adoption organization. Part of our approval process requires, among other things:\n* Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered.\n*The majority, but not all, of our pets require a fenced yard or secure enclosure.  In the case of apartments, we require Landlord approval and designated dog area in complex.\n*Verifiable good veterinary history INCLUDING regular vaccination/visits and good Heartworm Prevention history is a MUST!\n*Adopter must be able to have time to spend with the pup and be able to provide the pup a safe environment to live.\n*ALL our dogs are expected to be primarily INSIDE dogs.  They MUST sleep inside the home.  We truly understand that some folks have working dogs (i.e. farmers, ranchers,etc); however, the majority of our dogs have had a rough life prior to coming to us & we want to make sure that they are showered with LUV & maybe even a bit spoiled for the rest of their lives. \n\nOther facts are also considered, including whether children or other pets are a good fit with the dog. \n\nMust Luv Dogs reserves the right to deny any applications that we don't think are a good fit with the pup. Our first & foremost concern is the dog's best interest. It is our MISSION to place them in a home that is a great fit for their needs for a lifetime of luv & being part of a family.\n*We will consider adoptions in any area; however, will do not ship or transport puppies under the age of 12 mos. We will ONLY transport an adult dog on a transport approved by MLD, at adopter's expense.\n* In order to be affordable and afford every family an opportunity to have a pup of their own, we keep our Adoption Fees low; however, please keep in mind that the fees we charge do not cover all costs for the pup.  Any additional donations are greatly appreciated!\n\nPlease note that all of our pets are in private foster homes. In order to reduce any stress or confusion for our pups, we require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meet & greet for any of our pups.  Alternatively, you are always welcome to come meet any of our pups at one of our regular Adoption Events.   Our events are always posted on PetFinder OR on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/mustLUVdogs.org.\n\nFinally, THANK YOU for considering Must Luv Dogs for your next pet. \n\n*Most dogs require a fenced area in yard. \n*Apartments okay IF nearby dog park or walking trails (with landlord approval).\n*ALL dogs must be INSIDE dogs and treated a part of family. \n*We are a DUE DILIGENCE Adoption Rescue.  \n*Must have good Vet history & Heart Worm prevention is a MUST!\n*ALL dogs are fully vetted, spay/neutered and micro-chipped prior to adoption.\n\n",

He's quite friendly and obedient and thinks his best vantage point to stare up at your face is by putting his paws on your waist and giving you kisses.  He is one sweetie that think he is a macho male type, but is really a little mouse on the inside! Don't tell him that though, because he honestly thinks he's so sure of his place in the universe as the leader of the pack... until the nail trimmer comes out, and then his confidence gives out! \n\nHe is very gentle in taking treats. Repo likes to have known expectations of what comes next throughout the day, so the activity and hustle and bustle of many folks in and out of a home probably isn\u2019t the best fit for him. Repo would make a great couch potato!\n\n----\nPeach County Animal Rescue is a rescue located in Fort Valley, GA. Our adoption fees range from $250-350+. Although our rescue dogs share a common bond with one another, no rescue story is the same (even when similar). Vetting costs vary depending on their health conditions. For us, it is never about the money. We are a non-profit. Thank you for your love and support! All of our dogs are fully vetted: up-to-date on annual shots, spayed/neutered and microchipped with a lifetime registration. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nIf you would like to send in an application for this dog, please use the link below! https://peachcountyanimalrescueandrehabilitation.org/apply-now-2/",

            "description": "** Please read the bio in its entirety before emailing with questions or submitting an application**\n\nAs we are an all volunteer rescue with limited time to respond to emails, if you email us with questions that have already been answered in the bio, we won't be able to respond. We are being inundated with emails at the moment. Thank you for your understanding!\n\n~~Hey, Splinter here! I'm often referred to as Master Splinter by my students, the Turtles, and I'm their martial arts and ninjutsu instructor as well as their adopted father, but in my other life I'm an adorable, tiny gentleman that sure would love to call you my Family!\n\nYou are most probably wondering why a handsome 12 year old (estimated by our vet) guy like me is looking for a home. Well, here's my story. I came into the shelter after a really rough life, my owner did not have me neutered, my teeth were in horrible shape, my nails were super long, my skin was so itchy from flea bites that I scratched ALL the time, my tail bone was broken and I'd been shot with a BB. Whew! The worst part is I was dehydrated and emaciated \n\nI was so happy when PawPrints Animal Rescue took me in and found a foster home for me and Boy has my life changed! Currently I live with my foster mom and her four senior dogs and let me tell you, Life is good! I've been neutered, had a dental and my itchy skin is healing nicely and now I'm ready to find a family of my own.\nI don't think I'd do well with young children or with high energy dogs because I have a sore back and the little ones and rambunctious dogs may unintentionally knock into me so I'm looking for someone who can be gentle with me. I love to cuddle but my forever family would have to make sure to lift me on and off the couch so I don't make my back sore again but don't worry, I weigh less than 6 pounds so lifting me would be a breeze! I know I'd make a great companion for an older person who's looking for an adorable lap dog!\n\nI do bark initially when my foster mom goes out but I quickly settle down and mostly sleep while she's away. I must admit that even though I'm pretty close to the perfect companion, I am not 100% housebroken when I am left alone. I do know the meaning of the word \"out\" but it's most probably best not to let me have free roam of the house while you are gone. I really am a good dog and I hope to work on this now that I am neutered and once I settle into a stable, forever home.\n\nThings have been so confusing lately but if you gently correct me for anything you don't want me to do and praise me for when I'm being your best boy, I will become the most perfect dog ever because I love people and just want to make them happy! In fact, because it makes me so happy to please my person I'd really like to find someone who is retired or at least home a fair amount of time to be with me.\n\nSplinter is 12 years old (approximately), neutered, has had a full dental, tested negative for heartworm and is on monthly prevention, is up to date on his vaccines and microchipped.\n\nAdoption fee is $100 (plus tax for KY residents)\n\nHis listing will be removed as soon as he has an approved application\n\nIf you have specific needs that aren't addressed in the bio (children in the home, small animals, apartment/condo living, etc) please email to ask if the dog is suitable for the environment before submitting an application. Once the application is submitted, please expect someone to email you with questions and/or provide more information about the dog is we are unsure that the dog may be a good fit.\n\nMost importantly, please be honest! We have many people tell us what they think we want to read, not what's truthful. If there are discrepancies, your application will be denied. It's important for us to place dogs in a home that's suitable. You may be a stellar owner but possibly not a good fit for the dog you were first interested in adopting. We're not trying to offend anyone, we're trying to set everyone up for success. We're a best fit rescue and will verify your vet and personal references.\n\nAdoption Process:\n\nStep 1: Complete a \"no obligation\" application on our website, www.pawprintsnky.com\n\nStep 2: PawPrints will review the application, verifying Vet and personal references as well as landlord requirements/restrictions (if applicable)\n\nStep 3: IF your application is approved, we will call you to schedule a meet and greet for you to meet the pet.\n\nStep 4: If the meet and greet goes well, we will schedule the home visit.",

I'm learning new things everyday from the staff and volunteers here at Mackenzie's. I was picked up as a stray as a youngster, so the staff and volunteers here have really helped me buckle down on my training and  manners. In a quiet and patient home, I'm pretty confident that with one-on-one attention, I could really blossom.  I would love to take training classes with you, not only because I am very smart, but it would also help build a great bond between us. No small kids, other dogs or cats for now.\"  \n\n(Gilbert is not aggressive with other dogs, he just doesn't understand dog etiquette very well.)\n\nMeet-Your-Match Canine-ality color is: Green Life of the Party\nFor safety's sake, we are looking for homes with physical fenced in areas.\nPlease fill out our online adoption survey at www.mackenzies.info",

            "description": "Chewy von Celle is a beautiful 1-2 year-old German Shepherd and weighs approximately 85#.. This big boy with the soft ears and sweet smile is quite the sharp fellow. Medium-energy Chewy enjoys his walks and is quite observant, always keeping an eye on what or who may be ahead. He is apprehensive towards unfamiliar people and surroundings, and will do best with a shepherd-experienced owner who can introduce him to new faces and friends both slowly and cautiously. With patience, he becomes an easygoing, well-behaved boy who can be very sweet with those he knows, eating up any affection you\u2019ll give him. Off leash, Chewy seems to enjoy the company of dogs (but not cats). He really enjoys canine playgroups, roaming around with his pals and soaking in all the playtime he can fit into his busy schedule. He is loving and attentive, and is seeking a home that will make the most of these assets.\n\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website!

Shelby is more timid then her other sisters and brother. She really needs a family who can really be patience with her give her the time she needs to feel comfortable to come out of her shell. She never bites but will often run from you and hide. She is still learning to be a dog with a human family who will love her and treated her as a part of the family. Shelby scare of human touch all because of her pass. It is so sad to see how scare they are when you try to love on them. She would do best with low key dogs.  Sophie needs that special someone willing to work with her, help her gain her confidence and teach her that people can be good and trustworthy. Shelby, her sibling and mom always wondering the street looking for foods until they were rescue by a sweet kind heart elder lady.

They were the same age, puppies, and have been together ever since- except for a heartbreaking separation that almost ended in Lady's death. \nLeft at a kill-facility in Las Vegas by their former owner, AnimalVILLAGENM no-kill shelter in NM was contacted. Lady was in the process of being euthanized because she was a pitbull, and considered a 'dangerous dog.' \nDuring the process of euthanizing her, already sedated for death, the facility decided to check for a microchip. There was one, and  AnimalVILLAGENM said, \"YES, WE WANT HER BACK, NO QUESTIONS!\" 48 hours later, Lady- and Louie- were safely back in NM, at AnimalVILLAGENM. It was a rough road for the girls, but they are loving their lives again, and must be adopted together. We think you will see that in these pictures!\n\nDOB: 4-16-10\nTOTAL Adoption fee for both: $195.\n\nPet introductions are scheduled when adoption applications are approved.\u00a0\nSubmit $25 application fee with your online application now at animalvillagenm.org/adoption-application\n\nTo make sure our pets go to wonderful, safe, responsible homes, we introduce our pets to those who have already submitted complete applications, which have been approved.

He needs 1) Another young playful dog in the home &   2) Someone who has experience with fearful dogs. \nPls folks- take the time to read the bios.  Rambo & his siblings are awesome dogs but it will take time before you see the fun side that we see!\n\nRambo is a 1.5 year-old Shepherd lab rottie mix. He is 49 pounds. He came from a hoarder situation where he was loved but was not socialized with people. He gets along great with dogs of all sizes but prefers for them not be to dominant.  He's all about the fun dog.  He is very shy with people. He is great with his foster mom but he is definitely considered one of our project dogs.  He needs a loving home with someone who can be patient with his shyness. He would do better in a home with No kids who are going to scare him and he MUST have another playful dog in the house to help teach him that people are good...well some of us are. \n\nRambo has so much love to give. If you have love and patience And would like a great reward of earning a dog\u2019s trust please fill out an application and we can set up a meet and greet. \nwww.MuttsInNeed.org",

            "description": "<p>\"Gus\" is a Pitbull mix. He is very smart and loves to learn. He is about 2 years old. He is working on being housetrained. He is also working on manners and has been introduced to the clicker. He will need to go to a home that will continue to work on obedience training with him. His new family will also need to be an experienced dog home without small children.  He does do well with some dogs but does not do well with cats or smaller dogs.  \n\nAll of our dogs are either spayed or neutered. They have been given a distemper and bordetella vaccination, flea treatment, and have been wormed. Since our adoption fee is so low ($35) why not consider a tax free donation. Your support is a key ingredient in the continued success of our shelter. An application must be completed and approved if you would like to adopt a dog from the Story County Animal Shelter. The staff here at the shelter works very hard to find just the right home for each animal that comes through the door. For more information please call us at 515-382-3338.</p>",

I would prefer a quieter home without a ton\nof traffic, and a home as opposed to an apartment!\n\nI am planning to attend a high end board and train program, but apparently\nI am in need of \"an experienced\" couch to crash on when I get out before I\ncan attend. I am great with the kids in my current home but I would\nprefer no kids in my next home. I can be picky with my canine friends, so\nfor the time being I am looking for a dog free home!\n\nI need someone who will work with me on the training I learn so that WE\n(me & YOU!!!) can communicate at our fullest potential!! I LOVE learning\nand we could have SO much fun on the trails!!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please fill out an application at survivortails.org or email adoptions@survivortails.org with any questions.\n\n",

            "description": "How can you resist that face?  You\u2019d never believe Bandit is 9 years old, because he sure doesn\u2019t act like it.  He\u2019s got lots of pep, and he loves to romp and play in the MLAR yards.  He appears curious about the other dogs, so he might be good with another dog in your family, if introduced slowly, and he\u2019s such a nice, sweet guy with people.  He knows \u201csit\u201d and his big pointy ears don\u2019t miss a thing.  He\u2019s got a strong pull on leash (he is a big guy, after all), so if there are kids in the family, it\u2019d be best if they\u2019re older (12+).  If you want a dog who\u2019s well past the crazy stages, but still has lots of gas in the tank, and loves people, Bandit is the perfect guy for you!\nIf you are interested in meeting any of our adoptable dogs, please fill out an application at https://www.mlar.org/adoption-overview\n\nE-mails regarding adoption are not considered an application. \n\nOut-of-state applicants  (outside PA/NJ/DE) will not be considered, unless there are special circumstances. \n\nPlease visit our web site for more detailed information on the animals in our care, our educational campaigns, and for helpful tips on adoption.  www.MLAR.org",

            "description": "Shady is about 2 years old now.  In August of 2019, he was hit by a car on a reservation in Manitoba and suffered spinal trauma and a fractured pelvis.. luckily after x-rays and an MRI he didn't need surgery, but needed strict crate rest followed by rehab therapy.\n\nShady was paralyzed and could not walk, but he has made a miraculous recovery and is now walking, running, playing and is house trained!\n\nShady has fully recovered from his injuries and has been having so much fun on our 7 acre property.  \n\nHe has limited range of motion in his hips, so he tends to bunny hop.  This doesn't cause him any pain, it's just the way he moves now. \n\nThe one thing he cannot do is to Go Down a lot of Stairs.  His brain isn't getting the right signals to his hind legs about that, and may never.  But we do make him go down the 4 stairs to the outside.  He can go up the stairs with ease. \n\nWith that being said, Shady's home should not have lots of stairs and he should never have free access to stairs.  \n\nHis ideal set up would be a one level detached home or a home with no access to stairs preferably on a fully fenced acreage, with access to indoors too.  He loves hanging out with his humans while watching tv or sitting on the deck.  He's very attached to his people \n\nShady loves having lots of space to run and frolick. Shady also LOVES water!  Swimming is good for him but he should never be off leash swimming in case his legs get tired and he starts to sink.\n\nIf you're gone long hours, a doggie door to a secure property would be perfectly ideal for the Shade man.\n\nShady is great with other dogs, but he is a RUDE player and this tends to annoy other dogs.  He does tend to get over excited, and doesn't fully understand the \"quit\" signals from other dogs, and this needs to be monitored and controlled by his human to prevent altercations.  He would prefer to live with female dogs over make dogs but if the male dogs is calm, not excitable and non reactive then Shady would make friends. \n\n He has met some small dogs but gets over excited and his big feet, over excitable and clumsy nature could injure a small dog, so a home without small dogs would be best..  he is not good with cats \n\nHe still has lots to learn as he wasn't taught much before his injury and since then has been confined for recovery. Especially his recall and stay. \n\nShady needs a confident leader who will focus on boundaries and routine. He should not live with any children as he is too excitable and can unintentionally knock them over. He should have an adult only home as he needs consistent routine and boundaries. \n\nHe has a high prey drive for small animals including  cats, squirrels, birds and other interesting critters.  \n\nShady should not live in highly populated and high traffic areas.  He tends to get overstimulated and over excited, making it hard for him to focus on his human.  When he gets over stimulated he tends to try to nip at passers-by when he is on leash so he will need to be muzzled on leash walks.  Finding Shady a lovely acreage setting would be so ideal.   He loves his current foster home on 7 fully fenced acres. \n\nHis adoption fee is $195.  He is neutered, microchipped, tattooed, dewormed, flea treated and vaccinated..\n\nYou can go directly to our website and submit the application by copying and pasting the following link into your browser \n\nhttp://lowermainlandhumanesociety.org/adoption-application/",

Thomas was spotted during one of the hottest summers on record, sitting on a piece of cardboard to protect his paws from the grueling hot pavement of a Santa Ana alley, with no food or water in sight. A wonderful woman who feeds feral cats in the area saw him day after day trying to survive when she contacted AALOC, asking us to help this small Chihuahua.  \n\nThomas is about 10 pounds, a feisty dog with a soft center. He\u2019ll bark when he sees a dog or person he doesn\u2019t know, but gets along well with his buddy Chihuahua friend Jesse and the dog walkers at AALOC. His spirit is a bit broken and we wonder how he could have come to living alone on the streets. You\u2019ll definitely have to build trust with Thomas, but once you do we know you\u2019ll have a friend for life. Thomas can also be possessive of food, toys and your attention, so someone who can provide the necessary leadership and guidance for Thomas is important, and a household without children is required. Chihuahuas are very loyal companions but do not consider their small size \u2013 they will protect their owners without consideration of the danger. Therefore they must be protected from bigger dogs, as well as cold weather and falls.  \n\nPlease submit an application to adopt Thomas on our website at www.aaloc.org. Once your application is reviewed and approved we will contact you to make an appointment to visit us at AALOC to meet Thomas during visiting hours (10am to 3pm daily) and get to know him a bit.",

            "description": "Simba is a gorgeous young German Shepherd mix, who loves to play with the other dogs in his foster home.  He has an endless supply of energy and would make for an excellent running companion. He will need a lot of exercise and socialization on a daily basis. He\u2019s very intelligent and treat-driven, so he\u2019s been fairly easy to train. He knows how to sit on command and comes when called.  We\u2019re still working on his inside manners, such as jumping up on people, and barking at people walking by on the sidewalk.  He\u2019s house-trained and has been free to roam the house while his foster mom is out, with few chewing incidents.\n\nHe will need slow introductions to new people, as he is a bit nervous at first, and will need to meet other dogs in the house to determine if they are compatible.  However, once he gets to know you, he becomes quite the cuddle-bug and will flop over for a tummy rub in a heartbeat.  He is not food-aggressive and sits patiently while his foster mom prepares his and his foster brother\u2019s food.\n\nHe definitely has the stubbornness of a GSD but has responded well to positive reinforcement.  He will need an experienced owner who has a lot of love and patience, because he\u2019s a sweet, loving dog, and is definitely worth the effort. \nPlease complete an adoption application at\nhttp://www.bigredrescue.com. \n\nYour $350.00 adoption donation will be used to\nhelp rescue the next pet in need.   As a rescue we \nreserve the right to assist the applicant in selection of a pet. \nPlease understand some families will not possess the \nqualities necessary for certain pets.    \n\nAll adopted pets are (age appropriate) current with rabies and distemper/parvo vaccinations.  All of our rescued pets are micro~chipped and (age appropriately) spay or neutered.  While some of our pets available have been treated for heart worm or tested heart worm negative all of our pets will be current on heart worm preventative.  All heart worm information is available to all applicants as this information is crucial to the well being of the pet.  Please see your individual contract for all details related to your adoption/pet.  \n\nPlease visit and like our Facebook page at: https://www.facebook.com/BigRedRescue",

She will always have hanging skin from such horrible treatment. She had behavior problems, such as spinning and chewing on her tail, this was caused from anxiety. She would really do much better in a home where she can feel safe. She is not easy on the eyes, but her heart is pure. She needs someone with a big heart that won't judge her on her misfortune. A foster home to adopt would be wonderful too. 2/2/21 3:58 AM",

            "description": "Friends to the Forlorn\nAdopt-a-BullBreed: Pit Bull Terrier Gender: Male Estimated Date of Birth: April 9, 2017 Size: 45 lbs Location: Stone Mountain, GA\nRESCUING LEO\nLeo came into Cobb County Animal Control as a stray. He has an unknown source of front right leg lameness and some back-end weakness that is more pronounced on slick surfaces. He runs, jumps, plays, and uses stairs 100% like a normal dog. An orthopedic surgeon looked at his x-rays and saw no significant abnormalities, however it was determined he may have some possible nerve damage. Animal Control felt that it would be best if he was placed in a home through rescue to ensure he gets the proper home. FTTF was able to give him his freedom ride on 10/1/18.\nABOUT LEO\nLeo is full of himself - he is smaller pittie mix that is full of personality. He bonds really quickly with people and wants to please. Leo loves all people and some dogs. Leo lives in foster care with other dogs and he very much prefers older, lower energy dogs for his friends. He would do best in a home without cats. He walks well on a leash and will gladly show you his happy dance when he sees a human with a leash in their hands. He also loves riding in the car, so much so that if you walk past a car, he will stop and try to get in. (this guy is an excellent travel buddy! He even enjoys going out on the boat!). He is mostly housebroken and crate trained, although he is not destructive and can be trusted out of his crate by himself. He loves snuggling at night and if he could, he will stay sleeping with you all night. This boy is super loving with a medium energy level so he loves to play and run. He is quick and bouncy and a lot of fun.\nLeo has an old injury to his front, right leg that has left him with some nerve damage. The delicate paw doesn't slow him down at all, but occasionally causes the 'sleep' sensation, causing him to chew on that paw, but medication for anxiety seems to cut down on that behavior. He does better with traction on grass or carpet than on a hard, slick floor. When on good footing, he gets around perfect and nothing slows him down. He would love a yard to run around in too. Leo is ready for his forever family so if you are looking for a smaller, loving, playful boy Leo is your man!\nPhoto Album of Leo: https://www.facebook.com/pg/FriendsToTheForlornPitbullRescue/photos/?tab=album&album_id=2694938927230923\nOur adoption fee is $300. All dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, on heartworm prevention, and are fed top of the line grain-free food.www.savingpitbulls.org",

When Bodine came to us he was skin and bones; he is now a happy, healthy, 73-pound boy! Bodine is a Shepherd/Hound mix and approximately 5-6 years old. Bodine needs to be the only dog in the home. Bodine is an active dog that needs a large, fenced yard to run and play. \n\nThe fee to adopt Bodine is $200.00; this includes: neuter, deworming, vaccinations and a microchip. \n\n**Please Note: Bodine is currently located at our facility in Sherman, Texas. Adoptions are by-appointment only; if you are interested in adopting Bodine, please visit our website, www.arfhouse.org and fill out an adoption application.

I\u2019m more comfortable with women than men, but then again one of my favorite volunteers is a calm and patient man. My least favorite are cats. I have some missing toes on a rear paw, but I\u2019m an easy walker and sometimes hop along on three legs. In fact, I love to run if I have the space! I\u2019ve been crate trained but much prefer cuddling on the couch with you. I bond with my person so much, I admit I can get protective. I\u2019m teachable and willing to learn, and you can learn what a love I am when you visit me and take me home!\n \nTo view additional animals and find out more about The Animal League of Green Valley, visit our website at www.talgv.org or call (520) 625-3170 between 10 am and 2 pm Monday though Sunday.",

One day I heard the volunteers saying I was such\na princess, a \u201cCinderella\u201d and they changed my name, calling me Cinder\nfor short. Well, I like that a lot better and I\u2019m so smart, I learned my\nnew name in a day! I have been at Operation Scarlet for over a year now.\nI came here after leaving Puerto Rico and spending more than a year at a\nshelter in another state. I get good care here but let me tell you, I\u2019m\nmore than ready for a real home\u2026..something I never really had. While\nhere at Operation Scarlet I\u2019ve seen lots of dogs come and go, leaving\nOperation Scarlet for their forever homes. I don\u2019t know exactly what a\nforever home is but from what I hear it sure sounds like heaven to me.\nMy dream of a perfect forever home? Well, I am pretty much a princess so\nI want a home where I can reign as a true princess\u2026.no other pets or\nchildren to compete for attention. What else? As a princess, you know I\nneed my space. A big fenced-in yard with a nice high fence would fit the\nbill. Not having a home my entire 2 years of life, I know I have a lot\nto learn about living in a home and I know it will take time and\npatience for me to learn how to \u201cdog\u201d. It will be so worth it, for me\nand for my subjects, I mean my family. If you\u2019d like to meet me, Cinder\n(fka Sorpressa) please go to the Operation Scarlet web site,\noperationscarlet.com, and fill out an application. Hours are by\nappointment only.",

I am deaf and have extremely limited vision. My foster momma thinks I can see shadows, but I\u2019m very easily startled and so I am not a good fit for a family with young children. I love to go on walks and bunny hop the whole way! Food rocks my world and I start every day with a happy heart ready for my breakfast! I get along well with other pets as long as they respect my space - I get scared easily since I can\u2019t hear or see very well. Right now my foster mom has two other dogs and a cat and I get along well with all of them!\n\nI am a healthy girl and will come with all updated vaccinations, heartworm test, microchip, recent senior bloodwork and 12 months of heartworm and intestinal parasite prevention. I have already been spayed and have had an extensive dental cleaning (I only have a couple little teeth now)! \n\nI have been waiting very patiently with my foster mom but I am so ready to find a family that will love me in my golden years! If you think we might be a good match, please email me! Can\u2019t wait to meet you! She can go on a home visit with you for 1 week. If interested in adopting Opal, send an email to adoptions.spspca@gmail.com",

            "description": "Hiya friends, it's Nikko here. I am so ready to find my forever home and show my future adopter(s) what a good boy I really am. My friends here at ARNO report that some of my best qualities are that:\n 1) I walk very well on a leash. I really don't pull much, if at all. \n 2) I am great in the car! I don't try to climb up into the front seat or into your lap. I'm a perfect passenger.\n 3) I love laying in the grass and enjoying the beautiful fall weather after a romp around the neighborhood. I will pose quite well for pictures (have you seen my adorable smile?!) and my tail will wag while you give me all the pets.\n\nI'm a smart boy and very eager to please. If you want to teach me tricks, I'm down! If you like to go for walks in your neighborhood and explore nature, I'm down! If you want to go grab a hamburger for each of us at the drive through, I'm down for that too! I'm a good boy who is ready to run, play, and use my brain in my forever home. And of course I'm also very excited to cuddle, take naps, and watch tv with my forever people too.\n\nMy adoption fee is $200. This includes a spay/neuter, up-to-date vaccines, deworming, a microchip, a heartworm test, and, if needed, heartworm treatment.\n\n________________________________________________\n\nFor all animals that have not been spayed or neutered a $100 deposit will be required in addition to the adoption fee. The deposit is refundable upon completion of the spay / neuter surgery.\n\nFor more information email: adopt@animalrescueneworleans.org.\n\nTo complete an application, please visit: https://animalrescueneworleans.org/adoptfoster/.\n\nPlease visit our facebook for more information about adoption specials, and adoption events. Events are a great way to meet multiple animals at a time!",

Our adopt application can be found on our website www.jcldr.com\n\nCOLORADO SPRINGS COLORADO : Meet MACY, a sweet Catahoula X Jack Russel (Possibly Jack Russel) Spayed Female, one year old.  Up to date on vaccs, HW tested and neg, on prevention. Microchipped. Somewhat accepting of crate but not actually crate trained. Has overcome car sickness from puppyhood, Short trips day to day driving she does ok but long distance trips she might get car sick still. Hit and miss at the veterinarian\u2019s office. No muzzle needed but she needs time to settle down and get acquainted. Slow approach from strangers usually wins out. Fed twice a day, Country Naturals.  Treat motivated for training. She probably weighs between 45 and 50 pounds. She is leash trained. She still is puppy focused and does some leash pulling. (Admin note: Recommend a Martingale collar for her )  She does know Heel, sit, stay, down, roll over, paw paw. She has learned some manners. Quick learner. Not much of a barker. Pretty quiet. She is protective of her owner which is a good thing. She is friendly with most people after slow intro\u2019s. She cannot be rushed at all. We are pretty sure that she has some vision deficit and also some hearing deficit in her white ear. We have not tested it out but we see the signs of it. It would be minor not major. Basically we want to stress that she is loyal and sweet and a really good puppy with a lot of potential in the right home. No small children but older children probably ok. She has been around teens, introduced to her properly and has done well.  She goes to doggie day care twice a week and does better with big dogs not smaller ones. She plays very Catahoula rough and rather dominant in play. She has never been around cats but with her hunting drive we would say no small critters for her. Housebroken. \n\nHISTORY:  She was adopted from a Colorado Rescue at the age of 9 weeks. She has been with her current owner ever since. (ADMIN NOTE: The reason she is with JCLDR on the adopt floor is because we are highly experienced at placing Catahoulas in proper homes.) Owner needs to rehome her because small grandchildren often in the home and incompatibility with older male Golden, just too much rough puppy play and the older dog has bad hips. \n\nGOOD: Owner loves her smartness and is incredibly loyal. She loves with her whole heart. Loves playing ball and games. She loves to learn tricks. Any game she loves to learn and play. \n\nBAD: Separation anxiety is getting better but it is still there and she is a bit needy and has some signs of it. Reactive with small children and some noises but she is better with noises. (Admin Note: This can be from her hearing and vision deficit. She hears and sees things in a more intense way) She does improve if you keep working with her. (ADMIN NOTE:  Remember that she is just a baby.) She is pack settled with her family and doesn\u2019t need strangers in her life.. she will interact with strangers respectfully if no one pushes on her. \n\nUGLY: Small children could turn ugly for her.. no bite incidences yet but owner is very careful to put safety first. \n\nIF INTERESTED PLEASE CONACT JANEEN JACKSON jj4@midrivers.com or 406-323-3519",

Hes awkward on walks, and very eager to take them, but is still working on his leash manners and would do well with an adopter who has the patience to assist him with perfecting these skills. He knows basic commands such as sit, but sometimes struggles to follow through due to being distracted. He does well with hand commands combined with the verbal request. Sully is crate trained potty trained although with his new environment, he may need a few gentle reminders to help his recollection. When Sully wants something, he will turn on the puppy dog eyes and put his paw on your arm. This young boy is so eager to please that he occasionally gets a bit too excited and appears anxious as he has been untrained. Certainly, he will thrive with routine, stability, and known expectations. Sully is an affectionate, sweet boy, and just wants to make his new family as happy as they've made him.\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

This girl was hairless, emaciated, and suffering. Opal had a tiny patch of hair on her upper back/neck area, the only part of her entire body that contained hair. Her skin was raw, and she had open oozing wounds on her head, likely from scratching. She tested positive for both Sarcops and Demodex.\n\nBut that's where her story changes for the better! She was placed into a loving foster home in Texas where her skin, body, and soul all started to heal. She was treated for the skin conditions and her fur grew back and we could see her beautiful coat and coloring.\n\nOne of the best things Opal had going for her was her great personality through everything! Opal has every reason to hate people, yet she's just the opposite! Opal is not timid and desperately wants someone to give her love to. \n\nOpal has already been through so much and deserves a second chance at finding her forever home! \n\nAdditional video: https://youtu.be/tG6Jp2hF2gw\n\n*HOMEOWNERSHIP REQUIRED & BSL RESTRICTIONS MAY APPLY!*\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

Filling out an application does not obligate you to adopt, but merely begins the process. SEPR DOES adopt out of state!\n\nAdoption fees: All SEPR adoptions are $300 for adults and $400 for puppies 1 year and under.  This includes: adoption fee (spay/neuter, utd vaccinations, micro-chipping), microchip registration, Gentle Leader, and two tie downs for use in your home. \n\nSEPR requires all adopted dogs attend a training class with their adoptive family within 90 days of their adoption. If an adoptive family completes this training class, they will be refunded $100 of their adoption fee with proof of licensed certificate. SEPR even offers an obedience class called Train-A-Bull to alumni over 1 year of age on a seasonal basis.  These classes are currently free!\n\n*All other pets in the residence must be spayed or neutered and all pets up to date on vaccinations.\n\n*SEPR requires all applicants must be 21 years of age.\n\n*SEPR dogs are adopted to be inside the home, \u201cpart of the family\u201d dogs only.\n\n*Families with children 5 years of age and under wanting to adopt puppies will be reviewed on a case by case basis. Raising a puppy properly takes a lot of time, and we understand that in families with small children, time can be a limited commodity.",

He would enjoy someone who is semi retired as he is used to someone home a fair amount.  Children over 8 yrs old.  No apartments. NO crating.\n\nJiggy\nMini Pomeranian\n8 years old\n9 lbs\nMedium Hair\nBrown fur\nMedium energy level\n\nJiggy is a shy but friendly little fella but he MUST have someone who will have patience with him for the first few days.  He has gone through so many changes in a short time, it\u2019s confusing for any dog.  Once he has had some time to adjust with an adopter who will go slow and be patient with him, he will warm up and loves to love!  He is a kisser and a dancer, will give you as many kisses as you\u2019d like and will dance when he\u2019s telling you what he wants.   He also LOVES being spoken to \u2013 he gets so excited and lights right up when someone chats with him.\n\nJiggy can get so excited! Especially if he knows he is going for a walk or a ride.   Jiggy is great on his leash and loves to be your car companion.   He gets along with other dogs and is good with children. He does not seem to interact with another dog, but he loves to run and he just loves knowing another one is around. He loves to play and loves his toys.  \n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:  Jiggy does not like to be cornered or feel trapped.  He gets very anxious and will air snap.  He will come to you when he wants attention or wants to be picked up.  He is not 100% trained and has been tested to check for health issue, must be ok with occasional pee inside.\n\nThis furry little sweetheart is looking for a home with very patient adopters who will take it slow to give him the chance he deserves for his new home.   He is such a delight to have around, once you meet him you won\u2019t be able to resist! \n \nIf Jiggy sounds like the right fit for your home, submit your application at www.ckanimalrescue.com\n\nAdoption fee: $350\n\nJiggy is neutered, is microchipped, up to date with his vaccinations\n",

My 12 year old daughter has named him Dash and he fits right into our busy family.  He still has a lot of puppy energy and is working on his attention span.  He loves kids of all ages but since he is still working on his manners, I feel small babies would not be the best for him.  He gets along with my small dog and totally respects his boundaries.   I have a larger dog the size of him and they love playing.  Dash is kennel trained, follows simple commands, and works hard to please you.  He is working on walking with the leash and he\u2019s also catching on to playing fetch.  He sleeps out of the crate with my daughter at night with no issues and he\u2019s kenneled through the day while we are at school and work.  He tolerates playing dress up and has had a tea party or two with my 6 year old granddaughter.  He loves car rides and going jogging.  If he could have a regular jogging buddy he would be in heaven.  He can jump a chain link fence to go to find someone to play with so needs a tall wooden fence.   Dash is intelligent, fun, loving and obviously very handsome. \n\nAdoption fee for all dogs and puppies is $130.00 each, which includes spay/neuter, vaccinations (including all puppy boosters for puppies under 4 months), worming, flea/tick treatment if needed, microchip and collar/leash/tags.",

When he came to us he was very thin, but has now filled out to a healthy 80 pounds.\n\nThrough it all, Butch is a lover, and is more than happy to kiss you and wag his tail. He will do best in a home without kitties. Butch is looking for a home with a fenced yard. Let's give this guy the happy life he so very much deserves!  \n\nInquiries in Pinellas County please\n\nPlease note, we are not a shelter. We do not have a kennel or facility that you can visit and see all the dogs. Each dog is fostered in an individual home. We do rescue out of our private homes and in our spare time. So, you cannot come visit our dogs until you have gone through the application and interview process and we have contacted you about scheduling a visit.  We do not have set \"hours\" and we answer all calls and emails as quickly as we can.\n",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Izzy. I\u2019m about 2 years old now and still have the energy of a puppy. I would love to have a country home where I have lots and lots of room to run. You see, my foster home lives in the country and we go for walks through her property. I love running around but I come back to her when she calls for me. I would also love a home without other animals. Every time I see a dog, I get really worked up and have to take anxiety medication to be able to calm down. I hope I can find a home that I won\u2019t have to be around other dogs! One of my favorite past times is playing with boxes so I hope you love ordering things online, BOL! I\u2019ll be happy to break down the recycling for you! My foster home is great and has taught me lots of things like ringing a bell to go outside to potty, she taught me to love my crate, and she is also helping me remember that humans don\u2019t usually like me jumping over the back of the couch - I just thought it was faster! I hope I can find my forever home soon and that my forever humans like playing tug and giving me scratches because I love those too!\n\nA local radio station featured me as an adoptable dog so you can check out the video and see how amazing I am, thanks y107! https://www.facebook.com/Y107FM/videos/411950362845075/\n\nFun Facts:\n\nAge (best guess) - 3 Years\nBreed (best guess) - Black Lab\nCurrent Weight - 82 lbs\nDog Friendly - No\nCat Friendly - No\nKid Friendly - No\nPotty Trained - Yes\nCrate Trained - Yes\nLeash Trained - Yes\n\nAll of our adult dogs are current on vaccinations, de-wormed, heart worm tested, spayed/neutered, on monthly preventatives & micro chipped prior to adoption. \n\n*Adoption Fee is $200.00, No out of State Adoptions ,Virtual Home Visits \n Required  \n\n*We do not require fenced yards for all dogs, fenced yards are required based on a dogs needs. *No invisible fences.\n\nIf you would like to meet this dog, please fill out an adoption application at www.unchainedmelodies.org/adopt/\n\nThank you for adopting!",

If there are multiple applications for a dog, after all home checks are done,  the dog is adopted out to the home that is the best fit for that dog.\n \n ******Chicagoland Dog Rescue reserves the right to restrict adoption of a dog to potential adopters who live within a fifty (50) mile radius of Schaumburg, IL *****\n\nHi, my name is Chopper or Chop as my foster Mom calls me!  I was an owner surrender who ended up at the very scary city shelter.  I sat there waiting for my former person to come back to get me, but they never did.  I was pretty skittish when I got to my foster home but now I am settling in nicely.  My foster Mom says I am a real sweetheart!  I think I am a lap dog and will fall asleep with my head in her lap any chance I can get. Because I had a pretty rough start, I would do best in a home without small children or other pets. What can I bring to a new family? Well, I  am crate trained and potty trained and neutered and up to date on all my shots! I have lots of love to give and will greet you always with a wagging tail.  What am I looking for in a new furever home? I would like lots of cuddles and a gentle hand to pet me, a person or people to play and walk with,  and a soft place to lay my head at night. And someone who will do some training with me so I know the boundaries and can fit well into your home!  If you would be interested in meeting me, please fill out a pre adoption application or send an email and my foster Mom will get back to you just as quick as she can!\nXOXOXO-Chop\n\n\n\n\n**The ADOPTION FEE for this pet is $400 which includes getting the puppy/dog up to date on rabies, distemper and bordetella vaccines, fecal test and deworming if necessary, heartworm test, spay or neuter (not including pre-surgical bloodwork) and a microchip. Free access to our weekly training classes is also included for the life of the dog, something no other rescue in the area offers.***",

Below the map is our logo and the link to click on to access adoption forms, contact info or to donate. ALL DONATIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE.\n\n\nAdoption Fee: $75.00\n\nSamson is a busy little fella that is 15 years old and weighs just 7 pounds.  His family was no longer able to take care of him so SCMR agreed to help.\n \nHe does bark for attention and is very loving. Samson just wants to be where he can see his person and be close to them. Sadly he has congestive heart failure and is on two heart medications that he will need to take for the rest of his life: Vetmedin and Enalapril.\n \nSamson was a breed dog and has the number 184 tattoo in his left ear, likely for the breeder to keep track of his breeding history. He has cataracts and has some central vision loss but still has peripheral vision. Due to neglect, he has no teeth. Tooth decay probably contributed to his heart condition. He is also not neutered and has an undescended testicle. His heart condition makes surgery inadvisable.\n \nSamson is being fostered in Chattanooga, TN for the time he has and is being loved and well cared for.  If there is anyone that would like to sponsor his medical care, please send a donation to SCMR. Thank you.\n\n\nNOTE: SCMR DOES NOT adopt to homes with children under the age of 10 years or homes with Electric Fences\n\nOut-of-state adoptions are possible; however, the approved adoptive home is responsible for making the necessary arrangements to pick up their new little one.",

If you have any questions regarding one of our Mastiffs, please read their bio and if you still have questions- drop us an email at info@greatplainsmastiffrescue.org . If you have questions about our adoption procedures, please go to our Pages of Interest on the left hand column under 'Adoption Info.' We answer email inquiries almost immediately-usually always within a few hours and phone calls are returned with 24-36 hours.\n\nGPMR does not have a shelter. All of our dogs are kept in loving foster homes. We must have a completed adoption\napplication on file before meeting any of our mastiffs.\n\nGPMR adopts to the states of Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana and parts of Colorado.\n!!!Any mastiffs being adopted out of the state of Oklahoma require a health certificate to be paid for by the adopter!!!\n\nMeet Greta! This amazing girl was surrendered to a shelter in TX when her owners were not able to care for her anymore. She is 11 years old! It's surprising to us how many senior dogs end up in Rescue. These guys still have so much love to give. Despite her age, Greta is pretty active and enjoys going on walks and playing with the other Mastiffs in her foster home. She is good with kids as well. She's just perfect to us, it's hard to imagine she ended up in a shelter. She is a sweet and happy girl.Greta is safe and loved in one of our 'Hopsice Fosters'. These special foster homes take in the old and terminally ill Mastiffs and keep them as part of their family for whatever time the dog has left. Sometimes that's a few months, sometimes a couple of years. If you are interested in fostering, please contact us! info@greatplainsmastiffrescue.orgSave a Mastiff...Adopt, Foster, Volunteer!",

Her sad eyes follow you as you pass her kennel.\n\nLyla zips around the yard, eagerly chasing toys and  walks well on a leash.  Once she is comfortable with you, she elicits attention and loves to be petted.\n\nHer previous owner indicated she lived in a female household and she prefers that environment. She also is protective of her family and her bark will let you know there are people approaching! Lyla has quickly mastered many behavior cues and eagerly displays them when asked. \n\nLyla is mature girl that is looking for a stable home and one that will allow her to share her love.",

We have been following Brownie's story for some time as she was owned by an elderly man who lost his home and was living on the streets with 4 dogs. Nala's rescued 3 of the dogs so far (the 13 year old mixed breed is still at the shelter waiting for an opening at Nala's). Brownie is spayed, up to date on vaccinations, is very quiet and well behaved. Brownie enjoys the company of other dogs but does not care to play, she is a couch potato and a great companion. She walks well on a leash and is housebroken. Brownie has been thru a lot of changes and she just needs a home to hang her hat in her senior years.\nWe are located in Palm City, FL and we adopt mostly in a 50 miles radius. We always do home visit, and personalized meet and greet, to insure that your new companion will be a great match for your family.\n\n\n",

His highlight of the day is going for walks, eating if course, and being with those that love and care for him. He has quickly taken the staff hearts and voices his opinion a lot. He has some hip issues that may be arthritis. He favors one hip over the other at times. He tested positive for Lyme disease at which he is getting doxycycline for at the moment. There is a beacon of hope in those Rottie eyes of his. \nHe knows there is a place out there for him with a family that will love him for him and see past the old age spots. If you are interested in seeing this guy he will be available to be seen after November 11th.",

That is how she lived for 2 more years, until her owners decided to breed her.  Then, they decided that was too much for them as well!  She was surrendered to the shelter.\n\nAlma never received any training.  She is a happy dog who does not know how to be social with other dogs.  We are suggesting a home with no other pets, as Alma does not know how to behave around them.   \n\nAlma has not had an accident at her foster home since the first couple days she was there.  We are working on leash skills and basic obedience training.\n\nAlma loves to play.  She will chase tennis balls and loves her bones.  Alma takes treats gently.\n\nAlma is up to date on all her shots.   She has been spayed.  She seems very healthy!  She was wormed, and started on monthly heartgard.  She is microchipped.\n\nAlma is smart and responsive to people~!  She wants to say hi to new people,  and see who they are.\n\nIf you are interested in Alma, an application must be processed before you meet her.  References must be checked, and a home visit completed.  If you do not have a fenced in yard (5' please), then you need to demonstrate how she will be exercised.    Please be within a couple hours of N NJ.\n\nAdoption fee is $250.",

Matrix is your man! He will make you feel good. And he will make you feel loved. He's just a GOOD dog. Matrix is a friend to every human he meets. So if you're the type who likes to be social (and when COVID is finally past its peak one day), Matrix will be your perfect co-host-with-the-most! Please give this boy his special chance he deserves at The Good Life. PLEASE SHARE!\n\nAll Breed Rescue NE Foster Group wrote, \"Matrix is a mixed breed senior pup looking for his forever life! He was 'found' but we believe that was probably the original owner. He was said to be 9 years old. He was pulled in October 2019 and has been in foster. He is friendly with people of all ages.\n\nMatrix's likes: HUMANS, The Phillies, snuggling and having a home. Matrix is super loving and affectionate to any person he meets and always greets new people like a true gentleman! He walks well on a leash/harness. Matrix rocks commands and knows 'sit,' 'down', 'lay down,' 'sit down' and 'wait' (this is used for his meals), and 'drop it.' His goofy personality with lots of wiggles is very endearing! He loves to go for walks and is up for adventures, but is also just as content sitting and cuddling on the couch with you. And don't let his size fool you...he likes to give kisses and sit on your lap like a puppy.\n\nMatrix would prefer to be an only pet and cannot be placed with cats. He weighs about 60 pounds and is in good health. He does use apoquel for dermatitis. He had a full senior wellness blood panel done in January. He can be adopted anywhere from Maryland to Maine and transport will be provided. His senior adoption fee is $150.\"\n\nTo adopt Matrix, please email Sarah at sarah@allbreedrescuevt.com with questions or to apply!",

I was rescued a few years back from the Rancho Cucamonga shelter and have lived since then with various dogs, including my  good friend, DJ, a female cattledog mix, and after her, Tiffi, a pretty dalmatian girl.  Now I'm living with a group of small dogs and am so missing my female buddies.   I am good with female dogs and non-dominant male dogs, big and small but love the girls the best.  I am a strong sturdy boy, consistent with my breed, so i do need someone experienced with large dogs but with a bit of training and a lot of love, I could be the most perfect pup.  I am neutered, vaccinated and microchipped so I am ready to go handsome big pup like me?\n\nIf you are interested in meeting me, please contact Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc., by email at dalrescue@sbcglobal.net   Rescue will send you an adoption questionnaire to complete or you can access the questionnaire on line from our website homepage, www.dalrescuesocal.com.  Once Rescue gets back the completed questionnaire, and if it looks like I might be a good fit for you and your family, arrangements can be quickly made for you and your family to come meet me at the kennel where I live.   I love meeting new folks so please, contact Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc. and ask about me, Domino.  \n\nTo learn more about Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc., a 501c3 non-profit charity, and to see all of our available dogs, please visit our website at www.dalrescuesocal.com.

Adults only, too please. \nTino is about 40 pounds and about 3 years old. He has the cutest face and ears to die for. He has also really got his pouty face down pat!\n\nPlease share Tino! He may just be a run of the mill black mutt to some, but to someone special, he will be their best friend and companion for life!",

            "description": "Mellie is a very attractive small hound mix with a white, brown and black coat. Watch her video of Mellie's gay abandon while playing with her doggie friend.\n Mellie can be very anxious at times. In her foster home she enjoys being with us, sleeping on the couch and spending time in the yard. But she is shy of visitors and is sometimes too timid to come back indoors if she feels new people have been in the house. We haven't managed to get her to walk on the leash and would not adopt her to anyone who wants a dog who must. She will require a home with a very secure fenced yard - at least 6 feet, wooden privacy preferred, which touches the ground. She is frightened if she is not in the yard or the house so trips to the park or walks are not for her. She needs to go to someone who will love her as she is even though we do of course hope that she will continue her very gradual confidence building. \nMellie likes the cats and tries to play with them but resigns herself to the fact they may only want to curl up with her - lazy old things that they are!\n Mellie was found as a stray with her puppies in someone's backyard. She had been seen running around the neighborhood and was thought to be abandoned.\n Read more about Mellie on the Independent Animal Rescue website at https://animalrescue.net/dogs/d-15-152/.",

            "description": "Ketch is black, white, and tan with floppy ears, and white under her chin and down the front of her neck. Although she has no tail, she wags her little stump.\n A smart, strong-willed dog, Ketch needs a job to do. Obedience, agility or nosework training would be best. Alternatively, she can be someones running partner (she is very athletic). She does require plenty of exercise, both physical (walks, running, agility) and mental (obedience and trick training, impulse control training). Ketch is highly motivated by food and loves to play with toys, which makes training easier. She can, however, be very stubborn at times, so training her requires some effort. We are currently working on basic obedience training with her (Ketch is a jumper and a very strong puller) and impulse control. We are looking for an experienced dog owner who enjoys dog training and is not intimidated by a challenge.\nKetch loves people, but her high energy level makes her unsuitable for families with young children. Ketch has been introduced to other dogs, but she is, unfortunately, not good with them. She will only be adopted to experienced dog owners that currently do not have any other dogs (and do not plan to add new dogs to their family in the future). She cannot be trusted with cats or other small animals, either. Ketch is currently undergoing behavior modification training, which will hopefully make her reactivity to other dogs less prominent. However, we will still only adopt her to single-dog homes. \nKetch is fully crate- and house-trained. She still has a tendency to chew on inappropriate objects, but providing enough exercise and appropriate chewing items is enough to alleviate this problem. Ketch is healthy, full of energy, and waiting for a patient human who is willing to invest time and energy in her training to help her reach her full potential.\n Ketch was found as a stray and spent several months at a local shelter. While at the shelter, the volunteers spent time working with her, teaching her some basic skills, socializing her in playgroups, and even teaching her to navigate a couple of agility obstacles.\n Read more about Ketch on the Independent Animal Rescue website at https://animalrescue.net/dogs/d-18-050/.",

            "description": "Usagi is an adorable stocky little mixmostly white, with large brown patches and some small, dark polka dots. She is short and muscular with adorable chunky paws. Her big bunny ears usually stand straight up, but sometimes her right ear flops over. Usagi has stunningly gorgeous blue and gold eyes, and a mottled pink and brown nose.\n With her foster family, Usagi is an extremely affectionate little hunk of love. A master of snuggles, she will happily either lie on top of her humans, sprawl out next to them, curl up in the curve of their legs, or smoosh in-between them; big spoon, little spoonshe loves it all. One of her most favorite activities is belly rubs. She will flop onto her back, with paws dangling, and extort all the belly rubs she can. She loves her toys and all food.\nUsagi loves to chase a ball, and can run faster and jump higher/farther than most, which would make her great for any type of agility games and training. She occasionally gets the most adorable zoomies and will race in circles, grab a toy, and buck like a little bronco. She is sooooo endearing and provides endless entertainment.\nUsagi is very smart and eager to please. She has learned Sit, Down, Stay, Up, Roll over, Spin, Lay on your side, Go to your mat, Wait/Hold (for food or when doors open), Leave it, Come, Kennel up (Go to crate), and a few others! Heres one of the tricks she now knows: she can lie down, with treats lined up on her legs and muzzle, and then, when given the Okay cue, she will gobble them up! Usagi generally walks beautifully on a leash. She is a quick study and would likely be happy to learn any trick requested.\nThese are just some examples of Usagis amazing qualities and lovable personality. She is, however, very fearful of new things including dogs and people. She has made progress, but in her forever home Usagi will need a patient pet parent/family who will continue to work with her slowly while she builds confidence.\nUsagi currently lives with a dog and a cat, but as she has not met most other animals well, she will need to be the only animal in her new home. Her very rambunctious playstyle and bullish affection would also likely overwhelm small children. Usagi is getting braver but still needs very slow introductions to new humans. So, she would not do well in a house with lots of visitors or with people who travel a lot.\nUsagi completely melts her foster humans with her sweet, affectionate gaze, the press of one of her meaty little paws, or the smooshing of her blocky head against their cheeks. She will bring boundless love, affection, and laughs to her forever home, and needs loving, caring people to help her feel safe.\nFor more pictures and videos of Usagi (some with the resident and former dogs in her foster home), check out the Instagram handle @dexeducation.\n Usagi came from a local shelter.\n Read more about Usagi on the Independent Animal Rescue website at https://animalrescue.net/dogs/d-18-031/.",

As a curious hound, he likes to get into everything, just like a little (big!) pup. He is doing well learning to live in a home. He needs quite a bit of structure and training yet.  \n\nGus is very prey driven, so he cannot live with cats. He seems to do well with other dogs. He is very loving, and can be clingy to his person.\n\nGus has quite the personality and a thirst for adventure. He is doing great with house and crate training. \n\n\nWe try to limit our travel time for home visits to a two-hour driving range (about 75 miles) from Morganton, NC.\n\nPlease visit http://www.abetterlifeanimalrescue.com/adopt-a-pet.html for an adoption application.\n\nAdoption: $100",

I am neutered, heartworm negative, current on shots, micro-chipped and on flea/heartworm prevention.  I have also had a blood work panel done and a dental.  My adoption is $100. \n\nI was adopted when I was just 10 months old.  Unfortunately, my adopter ended up in prison in 2017 and his elderly mother could not take care of me anymore so she turned me into animal control in 2019.  Good thing I have a microchip because that is how I was saved again and got back to the rescue.\n\nI am kinda noisy and have been known to \u201cbay\u201d (it's a hound thing).  I can not be left alone in the yard because I can dig out and I like to chase cats.\n\nPlease email for an adoption application.\nWe do not adopt out of state.\nDue to many bounced checks, we now require that adoption donations be cash only.  However, if you make a general donation to the organization (not associated with the adoption of a pet) we do accept checks and paypal.  If you are unable to adopt right now, won't you please make a donation to help care for the pets?  THANK YOU!!",

She is the life of the party, with stunning good looks and a sweet pittie personality to match!!  \n\nConfetti is fully housebroken, and would love to live with a calm and respectful dog - she is especially fond of chihuahuas!!  She absolutely adores people, and has been to several adoption events because she is such a social butterfly!\n\nConfetti has a neurological condition that throws off her balance but it affects no other part of her life.  She eats, sleeps, and potties just like other dogs, but she requires a bit of assistance while doing things that involve standing or walking.  She has a special harness that she walks with when outside, and she eats out of a raised feeder (while her foster mom holds her steady).  She needs a boost to get up on the couch, but if her foster mom isn't moving fast enough, Confetti will hoist herself up there!  \nShe is full of confidence and determination, a true testament to the amazing pittie spirit.\n\nConfetti has been going to physical therapy once or twice a week, where she receives laser therapy, walks in the water treadmill, and gets massages.  All of these will help to slow the progression of her condition, and we would like her to continue these sessions after her adoption.  She will also require a home that has very minimal stairs, and that is mostly carpeted.  All of these are to ensure her safety and care. \n\nIf you think you or your family would be a perfect forever match for Confetti, head to rescueapittie.org to fill out our adoption application.",

I know a few commands like sit and come but I am eager to learn more. I am also a patient pup who is very attentive. One of my favorite things to do at PIPH is to run around in the play yard and go on walks! I am a people's dog and I love to be around my two legged friends and I love to play with children. Oh, and I will do just about anything for a treat! Can you help me to find my forever home? \n\nOur adoption fee includes..... \n**All age appropriate vaccines\n**De-wormings \n**Spay or neuter\n**Up to date on prevention \n**Any medical treatment needed \n**Heart worm test for dogs \n**FELV/FIV testing for cats \n**Microchipping\n\n**Due to us being a shelter environment unless stated Differently we do not know if the dogs are house or crate trained. \n\n**All cats are litter box trained\nPlease go to our website to fill out the adoption application.....\nwww.pawsinthepanhandle.com",

We found Deidre alone and scared in a shelter suffering from a horrific skin condition that left her with open, painful wounds. The skin condition was very treatable, and Deidre went straight to our vet for immediate treatment. Deidre is very sweet but a bit timid and shy. Who wouldn't be after suffering for so long? Deidre would do best in a home where someone is home most of the time, or with that special, patient someone willing to work with Deidre on gaining the confidence she needs to be apart from her person. Deidre is up to date on vaccinations and will be spayed prior to joining her forever home. She is great with people of all ages and other dogs and will make a wonderful addition to any family. If you are that special someone for Deidre who can show her that life can be good, that people can be kind and that she is deserving of a happy life, please apply online at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

Weighing just 40 lbs, this little guy likes to carry his toys around, but does shred them to pieces.\n\nMaverick loves to play! He plays hard and runs fast. His favorite game is fetch and he can play it for hours. Maverick is great with people and good with kids. He gets along well with other dogs once properly introduced. He also gets along well with cats and even pigs. \n\nHe is not too submissive or too demanding, but has a calm demeanor. So far his only issue is being reactive on a leash with other dogs and we are working on that.\n\nMaverick is up-to-date on vaccines, neutered, microchipped and being maintained on monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention. He is house-trained and crate-trained. \n\nMaverick has gone through some basic training. He has learned the SIT and DOWN commands and walks well on a leash \u2013 even off leash he walks right beside his foster parents.\n\nMaverick loves to go for car rides and take on new adventures. He recently went to the mountains and enjoyed the snow. He walked through creeks and explored everything.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a new family member who is active and playful, please consider inviting Maverick into your life.\n\nThis dog is currently being fostered as part of Diamonds in the Ruff Canine Rescue. An application is required, along with a home visit and small adoption fee.  Applicants must be at least 21 years of age. **FENCED IN YARD REQUIRED**\n\nPlease visit us on our Facebook page for additional photos, give us a like while you're there! \nhttps://www.facebook.com/diamondsintheruffNC\n\nAll of our dogs are fostered in homes and are INDOOR dogs. We believe all dogs are family members and should be treated as valued members of the household. \n\nPlease review our adoption guidelines for further information on adopting from Diamonds in the Ruff Canine Rescue before submitting an application. www.DITRnc.com.\n\n\n.",

He does best in a home without a lot of vistors or children. Taz loves to chase tennis balls and he especially loves to play with our giant \"\"Jolly Ball.\"\" He would love to have backyard to run around in, but cannot be left alone outside for long periods of time... He will climb out of a fence out of boredom! If you think you might like to meet Taz, give us a call at 530-894-5630.This animal is at the City of Chico Animal Shelter. Please call 530-894-5630",

            "description": "Beamer is a permanent puppy with long, gangly legs and ridiculous, puppy-dog eyes. Beamer is such a goofball and is looking for the peanut butter to his jelly.\n\nBeamer is very food/treat motivated and will obey if he knows he is going to get a treat. He knows all the basic commands (sit, down, shake, stay) as well as \"High Five\". We have taught him to \"Find it\" which is his favorite indoor game. We make him stay as we walk around with a treat in hand touching numerous surfaces to leave the scent; once we place the treat \"hidden\" somewhere, we let him smell our hand and then tell him to \"Find It\". It is really fun watching him go from place to place trying to find the treat.\n\nBeamer enjoys daily walks and being active. He would be a fantastic running partner or hiking companion for any Coloradan. Just like any dog, if Beamer is left unstimulated (mentally or physically), he can become destructive. Weve learned Beamer loves hard chew toys, like antlers, nylabones, and Kongs.\n\nBeamer is fully house-trained and has to wait to poop or pee while on a walk until he gets home. He ALWAYS waits until we get home and has \"his spot\". He's never had any accidents in the house.\n\nOur beloved Beamer is a graduate of Golden Heart Canine's board and train program, which means he's got mad skills. He is still a giant puppy and clumsy, but at least he's got skills. In board and train, he learned to walk properly on a leash, learn patience (which may have been the hardest part for him), and how to be around other dogs without being uncontrollable. His forever home will need to continue to reinforce these skills.\n\nBeamer is one of our Single Shamrocks. A #SingleShamrock is a dog who needs to be the only dog in the home, so no other pets and children older than 13 years old. If you're interested in FOSTERING or ADOPTING him, please complete an application here: http://2babrescue.org/adoption-application\n\n*BSL Restrictions may apply.\n\nTo see video's of Beamer's board & train program, please see below.\n\n\n\tBeamer Video 1 https://photos.app.goo.gl/X2gN3Zkt2smVm2Jc7 \n\tBeamer Video 2 https://photos.app.goo.gl/3Jk5vYNWjrwmh3uB6\n\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

Rescued by a humane officer she sat in a kennel for 4 years languishing without hope. Finally, a gentleman looked past the bars of her cage and saw the kindness this pup desired to share. He adopted her and together they lived for many years. However, her person had surgery moved away to be with family and could not take Benga with him, so surrendered her to another kennel. We knew this kennel would be the end for this 10 year Pocket Pit, so we have intervened with the mission to find her a home. Benga is a little overweight but energetic, loyal and sweet companion, who loves car rides, walks in the park and just cuddling next to you for some quiet time. She is house broken, vaccinated and spayed - waiting for someone to share her love with again. LOOKING FOR QUIET SINGLE NO KIDS OR OTHER - SHE WILL STEAL YOUR HEART BUT IS A ONE ON ONE SWEETHEART.  PLEASE CONSIDER ADOPTION she really is a beautiful girl. Homeowners, CONTACT THE FOSTER CARE PERSON FOR ANY INFO @ DEB 216 225 5526.",

She is well trained and knows all her commands, walks good on a leash and crate trained. She is very curious, gets excited easily and gives lots of kisses. Dora loves to go on walks, have her belly rubbed, roll around, take naps and show off playing with her toys. She also loves treats and water although not the best swimmer. Dora can be fearful of strangers and other dogs but warms up and is the sweetest, loving girl.\nDora\u2019s family moved out of state and was unable to take her with them. She is currently in foster care looking for her forever home. Dora would do best being an only dog. She has alpha tendency.\n***  If you would like to meet sweet Dora, please email for an adoption application, adopt@valleydogs.org.\n",

I work on the sites everyday and keep them updated.  Be sure to add us to your contact list on email or we could be trying to email you and it could go to spam.\nCourtesy ShyLow (Shiloh) came to us September of 2018 at 7 months old. So we made her birthdate on Valentine\u2019s Day. She loves her humans and loves snuggles. She loves to jump up and give hugs. She likes to lick your hand as you walk with her. She is a free roamer and has not been leash trained. Although the few times she\u2019s used one she does good. She is crate trained (sleep in crate all night) and house trained. For being almost 2 she is very energetic. She has not been around cats, livestock or small children so not sure how she will do with them. She gets along wonderfully with my 12 & 19 year old sons. She loves her dog brothers but is jealous of her dog sisters. She has become aggressive to the other two female dogs in the home. So she must be an only female or only dog. Her brothers are smaller and larger than her and has not had issues with any of the three. \u2022She is a fixed Female Boxer/ Shepherd mix. \u2022She is chipped. \u2022She is vaccinated. \u2022Flea & Tick preventives. \u2022Heart worm preventives. \u2022Eats dry dog food \u201cPedigree Complete Nutrition Adult Dog Food\u201d Adoption fee $85\nWe are foster based only (No shelter) you can't just drive up here and get a pet.

I will also chase and harm a cat. I need a home with a single woman who is willing to build my character and my faith in people. If you would like to adopt me just because I have beautiful eyes I am not for you. With my personality, you will have to look past my looks and find my real personality.\n\nI am quirky and funny when I am comfortable. I love water and love to dig.

They are now neutered and are ready to find a new home.  \n\nThey are a bit fearful but very sweet.  Wouldn't you like a little beagle to cuddle with?",

The staff there liked him so much that when no owner turned up to claim him, they asked us to save him.\n\nTahoe has been friendly from the first day. He is somewhat reserved, but very affectionate and really enjoys human attention. Tahoe should be fine with older kids; his size and activity level would overwhelm toddlers. We think Tahoe would be best as an only dog in a home. He has plenty of energy and he loves to run, so if his owner was in to jogging that would be a plus. Tahoe is a good watch dog; he is not a digger or chewer. \n\nOur vet thinks Tahoe was probably born in 2015. He is crate trained, but would prefer a home where he does not need to be crated on a regular basis.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Bette grew up on a small farm guarding goats, and when her elderly owner could no longer take care of the farm, the goats were sold and Bette was surrendered to us. She is a very sweet girl who is perfectly safe with goats and chickens, but she has decided that she prefers living inside the house. She is house/potty-trained and crate-trained.\n\nBette gets along well with other dogs of all sizes, and is playful with most dogs. She loves people but isn't annoying about asking for so much attention that she seems needy.\n\nBette DOES need secure fencing, and if you leave her outside unattended too much, she may get bored and try to dig under or climb over the fence. The best solution (other than 6' or taller fencing) -- just don't leave her in the yard and ignore her. Make her part of your family, whether that's inside the house or when you're enjoying your back yard.\n\nNOTE: You'll see one close-up photo of Bette with stitches on her muzzle. When she was still living in the pasture as a livestock guardian, she showed up one day in a different pasture (still on our property) and she had a cut on her muzzle. We believe she got the cut from digging under the fence, but it's possible she snagged it going over rather than under. Either way, that was our cue to move her from the pasture to the house.\n\nOverall, Bette is a great dog and easy to have around. If she sounds like the perfect companion for you, please read about our adoption process and requirements, and submit your application on our website at www.bluebonnetrescue.org/info/adoption.",

She is a total goofball, looking for a family that loves to play, laugh, and be silly!! We would love to get Cheese back into a home. She is up to date on her shots and spayed.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Name - Will\nNicknames - None\nAge - Adult\nWeight - 50 lbs\nOther dogs - Great with dogs Very playful and loving\nCats - could live with dog savvy cats under supervision as he will chase if given the opportunity. But can co-exist under supervision.\nChickens - No\nKids - kid friendly\nBackground - Will is one of 5 dogs we flew down from a shelter up north. He came into the shelter as a stray and so not much about his history before the rescue is known\nHealth issues - He trembles when he is nervous, mostly in his back leg. He gets stiff if he lays down too long - mostly in the colder weather. He takes daily medication to help with the joint stiffness\nCrate trained - Is not a fan of the crate and does have separation anxiety. He is best left out with his doggy sibling and only for short periods of time\nLeash trained - Mostly yes with room for improvements\nHousebroken - Is used to using a doggy door and have the ability to go outside whenever he chooses\nEating Habits - Very Good. Not picky. Does not beg for table food.\nCommands known - Sit, Stay, Wait. Very smart when he figures out what you want\nCar rides - Good. Not nervous, likes to look out window. Uses harness seat belt\nBath time - Not his favorite activity\nAffectionate - Very loving and follows you everywhere. Loves to have his head scratched and belly rubbed\nActivity level - Due to the stiffness in joints low to medium. Short walks are good and he likes to zoomie in the backyard. Perfect for a couch potato who wants to cuddle\nPlay style - Push/pull style with foster sister but ultimately more submissive. Loves chewing on bones and learning how to play fetch. When relaxing, he cuddles and sleeps with foster sister and likes to groom her\nBad habits - Separation anxiety, which is improving. He must be left in a larger contained area (not a crate, think baby gated room) with access to outside for potty. Only bones or appropriate toys left out so he does not chew on anything he's not supposed to. Oh and he dunks his whole face in the water bowl so be prepared for a little slobber\n\nRedeeming qualities - Very loving and just wants to be near you. Eager to please and very trainable. Doesn't bark at other dogs but does like to \"talk\" to you when he gets excited\nBest feature - Has little black eyebrows and a black mustache. One ear that stands up and one that folds over. Has a very soulful face that makes you think that he has been through a lot. He's an old soul. Likes to put his face between the chair cushion and armrest and gets this squishy face and pitiful eyes that just make you want to do anything for him. He's very willing to learn. Only took 3 times of putting his food bowl in front of him and telling him to \"wait\" and now he does and looks to me for the \"ok\". Knows the negative \"uhh uhh\" sound and stops doing whatever he is doing and focuses on you. Example: we have an Alexa Show and one time I was checking on him when I was gone and he had gotten into something and I gave the \"no\" sound, and though he couldn't see me, just hearing me made him stop what he was doing!\n\nWhat Foster Mom/Dad wants you to know -\n\"Will came to us with a very strong will and wanting to do what HE wanted to do, I think this was a survival attitude that he had to have just to survive, being a stray. With lots of patience and work and letting him learn what it means to be a dog, he is finally giving us the authority to take care of him. Is he still stubborn? Yes. Does he still have separation and barrier anxiety? Yes. But, the most important thing about Will is that he is improving so much and we can see that he has a lot to give to the right people. He tries, REALLY tries to do the right thing. He is very smart and learns things quickly. He loves to be your shadow and follow you from room to room and let you know that he does it because he loves you. It's his way of showing it. He is playful and good with our other dog. He snuggles up with her in the same doggy bed and will groom her and just lay down. He has quiet times where he likes to just lay on his bed and he sleeps through the night out of the cage and without people in the room (another thing he has learned!). I love that he doesn't bark when people come over or when the neighbor's dogs come to the fence. He does let me know by becoming alert that he heard something outside or the Ring doorbell went off! Will will win your hearts and soul, and with the time, training, and patience, he is really going to be an extraordinary dog!\"\n\nPlease consider sponsoring Will with either a one-time or monthly tax-deductible donation.

            "description": "Meet Rufus.\n\nRufus is an approximately 5 year old American Bulldog mix who was an owner surrender.  Rufus is a sweet guy with a proud strut.\nWe joke that he is the John Wayne of dogs, with his swagger. \nHe likes attention but has his cute little \"pretend\" aloofness. \nHe is great on a leash, enjoys exploring but also likes to just chill and enjoy the outdoors. He seems 100% housebroken. \nRufus ignores most dogs, but no cats, small dogs (or squirrels!!) for Rufus. He would LOVE a fenced in yard! \n\nRufus would work best in a home where someone is home during the day. He prefers hanging out with his person and/or family (he even prefers to sleep in the bed room with his peeps, too!) Rufus would probably be just fine with another dog of his approximate stature, with proper decompression and slow, supervised introductions, of course.\n\nIf interested in meeting Rufus please fill out an adoption application on our website.  https://www.guardiansfortheanimalsofohio.org/adoptionapplication",

Step two will email or call and answer and ask a few questions. Step three set up a time to meet the dog at Tails of Rescue Store (981 Lake Blvd Redding CA) will be meeting OUTSIDE only.  All of our animals our in foster care at night.  We do at times use the store as daycare to keep everyone friendly with each other so not adding people not fostering into the store.  This is very different than how we have ever done adoptions so we might have a few hiccups here and there. \n\nHaylee is a 4-year-old female lab blend.  She has lived on a property with horses and other dogs.  NO cats!  Walks a little strong on a leash, but getting better.  The reason we have Haylee is she would see the gate open and run, but would always come home.  At the foster home, she is doing well staying in the fenced area with fencing and electric fence.  She does fine going to the store each day.  OVERWEIGHT due to sneaking puppy food.  \n\nHaylee is spayed, chipped, heartworm negative, current on shots, kennel cough, and rabies.  Applications can be filled out at tailsofrescue.org underdog application.\n\nIf interested in the store Tuesday-Friday-Saturday from 9-12.  We are NOT a first-come-first to adopt a rescue, the best fit for the family and dog is the way we do things.  Adoption fee is $218 Spayed, Chipped, Heartworm, current on shots, and kennel cough\n\nWelcome to fill out an application at tailsofrescue.org under dog application to get things going. We do out of town adoptions often, but will not ship animals must come to Redding for pick up.",

            "description": "* PLEASE READ ENTIRE BIO* This dog has medical issues and you need to understand them before applying for him\n\nMeet Dustin Dingo, a dachshund/beagle mix who is approximately 12-14 years old & a refined old gentleman. He likes to take his time to smell the roses! He loves cuddling and taking afternoon naps on the sofa! Dustin is good with other dogs and loves to walk around his surroundings! He is currently being cage trained and is doing well! He also is learning to potty outdoors, but must wear a diaper inside to prevent accidents. He has a lot of anxiety but his foster family is working with him and he is slowly feeling more comfortable with others and starting to show affection! Dustin speaks to his foster family by grunting & barking for attention. After all he is mostly doxie & we all know they demand to be the center of our universe.\n\nDARE sprung Dustin from the shelter because he was in dire need of lots of medical attention which the shelter was not able to handle and we could not turn our back on this sweet fellow. We had the vet check him all over particularly regarding his renal hernia. The vet does not recommend surgery for it because at his age it would be difficult for him to recover. Dustin also has epilepsy which is being controlled with medication. Plus he recently had a dental, so his breath is nice and fresh. At his age, he has the usual diminished sight & hearing. Even with all this Dustin remains to be a very sweet boy.\n\nDustin is a special needs little guy and will need a family who is patient, caring & understanding of his abilities.\n\nIf you know that I am your forever dog please fill out an application at: https://daretorescue.org/adoption-application.html **Please don't forget to put my name on your application!\n\nIf you can not adopt me but would like to help DARE pay for my care while I am in their care you can donate online http://daretorescue.org/donation.html\nor send check or money order made payable to DARE to:DAREPO BOX 21161\nTAMPA, FL 32210\nYou can also contact us at info@DAREtoRescue.org\nEven if you do not see a dog that matches what you're looking for, you may fill out a no obligation application and we will work to find a match for you. We receive dogs into foster care almost daily, so it is impossible to have every available or soon-to-be-available dog on the website.\n1/17/21 2:04 PM",

            "description": "J.P. is an 9 lb Chihuahua who was brought in as a stray and estimated to be 10-12 yrs. young. This old man loves a sunny window, an occasional scrambled egg, and a little meander around the backyard. J.P. has extremely limited vision and will need a quiet home with no small children. Due to his vision and age he is easily startled by quick movements and has trouble in low-light situations. He expresses his fear by growling but as a toothless guy hes harmless. J.P. has recently started experiencing seizures and is now on medication that he takes a few times a day. He goes outside on a regular bathroom schedule but wears a belly band in the house to catch his senior moments. J.P. does not like the fuss of getting his \"pants\" off and on and he is not shy in expressing his annoyance, so shared walls of apartment living are not for him! J.P. prefers to leave playful rough housing to the younguns; however, he currently lives with another older, small, low-key chihuahua and might be comforted by the presence of another senior dog-friend. J.P. likes to know you're there if he needs ya, but prefers to relax alone in his bed, in front of the heater, or in his favorite sunny spot on the floor! The perfect home for J.P. will be one with a sense of humor, patience, and the desire to make sure this old man has everything he needs in his golden years!\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for J.P. is $200, which is TAX DEDUCTIBLE, and goes toward providing supportive services to animals in the home, as well as the high cost of vetting our animals in rescue. If you would like to welcome J.P. into your home, please begin by submitting our adoption application. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver. If you would like to learn more about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue, or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com. We invite you to visit our Facebook Page, and when you visit, please don't forget to Like our Facebook page so that you wont miss any information about our animals and events!",

He quickly made himself at home and has been such a great sport throughout his surgery and recovery. He was always super excited for our vet visits and got gold stars each time. He can be a pretty active boy and enjoys playing ball, running, swimming and getting outside any chance he can. But he also enjoys his sleeps, even through the loudest of thunderstorms he dreams and snores so sweetly. He's always ready for snuggles and is okay with whatever snuggle style preferred. As long as he's near you he's a happy boy. He is potty trained and crate trained, although some yummy snacks are key to getting him in there. He has shown interest in other dogs while out and absolutely loves to see his neighbor friends and walking buddies who are 2 tiny rat terriers. He isn't much of a barker and greets everyone at the door with great enthusiasm. Neptune has been such an amazing edition to our home and we know he will make someone very very happy very soon. He is an absolute joy. To contact his foster, email sonia.n.segura@gmail.com",

Her favorite types of toys are the ones that involve trying to get treats out of them, she loves the challenge! An active owner who wants to play with her is exactly what she needs. She should go home as the only pet in the household so she can have all the attention to herself. Coco needs an adults-only home where she can frequently be let outside as she has a history of bladder issues. A bathroom break every 6-8 hours is perfect. After adoption, Coco will have access to free training consultations with a certified trainer at North Shore Animal League America to help acclimate her to her new home!",

Problem is he is so shy-standoffish-aloof-afraid of people it will take him some time to adjust.\nThey Good Bad and Ugly\nGood\nPotter has proven over and over that he is good with other dogs. Big, med. small they all seem to be good with him if not too pushy but he will adjust to most dogs even if they stick a nose where it does not belong.\nIgnores the kitty in his foster home.\n\nFood motivated but not just any food it is your food. Fries, low sodium tortilla chips,(he does not want to retain water and look plump)\nPretty sure he would not care about a cat but we can test to be sure. Loves to curl up in a soft bed. Barks if someone is at the door even if they have French fries.\nBad\nPotter seems to prefer dogs over people. He will likely NOT be a lap dog. Best he can offer with time is to sit WITH YOU but not ON YOU.\nUGLY\nPotter does not care or men. He has been known not to go outside to pee if it is rainy or cold\n\nP\n\nCome see this pup on Saturdays during adoption event hours. Please email Linda at lbredfire@sbcglobal.net or call WT&F's Dog Team voicemail 707-812-9030 to get a jump on the process, ask questions, and/or to confirm they will be there. Dog adoptions are held outside Napa Petco every Saturday - 12:30pm to 4:00pm.\nThis dog comes spayed/neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, dewormed, heartworm tested negative, and more with an adoption fee/donation to Whiskers, Tails and Ferals in Napa, CA.

An adult only home would be perfect for him.\n\nMarley is currently residing and being trained with Blue Dog Ranch.  He is getting prepared for his new furever home.  Please consider him as a new family member.  Ask for updates. (6/23/2020)\n\nMarley is a 12-yr old, frosted gray muzzled senior.  He is a cancer survivor that now is in need of a new home.  Marley is neutered, up to date on all his vaccinations.  He weighs 43 lbs. and is healthy.\n\nHe has been with the same family his whole life but circumstances have changed in the home where there are now a lot of children and now they are unable to keep him with them.  A family friend is able to foster him but, unfortunately, only for a short time \n\nHe is calm, sweet and not an aggressive dog but he doesn't like noise and overstimulation.  He tends to retreat from kids and other dogs.  He is fearful of bikes and skateboards.  Due to his nervousness and anxiety, it would be best if he would be in a home with no children or other animals.\n\nMarley has a beautiful soul and he's just trying to find his way in life like so many of us are.  He is in need of a caring long-term foster or a  long-term \"I Love You Forever\" home.\n\nIf interested in learning more about Marley please inquire via \"Ask About Marley\"\n\n\n\n\n",

This girl was urgent at SBC in October of 2019 for a broken wrist that was surgically repaired, and she's been with Cause for SB Paws ever since, waiting for her forever home.\nThree to four yr old Kali is a big girl at about 60 lbs. She seeks a home where she can be the center of attention, go on long walks on the beach (or street) at sunset, and just be loved. She doesn't require much - a yard, a warm lap, a couch to snuggle on...Kali would do best as an only pup or a home with another large breed male, and has plenty of love to give! She loves all people including small ones (kids).\nCould you open your home to sweet Kali?\n\nApply here: http://www.causeforsbpaws.org/forms/form?formid=3251\n\nEmail cause4sbpaws@gmail.com with questions.",

GSROC could not bear the thought of this beautiful girl alone and on her own.\n\nShe is approximately 3 years old and has a quiet nature. She is quiet and somewhat unsure around strangers right now. Jessie is not sure exactly what has happened to her and she is uncertain.\nRecently we introduced Jessie to some cats. She let us know in no uncertain terms that she is not a fan of felines! Due to her reaction, we believe she would do best in a home with no small dogs or cats.\nWe are just getting to know Jessie and will update her profile shortly.\n\nPlease go to our website and complete an adoption application at:\n\n/https://www.gsroc.org/application/\n\nAn adoption counselor will contact you to go over your application and assist you in determining which dog may be best for your particular situation.\n\n1/28/21 10:13 PM",

While he is not overly dog aggressive, it is clear he needs to belong to someone that can give him special attention and understands Dobermans.. AK has recovered...all ailments treated BUT he is heartworm positive and is awaiting treatement.  AK will be available for adoption once treatment is completed. AK very easily learns new routines and can be affectionate. AK hates going into the rain!",

But we think he would do best in a kid free and dog free home. He does not do well with cats.  He would do best with someone who is around most of the time.  He is a sweetheart that just wants to be snuggled up next to his human. Any one interested in him will need to make multiple visits with him to make friends.  Ruger requires at least a 4 foot fence.\n\nRuger is 6 years old.  His current weight is 80 pounds.\n\nThe minimum donation for Ruger is $450.00. This includes all of his vetting. If you are interested in Ruger, please fill out an online application through our website. \n\nWe are currently only open by appointment only. Due to the recent pandemic, we are looking at the safety of our volunteers that are there to take care of the dogs. Only serious inquiries will be considered.  \n\nThen meet him at the shelter during adoption hours on Saturdays and Sundays 10 - 2pm. All members of the household need to meet the dog you are interested in. Vet records for any current or previous pets need to be provided. If all goes well, a home visit will be done prior to adoption.",

            "description": "I have been sponsored. Thank you Jackie Mabe for sponsoring me in December. \nBissell is a pretty lab shepherd mix who was transferred to us from a municipal shelter. She's curious and attentive and likes to get out and go for walks. She does not seem to be a fan of other dogs, she wants all the attention. We think she is about 3-5yrs old. She can also climb a fence...her new family will need to be prepared for that. This girl LOVES people and her sweet personality outweighs all her \"\"challenges\"\". Her new family will need to be patient and help her adjust to life on the outside! We think shes best suited to be in a home with kids 8 yrs of age and over.\n\nDogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Our cat test should be used as a general purpose screening only to rule out overt aggression; we always recommend caution when introducing dogs to cats in the home. Recommendation on suitability of placement with children by their ages is based on behavioral observations including energy level and response to body handling. We never recommend leaving young children unsupervised with dogs, and we cannot guarantee the behavior of dogs with children, other pets or cats. Behavior evaluations should be considered as a snapshot of the behavior of the dog at this point in time; SCPR believes all dog families need to be prepared to invest time and energy into training as well as provide common sense management of their new dog. We always encourage family to do some research on the breeds or mixes of breeds prior to adoption as many can have some unique characteristics that may or may not fit into their families. For more information about this dog or any others at our Shelter, please visit www.doitforthedogs.com. We are the Second Chance Pet Rescue in Grove, OK. 918-786-7630. You can email us at doitorthepets@gmail.com.",

            "description": "Little Bit, who is being fostered in Richmond, VA, is 10 years old. He is an extremely sweet and loving Peke who wants/needs to be close to his family. Little Bit is blind due to cataracts and retinal issues. He has been evaluated by a veterinary ophthalmologist but is not a candidate for corrective surgery. He is on eye drops to reduce inflammation and his adoptive family will need to continue this medication throughout his life. Little Bit can be left alone for short periods, but do not be surprised if he is barking to try to find you! He does have a bit of anxiety when left alone, but once you walk back in the house, he will be excited you are home!\n\nLittle Bit is house trained. He is good at going up the stairs but never down, so he will need your help going downstairs. Because he prefers to be with his human, he will stay outside with you as long as you like. Once he is comfortable with the area, he will wander around on either hard-scape or grass. A fenced yard is important so Little Bit can learn his boundaries while still able to roam, which he likes to do on occasion. Little Bit likes to play with chew toys (prefers squeaky), loves treats (he is very gentle when taking them) and belly rubs, but mostly to just be with you! Being blind he can get defensive around other dogs if they bark or growl. One of his favorite things to do is just sit with you while you have your morning coffee or tea. He does not mind baths but does not care for getting his hair brushed or his feet trimmed. This sweet boy is ready to take on a new chapter in his life where he can enjoy the simple things and the ability to relax with his favorite person/people.\n\nIf you are interested in more information or in adopting Little Bit, please fill out an application to adopt. http://www.potomacpekes.org/onlineapplicationadopt.htm. We accept applications from Virginia, Maryland, District of Columbia, and areas close by. We require a vet check and a home visit. Previous experience with Pekes is always a plus! Little Bit\u2019s adoption fee is $250.00.\n\n",

Bilateral hip dysplasia & arthritis\n\n\nDomino is another a local owner surrender.  Domino, (aka - Dom, aka - Baron von Domino), is a 7 year old Great Dane x Mastiff.  He is your typical gentle giant who loves nothing more than to sit on your lap and hang out on the sofa.  Dom exhibits many of the stereotypical Dane traits and is an expert leaner and can back right up to any unattended lap.\n\nDomino had a condition called \"Cherry Eye\".  His 3rd eyelid had been prolapsed & inflamed for many years and required surgical intervention by a veterinary eye specialist.   He also had a small eyelid tumor on the same eye\nas well as a mass on his shoulder.  We are happy to announce that Dom had his surgeries performed  August 2019 and has healed wonderfully!\n\nRecently Domino has been diagnosed with bilateral hip dysplasia and he also does have arthritis in his joints.  Currently he has responded very well to his new medication (Metacam & Cartrophen injections) and is now eating a special prescription food to help with his mobility.  Domino has his consultation with a board certified orthopedic surgeon as well as a neurologist regarding his hips & gait.  Unfortunately Dom is not a surgical candidate for a total hip replacement or a femoral head osteotomy (FHO) due to his size and the risk of implantation failure.\n\nWhat does that mean in future?  Domino will require daily medication lifelong.  He has been doing very well on his combination of Metacam, Gabapentin and monthly Cartrophen injections and is still the same happy loving boy he was when he arrived to our program.   \n\nDomino's retirement home needs to be in a quiet household with NO stairs.  He is also not suited for apartment/condo living.  He loves going for walks but they do need to be short (15 minutes or less) and his new family needs to be able to restrict Dom's activity.\n\nDom does get along great with the other dogs in the home (ranging from medium-giant breeds) and has grown up with children.  With that being said at this time we will be in search of a home WITHOUT young kids or pets due to Domino's hip dysplasia.\n\nWhat is Domino's favourite thing to do?   CAR RIDES!  As his activity now has to be restricted we take him on more car rides than long walks.  He loves nothing more than to hop into the back seat and hang his head out the window to say hi to passersby and to thank the ladies at the Tim Horton's drive thru for his Timbits.  \n\nPlease note that Dom has a fear of being alone in an enclosed space due to accidentally getting stuck in a small bathroom.  Thus far we have not been able to have him comfortable being in a crate but he does very well free range in the home.\n\nThis gentle giant sure enjoys going for car rides but most of all he LOVES snuggling with you on the couch.  He can be a bit of a picky eater but can easily be enticed with some fresh steamed veggies mixed in with his kibble.  \n\nIs Domino the love bug you have been waiting for?

Charlie's owners left behind over 20 dogs so many were not socialized. Charlie is sweet, but very unsure of new people. He will need an owner that can sit and let Charlie come to him. Charlie appears to be house trained but he will need consistency in a new home. His most favorite thing in the world is chasing the tennis ball. He will play fetch for hours. Charlie will need to go to a home that has a 6 ft privacy fenced in yard. \n\nFor more information: adopt@spcaesttx.com\nFor adoption: www.spcaeasttx.com",

I am a little afraid of new people and need a little extra time to warm up. Treats help when meeting me and I hope you don't mind taking it slow. I will melt into your lap once we're friends! I am looking for a quieter adult only home where I can get lots of attention. I've been with BHS for a while now, and I hope my person will come along soon. I get along with some dogs with slow introductions and I am willing to try to make new friends! I have not been tested with cats and my ideal home would be one with a yard that has space for me to run and play. Come meet me at the Dog Adoptions Center today!",

When she was barely a year old, she was found wandering around East Texas skinny, pregnant and heartworm positive to top it off.  The shelter was going to kill her and her unborn babies, but Nana could not let that happen.  So Genavieve stayed with a nice lady that helped her have her puppies, Now that all of her puppies have homes, Genna needs a home of her own too.  She still thinks that she's  a puppy herself. She is extremely playful and very loving.   Genna is particular about her other dog friends.  She is good with most other dogs, but will not tolerate being bullied by another dog.  For this reason, Nana's requires an in  depth testing with any resident dogs prior to adoption approval.  Genna is free of Heartworms and healthy.  Won't you give this loving little pittie a chance at a new life?\n",

            "description": "**Update**  (3/4/2020)  Becca met a potential adopter today, but she was so scared and withdrawn since she was unfamiliar with the surroundings.  She will need an adopter who is able to see the amazing girl that she can be.  Becca is very comfortable in her foster home so we didn't realize how withdrawn she would be when meeting new people.   We will be working on providing Becca with more opportunities for socializing to help her gain confidence.   IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH BECCA AND ARE ABLE TO FOSTER OR ADOPT HER (and live in the Leb/Lanc/Hbg area of Central PA), PLEASE EMAIL US AT AngelsAmongUsRS@live.com.   (12/27/19)   Becca is doing great in her foster home, but she deserves to have her own family!   Please take a look at our beautiful girl!  (10/23/19)   Becca arrived at our rescue a few weeks ago to be treated for HW.  BUT.....she was tested again by our rescue vet....and Becca was found to be HW Negative!!!!   So she is ready to find a family of her very own.   Becca is a small mix....maybe Lab and not sure what else....weighs about 35 lbs.   She is a beautiful jet black girl who appears to be 8-9 years old.   Becca LOVES people and is fine around other dogs unless food is involved.   She apparently had to fight for her food in the past, and as a result Becca does show food aggression.   But take food out of the equation, and she is the sweetest girl!   Becca will need a patient owner who is willing to allow her time to settle in to a new environment.   IF YOU LIVE IN THE LEB/LANC/HBG/YORK AREA  AND WOULD LIKE TO MEET HER TO FOSTER OR ADOPT, PLEASE EMAIL AngelsAmongUsRS@live.com.",

Here are 10 things he wants his new family to know about him:\n\n1.\tI am a Bullmastiff, and I am about 4 years old. \n\n2.\tI didn\u2019t have a great life before rescue, so I can be very shy and timid with new people.  I sometimes bark at them, but only because I\u2019m afraid.  My new home will need to continue working with me to help me learn to trust humans again.\n\n3.\tMy ideal home would be with an adults-only family that doesn\u2019t have many visitors to the house.  New people are scary to me, and when I\u2019m afraid, I am not my best self. \n\n4.\tI live with a female Cane Corso, and she\u2019s my bestie.  It would be nice to find a home with a large, confident, and easy going female that I could be friends with.\n\n5.\tI haven\u2019t had much experience with small dogs since I came to The Bullpen, so I don\u2019t know how I would feel about living in a home with them.\n\n6.\tI haven\u2019t met any cats since leaving the shelter, so I\u2019m not sure how well I would do in a home with felines.\n\n7.\tThe words that best describe me are shy, watchful, and sweet.\n\n8.\tI like to hang out with my Corso friend, sunbathe, and of course, EAT!\n\n9.\tI am housebroken, good on a leash, and I know how to use a dog door!\n\n10.\tI am fully vaccinated, heartworm negative, neutered, and microchipped. \n\nReady to give Keen the forever home of his dreams?  Fill out our Adoption Application, located at www.bullpenrescue.org under the 'work with us' tab.\n\nWe highly recommend that our potential adopters fill out an online application as soon as possible, as it greatly expedites the process of finding the right dog for your situation.  \n\nOur dogs are available for adoption nationwide but preference is given to adopters willing to do an in-person meeting.  Please understand that our dogs are not adopted on a first-come, first-serve basis, but rather we strive for a \"perfect placement\" so we know that they will not be failed again.\n",

I lived with an elderly woman and 20+ dog companions, but she couldn't take care of us anymore so we had to go the shelter.All my small dog friends were adopted, but no one took me. I was so sad and had to stay in the shelter for a long time. I was about to be euthanized, but then my foster mom rescued me!\n\nI haven't been around people much so I'm a little nervous at first, but I really love snuggling with my foster mom and being with her all the time! I'm not quite sure what to think of kids, so I'd prefer to live in a home with all grown-ups. I get along well with my canine foster sister, but Mom says I probably shouldn't live with cats because I scare our cat when I try to play with hershe's just so fun I can't help chasing her!\n\nI know I'll make a great companion for someone. I'm super good when I'm in the houseeven when I'm left alone! I'm house trained and don't mess with any of my foster family's stuff. I'm pretty quiet too. I'm calm and love to relax with my family inside the house, but when I go outside to play I can really runand jump over things too! Mom says I'm \"agile\".I'm even learning to walk on a leash! If you're looking for someone to be your loyal companion, I'm the one! Please consider me. I still have lots of years of love to give and will be so grateful to share them with you.\n\nBiography\nHi!

            "description": "Rocky is an adult male American Bulldog, about 7 years old.  He is up to date on all his shots, neutered, and in overall good health.\n\nBehaviorally, Rocky is a true American Bulldog.  Hes got a strong body and a strong mind, & also loves to open up & get affection from his people.  He is larger than most small children & he is not the most mindful of his size & strength, so we recommend no small children for him. \nRocky has shown that he loves having a large yard to run & exercise himself in, he loves to chew on toys & bones, & will do anything for a yummy snack. He is fully house trained & does great alone & spending time in his crate relaxing. His absolute favorite thing is the water! He loves to play with hoses/sprinklers & even swims when he can! Rocky is a big boy full of unique personality & he is still hopeful on his search for his forever home!\n\nApply directly for Rocky at the link below!\n\nhttps://pitofoursoulsrescue.com/our-dogs/adoption-application/",

I was rescued from Animal Services and I'm thankful C.A.R.L. is giving me the chance to find my forever home. I know people will pass me by because of my age, but I know my special someone is out there. I hope they come for me soon.\n\nSince I'm blind, deaf and sleep most of the day, I'm not confrontational. I wear a cone so I don't chew on myself. I need a bath two times a week. I bark when I need to go out or come in. My foster mom carries me in and out. I'm a sweet dog who loves his belly rubbed.\n\n*Thank you to Sharon for sponsoring this wonderful dog at the Burnice Kraemer Sanctuary and giving him the chance for a better life.\n\nAdditional information: *Current on shots *Special Needs",

            "description": "Nana is a beautiful, 6-year old brindle and white pittie. She is both energetic and a couch potato. She\u2019s always ready for a walk in the woods or park and loves to cuddle up when it\u2019s movie time.   \n\nNana had a rough past where she was abandoned as a puppy in a foreclosed home, and chained to a radiator back in 2014.  She needs someone who will appreciate her happy, energetic spirit and help her know she won\u2019t ever be abandoned again. Her foster is helping her learn to receive her food more gently and working with her on housetraining, neither of which she has had in the past, but is showing progress day-by-day. Nana requires a home with adults and where she is the only animal. She handles the crate well, except of mealtime. \n\nShe is waiting for a patient, loving home so she can put her tragic past behind her and move into a happy second chapter, where she will be a valued, loved, respected, and cherished. \n\nEmail harescue1@aol.com to inquire. Pitbull experience required. Patience and love a must!",

This means letting me be separate for a period of time so I can get used to the home.. I get along great with my foster siblings but can be reactive to other dogs at first.  I am about 8 years old but still have some spunk left in me! I even get the zoomies sometimes! Cats don't bother me.  When going on walks I do tend to pull and bark at other dogs. A fenced back yard is a must .  I am  a little apprehensive when first meeting people and definitely take more time with men. I would be best in a home with no children under the age of 12. I love to take naps in a sunbeam and of course love a good belly rub! I am neutered and UTD on vaccines. If you have a free hand to give me belly rubs I would love to meet you so I can get them from you the rest of my life!",

Both my back legs needed surgery. I already had one and will need another one. While all the Canine Care staff spoils me, I am getting a little depressed. So they are hoping that someone would be interested in fostering me while I undergo all this medical\u2026hmm what word could I use that wouldn\u2019t be censored, well you know what I mean. They would then adopt me once I\u2019m all done with surgeries and physical therapy. Save-A-Pet would continue to coordinate and pay for my medical care. So what do you say?",

            "description": "Birdie\nBirdie is another precious senior pup who was found and never claimed. She is a queen and she knows it! When first found, she was scared. Her coat was horrible and she had a tumor growing on her tail. She has since had surgery to remove the tumor and the majority of her tail. The tumor was cancerous but it is a slow growing cancer. We could do radiation treatments but putting her through the agony of that is something we don't want to do. Her outlook is about 3 years and that is if her heart doesn't worsen before then. Birdie was also found to have some heart failure. Now since that awful tumor is gone (the removal had poor margins) and since being placed on 3 medications for her heart, Birdie is thriving. She is now about 11 years old (5/2020). She is in a foster home where she wants to be boss. Literally. She runs all the other dogs off so all of the attention can be hers. She loves people but she can also be bossy with small children. Birdie is very vocal when something displeases her majesty. She is also housetrained, she has to sleep in the bed with you, and she prefers to go on all of you trips in the car. Birdie is looking for a new home but until the absolute perfect one is found, she is safe in foster care. If you're looking for some spunk in your life and you have a heart for seniors, let us know! Date of Intake: 7/3/19, 5/20/2020 (due to passing of adopter)\nBirdie is located in foster care. Email us at Dogs@maumellefoa.org for more information. Online adoption applications available at www.Maumellefoa.org. Our adoption fee is $80. Included in the fee is shots, sterilization, microchip, dogs are given a dewormer at time of intake, placed on monthly flea/tick preventative, if heartworm negative then they are placed on heartworm preventative, if heartworm positive then they are treated once an adoption finalized.\nPlease note regarding the application to adopt: Personal references, landlord reference and veteranarian references / vetting history will be checked. All past and current pets must have been or must be up to date on vaccines and given heart worm preventative unless otherwise indicated by your veteranarian. If you use multiple vet clinics, please include them all.\nFind Maumelle Friends of the Animals on Facebook!",

Thrill seeker. Charisma master. Charm keeper. Energy reader. Athlete. Devoted companion like no other. 70lbs. A little under 2 years old. Bull Terrier. Seeking a life partner who understands the breed, is equally looking for an actual someone to share their life with, to commit, explore, learn, love and slay together, Forever. Someone patient, someone leading an active lifestyle. Someone into agility or nose work. Someone who makes their dog the center of their universe. Someone patient, committed with time to explore the unknown. This dog could could be taught to write masterpiece novels, build bridges, fly planes and be the detective necessary to any cause. Not a family dog. Not a dog to entertain your other dog. Best as only animal in the house. He\u2019s in it for a love of a lifetime with his human and he thrives at having a job. When he locks his eyes in yours, vulnerability wakes to a new meaning.\n\nAnimals can be viewed by appointment only. We ask that you review our adoption information AND fill out an adoption application prior to setting an appointment so we have all your information and you understand our adoption procedures - you can do so online here.     \n\nPlease feel free to email us or call us anytime for additional information on any of our animals - info@mcprescue.org or 312-388-3928. Our typical adoption fee varies based on the age of the dog at the time of rescue: Under the age of 1 years old is $500; 1-5 years old is $400; over the age of 5 is $300. Fees include vaccinations, microchip, deworming and other vetting as needed. Our adoption process includes an application, reference check and home visit.",

Pictures just don't do this boy justice. Raj is the sweetest ball of energy that needs a foster, a foster to adopt, or an adopter to take him under his or her wing. He would do best with a gentle authoritative handler who can set boundaries, encourage confidence and provide structured stability. We prefer an adult-only home, although Raj would be fine with older preteen/teens but so much for toddlers. He is a high-energy pup and would not want to hurt anyone accidentally because he didn't know his own strength. He is a bit jumpy and boisterous because he is ready to play anytime you will let him. As you can see in his video, he loves playing with his fur sibling Champ. Raj needs a highly breed-experienced owner - this is a must. Raj would do well (after slow introductions) with another dog who wouldn't mind his rambunctious personality, and would need someone with the ability to handle him with another dog. Raj needs a minimum 6-ft. fenced-in yard to run around in. Cats are a no for Raj. His ability to trust is amazing when people from his past have given him every reason not to. Raj is so deserving of the love and stability he has never had before. He is housebroken, crate trained and nondestructive. This wonderful boy is currently being fostered by a trainer.\n\n2/2/21 5:06 PM",

Gracie loves your attention and watching TV with you is her ideal evening. She walks just great on a leash and is a great car rider! She would do best in a home with no cats and if there is another dog it would be best at about 50 pounds and very friendly ....but she would be a great only dog! Gracie has quite the story behind her and has definitely decided that she loves being an inside dog and loves her people. Gracie needs a family that will commit to her for the rest of her life....she had a rough start and now deserves the best:) She is a sweetheart and full of silly sweetness.\n\nIf Gracie sounds like a dog for you please fill out an application at helpadogsmile.org.

Mecca would make a wonderful addition to any family.\n\nThe fee to adopt Mecca is $200.00; this includes: neuter, deworming, vaccinations and a microchip. \n\n**Please Note: Mecca is currently located at our facility in Sherman, TX.

He is athletic, curious and very affectionate. He is quite sensitive and suffers here at the Rescue because he so wants to be with his person. His adopter will need to be careful of his jealousy with other dogs in the home, but this can be managed. He is able to climb chain link fencing, so wood/vinyl would be ideal. Plastic sheeting could be placed on the bottom 3 ft, of a chain link fence to prevent him getting a toe-hold. If you want an adoring companion, who loves to please you, Remy is for you.\n\nAll our dogs are spayed/neutered, de-wormed, vaccinated appropriate for their age, vaccinated for kennel cough, and micro-chipped. Puppies (under 6 months) are $225.00; puppies (6 months to 2 years) are $175.00, dogs (over 2 years) are $150 and senior dogs (7 years or older) are $60.00.",

Please EMAIL apassionforpaws@gmail.com and wait for confirmation of your appointment before coming to visit the Akita Ranch. We also request that visitors wear masks. I weigh 62 lbs and want to be busy all the time!\n\nG'Day Mate!! My name is Spot and I am a 2 year old, wait, pardon me, what's that I see over there, I must run to find out! ..Anyway, what Spot wanted to tell you is that he is a young heeler mix and his mind is always busy. He LOVES water and he really enjoys activities that keep him engaged. He might not be a herding dog on a true working Ranch but he sure would love to run the perimeter at a dude ranch. He would also excel at agility, flyball or maybe even diving if someone patient but enthusiastic would show him what to do. Spot also has a very sweet and affectionate side. He loves his people and really does want to learn. Sometimes he gets the zoomies because he is so happy to have the attention and activity!! He is definitely a smart cookie and he loves his dog cookies too so he can be easily motivated with treats and praise. If you have the skills then Spot is up to the challenge! Come meet Spot at the Akita Ranch today!!\n\nVisit Akita Ranch 28930 Ellis Ave, Romoland, CA, Open 10-5 daily BY APPOINTMENT ONLY.

IF YOU MEET OUR CRITERIA FOR ADOPTION OF THIS DOG, PLEASE FOLLOW THE LINK TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE PROFILE TO COMPLETE OUR APPLICATION. THANK YOU!\n\nGretchen is an approximately five year old Pit bull. She weighs 68lbs. Gretchen is a sweet girl who loves people and dogs. Sadly, she has very  bad knees that can\u2019t be fixed. Gretchen doesn\u2019t seem to mind though.. she loves to go for walks and is very easy to walk. Sometimes after a walk she can get a little stiff, but a one mile walk is a breeze for her. She should not live in a home with lots of stairs. Single level is best for her. She needs a securely fenced yard, not an apartment.\n\nGretchen loves Kongs and sometimes gets the zoomies. She\u2019s so happy! She doesn\u2019t like being crated but is not destructive when left alone. She is currently living with another female Pit bull  in her foster and they love to play together. Gretchen growls when she  plays and that can be scary for another dog. It depends on their comfort level.\n\nAdoption Process: We are not first come first served. Indigo Rescue focuses on finding good matches between dogs and families to ensure life long adoptions. We deliver all dogs to their new homes. All of our dogs are in foster homes. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in meeting one of our dogs, please use the following link and complete our Adoption Application. You can either scan your completed application and email it to us at: info@indigorescue.org, or you can fax it to us at: 888-502-7660.\nThe link is not live, so you will need to copy and paste it into your browser: https://storage.googleapis.com/gator-users/user-680788/documents/d1742bff02e44c2ea25649cb45df5103/Pet%20Application%20Form%20December%202020.pdf\nIf the dog you're interested in seems compatible with your lifestyle we'll set up a time for you to meet the dog privately.\nPLEASE NOTE: Indigo Rescue only adopts to homes within 30 miles of Beaverton because our volunteers deliver all of our dogs to their adoptive homes. We work very hard to create a family of our Indigo Rescue adopters because we want to be close enough to help in case there are any problems. We want everyone to be happy and successful!\n\n**ALL of our dogs, puppies, cats, kittens and rabbits come vaccined to their age, spayed/neutered and microchipped.\n\nThank you for your interest in adopting and saving a life.",

She came to them after the local Shelter reached out for help finding out why Rayna was blind\u2026everyone hoping that since she was still young she might somehow get better.\n\nTwo of the rescue volunteers took Rayna on the long drive to Albany to have an MRI and see the specialists there.  It was found that she had two hematomas on her brain from an injury. One that must have happened when she was a very small puppy.  Although it was found she was in no pain, and will not get worse, she will never regain her vision.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t stop this beautiful girl. Rayna loves to run and play in the large yard in the grass and loves all the volunteers here.\nShe will need a very special home that understands the needs of a blind dog and a fenced in yard. But blind dogs adapt very quickly to their surroundings. So don\u2019t let that stop you from adopting!  She is an absolute sweetheart and deserves a wonderful home.\n\nPlease reach out directly to Paws Across Oswego for more information about Adopting Rayna.\n\nhttp://pawsacrossoswegocounty.com/adoption_information/\n",

            "description": "Hello, my name is Kavalier, and I came into Cuz i Matter Animal Rescue on 10/9/2019.  I am a Lab Mix female dog who loves to play out in the yard with my canine companions at my Foster Home.  My foster parents have this to say about me:\nKavalier is very timid of people but is warming up to them.  She listens very well and knows her name and knows when called to come in the house.  She does well with other dogs, as that is where she gets her confidence from.  Kavalier would thrive in a home with other dogs and a backyard.  She would not be a good lone dog nor would she be a good apartment dog.  When she goes for walks, she must have another dog to go along with, otherwise she is very frightful and \"bucks\" on the leash; but once another dog goes along for the walk, she is great.\n\nIf you'd like more information about me or to setup a Meet-and-Greet, please send CiMAR an email so my Foster Mom can contact you.  You can also find more pictures of me on their website:  http://www.cuzimatter.org/adopt-a-dog\n",

True to his breed, He is protective of his home and people. Loyal to a fault, he loves his humans. Though he loves kids, due to some resource guarding behavior, he needs a home without young children. \n\nDuke is very good on his basic obedience and he is crate trained. He does well with other even temperament dogs and is generally  pretty easy going guy. He would be best in a home with no small dogs or cats. \n\nHis adoptive home must have a 6 foot privacy fence, to keep him safe. And must be (within 50 miles) local to the Saint Louis metropolitan area. \n\nDuke's adoption donation is $450.00 and he is up to date and fully vetted. \n\nInterested adopters must submit an adoption application through our website, steppingstonebully.org to be considered.",

At 60 pounds this 5 year old girl that is a Rottie mix, is looking for a new home because she got too rough with a few roaming chickens. Nothing unusual for a dog these days but it created a situation where her owner was either going to give her away or shoot her.so we took her. This is a smart girl as most Rottweilers are. She minds well but doesnt get along with cats and can be a little aggressive with small dogs. She does well on a leash and likes to play fetch the ball in the backyard. She is devoted and just wants to belong where she can shine with all her wonderful traits of love, intelligence and can be your friend and protector. If you are interested in helping this girl find a place in your heart and household, please email us at ccrtennessee@gmail.com",

This snuggly girl was dumped by her breeder and has been with our rescue since she was 4 months old. She is the most loving dog you will ever meet and quickly became a staff favorite. She is incontinent and takes a few medications to keep that under control, but doesn\u2019t let that stop her from enjoying life. She absolutely LOVES chasing water from the hose and chewing her toys, but she is just as happy cuddling up on your lap. She loves human attention and spins when she sees her favorite people. If you want to experience the world with the friendliest (and wiggliest) boxer, Tesla is your girl!\n\nTesla is current on vaccines, spayed and microchipped. \n",

She seems to like everyone, though, as a mature lady, she would rather not be around active babies and little tykes in her home. She prefers well mannered grown ups.\n\nShe still loves to take walks and is good on the leash unless that Beagle nose pulls her towards something that smells really great.\n\nShe is a sweet girl and has an easy going nature, typical of what makes seniors so precious.\n\nShe does still like to play with a tennis ball, though!\n\nSugar holds her pee and poo for when it is time to go outside, no accidents for this lady.\n\nSugar is past her playful years so wants to be an only dog in her new home, especially since that is what she is used to. She is not that fond of other dogs anyway.\n\nSugar is a sweetheart who really deserves a loving retirement home. She promises to love you so much and says she is not that much trouble, an easy keeper.\n\nNo cats in her new home - she thinks they are critters to hunt.\n\nApply online at www.triadspca.org. Sugar is staying in a wonderful foster home and we would be happy to arrange for you to meet her if you call us at 336-375-3222.",

Every Pet's Dream is so happy to introduce you to our 100th Rescue! Meet Archie!!\n\nArchie loves everyone he meets. He is good with dogs of all sizes. Archie loves sunbathing and wants nothing more than to cuddle with his humans. He's got so much personality and is one of the most loving dogs. We were heartbroken when the cancer diagnosis came. However, we are thrilled that Archie is truly at home with us and loved by the entire family.\n\nWe don't know how long Archie was been neglected before we rescued him and he came to us in bad shape, but we know he will never be neglected again.\n\nRescued July 2018\n\nArchie is 11 years old and 60 pounds. 1/24/21 1:12 AM",

Patches would do best with no other dogs. Once he warms up though you'll never know he is a nervous kiddo. The adoption fee for all of our dogs is $250.00 + tax and that includes their vaccinations, spay or neuter, rabies and microchip. Our dogs are also heartworm negative (or we will cover their treatment). To start the process please visit our website and fill out the adoption application (www.dfwrescueme.org/adoption-application) and from there the foster family can answer any questions and arrange a time to meet.

He is not a fan of cats .\n\nThis big mush needs a family who will love his floppy ears just the way we do. Are you willing to give him a nice warm bed where he can snuggle when it rains outside . Some toys and some bones will make him very happy . Long walks and he will give you kisses all over .\n\nAmnimar is located in Middle Island NY .\n\nTo become his new family please apply today by filling in the adoption  application to find on our website www.a-teameliterescuedogs.com or email us and we send you one .",

I am the sweetest girl and I love to smile (as you can see in my photo). I can be a little shy of new people, but I warm up with gentleness and kindness. I LOVE tennis balls and playing fetch! But I also love snuggles and cuddles. I am told I am a very pretty lady and am so sweet. I would love to find a home of my own if only someone would take a chance on me . I need to go to a very special home without children or other pets. I also need a human who is understanding and has dog experience. I am very loyal and loving once I trust a human-and then we're best friends for life! Please take a chance on me.\n\nAn approved adoption application is required. The $125 adoption fee (payable by cash only) includes spay/neuter; microchip; dental teeth cleaning (if needed prior to adoption); vaccinations; and heartworm testing. Our adoption application may be found by going to: www.headinhomerescue.org; then click on the link to the adoption application. Dogs for adoption may be seen by appointment only following an approved application. Proof of completion of an obedience class is required for all dogs following adoption. Please note: while we welcome out of state applications, we do not ship our animals and require adopters to come to Holland to finalize any adoption. 2/2/21 8:31 AM",

He will be the perfect addition to any family. Axl is a very sweet dog. He really enjoys getting his belly rubbed and his favorite pasttime is to chase water from the hose in the backyard.\n\nAxl is EXCELLENT with children, however he does get a bit skittish if they are too loud or scare him. We think older kids (8+) may be a better fit for him.\n\nAxl is already housebroken, and knows how to use the doggy door! He is also leash trained and walks well on a leash. Axl is also fully obedience trained and knows his basic commands.\n\nAxl does well with other dogs that he is familiar with, but is sometimes selective and uneasy with other new dogs so he may need a slow, proper dog intro. He has not yet been tested with cats.\nAxl is a bit of a nervous dog with scary noises, including fireworks and thunder. He does best wearing a Thundershirt during any storms.\n\nFor more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\nIf you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page\n\nat www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals\n\nfor more photos and details.",

            "description": "Phoebe has had a difficult start in life, and was homeless and living with her friend Max at the water plant in San Bernardino, where the plant workers gave them food scraps and water, and they slept in the hills surrounding the plant. She is a gentle girl that wants noting but to give and receive love, but she needs a home that would give her time to slowly adjust and not have too many expectations from her in the first couple of weeks. A stable, loving, patient home will be best suited for her to allow her to decompress and create bond - once this happens, you will have the most loyal, grateful, loving dog you would have ever hoped for.",

He is about 6-7 years old and weighs about 60-65 pounds. He is house broken, crate trained, vaccinated, microchipped and waiting for his loving forever home to show up. Super sweet with people; stand-offish with unknown dogs. With proper introduction warms up quickly. NO cats. Plays ball. Absolutely loves the water and car rides. He is summer fun in one beautiful package. He thinks he's a tiny lap dog and is always trying to crawl up in your lap. If you're not in the chair, he crawls up and waits for you. He will chose getting love and pets from his person, over everything else: Treats, food, toys, all go by the wayside and are not as important as getting attention and love.

She is currently in a foster home with 2 Chihuahuas and a couple large mutts and is having a great time!. \n\nShe came from a hoarder case where unlike other hoarder cases these dogs were treated very well and were loved...There were just too many of them and they were not socialized with other people during that crucial puppy stage.  Because she is so shy and kids can be loud, scary and leave doors open, we are looking to place her in a home with adults only.  \n\nBlossoms ideal home would be with:\n\n1) 1-2 people in a house (not a lot of people coming in & out) No kids\n\n2) MUST have another dog. Preferably one young & playful like her. She doesn't need just a companion but also a playmate.\n\n3) Must have a  6ft fence that is completely secure. (we do yard checks) \n\n4) a LOT of love & patience to give & you will find it given back once she's comfortable\n\nIt seems like we are asking a lot but we know we will find her the right home. if you ever meet her you'll understand why we have to be picky where she goes.  She truly is a total love once she feels comfortable with you.\n\nIf you have a loving atmosphere & another dog for her to learn from please fill out an application. We would love to get this girl into a foster or forever home.  https://www.muttsinneed.org/adoption-application.html\n",

My intention was to keep her but we have cats and she is aggressive towards them. She seems to have a high prey drive. We have the cats separated from her right now but I'm afraid if she was able to get to them she might hurt them. Also yesterday my son was walking with our other dog and she jumped up and bit at my sons cheek. She didn't leave any punctures just scratched his cheek. I don't want to see her put down because I do believe she could make a good pet for someone without cats. She does do okay with other dogs but she plays rough and would be better with dogs her size or bigger. Her name is Eleven and she is up to date on all her shots and tests. She is about 50lbs and is around 2.5 years old. She is a mixed breed dog and I'm not sure what all she has in her. She seems to have some boxer her though.",

            "description": "Nova is a 46 pound,, 6 year old German Shepherd Mix. She is happy and loves running around in the yard playing with her foster humans!   She is always smiling and acts much younger than her biological age!   She's a very sweet girl looking for her forever family to love and adore!\n\nLike many rescue pups, this furbaby is HW+, but is currently undergoing the *slow-kill method of treatment (see more information below).  \n\nAll our adoption fees include spay/neuter, micro-chip, up-to-date vaccinations, including rabies thru date of adoption. This pup is heartworm positive and is currently being treated with the *slow kill method, approved by her veterinarian, on prevention & on flea/tick prevention. \n\n*The slow kill method of treatment, simply stated, is a 30 day regiment of  doxycycline followed by a monthly dose of Advantage Multi for 12 months, then retesting.   Most dogs test negative after one year of following this treatment; however, we always recommend that potential adopters consult & follow the advice of their family veterinarian upon adopting any of our hw+ pups.   Although the fast-kill method is still considered the \"gold-standard\" by the AVA, and may be preferred by some vets; the slow-kill method has proven to be effective in our rescue. The main reason we utilize this method is due to our limited financial constraints and the high number of our rescue pups that are infected.   In the cases of severe infection and if the pup is highly symptomatic, we sometimes use the fast-kill approach instead.   Again, we recommend for you to consult with your veterinarian after the adoption is complete and follow their recommendations.   \n\nIn order to be considered for one of our beautiful pups, please go to our website and complete and application: https://www.mustluvdogs.org/adoptable-pets.\nPlease note that we are a DUE DILIGENCE adoption organization. Part of our approval process requires, among other things:\n* Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered.\n*The majority, but not all, of our pets require a fenced yard or secure enclosure.  In the case of apartments, we require Landlord approval and designated dog area in complex.\n*Verifiable good veterinary history INCLUDING regular vaccination/visits and good Heartworm Prevention history is a MUST!\n*Adopter must be able to have time to spend with the pup and be able to provide the pup a safe environment to live.\n*ALL our dogs are expected to be primarily INSIDE dogs.  They MUST sleep inside the home.  We truly understand that some folks have working dogs (i.e. farmers, ranchers,etc); however, the majority of our dogs have had a rough life prior to coming to us & we want to make sure that they are showered with LUV & maybe even a bit spoiled for the rest of their lives. \n\nOther facts are also considered, including whether children or other pets are a good fit with the dog. \n\nMust Luv Dogs reserves the right to deny any applications that we don't think are a good fit with the pup. Our first & foremost concern is the dog's best interest. It is our MISSION to place them in a home that is a great fit for their needs for a lifetime of luv & being part of a family.\n*We will consider adoptions in any area; however, will do not ship or transport puppies under the age of 12 mos. We will ONLY transport an adult dog on a transport approved by MLD, at adopter's expense.\n* In order to be affordable and afford every family an opportunity to have a pup of their own, we keep our Adoption Fees low; however, please keep in mind that the fees we charge do not cover all costs for the pup.  Any additional donations are greatly appreciated!\n\nPlease note that all of our pets are in private foster homes. In order to reduce any stress or confusion for our pups, we require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meet & greet for any of our pups.  Alternatively, you are always welcome to come meet any of our pups at one of our regular Adoption Events.   Our events are always posted on PetFinder OR on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/mustLUVdogs.org.\n\nFinally, THANK YOU for considering Must Luv Dogs for your next pet. \n\n*Most dogs require a fenced area in yard. \n*Apartments okay IF nearby dog park or walking trails (with landlord appoval).\n*ALL dogs must be INSIDE dogs and treated a part of family. \n*We are a DUE DILIGENCE Adoption Rescue.  \n*Must have good Vet history & Heartworm prevention is a MUST!\n*ALL dogs are fully vetted, spay/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption.\n\n\n\n",

A calm low traffic home is desired with someone who is home most of the time, as she doesn't do well if alone for too long, but this is trainable.\n\nWe do our best to get to know each and every dog at our camp. Their personalities emerge after being with us for a bit and sometimes change. The personality and other information included in the above description is based on what we know currently in the shelter environment. All dogs are up to date on vaccines (Distemper, Rabies, Bordetella), microchipped, spayed/neutered and receive worming, flea & tick medication before they are adopted out. Please note there are some exceptions depending on the condition of the dog. If you are interested in this dog please fill out an online application at https://www.camppapillon.org/dog-application.\n\nOnce your dog is in your home, they will adjust and relax and could become more playful or show more personality traits as they begin to open up. Once adopted, please allow your dog time to decompress and relax in a stable home environment.",

EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

You could call me Thunder the Magic dog because even though I'm black, photos of me often look brown!  I have pretty brown highlights, that trick cameras.   \n\nI'm an active girl that likes to run and play, so I'm looking for a home with a fenced yard and a person to play frisbee with me!  I like one-on-one attention, so I really don't want to share my home with another dog or cat.  I also don't have a history with little kids so I can't go to a home with kids under 7 (per rescue policy).   However, all that aside, I'm a happy, smiley, loving girl.  I'm also intelligent so you can train me.  We could have so much fun playing and training!  If you're looking for a smart, pretty, lovable girl who doesn't have to share you with any other pets, ask about me.  I can't wait to meet you!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please go to www.lrrof.org NOW and fill out and application.\n\u00a0\nThanks so much for your interest in our rescue!\nTo apply to adopt from Labrador Retriever Rescue of Florida, please visit our website at http://www.lrrof.org. Your support, both through adoption and donation is always essential to us and our Labs. Donate today.\nWe're about matching the right dog with the right family! All applicants will be assigned an Adoption Counselor who will act as their liaison. In addition, a phone interview, home inspection and vet reference (if applicable) are required for eligibility to adopt from Labrador Retriever Rescue of Florida.\n",

            "description": "Danza is an appx 10 year old male Chi who currently weighs about 15 lbs.  Danza found himself a stray in a neighborhood that never sees strays.  He had a zip tie for a collar, was overweight, his nails curled under and afraid.  No one was looking for Danza.  Fortunately he landed in a great foster in the Snooty program and is safe.  He has had a dental, which ended up meaning having all of this teeth pulled.  Danza is one of those old man Chis who really would just like the lap of an older person to hang with all day.  Other dogs are frightening to him....he just wants his human.  He does well on a leash for short walks, but is just as happy to head to the back yard for potty breaks.  He would love a fenced in yard for sunny days and lounging.\nHe is neutered, up to date on shots, current on preventative, and microchipped.  His adoption fee is partially covered through our program due to his senior status and he can be adopted with a suggested donation of $100.\n\nAll dogs adopted locally through SGDR receive a free six week session of obedience classes and a lifetime of behavior support through our Project REWARD program with trainer Charlotte Blake.\n\nYou must have an approved application before being able to visit a dog. Visit our website below for an adoption application and answers to your most \u201cFrequently Asked Questions\" \nQuestion about adopting: http://snootygiggles.com/policies/\nApplication: http://snootygiggles.com/application/\n\nIf you expect to leave the dog alone for long periods of time, please do not consider adopting a puppy.  Puppies need lots of attention and companionship.  Thanks.\n\nAll known information about the animal is listed above. We do our best to give accurate information, but most of our dogs are rescues and do not come with a known history.",

Stark white with tiny black spots.   \nSpayed or neutered?     Spayed\n\nGood with:       \nkids?        Possibly, but proper introductions are necessary. \nstrangers?      Fancy must be properly introduced to whomever she meets.  Once she knows you, she\u2019s very sociable and friendly.\nother dogs?      Possibly, but only with proper introductions.      \ncats?     No cats.   Fancy has a strong prey drive.   \nOn leash?    With the training she\u2019s been provided, Fancy is very good with the e-collar, walks well on heel, and has learned all the \u201csit,\u201d \u201cdown,\u201d \u201cplace,\u201d \u201ckennel\u201d and other commands.\nHousetrained?    Yes.        \nCrate trained?      Yes.          \nPaper trained?     No.\n\n\nFancy was brought to the New York Animal Care Centers (NYACC) by her owner as a surrender in April 2019, August 2019.  They said the landlord wasn't allowing her any longer.  She then developed Kennel Cough then was placed on the At-Risk List where she was almost euthanized.\n\nSomeone saw her and wanted to foster her.  She didn't do well at the shelter in that environment at all and was deteriorating.  \n\n\nPreferred forever home for your foster?  Fancy would do well with a family with no small children and without strangers coming and going.  No cats.  She is dog selective, and with proper introduction may do okay with a dog on the smaller side--she did okay at Board and Train with a number of dogs.  She will learn to meet new people, but that has to be worked through in order that she can safely get to know new folks.  She is puppy-ish, fun, and has a lot of energy, so her new owners will want to play with her, take her on walks, etc.  She loves the flirt pole, loves chasing.  She is an extremely smart and adoring dog once she gets to know you, but she takes a while to warm up to strangers, so it\u2019s best that she go to a quiet home.  She loves the outdoors and would do great in a home with property, though fences cannot be trusted, as she will either scale them or dig under them.  She would love to be an only pet but could be tested with a second dog.\n\n\nInteresting quirks/behaviors:  \n\nFancy is extremely smart and loving, and because of these qualities, she is prone to separation-type anxiety and so must be kept active, stimulated.  She literally leaps for joy, and can from a sitting position go over 6 feet--this is something we\u2019ve discouraged, but it\u2019s also fun to watch and okay if it\u2019s allowed only during playtime.  Once she gets to know you, you will never feel love this strong again from a dog.  She is also extremely beautiful with her shocking white coat--looks like a unicorn when out in the sun (but without the horn).\n\nIssues:  She has anxiety issues that can veer toward separation-anxiety and, if not kept on the protocol she\u2019s learned at training, could turn into fear-based aggression.  Allied Training has agreed to work with the new owner, so all this will be clear.  She\u2019s also smart and no couch potato, so she\u2019ll need play, walks and stimulation--once that\u2019s in place, though, she is happy to curl up by your feet wherever you are.\n\nFancy is so loving it can\u2019t but touch a person\u2019s heart.  She\u2019s also just a bundle of puppy-like, playful fun.  An incredible dog.\n",

            "description": "Addie and Maddie were saved off death row in a high kill Texas shelter.  The 1 year old Rhodesian mix sisters could barely walk from old back leg/hip injuries that didn't heal correctly.\n\nFast forward a few months with medication (carprofen), CBD Oil and joint supplements and these girls are almost Bionic!  Addie has now been adopted.\n\nMaddie for a very specific home due to their background.  She is great with people once she gets to trust you.  Little apprehensive of strangers and their intentions at first.  Remember, these are dogs that came from living on the streets and having to fend and provide for themselves.   She has a taill that will wag for hours!\n\nOk now the real stuff that you need to know about Maddie.  She is also pretty crafty and a 5 or 6 ft chain link fence is a breeze for her to Houdini out of (trust me I know .. I said they were now feeling bionic remember LOL).  No other small animals (cats, chickens, rabbits ect).  \n\nShe would be happiest with a large, wide open area to spend her days laying out in the sunshine.  Lots of acreage and a wireless system / electric fence may be ideal for her.  She also needs a building that allows access to 24/7 that contains heat in the winter and A/C in the summer.  She has no fur and can't spend the winter outside, period, end of sentence.  \n\nWe don't ever adopt our dogs to be outside dogs, and it is the same with Maddie.  We want them to be loved family members, but also know what will make her happy as well, so we may be looking for the impossible, but I hope not.  I hope in time with the right family she will be comfortable in a home .. but I understand she may never get there.  \n\nMaddie is up to date on vaccines, spayed, heart worm negative, on preventions and micro chipped.  She does ok on leash and in the car when crated.  She is about 40 lbs currently and will stay medium sized.\n\nMaddie is currently located in Tennessee and the adoption fee is $150 each  The first step in our process is submitting the application.  We are happy to set up a meet and greet once an application has been approved. If you would like to adopt Maddie please fill out our online adoption application at http://safehaventn.com/ .  \n",

Once you do, you become his entire world. Gru is an insecure guy so it is really critical that his new owner lead him, show him, calmly guide him. When he is told what to do, he is obedient and the most loyal, eager to please personality you'll come across. He takes time, but boy is it worth it! He'll do just about anything for those that provide him calm direction. Constantly looking at them for direction. It's beautiful! \n\nGru comes with a fan club! Our team will show you exactly how he communicates and provide you with the tools and support you need. We plan to give his new human the road map for success and life long support! We got your back! And his. For life. \n\nGru does get along with other dogs and has lived with them. He doesn't crave to engage them, but he is OK if they are there. Being an only child though may just be what he needs for success. He's open to options here though it would need to be friendly confident dog that he can follow and learn from. \n\nTo schedule an appointment to learn more about Gru and to see if he might be a good fit for your home, give us a call at 775-800-1906.",

Quiet, curious, independent and easy going. \n\nAmos is looking for a single person or quiet couple that would love nothing more than to have a buddy around and provide an older dog a loving home. Amos takes a little time to get you know you and to trust. He comes from a pretty rough past so he prefers to be ignored at first, until he's comfortable. The more time you spend, the more comfortable he gets. Now, we get to see him play and run around in circles with excitement! It's pretty awesome and a huge change from how he felt when he arrived. \n\nAmos will be pretty mellow in the home and grateful for a consistent meal and a soft bed. A spacious yard, walks in the hills and a person he can call his own would be his dream life. He has an independent side for awhile, however once he knows you, he really does begin to love and show more of himself. Because he doesn't jump in strangers laps or hand out affection to everyone... you know you're \"in\" when you start to see him offering it up to you. \n\nWe absolutely admire his strength and mental toughness. He made it! And we couldn't be happier. \n\nTo schedule an appointment to meet Amos and learn more about him, please call 775-800-1906.",

Hey, I found my way into the warm away from the cold.  Who could blame me?\n\nOnce I get to know and trust you, I will be your forever friend. \n\nI can be anxious at times and pace a bit because of what happened to me, so I will need an experienced adopter.  Could you be a patient, loving person that would give me a home?  I love walks and tons of attention!\n\nIf there is another dog in the home, we need to meet first to see if they like me.  I don't prefer cats.\n\nI'm scheduled to be spayed.\n\n\n**MORE PICS TO COME!**",

He has grown to love his foster mom but is still nervous and snappy with new people. His house training has not improved and he has developed a cough for which we cannot find a cause or a solution. So our angry little problem child is no longer a healthy boy and we have officially made the decision to make him a permanent member of the GOT family. \n\nWe are a small rescue with limited resources: an adoption would be best for us financially, but we do not think it is best for Leo and that's why he's staying despite the financial burden. Please consider making a donation in Leo's name to help us keep him happy and comfortable for as long as he has left.",

But even so, Josie is super happy and playful. She loves playing fetch, walking on a leash and going for car rides. She is super easy maintenance ... even enjoying baths and tolerating nail trimmings. She does love her people but needs a home without other dogs, cats, or kids.\n\nTo make the best possible match for you and the pet, please click below to complete the Adoption Application. \n\nOnce your application has been processed, we'll be in contact. \n\nWe cannot schedule a meet and greet without a completed application. \n\nIf you are viewing this page through PetFinder, Adopt-a-Pet, etc., please go to http://ootwrescue.org/adoption.html to fill out an application or review our Adoption Process.",

            "description": "Brody is a gorgeous white and fawn colored retriever mix who weighs about 65 pounds, is neutered, up to date on vaccines and microchipped. He is estimated to be about 5-6 yrs old. Brody gets along with other dogs but not interested in playing and is a little socially awkward. He is hesitant at first and will need time and patience from his new family. He will need a home that can work on his manners in a completely positive way and manage his quirky ways. A fully fenced in yard is Required as he is very skittish when walking outside of his comfort zone area. If you are looking for a walking partner or someone to take to the park he is NOT your dog. An experienced pet parent(s) is needed for Brody as he has some resource guarding issues that need to be monitored. He is a vocal dog and tries to communicate with sounds that can be misunderstood at first. He is the type of dog that needs time to trust his human before bonding and is leery of new situations. He has come a long way in his foster home but will need continued reinforcement and a very committed home. We believe older kids or no kids would be best for him since he is still learning boundaries. Preferably a low key home without a lot of visitors or activity.\n\nInterested in adopting me?

He is up to date on his vetting and already neutered. Buddy has been on Apoquel for allergies for a very long time and his ears are horribly infected and he has hematomas in both ears :( Dr Rowland checked him all over today and we will have a full report on him in the morning. Despite having super painful ears, Buddy is so sweet and loving. He is good with other dogs, having lived with a smaller dog in his former home. We will update on his condition ASAP. Please keep Buddy in your thoughts and prayers!UPDATE: Buddy had a few medical setbacks while at the vet clinic but with all of the love the amazing care he received he bounced back and went to his foster home. We will continue to monitor his bloodwork and will keep his ears treated and itch-free :)",

Please email the completed application to newleashrescue2018@gmail.com\n\nAre you a runner/jogger?  Need a running buddy that can hang with you...even if training for a marathon? Sirius just might be the boy for you!\n\nSirius is a handsome \"tuxedo\" lab who is around 3 years old and came to us as an unclaimed stray.  He needs room to run and an active family committed to working with him and getting him the exercise he needs. \n\nHe spent some time at Camp Bow Wow and loves to play with other pups and loves people. Being a younger dog, he has a lot of energy and still has some manners to learn. He does ok with other high energy playful dogs, but is often too much for more laid back dogs to handle. \n\nWhen working with a trainer, he did well when he earned a treat for good behavior! He can sit, lay down, and shake. He needs work on the leash, but did better with treats. \n\nHe needs a little help with potty training but taking a little time with him in his new house by letting him out often and giving praise, he'll figure it out. He is a smart, tall, lanky puppy and he is always a happy boy. Sirius will need an owner that works with him and he will be loyal to the end!\u00a0\n\nHe loves food and is very food motivated, so continued training and working with him should be easy.  He also loves to cuddle up with his person and snuggle!   He is neutered, microchipped, up to date on shots and current with heartworm and flea and tick preventives. \n\nAdoption fee is $300.00 + tax (no checks)\n\nFoster to contact:  Kim @ 507-351-6647 or k.balder@hotmail.com\n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home. An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home. Sometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home and truly become comfortable. \n\nThere are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption, discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months. We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.",

Mastiff/Shepherd mix.\n\n\nThis beautiful, intuitive, sensitive, red head sorceress is going to make someone the happiest they\u2019ve ever even imagined. A little shy at first, quickly comes around when she realizes she\u2019s safe. Her love is thick. Her love is addicting. Her love is a instantaneous life win. Found her way to CACC because family didn\u2019t have time for her (Whatever). Originally head shy so you could see someone had a hard hand with her because of their own short comings. She\u2019s a truly special soul and only a baby. Can\u2019t wait to match her family with her and watch all her magic be nurtured and grow into pure magnificence. This dog has a lot to offer and will be the greatest friend imagined to her family. Definitely a confident leader as a human, well conditioned in compassion and positive energy is where she will soar. Plus, she LOVES dogs! \n\nAnimals can be viewed by appointment only. We ask that you review our adoption information AND fill out an adoption application prior to setting an appointment so we have all your information and you understand our adoption procedures - you can do so online here.     \n\nPlease feel free to email us or call us anytime for additional information on any of our animals - info@mcprescue.org or 312-388-3928. Our typical adoption fee varies based on the age of the dog at the time of rescue: Under the age of 1 years old is $500; 1-5 years old is $400; over the age of 5 is $300. Fees include vaccinations, microchip, deworming and other vetting as needed. Our adoption process includes an application, reference check and home visit.",

If interested, please complete our no obligation application.  This can be found at www.waldosmuttleycrew.org.  Select the Applications tab, then Adoption Application. THE APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED BEFORE WE CAN START THE PROCESS.  It can take up to a week to process an application.  We are an all-volunteer rescue so please be patient.\n\nOur adoption area is limited to a 4 hour radius of Indianapolis.  We try our best to provide all information in our bios.  If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask during the interview process.  Some of our dogs have special requirements such as needs another dog in the home or requires a physical and permanent fenced yard.  These requirements are not negotiable.  Unless otherwise noted, we do not cat test our adoptable dogs.  We also require that all pets in your household be spayed/neutered, up-to-date on vaccines and on a monthly heartworm/flea preventative. \n\nE-MAILS: We do not respond to e-mail inquiries without an application.  We regret that we cannot respond to every e-mail unless you fill out an application.  \n\nAll the dogs we offer for adoption have been spayed/neutered, wormed and microchipped, are up-to-date on immunizations, have been tested for heartworm and are currently receiving a monthly preventative.  If the dog had additional medical issues, those have also been addressed.  Visit our website www.waldosmuttleycrew.org for more information and to complete an application.\n\nOh, my goodness!!!  Would you look at that face?  You can't help but want to scrunch up all those folds & wrinkles!  But Jethro Tull doesn't mind!  He loves attention!  He's a 5-6 year old basset hound/beagle who's as snuggly as he looks.  Jethro is great with other dogs as well.  He's pretty low energy as he has more of a basset hound personality but he does get a bee in his bonnet on occasion and race around with his doggy pals.  He is an easy going country boy at heart and would be happiest in the country where he can explore and where his barking won't bother neighbors .  Jethro is an absolute joy and whoever adopts him is going to be very lucky!!!  Jethro's adoption fee is $200; he's neutered, microchipped and current on vaccinations.",

            "description": "RJ is a three year old, 65 pound Staffordshire Terrier who has had a rough go of things having spent his youth in and out of the shelter system.  He could really use a turn of good luck. Most recently, RJ has been staying with a dog trainer and has excelled in his lessons.  He knows all the foundational obedience skills, many tricks, walks well on a leash, and only barks when someone comes to the door.\n\nRJ will not annoy you with \u201cneedy-ness\u201d.  Unlike some dogs who follow you around and beg for attention at every turn, RJ is content to lay on his bed by the fire when he is not otherwise engaged.  Snuggle sessions with RJ come only after months of trust are built and even then, physical affection is on his terms.  He\u2019s wary of strangers so patience is a must.  Once you are in his circle of trust however, he can pour on the charm.  \n\nWe are looking for a dog savvy home for RJ and an owner whose heart is in rescue. We are not entirely clear on what he\u2019s experienced in his young life but are committed to finding him a quiet home with a healthy routine where he can feel safe from now on.  We are imagining a single person who works from home, or a couple, with no other pets or perhaps another female dog.  RJ would like to be in a rural or semi-rural area with the ability to get out in nature regularly. He would not do well in an apartment or in a busy urban area.\n\nRJ does enjoy playing with other dogs and would be most happy if he had a few female dog-friends to play with regularly.  Dog-dog play with girlfriends is by far his favorite form of exercise. He is not a dog park type of dog.   His exercise requirements are medium \u2013 a couple of long walks a day and some off-leash play should suffice most days, with some occasional bigger adventures thrown in.  As mentioned, he\u2019s a big fan of positive reinforcement training.\n\nRJ is in good health and is physically fit \u2013 a strikingly handsome specimen!  He is looking for a special person to bond with and to help him be successful in life, and in love.\n\nRJ's adoption fee includes spay/neuter, basic vaccinations, rabies vaccination, and flea/tick treatment.\n\nYou can find his application here:\n\nhttps://forms.gle/5eSBjHrWv7pTEEzUA\n\nQuestions?

We are working on potty training him, but he is not yet fully potty trained. He stays in a kennel when he is left alone (he will bark sometimes when initially put in the kennel). He is currently still undergoing a little bit of medical treatment, and because he only has 3 teeth he is currently eating canned food until he follows up with the vet.

Poor baby was saved from SBC with a puppy who we still aren't sure if the puppy was hers but she sure did love the pup! Of course the puppy was adopted and Keira has been with us for a couple of years. She has some problems with her hips and her ACL. She had surgery on the worst ACL (right back leg) but will probably need another surgery for the other one eventually\n\nThe vet said she has a strong case of hip dysplasia. Pretty much bone on bone.\n\nThe vet warned us once they tear one ACL there is a high chance the other ACL will tear. Which looks like is the case because she limps off and on the left back leg. We had an X Ray done and the assistant vet thought she had a slight tear but wanted the head vet to take a look at the X Rays. Which I havent had done yet. Instead Ive taken her to a chiropractor a couple times and give her supplements.",

IF YOU MEET OUR CRITERIA FOR ADOPTION OF THIS DOG, PLEASE FOLLOW THE LINK TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE PROFILE TO COMPLETE OUR ONLINE APPLICATION. THANK YOU!\n\nZulai is a springer spaniel mix of some sort. She is estimated to be four years old, but she acts like a puppy! Zulai is very friendly and loves to play with other dogs! This girl was rescued in the middle of a highway. She had recently had a litter of puppies and was underweight and not in very good health. She has gained weight and looks fantastic now. And of course, she is spayed now. No more puppies for her! Zulai has had basic training and she is very food motivated. Most importantly, Zulai needs a home with a good sized securely fenced yard. She gets along well with similar sized dogs who don't try to mount her. She would not do well left alone all day. She is not destructive but does have some separation anxiety and will bark when left alone. She is a super snuggle her and very much a people dog.\n\nAdoption Process: We are not first come first served. Indigo Rescue focuses on finding good matches between dogs and families to ensure life long adoptions. We deliver all dogs to their new homes. All of our dogs are in foster homes. If you\u2019re interested in meeting one of our dogs, please use the following link and complete our Adoption Application. You can either scan your completed application and email it to us at: info@indigorescue.org, or you can fax it to us at: 888-502-7660.\nThe link is not live, so you will need to copy and paste it into your browser: https://storage.googleapis.com/gator-users/user-680788/documents/d1742bff02e44c2ea25649cb45df5103/Pet%20Application%20Form%20December%202020.pdf\nIf the dog you're interested in seems compatible with your lifestyle we'll set up a time for you to meet the dog privately.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Indigo Rescue only adopts to homes within 30 miles of Portland because our volunteers deliver all of our dogs to their adoptive homes. We work very hard to create a family of our Indigo Rescue adopters because we want to be close enough to help in case there are any problems. We want everyone to be happy and successful!\n\n**ALL of our dogs, puppies, cats, kittens and rabbits come vaccined to their age, spayed/neutered and microchipped.\n\nThank you for your interest in adopting and saving a life.",

            "description": "Midas was pulled from MDAS in 2017 as a little buddy.  In December 2017, at approximately 6 months old, his foster mom adopted him.  To our surprise, in June of 2019, we were notified via email and phone that Midas was found in Northern Alabama.  After piecing together the timeline of events following his adoption thanks to the kind woman who had been taking care of him since the end of 2018 (we didn't know he was in Alabama), dealing with the uncooperative adopter from 2017, getting him vetted in Alabama, and arranging transport, Midas made his way from Alabama back to South Florida on July 4th thanks to very helpful transporters.  After hanging out with a few different fosters, Midas joined the 12th session of the Pawsitive Direction program.  Midas deserves a LOVING FOREVER home.\n\n** Approximately 3 year old Pit Bull mix\n\n** Neutered, UTD on shots, and microchipped\n\n** VERY dog friendly.  Participated in large playgroups at Trail of Hope Rescue (they generously housed him for us for 1 1/2 weeks before the session started because his temporary foster mom went out of town) and has been used this session to teach another dog boundaries and how to properly interact with other dogs.  Midas is patient, tolerant, and gives proper corrections to other dogs when needed which are awesome behavior traits.  He does not resource guard toys from other dogs (We don't know if he resource guards food from other dogs because we don't feed them together. Each dog eats in his/her own kennel out of respect for every dog in the program.).\n\n** Kid friendly\n\n** NO CATS ( we will NOT adopt to a home with inside or outside cats)\n\n** Medium energy.  LOVES balls whether playing fetch with one or just walking around with one in his mouth.  Enjoys hanging out in pools and playing with his canine friends.  LOVES to snuggle and be loved on, too.\n\n** Very sweet, loving, and so handsome\n\n** House/kennel trained\n\n** Graduated fully obedience trained, AKC Canine Good Citizen (CGC) ready, and PhD in Canine Life and Social Skills (CLASS) ready\n\nInterested in adopting amazing Midas?  Please contact Nicole (561) 723-8197 or email loxanimalrescuecomm@gmail.com\n\nwww.facebook.com/loxanimalrescuecomm\n\nwww.facebook.com/pawsitivedirectionprogram",

I have fun playing by myself if I have to, but if you give me a sibling or take me on some play dates I will like that too. I do have a request, though. Please be patient with me while I get used to you. I don\u2019t mean to be so shy, but sometimes I\u2019m a little overwhelmed with new people. But once we get to know each other I can be fun and playful and also a perfectly lazy lapdog!\n\nPlease keep in mind that\u00a0adoption commitments must be placed online as we have an \"appointment only\" process during this time.\u00a0\n\nDue to the COVID-19, we are asking that only serious, potential adopters visit the shelter. Before coming to the shelter, please check the website prior to see any animals you are interested in and fill out the online application: http://www.humanesocietymiami.org/adopt-a-pet/  Please keep in mind that at this time, the shelter is not a place to visit to get out of the house.",

            "description": "Meet Kingston! Kingston is a 2 year old 100 lb Cane Corso/shepherd mix that entered our rescue from an over crowded city shelter in the fall of 2019. Kingston was initially treated for heart worm and still has insatiable thirst from prednisone treatment. He entered the rescue underweight and was likely a former backyard dog just based on his mannerisms and behaviors.  Kingston has a very playful temperament but he's a big boy, prone to guarding and he spooks easy.  He is not be suitable to live with small children.  Kingston walks well on a leash and knows basic commands. He is food motivated and has good recall. Kingston is dog friendly but likely will attempt to rough house rougher than most dog's comfort. Kingston is a high caliber dog, he's rough around the edges and is not suitable for an inexperienced owner/handler or even the average dog owner. His ideal home is without children or cats and with another dog or two and an experienced/ savvy owner. If you currently have a dog and are interested in adopting Kingston a fenced yard is required for him to live comfortably in a multi-dog household. Kingston is up to date on vaccines, neutered, microchipped, and crate trained. If you are interested in meeting and potentially adopting Kingston fill out an application on our website, bighairanimalrescue.com",

She was turned into the shelter with an open stab wound on her back and wax burns on her head and face. The owner who turned her in said that she was in a fight with another dog (a chihuahua) and to stop it they stabbed her and dumped hot wax on her, (WHAT). The shelter took her to an emergency vet who closed her wound. She was a shelter favorite and everyone just loved her so she was able to stay at the shelter long past her euthanasia date but eventually she became urgent. She dog tested well at the shelter on multiple occasions including multiple play groups and without knowing the situation with the fight it's hard to know what exactly happened or who was at fault. \n\nKatniss had a foster step up however an incident occurred at his home within the first couple days of being there with one of his dogs we have no idea what happened. After a long and dramatic ordeal Katniss was dropped off at boarding where she has been since. We had been networking her privately but at this point it's clear that she will need the public's help to get her into a foster or adoptive home. \n\nWhat does Katniss Need?\nA home with no other dogs or someone who is experienced enough to crate and rotate and slow introductions. \n\nKatniss' Likes\nKatniss loves people, even though she has all the reason to hate them. She is cuddly and sweet and epically charismatic. \n\nKatniss' Dislikes\nI don't want to say she dislikes all dogs because I truly don't think that's correct. She has been dog tested in boarding and in the shelter and was fine. We have no desire to risk setting her up to fail and that's why we are looking for an only dog home, or an experienced owner who can crate and rotate do slow introductions and work with her as she deserves. We do have some trainers who we will happily pay to help. We are looking for a home without small dogs, cats or other small furry critters.\n\nKatniss' Health\nKatniss is up to date on vaccines and her stab wound has healed well. She has someone who is happy to take her to be spayed ahead of her move to her foster/adopter. \n\nKatniss deserves the world. She has really been dealt a bad hand in this world and truly deserves a life with a family of her own. To meet her is to love her, you don't stay alive at this high kill shelter that long past her euthanasia date just because. Katniss is wishing and waiting.\n\nCan you be her miracle?\n\nIf you are interested in fostering or adopting Katniss please contact us ASAP! We want to see her thrive!",

HE WEIGHS ABOUT 59 LBS.   What he does have is an abundance of affection and  high spirits.  He also has one aim in life--to light out for the territory.  HE NOT ONLY NEEDS AN ABOVE GROUND FENCED-IN YARD; HE NEEDS AN INVISIBLE FENCE!  If he doesn't have an electric back up, he'll climb up and over any fence and light out for part unknown. \n\nOtherwise, B\u2019See is a dream dog.  He\u2019s crate trained, house trained, walks well on a leash, rides well in the car and most important, he\u2019s extremely affectionate.\u2014 a real leaner.   BUT because he\u2019s got some hound in him,  B\u2019See MUST HAVE A SECURELY FENCED IN YARD.\n\nHe does like to chew hard, wooden objects, which probably means he's still quite young.  Fortunately, he accepts corrections very well and will willingly let you redirect him from one poorly chosen object to another acceptable chewing object---like a raw meaty bone or kong.\n\nDo feel free to call me and talk about B'See.\n",

            "description": "This beautiful girl is Lilly!\n\nLilly is a female, Blue Nose Pitbull rescue who is estimated to be 3-5 years old. She is very healthy, spayed, vaccinated, and potty trained.\n\nShe knows the commands sit, come, lay down, roll over, and high five. She is very playful and affectionate. She loves to give high fives, play fetch, and tug of war. She wants to be lying down next to you whenever she's given the chance. She's so attentive and curious about everything her human is doing.\n\nLilly is very shy and timid, but very friendly with people. She does need time to adjust to new situations/people. When she meets new people, she paces back and forth and may bark quietly out of nervousness. Once a new person sits on a couch, she'll run up to you and start to kiss you, give you high fives, and allow you to pet her. She is a very sweet dog who cares about doing well.\n\nShe's had a very rough life prior to being rescued about two years ago. The shelter that Lilly was rescued from was overflowing with dogs. She was attacked by other dogs at the shelter twice in the same week, and as a result, she has scars on her front arms and face. Because of her history, she is very nervous around other dogs and will act aggressively.\n\nShe is scared of kids (attempts to run away/pulls on leash), and has never been in a home with kids. She needs a loving and experienced owner who has a yard and no other pets.\n\nIf you think Lilly is for you, please fill out an application at www.doggiebonez.com so that we can schedule a meet and greet. She is also on all of our social media pages IG: @Doggie_Bonez_Inc_ and Facebook: Doggie Bonez.\n\nIf adoption isn't an option, please consider fostering one of our pups. We are a volunteer run non-profit dog rescue and always welcome new short and/or long term doggie foster families. We greatly appreciate the help and time of our fosters. You provide all the love, comfort and safety of a home and we supply you with everything else you may need, dog food, dog bed, toys, medical attention (if needed) etc. If you are interested please visit www.doggiebonez.com to see all of our available dogs who need a foster family while waiting for their fur-ever home and complete the foster application.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.UPDATE\n\nIn January 2020, we found an injury on Princess Mia's abdomen and took her in to the vet for stitches. We don't know how she got the injury -- she was in a space all to herself, so it couldn't have been caused by another dog. Her shelter was a 12' x 12' horse stall with wood walls, and the stall's small yard has woven wire fencing -- no barbed wire to get caught on. So it's a mystery. The vet put in a drain tube and stressed the importance of keeping the injury clean, so we moved Princess into the house. She stayed in our \"dog infirmary\" on her own, using a small fenced patio for her potty needs. As she got better, she started going over the patio fence (which is only 3' tall) to explore our fenced yard. After a few weeks of recovery, we took her out to a small pasture, thinking she would be very happy to get back to a pasture and have more freedom. We were wrong. First chance she got, Princess followed us back to the house, and she has lived inside ever since. She is still extremely shy, but she is getting a little braver every day. At first, she hid in a bedroom closet. Then she started coming into the kitchen. Finally she ventured into the family room. Now, Princess spends most days on the floor next to Lynnette's desk, and she spends her evenings next to the sofa. She goes outside to potty, and occasionally walks around, checking things out in the yard, but generally, after a few minutes, she comes right back to the same door she went out, ready to come back in the house. So after a lifetime of living in the pasture and not being handled by humans, Princess has decided to retire and start a second career as a house pet. \n\nORIGINAL INTAKE STORY\n\nPrincess Mia has been guarding goats her whole life, until her human died. Like so many people, her owner was the kind who thought you just put a puppy in the pasture and let her do her job. No human interaction. No veterinary care. The natural result of this outdated way of thinking is that the dog has a variety of health issues and has no reason to trust humans. It was a real challenge for local rescuers and animal control in the Waco area to wrangle Princess into the truck so she could go to the vet. But thank heavens they were persistent. Thanks also for the amazing Dr. Meier and her team at All Heart Veterinary Center, who sedated Princess in the truck, to reduce the stress of being moved out of the truck and into the clinic. Princess was spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, and heartworm-tested (she is positive but is being treated). She also had puncture wounds on her mouth/cheek from an unknown source, so Dr. Meier cleaned those wounds and stitched up the larger ones. Princess is now settled in one of our barn kennels, where she appreciates the canned food, which I'm sure is easier on her injured mouth, and which is great for hiding her meds. She hasn't yet tried out her brand new bed, but hopefully she'll figure that out soon enough. We're encouraged that she lets us pet her every time we go inside the kennel. Some dogs who have been raised hands-off as she was, will not tolerate human touch. We will take our time with this sweet girl, hoping to earn her trust.",

Once I know and love you, I become slightly protective and lots of people coming and going make me nervous. Plus I will need to be your one and only furry best friend.

She is always happiest around people and LOVES to have your attention. Birdie enjoys exploring outside and would love a fenced-in yard to do that! She gets along with dogs of all sizes but would be perfectly content as your one and only so that she doesn't have to share your attention.\n\nDon't let her age sway you, she has energy to play and take short walks and loves to snuggle up with you afterward.\n\nShe is a great cuddle buddy, has the cutest snore, and is treat motivated. Birdie does have some hip/joint pain when she goes to sit down but moves around really well otherwise. She also does not need to be crated as she does not like it.\n\nBirdie should go to a home where her humans are home all the time. She's older and leaving her alone for 8 hours a day is not ideal for her.\n\nBirdie can be protective of her surroundings and her humans, so new people coming over just need to slowly let her come to you on her terms. If she doesn't know you she does not like you touching her on the head/face area. If you have treats she will warm right up and once you have earned her trust, she will love you forever and willingly accept all pets and belly rubs you have to offer!\n\nBirdie enjoys her stuffed animal toys as well as peanut butter filled bones. She doesn't ask for much. She simply wants her furever family to love her unconditionally.\n\n**Please note we do not adopt to Canada due to border issues and breed specific legislation.Adoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, deworming, and flea treatment.",

Since Hope bonds so strongly with her people, she tends to get jealous of other dogs in the home, therefore must be an only dog. She is hopeful to find an owner that will be her best friend and promises to never let you down, like people in her past have apparently done. If you have room in your heart and family for a bundle of love... please read about the Adoption Requirements, Fees, Forms & Process and apply with our online application @ https://www.arfla.org/info/adoption.

Bear was dumped in the streets unable to walk and with several medical issues from living with uncaring owners who never provided medical care. He is now fully recovered and thriving. We have noticed he is weary of Men. From our experience most probably because he was abused by a Man but this does not take away from Bear being a love bug, sweet, gentle soul. He loves to walk around with his stuffed animals in his mouth, take walks and smell the fresh air or just lay down next to his human and cuddle. He is approximately 8 years young, house broken, neutered, up to date with vaccines and micro chipped. He is currently in foster care awaiting his second chance and forever home. Even with the rough life Bear has had, he is an awesome dog and would make any family home complete. Please consider adopting an older dog , I promise he will melt your heart.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website. All of our dogs and cats are in foster homes and we have no paid staff. If you have questions concerning a specific animal, PLEASE fill out an application and the foster parent will be in touch. We will not arrange any home visits with any of our dogs and cats until your application is processed. Please understand our foster parents are precious to our 2nd Chance family; without them we cannot function, so we do our best to not burden them with multiple appointments. Our foster parents will choose their top 3 applications and arrange home visits with these applicants. The adopter will be chosen at that time. The process can take anywhere from a week to a month. We want to make sure our little furry ones are placed in their 'forever home' and never have to go through a rehoming again!Update- Sweetie has seizures. She will need to be on medication for the rest of her life. She will need blood work every 6 months so it is not cheap and she cannot go somewhere where someone is not at home to get her immediately to the hospital if needed.I came to the ranch way overweight. The nice ladies there worked with me and my sons to get us trim and healthy. Man did we start to have a lot of fun when we could run around easy!!! Lets just say we got our 'groove' back. We might even be called a little mischevious :) We LOVE to cuddle all 3 of us together in a pile and we have a lot of fun playing in the play yards! The ladies have promised we will get to stay together and have a fenced yard. However long it takes 2nd Chance says we deserve to be valued and kept healthy :)If you are looking for a Grumble fill out an app and we will be in touch!Please fill out an adoption application:\nAdoption application (Dog)\nAdoption Application (Cat)\n\nPlease understand we do not adopt out dogs to\nfamilies with children under the age of 5. We do not adopt dogs to renters. Some dogs will have fence requirements while others may not.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment. The dogs and cats in our system find themselves there, for the most part, because their humans did not have the same loyalty to them as they did to their owners. We do not take the adoption process lightly, and will do everything in our power to make sure the animal is placed correctly the first time around for your sake and theirs. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!",

Her medical needs were taken care of and she was spayed. Gwen has now packed on a few pounds and she's waiting for her perfect home.\n\nGwen needs to be in a home without any other pets. She is food and treat aggressive with other dogs.\n\nThis large, strong girl is looking for a single owner, or a family with teens, who has had previous large dog experience and will respect her need for slow introductions to a new environment. She requires someone able to set boundaries and handle her with firm, loving guidance.\n\nGwen can be very sweet and loves to play, if you are on her list favorite people. She is picky when it comes to choosing people to love. Possible adopters should be prepared to visit her several times in order to convince her that you are deserving of her affection. We know that she is well worth the effort!",

            "description": "Meet Annabel, a 3 year old female Mountain Cur mix.  She has a smooth light tan coat with the black muzzle and head like a Cur.  Annabel is a good size dog weighing 40 pounds and this is full grown.  She was pulled from our local animal shelter where she had been picked up by Animal Control as a stray and no one came down to claim her.\n \nAnnabel can be a little shy and cautious on first meeting but warms up once she gets to know you.  We adopted her out but she was returned after 5 months.  It seems Annabel likes to be in control of the attention she gets and independent in her own space. She\u2019s a little like a cat, she is so sweet and wants attention but will walk away and do her own thing once she\u2019s had enough love! Then, after a break, she usually comes back for more! She was stressed and anxious in her new home and had stomach and incontinence issues, no fault of the adopters, we just think she needed \u201cspace and yard time to just be a regular dog.\u201d \n\nOnce she got back to our facility we gave Annabel the largest run and has her own yard to hang out in and she LOVES this!  She has been so happy and not had any stomach or incontinence issues. She has also started playing the most relaxed games of fetch ever! We still bring her in at night and crate her and she has had no issues.  So we feel she would be happy as an outside dog during the day.  She loves seeing people and being loved on so she is not to be just left in the yard with no attention.\n \nAnnabell recently completed her treatment for heart worm and is on prevention. She is back to her normal loving self and regular activity! \n\nAnnabel is a very sweet, loving dog.  She loves to be with people but just not all the time it appears.  However she doesn\u2019t seem to like young boys, something must have happened in her past cause she does get upset and barks a lot when sees a young male.  We feel she may be better in a home with no children.  She seems to get along with other dogs but would certainly do a trial to make sure.  We all love Annabel \u2013 her quirks and all \u2013 and she gives lots of love right back to you!\n\nAnnabel is up to date with her vet care, spayed and is microchipped.  She is on flea/tick prevention.  Annabel just needs that special home where she feels comfortable and loved but yet still have her independence. \n\nAll HSWA dogs are either at our Dog Adoption Facility or in foster homes. All dogs require an appointment to meet.  Please call us at 205-554-0011 or email humaneswa@yahoo.com to request an appointment to see the dog/puppy and to check availability.\n\nVisit us on Facebook! www.facebook.com/humaneswa\n\nOur adoption fee is $75.  Read more information on our adoption process at www.humanesocietyofwa.org/howtoadopt.html.  Then, if you feel your home might be the right forever home and you would like to adopt a dog, submit an online adoption application. The online applications may not work on mobile devices. If the online application does not work on your device, look to the right side of the forms page for a downloadable .PDF copy of the application.",

ADOPTION IS $150.00.\n\nYou know what we don't want to do? We really don't want to have Augie spend another Christmas with us! Nope, we want him to spend Christmas with a family all his own!\nWe just don't get t?\nThis boy is a doll! He needs a shepherd savvy family that wants a big ole lovebug of a dog and is just willing to give him a forever home.\nThe fact he has been with us since a pup may have folks questioning what \" might be wrong with him\"? Nothing at al!\nAugie came to us as a young pup and by the time he was ready for adoption COVID hit, meaning no events, no exposure. So here we are.\nAugie has been neutered, he is microchipped, he tested negative for heartworms, he weighs about 65 pounds, he is crate trained, he does well on car rides, he needs a strong handler for leash walks, he hates squirrels, he is not a fan of cats so no-go on that, and more than anything he needs a family that will be patient and permit him to adapt to a forever home.\nAugie is a shepherd so he needs to \" work\". That means he thrives having activities! Things as simple as keeping a basket of toys in a livingroom and teaching them to \" clean up\" by gathering toys. This is actually a great activity and sometimes doubles as a searching or hunting game. Taking him for a long walk, a jog, a bike ride, or for play in the park, are all great activities.\n\nShepherds do best in active homes, so if you have one, make this a priority. Excess energy will lead to misbehavior, dogs are like children in that regard. Give them something to do, something that helps them burn off that energy, and they will be happy.",

He was pulled from a rescue group in Port Aransas. he was minutes away from euthanasia! Hans was intact, heartworm positive. We decided to take him into our rescue after I saw his face on a rescue plea and noone was stepping up. Something just told me this guy only a year old deserved a second chance to live. I met the rescue to pick up Han's he still had huge ticks all over his body. He had been given tick prevention but there were so many still clinging to him. He was very thin his backbone was sticking up and you could see his ribs. It's taken just over a year to get him healthy. We found out after x-rays were taken he had been shot with a pellet gun many times. His back seemed painful to touch. Our regular vet thought he could have a tick born disease?  After x-rays and several blood panels the vet referred us to a local specialist, Dr. Tyson a internal medicine doctor at the Central Texas Veterinary Specialty hospital in Round Rock. After blood work and steroids it was determined he had autoimmune disease, which is controled with a small amount of prednisone.  Prednisone is very reasonable financially, so really not a burden in that department.  We got the ok for heartworms treatment which was several months of recovery and then he got neutered. Hans has been retested he is heartworm negative.  He does not have back pain anymore and is a happy, healthy boy. He's one of Dr.Tyson's favorite patients.  Han's does not mind the vet at all it's old news to him!\n",

Momma was a street dog just looking for a safe place. By the time we were notified the finder couldn\u2019t catch mom and only 5 of the 8 pups were under her porch as she knew a neighbor took 2 which broke our heart. Transport brought us the 5 pups with the hope of Mom and her other pup to follow.  She eventually befriended mom who we named Marie (after her caretaker) and she and her other pup were finally able to make the trip to north TX. Marie was extremely shy as she had spent her life fending for herself on the cruel streets of South TX so living in a house surrounded by people was a very scary thing. \n\nWe were confident that one day Marie would learn to love life as an indoor family pet .... and she proved us right!  She now seeks out attention and love from her foster family so we know with a little patience she is going to thrive in a forever home! Marie is 3-4 years old, approx 45 lbs and way over due having a family to call her own. Marie currently lives with dogs of all sizes and cats.\n\nIf you would like to meet Marie, the first step in the process is to complete an application.  Please go to roadtrip4paws.com and click on the Adopt tab to find a link to our online application or copy the following link to your browser  https://form.jotform.com/53098141083150.  \n\nHome visits required for all dog adoptions\n\nWe reserve the right to refuse placement of an animal for any reason",

            "description": "Bruno was a stray found and taken in by a dog loving family. He is a handsome TWC - Treeing Walker Coonhound. He just had his vet visit for vaccinations, is heartworm negative , neutered and between 5-6 years old. If you've never met a TWC, they are truly characters. Bruno is good with other dogs when properly introduced and loves attention. He is good in his crate but would need a securely fenced yard to stretch those loooooong legs. \n\nAdoption fee: (Cash/Check) $175 (Credit/Debit) $180.  This includes vet care and vaccines up until adoption, spaying/neutering, and microchip. If you have questions about an animal, please complete an adoption application at sqrescueinc.org  FIRST.  Someone will reach out to you once you are approved and be able to answer all your questions. Your application must be approved prior to meeting our dogs. Missing or incomplete information will delay processing of applications.  For questions about the application process, you may call 803.223.9729 and leave a message.",

            "description": "Hi my name is Lilo (like from the movie Lilo & Stitch)! I am a year and a half old and around 40 pounds. My fosters believe I am a cur / feist mix due to the shelter I came from and my spunky squirrel lovnig (chasing) personality. I spent 3 months with my training auntie to work on my leash reactivity (which, I'm a teenager, cut me some. slack!) Aunti just LOVED me so much, her favorite thing to say about me is \"this dog is so fun!\" . \n\nI need a 6foot privacy fence due to my kangaroo like jumping abilities! I enjoy kongs, puzzle toys, sniffaris, and snuffle mats for mental stimulation.\n\nAll I want is a forever home with an active family (or semi active - fun agility at home doggo!) as I make a great sidekick!\n\nI wouldn't mind a brother to play with that is my size or bigger since I just love to play and am too pushy for most other females and those little dogs are so pesky(no offense!).\nI require a really good one on one decompression with slowly getting me to play and meet my Stitch. I don't require a brother, and would be happy just doing COVIID-19 at home agility coursse or basic bonding at home.\n\nI AM A BIG cuddler and love waiting for your direction on what's on the list of fun next! I love goofing around and playing with my stuffed toy, tossing it around and chasing after it, as I can keep myself entertained for hours!\n\nI am a very sweet dog when people come to visit and knows no stranger and excited to meet (and get pets) from everyone I comes across. I would need to live with older kids in the home since I am super bouncy and love giving hugs. \n\nLilo prefers male dogs, plays loud and rough but will calm down when redirected, and enjoys cuddles and hugs. \n \n\nCrate trained, house traiend, leash trained - but we'd prefer a calmer non-hiking no dog parking (until her leash reactivity is 100% worked on) lifestyle for her.\n\nApply here: https://petstablished.com/pets/public/492358\n\nAdoption process: fouron.org/adoption-process\n\nWe will not answer questions pertaining to questions that are clearly stated on her profile, already due to the overwhelming amount of inquiries we recieve. Please apply, and we will match you with the appropraite dog. Thank you!",

Although Ben is almost completely blind he gets around great. He just needs a quiet, stable, loving home where he can spend his retirement days. He enjoys going in and out, so a dog door and fenced yard would be best for him.\n\nBen needs a home with no stairs, no cats and no children. He might be okay with another old large dog, but being sight impaired, he can be quick to react because he is not sure what is coming at him.  A quiet, calm only dog home is best.\n\nAs with all senior dogs, Ben is slow with some arthritis, so short walks and weight maintenance will be essential. He is on thyroid medication daily, but it is a very inexpensive prescription.\n\nMost of our dogs require a fully fenced yard, this does depend on the individual dogs needs and safety requirements.  \n\nOur dogs are fed a nutrient rich dog food named NutriSource.  Our experience is a high quality dog food keeps vet bills down and well-being high.\n\nIf you have any questions please email: claudiaatwag@gmail.com\n\nVisit our website to fill out an Adoption Application  http://www.wagsequimwa.com\n\nAdoption donation fee $250.00  (Please understand this adoption donation goes towards helping all the dogs we rescue)",

            "description": "Blue prefers to just be called Blue. And not Old Man Blue which is what we sometimes call him to distinguish him from Baby Blue. At a young-at-heart 9 years old, Blue still has a lot of pep in his step and would like it if you save that Old Man business for someone else, thank you very much! Blues favorite pastime is hanging out in the play yard so he can meander about and do lots of sniffin (and maybe a zoomie or two). He says that is SO much better than sitting in a shelter kennel. Blue is clever, too when hes ready for a treat, he will approach you and demonstrate his perfect sit. Then hopefully, you will demonstrate your perfect treat dispensing! Blue has some handling sensitivities. It may sound complicated but ultimately it means that he needs people to go at his pace and respect his boundaries. His volunteer champion Sophie says that he is a smart, sensitive boy and she always looks forward to spending time with her favorite old man. Blues ideal home would be low-traffic and adult-only. It would also be well-stocked with pupperonis and bully sticks!

We think that sounds pretty perfect too, Blue! To contact his foster, email maggie.lakeway@yahoo.com",

She has no idea, that she's might be intimidating to some people due to her size. She thinks, she's a lap dog and loves to snuggle. She's a very gentle girl and will do best in a calm, adult household with yard access. Rosie is a great combo of couch potato and exercise partner. \nContact \nIngrid \n(310) 480 6030\npcdrapps@yahoo.com\nIf you'd like to meet this cutie, please fill out our adoption application: http://www.pcdogrescue.org/online_application.html",

Animal Control was called because he was \"borrowing\" things from a lady's yard to play with.\nHe was taken to the Allendale County Shelter at a time it was completely empty. The only thing he had to play with was his metal bowl. It became an obsession. He would scoot it across his shelter run day and night. If we took him out for a walk, the bowl came with.\nA post on the Allendale County Shelter page about Cyrus went viral, and a couple came forward wanting to adopt him. So we got him neutered. The application looked good. We thought he was finally home.\nUnfortunately, he was returned the next day. He has been at our Dogport foster center since then. Here, he has been showered with attention and toys. He has discovered real toys, and he no longer finds metal bowls to be that interesting. He also looks forward to his daily walks.",

            "description": "Name: Kermit\nBreed: Terrier Mix\nAge: 6 years old (as of 2020)\nTemperament: Friendly\nGood with other dogs: No\nGood with Cats: unknown, but can test for approved applicant\nGood with kids: Only 12+ years old\nHeartworm Status: Negative\n\nKermit sadly was neglected and confined to a small cage, which prevented his legs from developing correctly. In turn, he does not walk like other dogs as his legs are bowed. He is the sweetest boy and deserves a great family.\n\n He loves bellyrubs above all else. He also really appreciates being put on a leash and walked for as long as his legs will let him...and then more bellyrubs. This is actually his preferred position, hence his crazy happy photos! He would make a great couch potato kind of dog, perfect family dog. He is very good natured and a jovial kind of dog that has no idea he is any kind of different.\n\n\n----\nPeach County Animal Rescue is a rescue located in Fort Valley, GA. Our adoption fees range from $250-350+. Although our rescue dogs share a common bond with one another, no rescue story is the same (even when similar). Vetting costs vary depending on their health conditions. All of our dogs are fully vetted: up-to-date on annual shots, spayed/neutered and microchipped with a lifetime registration. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nIf you would like to send in an application for this dog, please use the link below! https://peachcountyanimalrescueandrehabilitation.org/apply-now-2/",

            "description": "Hi there, I'm Tillie!\n\nI'm an 11-12 year old miniature poodle mix. I am a spayed female that weighs around 22-lbs. I currently live with other dogs and cats and I do fine but I prefer my alone time with my human. Though I do prefer cats over dogs.I am partially potty-trained, I do have some accidents which I am working on. I do have some health concerns that my future family need to tend to, I am visually impaired and my foster mom believes a bit deaf too. Due to this I get startled very easily and I redirect if approached from behind ( blind spots). AT feeding time I must be separated in a crate to eat I do have some old lady lumps but still considered quite pretty by all... Despite my little quirks I am in search of the perfect home which would entail NO KIDS UNDER 14, and would prefer to be an only dog or live with calm adult dogs.\n\nIf interested in adopting me visit http://tucsoncoldwetnoses.com/adoptable-pets/ and fill out the application and my foster mom will get back to you within 24 hours. My adoption fee is $190 plus an additional $21 for my county license.\nSent from my iPhone\n\n*Applications to adopt: wwwTucsonColdWetNoses.com Home Visit / ID and Residence Verification is required. Compliance does not imply or guarantee adoption. Approval is the sole discretion of CWN representative(s).",

            "description": "Bobby was seized in an animal cruelty investigation. He had not been around people much at all, so he was very shy when rescued.  However, he is doing so much better now!  He has been in a foster home for several months and his foster mom gave us this update, \"Bobby is about as easy going and relaxed as they come. He\u2019s very sweet and gentle. He can still be a little anxious at times but he\u2019s the sweetest dog around. He spends his time snoozing in his crate or on the couch. Once he\u2019s comfortable with you, he\u2019ll be your snuggle buddy. He even tries to sit on my lap at times! He also likes to follow me around. He adores our dog Jangles and gets along wonderfully with another foster dog in our home, too. He may be mellow inside but loves to run around with the other dogs outdoors. When he\u2019s done, he sits by the door to come in. Bobby is housetrained, crate trained and very quiet. And he usually puts himself to bed at night!\"  \n\nBobby will need a tall and sturdy fence at his new home because he can climb a chain link one. He also needs to go to a home with another dog. He will just feel more comfortable with one as a companion. His date of birth is 7/25/2015 and he weighs about 42 pounds.   \n\nYou can submit an adoption application for this sweet boy at http://www.fayettefcar.com/applicationform, where you can also review FCAR\u2019s adoption requirements.\n\nAll FCAR adoptable dogs have been spayed or neutered, are current on all vaccines, on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, microchipped, and come with a 30-day pet health guarantee. The adoption fee is $95 with an approved application. A fenced yard is required for Bobby, and because he can climb a chain link fence, a 6 foot privacy fence is required.",

He will chase every time but you'll need a second ball because he will not bring it back!  Tito is a special boy once you get to know him.  He needs a special adopter who is willing to come to the shelter several times to let Tito get to know you.  He doesn't like to be touched by strangers.  Tito does like other small dogs.  He is intimidate by bigger dogs.  (It was probably a big dog who took a chunk of his ear flap off).  \n\n If you are interested in meeting Tito, please stop in Tuesday through Sunday between 11:30 and 2 Pm.  Or you can call the shelter with any questions at (856) 663-3058.",

Delilah came to us with 3 adorable pups. Now that she has done her job as a mom she has been completely vetted and is ready to find her new forever family. She is a sweet girl but is really strong and does pull on leash. We are working on her with leash walking now. She would do best with another male dog but no females. Also no kitties for this girl as she thinks it is a game to chase them.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please read the information here and then complete our online adoption application. One of our volunteers will contact you once the application has been processed. If this animal is listed as a courtesy posting for another rescue please go to their website to complete the online adoption application.\n\n2/2/21 10:31 AM",

            "description": "Hi!This is Amelia! I had a rough start to life! My brother Taz and I were in doggie jail when we were puppies! We were so excited to get out of there and be adopted together! Unfortunately, we were left alone outside most of the time, but that was ok, we had each other! Then a year later when we were bigger, but still kids, we thought we would be big dogs and get out! But OH NO! We ended up in doggie jail again!!! It was MUCH scarier now than as pups! We were overwhelmed with all the noise, dogs crying and PEOPLE! We had never seen people much before and from the sounds of all the crying, they had to be BAD! Then we heard there was not going to be a second chance for us! But then a rescue took us out. There were less people, but just as scary! They fed us and thankfully left us alone, most of the time anyway. Slowly, since they fed us, gave us warm blankets, and talked soft to us, we were less scared but trembled anytime they came around... cause you never know, right? And sure enough, every week they would touch us all over and take us scary places and just traumatize us like crazy! It was horrible.But one day, we were excited to see them and every day after that was easier. Now, although we are still timid about new things, we love the people that take care of us and play and play with the other dogs and cuddle with the humans at night in bed. Soooo.... they say we are ready for our OWN home with our OWN people. We know it will be scary but they say they will find a MUCH better home than the shelter did AND it will be a home that understands and gives us time. And if, by some reason it doesn't work, they will come get us and keep us safe for the rest of our lives! WE DID GET A SECOND AND LAST CHANCE AFTER ALL!About me! I am a young athletic, happy girl who just wants to be loved and feel safe. I think I would be good at protecting my humans too! I prefer male dogs when playing as bully dogs drive me insane. Who do they think they are??? Bullying is just bad! But I could be an only dog too if I got plenty of play time with my human! I just want to love and be loved and safe. Come see me and see how sweet and pretty I am. I will make you proud!Amelia! Please visit me at http://www.rockyspot.org",

I have cataracts which essentially make me blind but I am sharp and will learn the layout of your home in no time! I also require insulin injections twice a day with my meals but I love food so I usually don\u2019t even notice that I\u2019m getting it. My previous owner told Speak! that he will continue to pay for my insulin following my adoption. I am also a cancer survivor! In February 2020, I had a cancerous liver mass removed. My surgeon says I can expect a cancer-free future and I am feeling better than ever!\n\nI currently weigh about 35 pounds; I am the perfect size. Despite my blindness, I am agile and sweet as can be. I really like to play and take short walks. Napping on a nice, soft bed or couch is another of my favorite pastimes.\n\nMy foster sister is a cat and we get along just fine. I am not very fond of other dogs; they tend to startle me and get up in my face which is aggravating when you\u2019re blind like me.  I am completely house trained and I let you know when I need to go out. \n\nI have a moderate energy level. Most of the time, I simply want to be near you and get some good head scratches. A fenced yard is good for me since I don\u2019t always know where I\u2019m at. I love my harness and walk well on a leash. \n\nI am a trusting and happy dog and don\u2019t even need to be crated when my foster mom is away. I will be up-to-date on my vaccinations and spayed at the time of my adoption. My adoption fee is $200. Please let us know if you have any questions or believe I would make a great companion for you!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please review our adoption policies and apply online at [www.speakfortheunspoken.com/adopt](http://www.speakfortheunspoken.com/adopt).\n\nVisit [www.speakfortheunspoken.com](http://www.speakfortheunspoken.com/) will give you more information about our rescue.\n\n***PLEASE READ*** WE DO NOT RESPOND TO PETFINDER OR EMAIL INQUIRIES. Please fill out an application on our website if you are interested in adopting this dog. We will only set up a meeting with the dog once you have an approved adoption application. We actively manage our dogs on Petfinder, the dogs listed are available for adoption. We will remove the dog from view once they are pending adoption.",

We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

He is completely vaccinated, neutered, microchipped and house-trained.  He is not a good fit with a family with other dogs or cats, but is great with children. Because of this, Rockney CAN NOT go to a home with other dogs or cats. \n\t\nRockney is a huge cuddle buddy, and very intelligent!  He can sit and shake on command and would love a new parent to teach him more tricks!  He loves car rides too!  As a large breed male, he needs to be taken on walks or even on runs daily and would love an active parent.  Rockney doesn't like a crate or small spaces but does well when left alone free roaming in the house. Rockney NEEDS to have a house with a fenced yard. \n\nGo to our website https://redfernanimalrescue.org/ and fill out an application if you are interested! Due to the amount of inquiries we are receiving, we are prioritizing adoption applications at this time. Make sure you\u2019re filling out an adoption application on Red Fern Animal Rescue\u2019s site in Colorado, as we are not a shelter in Tennessee! Please give us 48-72 hours to respond to you!",

I'm a shy girl, but I'm a sweetie - that's what my foster mom says. Like a lot of dogs, no one really knows my story before being rescued, so patience will get you far with me. That, and butt scratches. I hear they say \"What Lola Wants, Lola Gets,\" so butt scratches, it is. I really prefer to be the only apple of your eye, and can't live with other dogs or cats now.\n\nI love to go on walks and play in the water, especially the hose! My foster mom says I'm a smart girl who knows sit, lay, and crate on command (although I don't tear stuff up), and I would love to learn more. She says I love to cuddle, but am ok being alone as well, and if I'm feeling especially spunky, I will even show you my zoomies, and they are FUN-ny! Some things I don't like are thunderstorms, fireworks, and car rides.  \n\nI want my own family so bad!! Remember, \"What Lola Wants, Lola Gets\", so help me get what I want!\n\n**Lola is currently in a WI foster home!\n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is sponsored.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

I am a sweet boy once I am comfortable with people around me but I do tend to get nervous around new people, mainly men. I am potty trained and crate trained. I do LOVE treats so if you are worried about becoming my friend this is the way to my heart! I do have this nervous-tick and spin in circles and get a little irritated with myself and because of this I would be better to live in a home with no children. I am also a bit sensitive to touch in some areas and can get bitey.. I am a sweet loving boy that has some quirks that need work but I am great with dogs( as long as they are respectful) and don't really mind the cats either!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting me and understand that I will need to stay on task from what i have learned in my training. please visit tucsoncoldwetnoses.com/adoptable-pets/ and fill out the application and my foster mom will get back to you within 24 hours. My adoption fee is $175 plus an additional $21 for my county license.\n\n*Applications to adopt: wwwTucsonColdWetNoses.com Home Visit / ID and Residence Verification is required. Compliance does not imply or guarantee adoption. Approval is the sole discretion of CWN representative(s).",

            "description": "JOSIE is an approx 3 yr old, smallish Pit bull mix who was found limping around the city of Baltimore. At first it was thought that she had a painful birth defect but once they got in there to amputate it looked more like a bad break that had never been treated. Whether it was foul play or an accident we will never know. Josie has adapted well to tri-pawed life! While she has healed completely on the outside, we are working on her healing from the inside. Someone must have been terribly mean to Josie. She was totally shut down when she arrived As terrified as she has been, Josie has never been snappy. She lets us hook up a leash and take her on walks which is helping her gain some confidence bit by bit. Josie is great with other dogs, not yet tested with cats but she is panicked by people. Looking for a home with another dog and a patient family who can make baby steps with her. Josie has been spayed, vaccinated, tested neg for heartworms and is microchipped. Adoption $200. Super special families apply at www.companimals.org.",

I am wanting to be adopted so I can have lots of room to run and play with my human. \n\nBreed:  Red Heeler Mix\nGender:  Male\nAge:  3 year old \nSize:  55 pounds\n\nPersonality\nI love people and being outdoors. I love to catch people's attention by wagging my cute little docked tail!  I LOVE attention! I am a little active when I am outside but once I am brought back inside I will relax and watch what's going on around me. Nothing makes me more excited than having attention from a human and especially when they have treats!   I will do anything for those! I have pretty good manners. I don't jump on people. I usually walk or do a little jog wherever I go. I am a farm dog and would love to live somewhere with a big yard or farmland to hang out with my human. Can I help you with your farm chores??? I Also would do best as an only dog.",

I'm full of energy too!\nMy fur is mostly black on top ,and brown on bottom, its kinda long, but the cool thing is I don't shed hardly at all!! I love to run, and greet you,  and give you lots of kisses. I was found traveling with my big brother Rusty Ruff in June .  I am only for adoption with Rusty Ruff, my brother..The nice people here couldnt find my old owners. They took us to the vet to have everything done.... So now  we are waiting for that fantastic , loving home of our very own! My dream would be to have a family adopt me and Rusty Ruff together. We are best friends after all. We were found traveling together, and we are about the same age. See the last pic of us playing in the yard together....I love my dry food, and  esp when they put wet food on top too. I am house broken, and I love my crate. I would very much enjoy trips to training school with you. Id love and do require a big  5-6 ft  height fenced yard to play in, with your dogs, and Rusty Ruff too!.... The vet said I am around  3 years old. I dont bark alot, but when first put in my crate, i will bark just a little.\nI do like to do some jumping up, because I get so excited, so small kids prob not a good idea. I weigh about 30 pounds. I am a jumper and will get out of a 6ft fence if there are things for me to jump on, and jump over, so the rescue says I must go to a very special home, that includes both of us   with dog savy people!  \nPlease contact my people soon, so I and  Rusty Ruff my brother can begin our new exciting life with you.      Thanks  Ringo Star",

I'm prob too big for small kids, as  I do jump up still. I'm a very smart boy ,and I'd love to go to obedience training school with my new person.I do know what  a leash is and like to go on walks. I was found traveling with a dog they call Ringo Star, we play very well together.. We really want to be placed together, since he is my brother for last  3 years..... What would be great is if you would consider adopting  Ringo Star too, so we could continue our friendship??!!.. Id love to live with a jogger , or someone active to keep me busy. I dont bark much, but will bark at cars  ,and bikes going down alley. Id need a big 5-6 ft fence so I can play in yard , when you are home . I love my dry food ,and especially the wet food on top. If you'd like to meet me , and my brother Ringo Star, please contact my people ,and  we can arrange a meeting soon please!               Love Rusty Ruff",

His Labrador traits shine through, as he is happy relaxing with you as a laid-back companion or playing.  \u201cButters\u201d as he is often called has white on his toes and chest that stand out against his golden-brown coat.  His soft, lovable eyes will melt your heart.  Butters was born in August of 2019 and sometimes saunters like a cat when he walks making him even more irresistible.  This handsome boy is a cuddle bug searching for a family where he can share is love.\n\nOur HALAH dogs are currently only available to meet by appointment at the Home At Last Animal Haven grounds.  PetSmart has temporarily suspended all in-store adoption events (due to COVID 19) until further notice.\n\nSee www.halah.org for more information and photos.

First, when this blind and deaf sweet Aussie/border collie puppy was rescued by Speak from an irresponsible breeder and then again when he found his way to a great adopter. But life happens and Ethans people are no longer able to care for him. Full of heartbreak, Ethans dad realized the best thing for this pup is to find a home where he will have an amazing life.\n\nEthan is one year old, is crate trained and is doing fantastically with touch commands. Hes not a fan of puppies or dogs that are smaller than he is, but does well with bigger pups -- as long as its not dinner time. Hed prefer a home without cats or small children. He will also require a fenced yard. So incredibly sweet, Ethan would excel best in a quiet environment where things are calm, and this joyful boy can have the loving life he deserves.",

Loves to lounge on his bed, chase his toys & hang out with his human.  Housebroke, crate trained.  Learning his leash skills. \n\nHank had a rough start to life.  His litter was left in a box at 1wk old.   Growing up without a mom has made him unsure of the world.  He is cautious of his surroundings & new people.  Needs time to warm up.  Once he is comfortable, he is your best friend!  He would love to find a home that will be patient with him & give him the space he needs to be loved!\n\nTO ADOPT:  www.almosthomerescuetx.org\n\nEMAIL:  Almosthomeanimals@yahoo.com\n\n** You can check out all his funny antics on our FB page** \nhttps://www.facebook.com/Almost-Home-Animal-Rescue-603130489724091/",

Her tail is always happily wagging.\n \nTootsie knows the command \u201csit\u201d and takes treats gently from your fingers. She loves treats!\n \nShe is being fostered in Chicago, where she has a few male dog friends. She appears to be cat-friendly too.\n \nTootsie is also wonderful with people of all ages. She is very sweet, snuggly and loving. She prefers cuddling with people to playing with toys.\n \nTootsie was found stray in Schaumburg, Illinois, and her teeth were all ground down. Perhaps she was chewing on a chain or rocks. She just had a dental to take care of her remaining teeth.\n \nShe is crate-trained and appears to be housebroken. To meet and possibly adopt Tootsie, please contact Melia at melia88@comcast.net or 708-224-1900 for an adoption application.\n \nHer adoption fee of $200 benefits the rescued dogs of Lucky Dog Rescue. She is healthy, spayed, up-to-date on vaccines, micro-chipped and heartworm-tested.",

She\u2019s around 5-6 years old and would do best in a home where she can be the only pet. She\u2019s a spunky and happy girl, who also loves to snuggle. She would do best with older kids because she is still very playful and could knock over small kids. Teeka is deaf, but that doesn\u2019t hold her back from being the happiest girl around.

I like kids and dogs but if you love your cat, I\u2019m not the dog for you. I am housebroken, crate trained and walk well on a leash. My ideal home and yard should be large enough to accommodate a big guy like me, a 5 foot (or taller) fenced yard and the opportunity to spend time indoors too\u2014especially when it thunders. I am neutered, heartworm negative, up to date on vaccinations and ready for a new home. Please call Dennis at 979.758.1804 for more information. My adoption fee is $75.00.",

We were able to save Ubert along with several others from a severe warehouse hoarding situation. This poor boy spent so much time suffering through horrendous neglect and now we are so glad that he finally has a chance to have the best new life! Ubert has gotten all the medical care he needed with our vet partner. His eyes were cloudy as a result of tick borne diseases that he acquired that were never treated. All of this has been resolved and as you can see his beautiful eyes are back to normal and as beautiful as ever! Ubert is such a handsome boy and despite what he has endured is very sweet although a bit anxious. Men scare Ubert, so he will need to go slowly with an understanding family if there are males in the home. Ubert doesn't really know what to expect from life, so he needs to progress in baby steps. He is good with other dogs. We can't wait to see Ubert finally enjoying a warm, safe, comfy home of his own where he can get all the unconditional love that he has not known yet. If you can be the special person who can give this special prince his happy ever after, please fill out an adoption application for Ubert here! Www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org",

            "description": "I have been sponsored. Thank you Carolyn Boothe for sponsoring me in December. Makio is a big handsome brute who is transferred in from a partner shelter. He had arrived to them when his family moved out and left him behind. He's social and friendly with people but does not seem to be a fan of other dogs.\n\nDogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Our cat test should be used as a general purpose screening only to rule out overt aggression; we always recommend caution when introducing dogs to cats in the home. Recommendation on suitability of placement with children by their ages is based on behavioral observations including energy level and response to body handling. We never recommend leaving young children unsupervised with dogs, and we cannot guarantee the behavior of dogs with children, other pets or cats. Behavior evaluations should be considered as a snapshot of the behavior of the dog at this point in time; SCPR believes all dog families need to be prepared to invest time and energy into training as well as provide common sense management of their new dog. We always encourage family to do some research on the breeds or mixes of breeds prior to adoption as many can have some unique characteristics that may or may not fit into their families. For more information about this dog or any others at our Shelter, please visit www.doitforthedogs.com. We are the Second Chance Pet Rescue in Grove, OK. 918-786-7630. You can email us at doitorthepets@gmail.com.",

            "description": "Breed: Pit Bull mix\nSex: Female\nDOB: ~09/20/2018\nWeight: 49.8 lbs\nGood with: Some dogs\nEnergy Level: Medium\nPersonality Type: Timid but Loyal, Snuggle Bug!\nHistory: Stray\nIdeal Home: No cats or kids! Apartments ok if no breed restrictions!\nSpecial Info: Knows some commands, good on leash!\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

            "description": "Quinn was rescued from Memphis, TN in July of 2019. He spent some time in a temporary foster home before he traveled up to New York on September 7th to join his permanent foster family. He was Heartworm positive, but has undergone treatment and has recovered well.\n\nQuinn a big strong boy at around 66 lbs and is estimated to be around four years old. He is selective about who he trusts and will need continual training and reinforcement to teach him that new people and strangers are okay. For this reason only homes with experience will be considered. \n\nWith his foster family he is a big lover and just wants to be near his people. He will follow you from room to room to make sure he's not missing anything. He is not a barker and prefers to snuggle at your feet or next to you on the couch. He knows his commands and follows verbal directions well. \n\nHe is a submissive dog and does well with other dogs and kids with proper introductions. No cats for Quinn as he will chase. Because of his size children 6 and up would be best. He would love a family with older kids who could play with him and tire him out!\n\nBecause of his Heartworm status he will need to be kept on monthly preventatives for the rest of his life with no exception. He also needs someone with considerable experience, preferably a strong personality who understands dog behavior and training. If you think you are a good match for Quinn, apply at http://bit.ly/HHAdoptApp and we will be in touch!",

She needs a home with a family who is able to give her time & attention and space to run. She may do best with an older dog or a laid back, confident male. It's unknown if she gets along with cats. Stella is working on being becoming house trained. \n Stella is very nervious with loud noises. .. Thunder, fireworks guns being fired.\n\n\n\nStella needs a home where she will not be crated a lot.  She goes to the bathroom in her crate. Now whether that is a behavior thing as she does not like a crate we don't know.  She does go to the bathroom outside also.  She does play well with other dogs and is a sweet little girl.\nPlease consider fostering or adopting. Our rule is if wanting to adopt you would live with Stella for at least two weeks to make sure it is a good fit.\nYou must have a vet reference, a fenced yard, no small children and be a permanent resident of the Jacksonville, Fla area.\nNo apartments.

She arrived as a stray.  Her ten pups have found their new homes, so now it's Poppy's turn!     \n\nApproximate Age / Weight:  2..5 years and 63lbs. \n\nPersonality:   Miss Poppy became pregnant when she was really just a pup herself.  Our vet believes this could have been her second litter.  Luckily, our girl is food-motivated and already walks nicely on a leash.  She\u2019s happiest when outside, rolling on the ground and getting awesome belly rubs!  Poppy also enjoys noshing on a chew toy.  She can be a bit pushy, not realizing her size and manners at times, but has graduated from training class and continues to work on this in her foster home.   Poppy is interested in playing with other dogs, but hasn\u2019t learned good manners or appropriate social skills  in that department so being an only dog  is best.\n\nForever Home:   Poppy is very nervous and not confident when meeting new people. She does not trust others quickly and prefers a quiet home or a family that knows to keep Poppy safe when people come over by crating her in another room. She\u2019s a very strong and determined girl, so a physical fence is a must! No invisible and no tie out. Once she trusts her people she is awesome!! She loves to cuddle, loves her walks, and loves playing fetch and tug. Poppy needs experienced dog owners and to be the only dog in the household.\n\nPlease contact wtdr2008@yahoo.com if interested in adopting Poppy!\n\n\n\n <p align=\"\"justify\"\">\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Pre-Adoption Application:</strong></p>  To be considered for a dog, it is best to submit a pre-adoption application.  The pre-adoption application can be downloaded from our website - www.waggintailsdogrescue.org/adoptionprocess.html.  Just complete the application and email it back to wtdr2008@yahoo.com<p align=\"\"justify\"\">\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Waggin' Tails Adoption Information:</strong></p>  Waggin' Tails Dog Rescue has a standard adoption fee of $225 for adult dogs.  Different adoption fees apply for older dogs, small breeds and puppies - $125 for senior dogs (9 years +) , $275 for small breed dogs and $250 for puppies, plus a $50 deposit which is returned upon proof of spay/neuter.  Our adoption process includes an application, vet reference checks, and a home visit.<p align=\"\"justify\"\">Waggin' Tails Dog Rescue does not have a shelter facility.  All of our dogs are fostered in private homes.  To meet a dog in person, please see our event calendar on our website at www.waggintailsdogrescue.org for the latest information.  Arrangements can be made to meet our rescue dogs outside of Saturday adoption events after an approved application is submitted.  This application does not imply an obligation to adopt by the applicant or by the rescue group.<p align=\"\"justify\"\">  Our volunteers have made rescue a second job that they do in their spare time after coming home from full-time jobs.  E-mail inquiries are the quickest way to obtain information about a dog. <p align=\"\"justify\"\">Thank you for your support of rescue and your interest in a rescue dog!",

When we bathed him prior to neutering him, it was apparent he had never had a bath before. After arriving at the vet clinic, he worried about exiting his crate because the place was new to him. LJ had been captured, along with the Labradoodle he was running with, by a few dedicated volunteers after two weeks, by gaining the dogs' trust. He was seriously underweight but very dog-social and apparently unaggressive to people. He's a young dog, probably only about 2, and he weighs just over 70 pounds. 80 pounds would be an ideal weight for him, as he's fairly tall, possibly still growing.",

My foster mom changed it which is good. I look more like a Ginger anyway. I was found as a stray and spent a long time in this place called the pound. I got lucky because someone offered to babysit me until me new family found me. She thinks I am pretty awesome. Just read all the nice things she says about me. I am about 2 years old and weigh appx 60lbs\n\n\nThis is Ginger.   She's an energetic girl that loves everyone and everything, including kids, other animals, ropes, tennis balls and squeaky toys.  Ginger is housetrained, understands no and sit, and is learning to heel.  She would love a family with kids to run and play with\n\nIf you would like to meet me send an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and they will answer as soon as they can\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting...spay, heartworm test, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention and a wellness exam",

            "description": "Trapper lived the first year of her life on the streets by herself. She had never been touched by a human until she came to the shelter.  It was sheer luck that we got her and her 12 babies in the shelter. Her babies have long since been adopted and now we hope to find Trapper a forever home.  She is still weary of humans but hopefully over time she will warm up. She is treat motivated (hot dogs are her favorite) and walks well on a leash. Potential adopters should expect to spend a few days getting to know her before taking her home. Fenced/escape proof yard is a must as she would prefer to be on her own again.  She is sweet, just timid. If you have experience with these hard case dogs, please do not hesitate to contact us and/or come see Trapper.  \n\nTrapper does not like small animals (small dogs or cats), but she does well with calm dogs her size.  \n\nWE ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING BY APPOINTMENT ONLY DUE TO COVID-19\nUnless otherwise stated, the adoption fees for dogs over 5 months range from $50-$175. Puppies under 5 months are $175.00. Cats over 1 year are $35.00, kittens under 1 year old are $60.00. Dog adoption fees include a microchip. Cats can be microchipped by request for an additional $5.00.\nThe adoption fee includes the animal's surgery, vaccinations, flea preventative, deworming medication, sample bag of food/treat samples and a free first exam with participating veterinarians. Shelter policy and 2018 Indiana state law decrees all animals must be spayed or neutered prior to leaving the shelter.\nWE ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING BY APPOINTMENT ONLY DUE TO COVID-19\nOur shelter is open to the public on Monday- Saturday from 8:00 am -5:00 pm EST with the exception of Wednesdays on which we typically open by 1:00 pm. If you would like to make an appointment to meet one of our many adoptable animals, please send an email to us at pvchs@joink.com. To apply to adopt, you may download an adoption application from the Applications and Fees tab on our website. The web address is www.pvchs.cfsites.org. Please email the completed application to pvchs@joink.com.",

            "description": "Breed: Pit Bull mix\nSex: Neutered Male\nDOB: ~12/20/2013\nWeight: 56 lbs\nEnergy Level: Low-Medium\nPersonality Type: Adaptable and Smart!\nGood with: Dogs, no cats please\nHistory: Transferred in from another shelter, adopted and abandoned at\nIdeal Home: No cats or kids (teenagers ok!). Low-traffic home. \nSpecial Info: Knows a TON of commands and always willing to learn more! A bit of a couch potato indoors but enjoys walks, swimming, and playing with other dogs.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Dexter, please go to https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf to print and fill out an application. Since he is currently living in a foster home, please email your completed application to fostering@iheartdogs.org and our foster coordinator will follow-up to discuss next steps!\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

Navy does prefer the adult version of human and would be a great choice for anyone looking for a small quiet canine companion who will give a small sweet kiss upon demand. He also loves to get scratchies behind those fabulous bat ears. Navy asked us to convey that a small shoulder massage will not be frowned upon.\n\n*PLEASE VISIT THIS PET'S DETAILED PROFILE AT WWW.PETADOPTIONSERVICES.ORG\n\nCurrent on  vaccinations, spayed/neutered, and microchipped. Current on flea preventative and heartworm preventative. \n\n*Local adoptions (New Orleans and surrounding parishes) preferred. We do NOT ship animals\n\nIf you are interested, please fill out a Dog Adoption Application at www.petadoptionservices.org/forms\n\nOur adoptions include a foster period of 4-6 weeks so that you can be sure that this pet is a good fit without any pressure, and we are available to answer any behavior or training questions during that time (and beyond, if you wish).",

This Boxer-Lab mix came to Mostly Muttz Rescue from one of our southern affiliate shelters. The poor guy had been hit by a car, which caused an issue with his leg.\n\nIn the care of Mostly Muttz, Pluto was able to receive the medical care he needed and his leg was saved. He still uses the front leg for balance but not so much for bearing weight, so he gracefully distributes his 62 pounds of sleek-black loveliness over the other 3 strong legs.\n\nPluto is not so keen on other dogs, or cats. He does love people; both adults and older children.\n\nWhile the astronomers are trying to decide if Pluto is a planet or not, THIS Pluto can orbit right into your heart. Please visit https://www.mostlymuttz.org/adoption-application/ to submit an application for Pluto.\n\nAdditional adoption criteria: Children in the home MUST be 12-years-old or older.",

Most recently, Dixie was adopted for a year but returned this week after having potty accidents in her adoptive home. We have a trainer ready to help. But, even after a year, the adopter preferred returning her. We are so sad for our sweet Dixie girl. She was housebroken when she was with us initially, so we don't know what happened. She will also sit (most of the time) for treats. \n\nDixie LOVES people. She is also good with friendly male dogs, but we do not recommend a home with cats. \n\n\nThanks for considering a Cane Rosso Rescue dog! \nWe place dogs mostly in Texas but have adopted out a few out-of-state as well.\n \nIf you are interested in one of our dogs, please first complete our adoption application.\nYou can find it at http://www.canerossorescue.com/application/ . Her adoption fee is $300. Our dogs are spayed or neutered,\nmicrochipped, vaccinated and heartworm tested and treated (if tested positive) before \ngoing to a new home.

Goliath is also a velcro dog and needs a person that will be with him most of the time. He is the biggest sweetheart well, iif you are not a chicken) and just wants to be someone's baby. Goliath, although deaf, does understand facial expressions and hand signals). He actually listens quite well. 10/9/2019: GOLIATH IS NEUTERED AND READY TO GO! HE IS LISTED AS SPECIAL NEEDS BECAUSE THE VET BELIEVES THAT GOLIATH IS DEAF AS HE DOES NOT RESPIND TO SOUNDS/NOISES/OR BEING CALLED. HE HAS ALSO, UNFORTUNATELY, TESTED POSITIVE FOR HEARTWORMS AND ERLICHIOSIS SO HE HAS NOT BEEN WELL CARED FOR IN THE PAST. GOLIATH CAN RECOVER FROM BOTH HEARTWORMS AND ERLICHIOSIS. HE IS BEING STARTED ON A MONTHLY IVERMECTIN TREATMENT FOR THE HEARTWORMS (IVERMECTIN ONCE A MONTH IS ALSO WHAT WE USE TO TREAT HEARTWORM NEGATIVE DOGS SO NO \"SPECIAL\" CARE IS REQUIRED) AND HE IS ON DOXYCYCLINE FOR THE ERLICHIOSIS (A TICK BOURNE DISEASE). GOLIATH IS A GOOD BOY AND WILL MAKE A GREAT PET BUT BECAUSE HE IS DEAF, HE WILL NEED A HOME WHERE HE IS NOT ABLE TO ROAM OR WHERE HE WOULD BE STARTLED (IE BEING GRABBED FROM BEHIND) BECAUSE HE CANT HEAR, HIS BEW OWNER WILL NEED TO BE MINDFUL ABOUT MAKING THEIR PRESENCE KNOWN TO HIM. GOLIATH WALKS WELL ON A LEASH AND HAS THE CUTEST GRIN. WHAT HE HAS LOST ON HIS HEARING, HE HAS GAINED IN HIS OTHER SENSES\nGoliath is a large great pyrenees mix. He is white in color with a couple of brown patches on his back. Goliath was found on a womans property. We have attempted to locate Goliaths owners with no success so he will be looking for a new forever home. Great pyrenees, by nature, enjoy patrolling and roaming their property, and territory (as they see it...even if that means it extends beyond their property line).They are guardian dogs and enjoy having a job. Goliath would do great on a farm guarding livestock or he would probably also enjoy being a family pet as well. Just remember that he may want to herd your children or other pets. He is a very large boy so he could knock little ones over, although pyrenees are generally known to be gentle giants, unless you are a predator threatening their flock. Because pyrenees are known to roam, a secure fenced yard or regular leash walking is necessary to prevent him from wandering off and finding himself homeless once again, although he will be chipped which would, hopefully, help him find his way back home. Goliath currently is not neutered but we will be getting that and his yearly vetting completed before he leaves us. If interested in giving Goliath a forever home, please call 352-493-1255 or 352-226-0100 (leave detailed message if no answer) or text ONLY 352-215-3260 for more info or to set up a day/time to meet him.

A sweet family contacted us and said they would foster him if we would take him in. Of course, we could not resist that face! Poor Forest was heartworm positive, so he had to be treated. He has finished his treatment and is now ready for his forever home. Forest is a sweet boy who has never met a stranger. He always super excited to meet new people. He can sometime be dog selective, so proper introductions are a must.  He would love a home with a fenced yard to run and play.   Forest is house trained and walks well on a leash.  He loves to go for car rides.   He is very food/treat motivated which makes him easy to train and he already knows several commands.  He is fully vetted, neutered, UTD on all vaccines, microchipped and current with prevention.",

He is a boisterous dog who loves to rough-house with dominate female dogs and lets them beat him up. When people play with him, he is best directed by treats. He has a scar on his neck, which shows us that at some point in his life he may have been abused. He is food assertive, so must be handled carefully when giving and taking food away. He would do best in an adult only home with a dominant owner to keep him in line and model alpha, pack order.\n*****Special note about his video*****Bucky is a sweet playful dog, but has anxiety about meeting new people. We believe that the best thing for Bucky is for a potential adopter to visit him at the shelter several times before trying to do an official meet and greet for adoption. We can set you up to observe him with others he already knows. Spending time with him on walks at the shelter and giving him treats will be the best way to his heart. This will take a little extra time and effort on your part but it could be worth it for you. We have done this slow-meet technique with another one of our dogs who didn't make a good first impression and it paid off for the family who adopted him! They are very grateful to have him in their family now.Please fill out an application to meet him!",

When I wandered up to the shelter on a cold Feb evening, little did I know I\u2019d spend the next 1,000 days there. I haven\u2019t been well since birth, legs are bowed most likely due to growth plate injuries when I was little. Stitch has struggled with weight all his life. 2yrs of trails, experimenting with medication, exploratory surgery & vets determined I had a malabsorption disorder & would never put on weight. After 2yrs at the shelter through all weather & no interest. I was finally adopted. However it was short lived when my owner lost his home & couldn\u2019t care for me. I ended up in foster care, so no more shelter for me. But still, something wasn\u2019t right. I was lethargic, depressed & had no interest in eating. My rescue family was determined to figure it out. 2wks at the vet, hundreds later & so many blood tests. Finally determined I had Tick-borne disease called Babesia. Babesia is a very serious blood disease that can have deadly side effects if left undiagnosed & untreated. It is extremely hard to test positive  for & requires a lot of testing by the vets. We don\u2019t know how I got it but thankfully I received my treatment & am on the up side of this fight! The Dr said I\u2019D ACTUALLY look like a normal dog 1 day. Which I haven\u2019t ever! I\u2019m eating, playing  & still patiently waiting for my forever family. A family that understands the misunderstood, out of the ordinary, spunky & unconditional love. I am about 4yrs old, current on shots, neutered, microchipped & house/crate trained. I\u2019m good with kids & other dogs!!! I love car rides, walks, outings & pretty much anything you want to cook for me! Oh I am a bed hog, couch potato & tennis ball loving man! Please consider opening your heart & home to Stitch \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please go to www.thepitstoprescue.com\n\nif you would like more information on this dog please contact Apaws at info@apawspets.org\n\nif you would like to begin the adoption process and fill out an application please use our online application available here: http\\://www.apawspets.org/dog_application_display.php\n\nif you cannot adopt or foster, but would like to donate to the rescue to help with the care of this dog and the others, please go to http\\://www.apawspets.org/donate.php",

            "description": "Meet Allie\nCourtesy Post\n\nOver 2yrs ago, our Allie was rescued. We wish we could say that was the end of her hard life, but it was just the begining. She was found in an abandoned trailer park which flooded. We are unsure if she was left, wandered or was dropped off there. It was not a safe area, so there is no telling. She was living under one of the trailers & her only friends were the stray cats. The rescue that found her reached out to us for help. We knew this baby has been through a lot & was very confused! From the start Allie has had complicating allergies & has had it rough. No she couldn\u2019t go out to play with other dogs, sleep/rest or eat without itching. She itched until she bled, had daily baths, had to wear pjs & through the course of all of this the Drs struggled to pinpoint the root of her allergies. She was tested multiple times, placed on so many different oral & skin medications, that we lost count. Thousands of dollars later & to many days to count, she is slowly making progress. We refuse to give up on Allie. Even though she has her bad days, she doesn\u2019t let that get her down! She is the perfect balance of playful & calm, She loves to be silly & play around but also loves to nap! She is now about 2yrs old, spayed, current on shots, on heart worm prevention, microchipped. Allie is good with other dogs, kid & cats. Please consider opening your heart & home to Allie. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please go to www.thepitstoprescue.com \n\nif you would like more information on this dog please contact Apaws at info@apawspets.org\n\nif you would like to begin the adoption process and fill out an application please use our online application available here: http\\://www.apawspets.org/dog_application_display.php\n\nif you cannot adopt or foster, but would like to donate to the rescue to help with the care of this dog and the others, please go to http\\://www.apawspets.org/donate.php",

She is very shy to new people but when she opens up, she lights your heart up like a Christmas tree. A baby yet, she came from CACC. Someone most certainly didn\u2019t treat her the way one should treat a growing baby. But forward we go, and a new love and respected life we learn. She enjoys walks and loves other dogs. We would like to see her in a home with another dog as they make her feel more comfortable and seeing her happy is everything. Super snuggly and sweet once you earn her trust. Of course she thinks she\u2019s a lap dog. She a magical cross of who knows what. Sometimes we see deer in her, other times a Dane or a sorceress dweller from the enchanted forest.\n\nAnimals can be viewed by appointment only. We ask that you review our adoption information AND fill out an adoption application prior to setting an appointment so we have all your information and you understand our adoption procedures - you can do so online here.     \n\nPlease feel free to email us or call us anytime for additional information on any of our animals - info@mcprescue.org or 312-388-3928. Our typical adoption fee varies based on the age of the dog at the time of rescue: Under the age of 1 years old is $500; 1-5 years old is $400; over the age of 5 is $300. Fees include vaccinations, microchip, deworming and other vetting as needed. Our adoption process includes an application, reference check and home visit.",

I am very sweet, playful and I like to hug the volunteers.\n \nI get along well with older children (12+)  I get along with some dogs, but some not, we would definitely have to meet first!   I cannot be around cats or livestock (Horses, goats, pigs, chickens etc.).

            "description": "This sweet affectionate boy seeks a quiet adult home where he will get lots of cuddles with his human! Sam lives to love and be loved -- and will be your Right Hand Man and Best Friend. His whole being revolves around his humans. We would like him to be the only dog, so he is spoiled. He is 3 /12 years old and about 65 pounds. For playmates, he seems to get along best with alpha females! Hmmm, likes being told what to do and when/how to do it? Sam would LOVE a yard with dog door, so he can freely go in and out. Dislikes being crated or tethered. He is quiet and happy in the car (moving or not, company or not), or at the office (just his 2 people there). He enjoys daily walks, but must be on leash because of hip dysplasia. If up to him, he would run hard and then be uncomfortable later. His humans satisfy his need for action, with lots of mental exercises: hide and seek, finding hidden toys/treats, playing games. His ideal home would be out of the snow easier to get out and about and romp around, in Winter. Sam gets uneasy with new folks coming in, so proper introduction is a must. Easy to do, once you know his quirks. He takes his job seriously as a Protector of his loved ones. He has been working with a trainer and showing great progress. Continued training would really benefit this boy. He really does want to please. Very treat motivated! But, have to be careful to not be over indulgent. Important for him to keep a svelte physique for less stress on his hips, AND to attract the girls!. Typical birddog, he has some prey drive, so please no cats or chickens! And, please, no kids. Little ones make him nervous (me too, Sam!). Do consider this Darling Boy, for a spot in your heart and home. If you are interested in Sam, please fill out an adoption application online at www.tahoewarf.com. and contact Robyn at robyn.orloff@icloud.com",

He will be your Guardian, your champion, and your protector if you let him. \n\nRocky needs a very strong Alpha owner. He needs rules, structure, and boundaries set in place. He shouldn\u2019t be babied. Pampered, kissed, pet, brushed, and loved of course... but he doesn\u2019t like to be spoken too like he is a child because he\u2019s too smart for that. \n\nOnce Rocky sees you as his confident friend, he melts like butter. He will do trust falls and give endless kisses and cuddles.  He loves to play outside with the hose. HE ADORES you completely. Absolutely no small children for Rocky as he was severely abused by them. If children visit he must be put away. \nAny size dog or cat of any kind Rocky will do great with. He loves other animals... he even likes lizards.  \nHe will do best in a quiet household with out a ton of visitors. \n\nRocky came to PUP when another rescue was having trouble figuring out why he wouldn\u2019t listen. Turns out rocky speaks French! He\u2019s learning English well. peut-il venir vivre avec vous?\n\nIf your interested in meeting Rocky please set up an appointment with Paws unite people in East Patchogue by sending us a message.\nOur cats and dogs are at our Rehabilitation Center in East Patchogue, NY or in private foster homes. They are available to see by appointment. Email Adoptions@pawsunitepeople.com for more information.\u00bf\nOur cats and dogs are not available to be adopted out of state via a transporter. All of our animals require meet and greets, we do home visits and reference checks. If you are willing to travel to meet the pet and live out of area, feel free to inquire, but we will not send any animal to a home sight unseen.",

I'm 5 years old but i have a lot of life left in me. I don't want to spend the rest of my life in a cage. My story is sad, I was on the euthanasia list at the shelter, got adopted but it was an apartment and not the right fit, so I went back to the shelter. Than this cool trainer saved me and I fell in love with him. Well he lost his place to live, so I than went to boarding. And than someone wanted to adopt me. I was so happy, but he slept 12-14 hours a day and was kenneling me at that time, I don't like kennels much, don't need one. He tried to grab me even after i growled at him, and i bit him, i'm sorry but he didn't listen to my warning and I didn't know what else to do. MY friends say they have NEVER SEEN ME BE AGGRESIVE. I am always a happy wiggle butt. I love walks, and to play. I have house manners, and I even like calm dogs. And even smaller dogs. Well now I'm back in boarding looking for that perfect home. The perfect home for me would be a quiet calm home with a backyard and someone to love me, that would walk me and not crate me. Maybe an experienced handler. I am an awesome dog waiting for you. Please call 520-800-4633 asap and ask for DDee to meet me. I promise I will be a good boy!MEET >>Mick DDee>!! **Please Note: This is a courtesy post for another rescue; different adoption fees/policy apply.\n\nFor more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\nIf you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page\n\nat www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals\n\nfor more photos and details.",

The kennel techs who helped Thor with these photos on September 25, 2019 confided that Thor holds the title of 'Strongest Dog In Our Shelter'.  \n\nThor is NOT good with cats or other dogs :(\n\nThor was neutered on April 29, 2019 and was also given rabies vaccine.

Teddy/Teddie, our senior, had knee surgery, recovering well, and has an adoption pending. Henri has an ADOPTION PENDING!\n\nUPDATE: NOV 2020 - Rue has been ADOPTED! Danny has an ADOPTION PENDING! \n\nUPDATE: OCT 2020 - We were finally able to bring in TWO Spitz from S. Korea that have been waiting since FEB 2020! Danny & Rue, both young adult males, have just arrived, and are being given time to chill, as well as have vet check-ups. Danny is a white Spitz about 4 years old and Rue has a \"wolf\" colored coat and is also a Spitz. Each boy will be listed under our Chicagoland Eskie Rescue listings, we do need time to get new photos! Thanks again for your patience!\n\nUPDATE: AUGUST 2020 - We are just starting to get a couple of new Eskies into the rescue. Transportation is still difficult, United Airlines Pet Safe Program continues to have cargo \"suspended\" for flying dogs/pets. As we get in new dogs, we will get them listed as promptly as possible. Please be patient, as there are many who have been waiting throughout the pandemic period....aka we do have a waiting list!\n\nUPDATE: July 2020 - Due to COVID-19, we are still having significant difficulty transporting dogs. We normally rescue Eskies from a variety of locations and use the United Pet Safe program to fly dogs from the west coast and southern states to Chicago, but their program has been suspended for several months now. International transportation of dogs has also been suspended until further notice from South Korea. We are terribly sorry for any disappointment this wait has caused. As soon as we are able to bring in more Eskies we will get them listed! Thanks so much for your patience during this trying time.\n\nDue to the threat of COVID-19, the 'stay-at-home' orders in the state of IL, social distancing, and only essential businesses being open, it has been challenging to conduct adoptions as usually. We are a foster home based rescue and do not have a facility. We depend on space at our vet clinic and our own homes to introduce our dogs to potential adopters, and then the homes of adopters to meet again to go over vet care paperwork and our adoption contract. In the current status of our country, you can see how this has become difficult. Now that the weather is better, we are starting to meet applicants outside to keep social distancing easy. Please have patience as we \"reinvent the wheel\" to figure out new plans to move forward, and still keep our mission statement as our goal!\n\nChicagoland Eskie Rescue has a NEW website! ALL of our available dogs will be listed on Petfinder and can be found thru our website! Simply go to: www.chicagolandekierescue.com and find the button for available dogs, which will in turn bring you back to Petfinder to all of our listed dogs. Our new website will also feature an ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION!! YIPPY! Applications will be available to fill out online, so no more waiting, emailing, responding, etc. HAPPY DANCE! This has been a long time coming, websites cost money, all of our monies have always gone directly to the dogs. Fortunately, we have received donations specifically to help us launch a new website! So exciting! THANK YOU for your patience!",

I was very sick when I came to my foster home and they didn't know if I would even be able to experience the good life. But here I am! I'm doing amazing and loving every minute of it! I only have three legs so I move pretty slow and would prefer a calm and quiet forever family. Foster mom says I'm getting some wheels soon so I can get around a little better. My favorite thing to do is snuggle my humans. So I will need lots of snuggle time in my new home. \n\nIf you are interested in Peanut, please visit our website: www.ilenglishbulldogrescue.org, and read through our adoption criteria to see if you meet our requirements. If you do, please fill out an application to adopt.\n\nPeanut's adoption fee is: $200.00\n\nVisit us on Facebook: Visit us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/IllinoisEnglishBulldogRescue",

Jase was full of playful energy and ready for fun-and-games during his photo session. Thanks to Jon McIntire for spending time with Jase so that we could take his photos for his Petfinder/Facebook debuts.\n\nJase weighs 81.4 lbs and is very strong on the other end of leash. He would do best with an experienced handler.\n\nJase has already been neutered.\n\n",
