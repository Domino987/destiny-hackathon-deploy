            "description": "**Please read her entire bio before requesting an application**\n**We are only looking to place her in a home with an existing dog**\n\nAt roughly 8 years old, sweet Mama is a mature lady. Mama is an incredibly shy pup who is looking for a special and patient family. She is timid and skittish, and will take some time to warm up. When that time comes, she will then decide to stick to your side - a \"velcro\" dog if you will who is incredibly connected and loyal.\n\nOnce she warms up, she absolutely loves to cuddle with her person. Her couch potato side strikes a nice balance with her desire to be an adventure girl. She get so excited to go for walks and is a great little co-pilot. You should see how this little monkey lights up when the leash comes out - she gets SO excited to go on walks and seems to particularly love the beach. \n\nWith a careful feeding regimen, she has been slowly losing weight. Mama is very food-driven! She has done well around bigger dogs, and she currently lives with two dogs who are  medium and large in size. She interacts well with dogs of all sizes during our walks - she is a pretty confident dog towards other dogs, despite her size.\n\nWe are looking to place Mama in a home with an existing confident pup as she seems to gain much confidence from being around another dog. This makes her more comfortable which is beautiful to see and why we are wanting to make sure she finds a home with another pup. Again, it is important that she goes to a quieter home with people who understand that she will not approach strangers upon first meeting and she takes time to warm up. \n\nIf you are interested in this sweet girl, please email us at adoptions@pawfund.org to request an application.",

This poor boy came to us completely hairless and drastically underweight.  All that is not stopping him from being extremely sweet to everyone with whom he comes in contact.  He has been checked out by the vet and is on the road to recovery.  His hair is almost all grown back and as it turns out, he has a beautiful brindle coat.  We will update this post regularly with new pictures to show his progress and update the primary breed and maybe color and coat length as we are finding out those details as we go.  Now that he feels better physically, he is starting to engage more with us, play, and snuggle.  He is actually quite goofy.",

She will tell you that I literally skip, hop and jump when I am excited! I am a very playful pup with a huge personality and am also a very friendly guy. Playing with my toys is really great, and also I love playing with my people. I am totally awesome at playing fetch! I just love to play with my folks or my canine buddies! I learn new games easily because I am so smart, and I am very eager to please my people. (That doesn't mean that I will always let you win though, HA!) I am very proud to tell you that I can sit, stay and lay down if you offer me a treat or a toy. Please feel free to offer these to me at any time. Trust me, your generosity is greatly appreciated. I also love to go on walks and am learning how to have good leash manners. Sometimes I get excited and want to go too fast. There could be a squirrel around that next corner, you know.\n\nGOOFY! My foster mom thinks that I am a goofy guy because I make her laugh. She thinks my ears are funny because one tips slightly forward and the other one tips slightly backward. She tells everyone how adorable my ears are and that they just add to my goofy personality. I wonder why they didn't just name me Goofy.\n\nI am an affectionate fellow and also mild mannered. I always listen to my foster mom and go in my kennel when she tells me to. I also have a great time with her whenever we get to go on a car ride. Yippee! Riding in the car is awesome! I really want my people to love me! When I get my forever family, I will be the most devoted, loveable and faithful companion ever. I can't wait!\n\nSkipper Dipper is around one year old and medium size. He is black with white on his chest. He has been fully vetted, has a microchip and will be neutered this week. He is a healthy young guy.. He is a mixed pup and part American Staffordshire Terrier. He will make a great addition to a family or person with or without kids. Skipper Dipper loves all people....old, young, men, women and children. He also loves all other dogs....small ones, large ones, senior ones, males and females.\n\nThis handsome dude will bring joy to your life every single day!!\n\nThank you for considering adopting a new family member.\n\nMemphis area adoption fee is\n$200\n\nAll dogs are spayed or neutered {unless medical issues prohibit the surgery}, up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, heartworm tested {if old enough} and treated if necessary.

            "description": "Zara is pretty girl and a great dog who was picked up as a stray. Zara was very frightened at the shelter and didn't want to be restrained, and was afraid of men. Zara has been in a foster/boarding home for two months now and the family has earned her trust, including the husband https://youtu.be/MtpwBkJD_tQ Zara is all smiles these days. Her only issue is she does not like to be restrained, but we think with time she will trust her new owner if they stay kind and patient with her. Earn her trust, like her foster did, and of course, peanut butter! Zara is super housetrained and she does not destroy anything. Zara is about 3 years old and weighs about 57 pounds. She tested well with other dogs, see her videos below, HOWEVER we have discovered she is VERY protective of food and toys so would be best as an only dog . We do stress Zara needs a dog savvy family and most of all a requires a patient owner. She is looking for a family to love her unconditionally. If you are interested in Zara please email Virginia virginiaz3@gmail.com When you email please be sure to add your phone number so she can call you back. We highly suggest no small children because of Zara's restraining issue. She tested heartworm negative and is current on her vaccines.\n\nZara has a buddy to play with, with her foster familyhttps://youtu.be/US7NmYUj9D8 Zara is in the red collar but very protective of food and bones which caused an issue so best as an only dog.\n\nLoves to play with rope: https://youtu.be/eThUcmg56CY\n\nLoves to run around in a yard and chase a ball https://youtu.be/12Zt1vfAJko\nLoves to play with rope: https://youtu.be/eThUcmg56CY\n\nLoves to run around in a yard and chase a ball https://youtu.be/12Zt1vfAJko\n\nZara tested well with other dogs at the shelter Zara (108) and Jackson (811)\n\nAge: 3 years\nWeight: 57 lbs\nVetting: spayed, up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative\nTraining: Housetrained, good on leash\nTemperament: Good with older kids, loves to play with other dogs but food and toy reactive, best as only dog in home.\n\nEmail for questions: virginiaz3@gmail.com\n\nTo ensure we're meeting both pet and adopters' needs, we ask potential adopters to complete an Adoption Application ( www.bit.ly/DH-Adoption ) for caretakers to review.

            "description": "Bentley is by far one of the most loyal and loving companions to have around. Want to have fun, be lazy, be active? Bentley is all of that. This sweet dog will never disappoint, he's just so full of happiness! Bentley loves walks and car rides and being around other dogs and people! He truly is one of a kind!\n\nAge: 9 y/o\n\nBreed: Hound\n\nWeight: 81 lbs\n\nExperienced Handler Recommended: Bentley takes time choosing his people and trusting. Bentley is reserved and cautious until he is comfortable. And then he turns into Mr. Snugglepants.\n\nKid-friendly:\nNo small children\n\nDogs:\nIf other dogs, not super dominant, no small dogs\n\nCats: Not recommended due to high prey drive in hounds\n\nCrate trained:\nHe is but doesn't need it.\n\nPotty trained: Yep!\n\nLikes:\nHe LOVES walks, lounging around, meeting new people!\n\nBentley would love a fellow dog to play with, a person who lets him sleep in the bed (or at least close) and a family who loves to walk, hike, and run. He is breathtakingly athletic and appears much younger than his listed age. His tail is powerful when he wags it, and he alerts you to everything the neighbors are up to with a deep bark. Bentley would love to have a companion, but we do recommend supervision during playtime with other dogs, especially males. He is not dominant but he's no pushover either. If he is adopted in an only dog home, we recommend he does have regular playtime with other dogs that are familiar friends. We also recommend giving Bentley \"work\" to do, as he breed is known to be a \"working dog. He needs daily activity.\n\nFor multiple dogs, we also recommend considering crates when the animals are unattended for the safety and harmony of the pack. Bentley is reserved by nature which makes his integration into a new pack a slower process than some other dogs. He is not a social butterfly and must feel safe before he will integrate into the pack. Bentley's instinct is to mount other dogs, which is usually a sign of dominance, but with Bentley it is a behavior that was not corrected. We have been working on correcting it so that it happens less often, but with new people \"alphas\", new environment, new pack, Bentley is vulnerable to this behavior and other dogs. The primary key to success with Bentley is that he needs to trust his people first and foremost. He needs fairness in the pack and if he senses he is the second-rate citizen it may be hard. He has fear from his past and once he believes you have his back, he falls in love with you. Then he feels safe and secure with the whole pack.\n\nAdoption fee: $375\n\nOur dogs receive heartworm and flea/tick prevention the first week of each month, March through November.

She'll love to exercise with you, lay on the couch and nap, play fetch or snuggle in bed - as long as she's with you, she's totally fine and content! She loves treats and is motivated with a few bones and she'll be your BEST FRIEND!!\n\nAge:10\n\nBreed: American Staffordshire Terrier Mix\n\nWeight:\n43lbs\n\nKid-friendly: Yep!\n\nDogs: She is but can resource guard so adopters should be familiar with that.\n\nCats: Do not recommend.\n\nCrate trained: She is but the foster currently doesn't kennel\n\nPotty trained: Yes but will need a consistent schedule.\n\nLikes: She loves to sleep on the couch, play with toys, go for walks and give lots of kisses to her people!\n\nHealth concerns: She is currently undergoing heartworm treatment.\n\nAdoption fee: $325\n\nTeeDee is apart of our Foster To Adopt Program (FTA) as she is currently undergoing heartworm treatment. Adopters will be responsible for bringing TeeDee to her heartworm appointments at our partner clinic at Companions Animal Hospital in St. Cloud once per month until she is cleared (est. January 2021).\n\nThis Grey Face Rescue animal will be adopted with a FTA (foster to adopt) contract so the adoption can take place, while Grey Face Rescue still manages the financial responsibility of the veterinary care outlined in the FTA contract. Any other medical care needed outside of the veterinary care outlined in the FTA contract would be the responsibility of the adopter.\n\nIf you are interested in foster to adopt, you must fill out a Foster Application here:\nhttp://www.greyfacerescue.org/foster\n\nYou can read more about the process of\nFTA here !\n\nOur dogs receive heartworm and flea/tick prevention each month.

She had a thick human belt around her neck but clearly did not belong to anyone. When her medical condition began to physically deteriorate with BB gun wounds in her head and a very large growth hanging from her abdomen, we knew it was time to step in. \n\nAfter a few days of trying to earn her trust and the rescue of 3 other pups from the same area later (#sdfGraham #sdfHershey #sdfMarshmallow), we finally were able to humanely trap her and get her in to see our vet. And we are so happy she finally let us rescue her! \n\nLil S\u2019mores is definitely enjoying life off the streets. She\u2019s a little shy at first, but she loves a good shoulder and back rub!

            "description": "To be considered for adopting a dog from Canine Lifeline, you must have an approved application must be on file. Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nTori is a very beautiful 3 year-old Husky mix female with a super-soft coat and gorgeous markings. She was surrendered to an overcrowded county dog shelter in late August by her owner who said she was not good with the toddler in the home. The child was pestering Tori and the parents thought Tori might snap at the toddler. We don't know how Tori was treated in her previous home but she will need a quiet home without small children-respectful teenagers should be OK. Tori has been very friendly and affectionate with all the people she's met since coming to us to work on finding the right forever home. She loves to have lots of attention lavished on her and enjoys being close to her human friends. The first few days she was with us, Tori seemed very uncomfortable around other dogs but now that she's settling in a little bit, she has relaxed and enjoyed meeting some fellow Canine Lifeline adoptables. Although she might be happy playing with dogs on occasion, Tori does need to be the only dog in the home as she does not like to share her things or people with other dogs. She walks very nicely on a leash and is looking forward to exploring her new neighborhood with her family. She has had excellent crate manners in her foster home and is likely to be housetrained although we can't guarantee that she won't have a few accidents in her new home as she adjusts to the new routine. Her pretty long coat will require regular brushing to keep her looking and feeling her best. Tori was adopted from us shortly after her arrival but recently returned because her family found that she did not like cats so Tori will need a kitty-free home. Being a Husky mix, Tori seeks out affection on her own terms and isn't always comfortable with being hugged. She would do best with an owner who understands the breed and can give Tori the space she needs. Tori also needs a home with a yard that has a secure aboveground fence (no invisible fence) to keep her safe at home. Tori weighs about 30 pounds and her adoption fee is $325. She's spayed, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Tori. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Tori and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

He is very food motivated and eager to please, but is in need of basic training and manners.  He is not a couch potato and will need someone willing to work with him to make him into the gentleman he can be.  He is currently working on leash walking and basic manners. \n\nMozzy has a lot of love to give.  Small children may be knocked over because he doesn't know how big he is.  He is dog friendly but any potential canine siblings would require a meet and greet.  He is good with cats.  Mozzy is neutered, up to date on vaccines and routine care and is microchipped. \n\nIf you would like to meet this big, happy boy, please contact Elena by phone, text or email. 860-857-2270/elena.rogan.cecil@gmail.com  He is being fostered in Groton, CT.",

            "description": "*ADOPT ME!*\nBeaux - 10 years old, located in Pennsylvania\nDog ID#: 191051-P-D-LA\nIntake Date: 09/06/2020\nAvailable Date: 10/10/2020 \n\nHi, my name is Beaux!  I grew up in the south hunting with my original Dad, but after a separation I went to live with my Mom for a while.  In 2016, I was diagnosed with Cutaneous hemangiosarcoma. I developed some really gross things that grew all over me (tumors) and Mom couldn\u2019t help me anymore, so an amazing family in Massachusetts took me in and got me all the care I needed and guess what!? My cancer is now in remission. \n\n I really loved living with my new family but after one of my procedures I started being sensitive to loud noises.  Being in a noisy city environment was not the best for me anymore so I got to take a ride to a quiet neighborhood in Pennsylvania.  At first, I wasn\u2019t sure what to make of things.  I picked a whole Queen size bed to sleep in on my first night and my new foster family said it could be mine while I was here.  I slowly started to learn that the noises that I was always expecting before are no longer there, but the resident dogs help comfort me if I still get scared. I really love to lounge around and go on walks with the other dogs. Sometimes I pull when I\u2019m on a leash but it is just because there are so many new things to smell!  I\u2019ve been getting really good at following the other dogs\u2019 lead and realizing that when I pull, we stop walking.  My ideal forever home would be someplace quiet with at least one other dog.  I like to run around and play with a Jolly Ball and other outdoor toys, so a fenced in yard would be perfect\u2026 and if you have some bunnies, squirrels or birds for me to chase and look at that would be even better!\n\nSince you have gotten this far in my bio, I should let you know that I would be best in a home as an only dog.  I am very friendly and love people and kids, but I don\u2019t really enjoy the company of other dogs. I am currently coexisting with he other dogs in my foster home and don\u2019t mind walking past strange dogs outside, but if I had my way I\u2019d prefer to have my people all to myself! The two resident dogs I am living with have been very calm and patient about getting to know me and because they are keeping a respectful distance, I am slowly getting more confident around them. I do not want to hurt other dogs, but they make me tense and I don\u2019t like it when they get in my face. We go for pack walks together daily and I have no problem passing other neighborhood dogs and walking beside my canine pals. I think that\u2019s because there are more interesting sights and smells to think about. It is inside where I feel too confined around other dogs, but my foster family is working on helping me get better with this. In addition, I am too excited by birds and cats to calmly live with them.\n\nBeaux is an English Pointer that will be 10 years old, up to date on all shots, neutered, microchipped and negative for heartworms.   He is on monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventative.  Beaux is afraid of any loud noises (thunderstorms, fireworks, etc.) and is also afraid of big trucks, but only when outside.  If a UPS/FedEx truck pulls up while he is inside, he does not seem to be bothered.  When he gets scared, he will pant, shake and either pace the house or freeze in place.  He also appears to show some fear even when it\u2019s just raining with no thunder. If you put him in a covered crate and administer some trazadone it seems to help. He is a great sleeper during the day and at night.  He will not sleep in bed with you for the whole night but will lay there for a few hours before finding a spot of his own.   He LOVES to be outside in our fenced yard running around and looking for any kind of critter but if he will be outside in the sun all day does need to wear UV shirts to protect his skin. \n\nWant to learn more about one of the dogs we have up for adoption?

And then you end up with s\u2019more pups. \u00a0\n\nGraham started off very subdued but has started to come out of his shell and is quite perky. It just took him a minute to realize what we tell every new streetdog- \"The worst is over, it just gets better from here!\" Hershey didn't need any convincing at all. She knew she was moving up to the good life! Little Marshmallow must have never had a good night's sleep because all she wants to do is to curl up in your lap and snooze!\u00a0\n\nAll three pups are approximately 10 months (October 2020) old and, despite tough circumstances, are so very sweet and generous with kisses! They all seem to really enjoy the company of other pups too! Hershey definitely has the most energy and enthusiasm. Graham is happy, grateful, and medium energy level. Little Marshmallow is perfectly content to bat her pretty white eyelashes and curl up for a nap anywhere she can find, as long as she is touching you!\n\nWe are so thankful that our s\u2019more pups are as sweet as their names! And can\u2019t wait for them to see and experience s\u2019more of the good life!\u00a0\n\n*Behaviors not listed have yet to be tested.",

            "description": "We've seen some pretty gals in our time, but Sophie might just take the cake! She's a beautiful 1 year old copper AmStaff gal with a bit of a lowrider build and a puppyish heart! Sophie arrived at CCR after being grazed by a car while running stray in the western suburbs. She wasn't seriously injured, but the incident slowed her down long enough for her to be caught! No one came forward to claim Sophie, and we're wondering if it's because her previous family wasn't all that nice to her. Sophie loves people but she's also initially pretty terrified that someone is going to hurt her...whether that's because she was hurt previously or because she was never interacted with much at all, we don't know. What we do know is that if you go slow, give Sophie time to adjust and lots of sweet talk, she'll open up and then all bets are off! Unfortunately, Sophie seems to have a particular fear of men, so we are looking for a female-only household for Sophie. Sophie adores other dogs and really needs a home with another playful dog that will wrestle with her and also show her that people are good and she can be brave! Because of her initial skittishness, Sophie needs an adult home with no children that has a little patience to let her go at her own pace. Sophie is super affectionate and presents initially very submissively...but don't let that fool you! This lady has lots of rough and rowdy play that she'd like to let loose! So if you have a playful dog, an adult home, and lots of love to give...Sophie's your gal!\n\nTo meet Sophie, please submit an application at chicagocaninerescue.org!",

I\u2019m a nine-pound, nine-year-old chihuahua mix, fully vetted, neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, and on heartworm preventative. \n\nSome call me a charmer, and I don\u2019t deny it! My soft, plush fur is like a velvet jacket, and you\u2019ll love it when I cuddle up to you or cover you with kisses. Speaking of kisses, mine are extra gentle since I\u2019m missing all but two teeth. My tongue may loll out of my mouth a bit, but, trust me, it only adds to my adorableness! And don\u2019t think that because of my senior status I just lie around all day. I enjoy playing with toys and other dogs and would love to have a dog companion to share my occasional bursts of energy. Of course, I\u2019d be happy as an only dog too; humans are my favorite companions. Be prepared for a happy little shadow when you adopt me!\n\nI\u2019m a softspoken fellow, and I\u2019ll whimper softly to let you know I need something like dinner or another cuddle. I do suffer a bit of arthritis, so I need to take regular medication and be held and picked up gently. It doesn\u2019t keep me from enjoying a leisurely stroll around the neighborhood though; I\u2019m great on a leash! I\u2019m accustomed to using puppy pads for taking care of my business. Leave one or two in discrete locations, and I will use them reliably. I\u2019m also used to dining in my crate, but I\u2019d prefer not to spend a lot of time in it, nor do I need to, since I am very respectful of my human\u2019s property. \n\nAt my age, it\u2019s hard to be starting over and in search of a home. I thought my last home was my forever home, and I don\u2019t understand why I was given up. Would you give this old dog a chance to learn some new tricks in your family? There\u2019s a lot of life and love left in me!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Chi Chi, please DO NOT SEND A MESSAGE TO OUR RESCUE GROUP.  We are too busy placing dogs in great homes to answer messages and inquiries through the listing site.  \n\nPLEASE GO TO THE LINK BELOW TO COMPLETE AN ADOPTION APPLICATION.\n \nwww.chihuahua-rescue.com/adoption-application\n \nCRT requires an approved adoption application and a home visit for all adoption applicants.  CRT transports to OH, KY, IL, MI, MN, WI. \n\n",

Please see what her foster mom has to say about her.....\n\nShadow is about two years old, jet black with very short hair, very sleek and muscular, about 35 lbs. She is strong, active dog who loves to walk, run, jump, play tug of war, or amuse herself with a ball, bone, or canvas chew toy.\n\nShe is fully house trained and very regular and predictable in her potty habits. Shadow loves people of all ages and stages. She is good with children and very gentle. She is doing well at learning how to greet people and get her pats and snuggles without jumping.\n\nShadow is truly a wonderful and amazing dog. Affectionate, smart, athletic and beautiful. She loves life and is a joy to be around and makes every walk an adventure and is great company.  \n\nIf you are interested in hearing more about Shadow, please respond to this post and we will send you an adoption application.  We are a small, volunteer only, foster based rescue in St. Petersburg, FL and request inquiries in Pinellas County only please.",

Queen can come off as a bit reserved around people he doesn't know, but once you get to know each other he is sure to be a loving and loyal companion. He is good with other dogs and loves to go on walks and has great leash manners! He has a ton of energy so he would do great in an active household where he can get out a lot and perhaps play with some doggy pals.

            "description": "Earl is an amazing little guy. He is about 2 years old and 43 pounds, which makes him the perfect medium size. His green eyes are mesmerizing as he pays close attention to his surroundings, and his expressive eyebrows, pink nose, and fluffy tail wrap up the one of the kind package for this tender hearted guy. \nEarl had a rough start in life coming out of a hoarding situation in which he was not well cared for or socialized.  But dogs\u2019 resilience is amazing and even though he thinks twice before trusting somebody, he is ready to put his past behind him.  He has been in an amazing foster home over the last 3 months and has made great strides in his socialization skills. He is fully leash, crate, and house trained and does great with other dogs.  He is still shy and nervous around new people, but has bonded with his foster mom, so we know he can trust given time and patience.\nHe loves snuggling on the couch, a soft bed, good food and going for walks. Most everything is a new experience for him so patience is vital. It will take time to earn his trust and affection but it\u2019s so worth the extra effort. \nHe would do best in a home setting that is quiet and calm. \nPlease call 256-486-8770 for more information.",

My absolute favorite things to do in the world are spend time with my humans, long walks and sleep! I play hard, but I sleep just as hard.\n\nI\u2019d be perfect for a family or single person who has plenty of love and time to spend with me! Id probably do best in a home where I\u2019m the only 4-legged friend. I like to walk at least 45 minutes a day, so be prepared! I\u2019m great on a leash, love car rides, and I know some other tricks like sit and paw too! My foster mom says I\u2019m the easiest girl to get along with and would happy just to have a warm home and loving human. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Tanya and are local to the Dillsburg area, please visit our website, www.crcpa.org, and complete an application!",

He is slowly coming out of his shell and learning to trust people. River is very shy and timid but very sweet. Loud noises & sudden moves still make him wary. He is not aggressive at all and plays well with other dogs-even tug of war! He needs a patient adopter who will give him time & patience to earn his trust. He will need a lot of one on one to build his confidence. A quiet home where he can flourish would be best for this sweet boy. We don't know his past traumas but we do know he feels safer with women than men. River would do best in a home with a fenced in yard to be out and about, since he prefers that as opposed to leash walking. If you'd like to be the lucky one to win this beautiful boy's love please apply!\n\nAdoption fee is $350 and includes a veterinarian visit, de-worming, age appropriate vaccinations, spay/neuter surgery and microchip lifetime registration.",

            "description": "PLEASE NOTE:\n- REQUIRES ANOTHER DOG IN THE HOME\n- NO SMALL DOGS\n- EXPECTED TO BE A LARGE DOG\n\nNAME: Ryan Reynolds\n\nAGE/GENDER: Baby (born 7/29/2020), Male\n\nBREED: Labrador Retriever and Australian Shepherd\n\nADOPTION DONATION: $525\n\nTEMPERAMENT: Playful and mischievous\nWEIGHT: Estimated adult weight is 50-70 lbs.\nHOUSE TRAINING: Not yet. He is a baby so he will need a consistent schedule with multiple opportunities daily to go outside while he works on it. Puppies should not be considered reliable in regard to house training until 6-12 months of age. They're a lot like toddlers, who require diapers. He is developmentally delayed and taking a bit longer to potty train.\nCRATE TRAINING: Good, he's young and trainable.\nOTHER DOGS: Good and will need continued socialization, like all puppies. In fact, he requires another dog in the home to be a mentor to him. His mentor needs to be social and outgoing and have the patience of a saint since Ryan is very in your face. No small dogs as Ryan has a hard time adjusting his play style.\nCATS: He's a bit of a cat chaser. Continued socialization will be important.\nCHILDREN: Dog-respectful children, 12 and older\n\nHEALTH: Ryan Reynolds is growing and learning every day, but he does have some developmental delays due to early trauma (see history below). Ryan Reynolds is still learning his name and how to track/look at his people when interacting with them. He has some lasting physical effects as well as mental effects, but he is a mobile guy. Prior to adoption, puppies will be altered, microchipped, flea treated, and dewormed. Puppies are given vaccination boosters in our care; however, adoptive families will be responsible for the remaining vaccinations that puppies need. Your adoption donation goes toward the cost of this vet care as well as transportation and general care costs.\n\nHISTORY: Ryan Reynolds came to us after his mother attacked him and his litter mates. Thankfully Ryan Reynolds survived, but not without physical injury and subsequent developmental delays. Motley Zoo Animal Rescue was asked to find him a great forever family and that is exactly what we plan to do!\n\nNOTES FROM FOSTER HOME: Ryan Reynolds is a puppy so he's playful and has a lot of puppy energy. He is super cute and fun, but a lot of work. His forever family should be committed to lots of training - obedience, house training, and socialization. This will ensure that Ryan Reynolds grows into a confident, well behaved adult. Due to his early trauma, Ryan Reynolds can be fearful and startle easily, especially when approached from over his head, so he would do best in a family with children 12 or older. A puppy's personality is dependent on their environment, and the structure and training they are given, in addition to socialization. Their personalities continue to grow and are shaped by their new adoptive families. Puppy daycare and socialization classes or puppy kindergarten are highly recommended for their personal development. He will more than reward you for all your hard work with lots of love, loyalty, and laughs.\n\nRyan is developmentally delayed and has some fear issues. However, with his brain trauma, he is behind mentally and is picking commands up slower than a puppy his age and even slower than his sister. He is learning his name and to sit. He is playful but skittish, which is why he requires older children in the home. Quick movements will send him running for cover. Even just touching him will startle him and cause him to scream and thrash in panic. As he is not your average puppy, he will need a lot of work, time and patience to build up his confidence. Neuro puppies tend to be hypersensitive so they tend to over exaggerate things/emotions. So fear can be intensified. He is very loving but not very cuddly and is just learning to snuggle. He is getting used to being held and hugged but can panic at being restrained (hugged) for too long. He is learning to walk on a leash. He is a wonderful silly and sweet little boy with just some little quirks.\n\nAll dogs adopted from Motley Zoo come with a leash and either a Martingale collar or a harness, depending on each dog's particular needs.\n\nABOUT MOTLEY ZOO\n\nWelcome to Motley Zoo Animal Rescue. We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit animal rescue organization that is run entirely by volunteers. Motley Zoo does not have a brick and mortar shelter location. Instead, all our rescue animals are cared for in private foster homes where the animals receive one-on-one care and attention in a home environment until permanent placement is found. Please email adopt@motleyzoo.org and request an adoption application and we will work toward approving you as an adopter with our rescue so that we can set a time for you to meet!\n\nFor more information, please visit www.motleyzoo.org.\n\nThank you for considering adopting a dog in need!\n\nWoof,\n\nThe Motley Zoo Crew",

He\u2019s a simple country guy with simple country needs. He\u2019s out here lookin\u2019 for the farmer\u2019s daughter and he ain\u2019t about your high falootin\u2019 city life.\n\nWilson\u2019s a looker, he\u2019s gonna turn all the girls heads with his beautiful coloring and perfect heeler build. But my guy, he knows that the prettiest lady out there is Mother Nature and he wants to share that with his new family. \n\nWilson is not built for city life. Or suburban life. He wants land, he wants to explore, he wants to run and appreciate the beauty of the world. He also very much wants to please and help his human, so we believe the Wilson would love a farm and a job he could do. He\u2019s been practicing his herding skills on some unappreciative cats, so he\u2019s got what it takes and he\u2019s willing to put in the reps to make it happen.  \n\nWilson does fine with other dogs, would probably like a friend around his size to \u2018rassle and explore with, but most important to this guy is FAMILY. He wants one more than I\u2019ve ever seen a dog want one and he wants so badly to be loved unconditionally. Wilson will give his life for his family, I have no doubt, so if you\u2019re looking for LOYAL, you\u2019ll never find another like this one. \n\nWilson is vaccinated, neutered, current on heartworm and flea/tick prevention. He is housebroken and crate trained. He\u2019s mostly good on a leash and has FANTASTIC recall off leash when hiking and exploring. He LOVES water. \n\nAre you Wilson\u2019s forever family?

Now is the perfect time to adopt him! He's a petite guy who is dog friendly, crate- and potty-trained. Pinocchio has also been picking up training quickly and would love to continue his education in a forever home.\n1 y/o, 40 pounds, G U M B Y \nDogs: friendly\nCats: unknown\nKids: unknown\nFill out an application today!",

            "description": "DOB: 2015 Weight: 82 lbs\n\nMeet Cooper! He's a lab mix, 6 yrs old and about 70 Lb. He loves to fetch and will bring the toy right back and drop it at your feet, ready to go again. He already has skills and knows sit, down and shake.\nHe previously lived with other dogs and has met several at the shelter. We have found that he's not a fan of the young ones who want to play and are in his face. Another dog that's calm would most likely be the best fit. Cooper needs a home without cats or chickens. He's house and crate trained. He does not like being swatted or hit as a form of correction.\nCooper is neutered, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm negative and microchipped. His adoption fee is $150. Applications can be found on our website pcpoundpuppies.com\nWe also offer a 2 week trial adoption to make sure it's the right fit. We can loan you a crate during that time. He came to the shelter 10/2020***YOU MUST FILL OUT AN APPLICATION BEFORE WE DO ANY MEET AND GREETS. QUESTIONS? CONTACT pcpoundpuppies1@gmail.com\nOur adoption fee is $150 which covers a portion of the dog's vetting costs. The adoption process includes the completion of an application followed by an interview.\nClick here to submit an adoption application: https://pcpoundpuppies.webs.com/adoption-application\n***IMPORTANT: Due to the effects of COVID-19, our Sunday adoption events at Pet Food Center have been canceled until further notice. If there is a dog you are interested in meeting, be sure to contact us and we may be able to set up a meet and greet as soon as possible.***\nYou can get in touch with us by email at pcpoundpuppies1@gmail.com or by phone at 812-483-4341 for more information.\nWe respond to inquiries and adoption applications at our earliest opportunity, but please be patient with us as we work full-time jobs and perform this service as volunteers. We do our best to return messages and schedule adoption interviews within a couple of days of receiving your application.\nThe fastest way to get the ball rolling is to complete an adoption application for the dog that caught your eye. Thank you for considering the adoption of a shelter dog!",

He is very shy when first meeting new people. He can be skittish especially on leash. He would do best in a home with no small children, and we would prefer he go to a home with another dog to help him gain confidence. He needs someone who is patient and willing to go slow as he gets to know them. He will need to work on house training but he is very smart.\nIf you are interested in Woody, please complete our online application which can be found at kcpaws.petfinder.com",

She's potty trained, crate trained, walks well on a leash, and is trustworthy alone in the house! She's in good shape, and loves to go for walks. She's knows Sit, Stay, Down, and Shake Hands. She's quiet around the house, and gets along well with other dogs (both large and small). She came to the shelter as a pregnant stray without much experience with people. She initially kept to herself, but has settled in and now comes seeking some attention from her people, giving kisses and enjoying being petted. She'll need a little patience as she gets used to new surroundings, but will blossom into a great companion.",

            "description": "This sweet adorable boy is making progress. We are so proud of he and his brother; they have had a long road but are learning life can be good to them. He is a petite dog, just the perfect size. He absolutely adores being outside. He loves to run and spin. He comes to the window when he is ready to come back inside. He is very sweet and quiet, does not make a lot of noise and loves his chew toys so that is a must! He is an overall sweetheart once he knows he is safe and feels comfortable. \n\nBullwinkle came to us shy and timid. He will need someone who is patient and willing to help him with his insecurities; while he is making strides he will still need patience and time to acclimate. \n\nHe will do best in a home with another dog that will help him build his confidence. He is about 35-45 lbs, almost 2 years old, loves salami, and his chew toys. He will need a home with a backyard since he is shy and the freedom of a yard allows him more time to come out of his shell. Older children who understand the need to go slow with him are recommended. \n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption. The standard minimum donation for puppies is $325 + 8.25% tax = $351.81, for dogs over 12 months the adoption fee is $225 + 8.25% tax = $243.66 and for our senior dogs 8 years and up is $100 + 8.25% tax = $108.25; this increase includes sales tax recently required by the State of Texas to collect. You can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallasdogrrr.org. \n\nFor more information, you can email adopt@dallasdogrrr.org. Upon receiving your application please allow us 2-3 business days to review and process.",

He is a great house pet, enjoys belly rubs, snuggles and resting his head on your lap.  His favorite toy is the tennis ball though he will chew them up in time. Echo knows some basic commands (sit, kennel, and is working on down and stay). Since Echo is recovering from a spinal infection which had caused him some spine and neck pain, he will need extra work on leash walking, as he's been staying indoors most of the time.  He is starting to go out for short controlled walks  and has exhibited some reactivity to other dogs on walks, so will need some professional training with dog socialization and leash walking.  He is still on multiple medications which will be ongoing for a few months, and a follow up checkup is due in mid January to confirm his long term prognosis.  As Echo is loving to his people and wishes to please, good training and consistent practice following training should be a success.  His best fit home will include a private yard with sufficient fencing/gating (minimum 6 ft tall), experienced large breed dog owners, and a willingness to work through loving discipline to round out his already wonderful self. Older children over 14 in the home would be fine, and he should be the only pet. Echo has not been cat tested yet. He is crate trained.",

I love humans and the attention I get from them, even kiddos! I haven't met kids younger than 5, but I do well with a little bit older ones. I love when I get head scratches, and back pets, and all the things from human that include attention, and I will seek it out. I'd much rather be around people than other animals, but I do get along with dogs that are my size, although it does take me a bit to get comfortable with them. I want to make my humans as happy as possible, so I'm working really hard on my potty training skills. Also, I know I'm a bit big, but I sure do love being a lap dog, where I can sit right next to you, real close, and snuggle when the time calls for it. I'm really hoping my new family likes to go on adventures and will take me with them! I have no issues with stairs, and hiking sounds like it would be super fun for me. I'd love getting to sniff all the things there are during a nice long walk, and it would burn a little of my energy. Maybe you have room in your home and can show and old gal what fun life can be?\n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $275.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

To meet Gordita, see the contact information below.\n\nGordita, a 60 lb., four-year-old Black Lab mix, was taken off the street after she had given birth to a litter of pups. They all died of Parvo. She was so scared when she was saved and now always keeps a healthy distance from new people. But once she accepts you, she is a most loving girl.\n\nShe will need a 100% secure fenced-in yard from which she cannot escape. Her first adoption just wasn\u2019t right for her. She hid in the bushes until the gentleman from the rescue group came to retrieve her.\n\nShe also needs to be put on a diet and she needs regular exercise. Gordita is housetrained and spayed.\n\nTo meet Gordita, contact Dana, our ARRF representative working with the Tijuana rescue at dkmikel@gmail.com or 760-519-5532.\n\nUnable to adopt, but still want to help? Your support through tax-deductible donations are always needed and greatly appreciated! Donations go a long way in helping cover medical bills.\n",

To meet Juan, see the contact information below.\n\nJuan, a light brown Lab mix who is around seven years old and weighs about 50 lbs., was living with an elderly person. Our Mexican counterpart got a call saying the person had died but his dogs were still in the house. Our rescue picked them up and that is how I met Juan. Of all the dogs we have, Juan is the one who always shows his excitement when we come home. He is good and never destructive when we are gone, but always so happy to see us again!\n\nHe selects his dog friends and thinks he can always be the leader of the pack. He is particular about  male dog friends, but gets along with females just fine. He doesn\u2019t care for cats, so a solo dog home or one with a female dog would be best for Juan. He has a limp, but it doesn\u2019t keep him from being by your side. He is also housetrained.\n\nHe would prefer an adopter who works from home or is around a good share of the time so that he can be with you for most of the day.\n\nTo meet Juan, contact Dana, our ARRF representative working with the Tijuana rescue at dkmikel@gmail.com or 760-519-5532.\n\nUnable to adopt, but still want to help? Your support through tax-deductible donations are always needed and greatly appreciated! Donations go a long way in helping cover medical bills.\n",

            "description": "BeBe is a six year old pit bull mix. This, sweet happy go lucky girl is sure to brighten your day each and every morning.  She greets you with her ear to ear grin, an enthusiastic tail wag and an amazing little happy dance.  She looks forward to her walks and actually enjoys a little jogging.  At the end of the day, she's all about a soft bed, a good cuddle and perhaps some binge TV watching! BeBe came to us from a nearby shelter where she arrived as a stray with a pendulous mass hanging from her chest, which has since been removed. When she was spayed, two smaller mammary masses were also discovered and removed.  These masses were found to be cancerous so  should be monitored on a regular basis.  BeBe loves people, adults and older children alike. but wants to be your only four legged friend.   \n\nThe adoption Fee: $175 (dogs over 1 year) or $225 (dogs under 1 year) includes spay/neuter rabies, DHLPP and kennel cough vaccinations, worming, flea treatment, heartworm testing, heartworm preventative, microchipping and microchip registration fee.\n\nTo adopt during the COVID-19 pandemic please call us at 607-594-2255 ext 201 to schedule an appointment to meet her.\n\nOr, visit us on line at www.schuylerhumane.org for additional information, an adoption application, to see more adoptable dogs and cats or for directions to our shelter.",

One day Stella, a Black Lab mix, came to her rescuer\u2019s office in TJ and just invited herself in. He had a welcoming home, so that was not a problem. Later that same day her owner came looking for her and took her home. Two days later the same thing happened, but this time she brought her friend Beethoven, a huge Saint Bernard. Again, no problem for her rescuer, but the same thing happened. At the end of the day, the owner came looking for them and took them home. The next day Stella came again, but this time did not allow the owner to take her home. When she heard his voice, she hid in her rescuer\u2019s big warehouse. This procedure happened every day until the owner gave up. Stella definitely wanted to be rescued and find a different home!\n\nShe weighs 54 lbs., is around 7 years old but acts younger, and she plays like a puppy. Stella is good with most other dogs but can be a bit bossy. She has plenty of energy, she is housetrained, and she likes to go on a walk 2-3 times per day. She is a bit overweight at the moment and protective of her food, probably from her experiences in her former life. Her foster is working on slimming her down. She has only a few teeth left. Stella would do best in a home with no cats.\n\nFor more information, please call DANA at 760.519.5532 or jtnardi1@msn.com\n\nUnable to adopt, but still want to help? Your support through tax-deductible donations are always needed and greatly appreciated! Donations go a long way in helping cover medical bills.",

I step on my greyhound foster brother and foster parents a lot! I'm very curious, and I like to see what you're doing and explore outside. I like unpacking the toybox and chewing on each one! I can be a little shy and nervous in new places and situations. I'm doing well with older kids and the resident kitty, although I do not kennel well and when my mom tries to put me in an x-pen I try to break out.\n\nTo see other hounds currently in our care please visit the Hounds in Our Care page on our website.\n\nYou can also learn learn more about our adoption philosophy and find a link to our online application at our website: www.gpa-mn.org\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about adopting from GPA MN, please contact us at adoptioninfo@gpa-mn.org\n\n2/2/21 2:49 PM",

He is a smart cookie, already picking up on a few commands (such as sit, etc.). Clark's doesn't have Xray vision or laser eyes, but he certainly has the ability to melt your heart. We promise, with this guy around, you'll have plenty of funny stories to share about this lovable goofy pup.\n\nIf you would be interested in adding Clark Kent to your family please complete our online adoption application.\n\nUPDATE: we\u2019ve gotten to know this goofball over the last few months and can say he is quite the character. Some in the shelter have even taken to joking that his funny quirky personality makes him more of a Clark Griswold instead of Clark Kent. We\u2019ve also noticed that he will act dumb, but he is actually very smart. He is highly food motivated, which, mixed with his smarts, makes him a very trainable dog. Trick-wise, he knows sit and stay and we are eager to teach him more as we are sure he\u2019ll pick them up quickly.",

            "description": "Achilles is a tri-colored 6 year old male foxhound-coonhound mix. He is approximately 45 pounds. He loves his people! We were told he was not good with other dogs. He is a very slender boy that would do well in a home that could help him gain some love weight.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

To meet Suzy, see the contact information below.\n\nSuzy is a spayed, 55lb grey female Bully mix estimated to be around 5 years old. This outgoing gal loves car rides despite having been hit by one right before she was rescued. Suzy is one of the special dogs that ARRF is featuring from a rescue partner in Tijuana, Mexico. \n\nSuzy was rescued off the street in TJ after Salvando Vidas, our rescue partner, saw her lying next to the road covered in blood. He was able to jump out of his car, scoop her up, and bring her to safety. Suzy had just been hit by a car and sustained a few broken toes and scrapes, but luckily turned out to be just fine!\n\nSuzy is a great girl. She LOVES to go out, and every time Salvando grabs his car keys, Suzy is the first one standing by the front door. She jumps at the chance to go to the beach but likes to stay out of the water. Since she has a residual limp in one of her hind legs, Suzy is not the gal to take on long walks or runs. She would much rather sit next to you in the front seat of your car and enjoy the ride.\n\nSuzy is house trained and gets along with adults and most dogs. Her caretaker thinks she would get along well with children, but probably not cats. Her vaccinations are almost all up to date. She will just need to get her rabies vaccine updated when she arrives in the US. As with all dogs from this rescue, Suzy has been treated for Ehrlichia and is dewormed regularly to ensure she is happy and healthy.\n\nUnable to adopt, but still want to help? Your support through tax-deductible donations are always needed and greatly appreciated! Donations go a long way in helping cover medical bills.\n\nTo meet sweet Suzy, contact Dana, our ARRF representative working with the Tijuana rescue, at dkmikel@gmail.com or 760-519-5532.\n\n\n\n\n",

To meet this pet, see the contact information below.\n\nChoco is about two years old. His coloration is an unusual brown tiger pattern. He is a neutered Pit Bull Terrier who weighs about 66 lbs. He was just a skeleton when he was rescued in Mexico. He was very aggressive towards other male dogs and full of scars. Now, six months later, after being in a safe environment and always with a full belly, he is the sweetest boy you can imagine.\n\nAs with most young dogs, Choco is very active, a tad clumsy, and likes to jump up on you. This behavior still has to be corrected, and for that reason, he is not suitable for families with younger kids. He needs a 'strong' caregiver, so he will need an experienced adopter. \n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT DANA at jtnardi1@msn.com or call 760-519-5532. This pet is being fostered in the Carlsbad area of San Diego County.\n\n",

Although she was walking on 3 legs, it took almost an hour to catch her.\n\nPinta has had 7 chemotherapy treatments and reconstructive surgery. She is now cancer-free. Occasionally, when she is picked up by someone she doesn't feel 100% confortable with, she will have a \"nervous pee.\" But if she is left with her 3 legs on the floor, she won't have an accident.\n\nPinta likes to be on her own and doesn't really like the company of other dogs--she basically just ignores them. We imagine she might find a cat as a companion more interesting. She loves attention and hugs but does not like to be picked up. We think an older caregiver would be perfect for her. Definitely not a girl that will go out for long hikes or running!\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT DANA at jtnardi1@msn.com or call 760-519-5532. This pet is being fostered in the Carlsbad area of San Diego County.",

At the end of the day, Nala is honestly just the biggest lover that you'll ever meet. Nala craves human companionship, loves her daily walks, enjoys sunbathing in the backyard, lives for belly rubs, she's all about cuddles & movie nights & loves to give big kisses. She's 100% potty trained, 100% crate trained and does well on a leash.  Nala knows all of her basic commands and is very eager to please. The perfect family for Nala would be one that is active, loves the outdoors, an avid runner or someone who loves going on daily walks, and definitely a family that loves cuddles & puppy kisses.\n\nWhen it comes to people, Nala loves everyone she meets! She loves & adores children and would make the perfect family pet. She'd do best in a home with kids over 10 years of age because at times she doesn't always understand her strength. Nala would thrive best as the only dog in her furever home, although she has made a few friends while in our care. Nala does not do well with female dogs,  but does well with submissive male dogs with a proper introduction. But once again, we would like her to be the only dog in her forever home. Nala absolutely adores the cat that is currently in her foster home- especially when it comes to cuddle time.\n\nAdoption Requirements: No Exceptions\n- Fenced in Yard Required\n- Needs to be the ONLY DOG in her new home\n- Nala would thrive best as the only dog in the home, but does do well with most submissive male dogs & does great with the male cat in her current foster home\n\nWant To See More Pics:\nhttps://www.petfinder.com/dog/nala-50060051/mi/ferndale/pro-pet-otic-foundation-mi1050/\n\nNala is currently up for adoption through Lending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue located in Metro Detroit. Her adoption fee is $150  & will include her distemper, rabies, bordetella, parvo, & lepto vaccines; deworming; microchip; heartworm test; fecal test & being fixed. Nala is currently on both flea & tick prevention and has had her ProHeart 6 Injection for heartworm prevention. \n\n***PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE POST & FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS****\n\nLending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue; previously known as the PRO-PET-OTIC Foundation, is a 100% Foster-Based Rescue that is ran by all Volunteers. Which means that we are not a shelter & each animal is in an actual home with a foster family. We kindly ask that you put any questions within the email & our team of Volunteers will get back to you. With the overwhelming amount of emails please be patient with our 100% volunteer family and we will get back to you. The application MUST BE filled out, a Vet Check MUST BE completed by our team, as well as a phone interview before we do a 'Meet N Greet.'\n \nHow To Apply:\nIf you're interested in adopting one of our available dogs:\n1. Email LendingaHelpingPaw313@gmail.com with the dogs name as the subject when you ask for the adoption application.\n2. Once you have completed the application, please print it out, fill it out, scan it, & then email it back to LendingAHelpingPaw313@gmail.com. If you do not have a scanner, please take a picture with your phone and we kindly ask that you sent all attachments into one email.\n3. Please make sure to call your vet to grant our organization permission to do a vet check on your current pet.\n4. If you are interested in more than one dog, please list your top 3 choices on the completed application.\n5. Please be honest & truthful on your application. We always do a vet Check. We always do a home visit. And we always have both the prospective families & dogs best interest at heart!\n\nThank you in advance for all of your love & support,\nThe Lending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue Family",

Not the way we feel about her. Shirley should not be picked up by children as her head tilt (prob due to past trauma) has her flopping and twisting when picked up.  She does seem bonded with her mother but we would be willign to separate them if they went to active homes that would provide things to keep them busy and loved.  Shirley isnt that great with any of the dogs but she is very affectionate wiht humans. Shirley connects well to people and always greets visitors and lets you know she would love pets and greetings.  She is precious.  She is not great with her house training so that takes patience and cleaning up after her or maybe just getting her on a schedule.  She might just learn if enough time is given her as she seems to want to please.  She is VERY cute!",

These pictures capture his funny personality just perfectly.\n\nSpuds is one of a kind. He is a little bit of a chunk but that does not slow him up a bit. He seems to love every human he meets. He loves to go for walks, and gets bursts of energy and picks up speed until he\u2019s running like the wind. He looks back to make sure His person is still there. When he is ready to relax, he just plops down in the grass. He will get up when he\u2019s ready and not a minute before unless he is getting a treat. \n\nSpuds needs to be the ONLY animal in the home as he seems to be on high alert when other dogs are near. He will also need an experienced adopter that is able to handle him on leash when passing other dogs. He is hyper focused when it comes to cats. He is a nibbler not a licker and he nibbles on my chin. He is a gem and quite the charmer?. He is also house trained.\n\nPlease send a message to Paws Rescue if interested.",

He and Nala dance when they see their leashes and harnesses come out! He also loves playing in the snow! These two are a bonded pair, so we do request that they go to their forever home together.

She came to us with 9 day old puppies (which have all been adopted) and now Scarlett is looking for her forever home.\n\nScarlett is a super sweet girl - she loves to play outside but she really just wants to be with her people.  She knows most basic commands and is super smart - she wants to learn.  She is also house broken and crate trained.\n\nScarlett loves people, but she is pretty dog and cat reactive - so she should be the only pet in a home.  She would also love a fenced in yard or an active owner to take her for funs.\n\nScarlett is up to date on Shots , is spayed and microchipped and is heart worm negative.  \n\nScarlett's adoption fee is $210 - if you would like to meet her, please contact Jennifer at jennpedbutler@me.com or Karen at napr411@gmail.com.  Thank you.\n\nWE ARE A SMALL RESCUE AND HAVE A HOME VISIT AS A PART OF OUR ADOPTION PROCESS SO WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO ADOPT IN COLUMBUS, OHIO AND THE SURROUNDING AREAS.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "Milo came to us from a well meaning owner who had never owned a Chow before and wasn't quite prepared for what that entails. He is about 2 years old and 55lbs. He was only with his previous owner for a couple of weeks, but during that time he displayed protective/guarding tendencies (growling/snarling at strangers who approached the family). Milo snapped at a young child in the home (who was described as high energy), so we do recommend no children. Milo is a happy boy who is basically a young, high energy puppy in the body of a 50+lb adult dog. He has been working hard with our behaviorist to learn manners. He is a smart boy, but he gets distracted very easily! Milo will need a savvy owner who can dedicate time, structure, and patience toward helping him be the best dog he can be. He is being fostered about a half hour north of Houston.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete an application @ https://form.jotform.us/41173109602142.

When he's not hanging out with humans, you can find Ace playing with stuffy toys or snuggled up in his bed resting. Solving food puzzles and working on frozen Kongs is another one of his past times. He also enjoys the company of other dogs and will zoom around and chase with them. Ace would feel most comfortable in an adult-only home that has dog experience and understands his needs.

I love people, even strangers, and want to greet everyone with my big smile, kisses and wagging tail. I also want to be best friends with them and want their attention right away! I enjoy playing outside, doing anything--playing with toys, chasing tennis balls, and trying to catch those pesky squirrels. I'm a big lovebug and don't know my own strength sometimes, so it's best if I don't live with small children. I'm not a big fan of other dogs, but I have lived with a cat in my previous foster home. I'm a smart girl - I knows lots of commands, I go to \"my place\" in my crate to sleep and eat, I am housebroken, and I try my best to be a good dog, but I will need your help to try to \"curb my enthusiasm\" a little. I hope you will look at my pictures below and see my beautiful smile, and how much I enjoy belly rubs!! I will need an experienced dog person who has the time and patience to help me overcome some of my bad habits--I really want to . I look forward to meeting you soon and starting a new adventure together. Love, Sandy\n\nI qualify for Foster First which means you can foster me for 14 days prior to adoption to ensure I'm the perfect fit for your family?",

Sister is blind and Sis acts as her eyes and her protector! They came to us from Kentucky after their owner passed away, and they needed immediate medical care. They had skin infections, ear infections, and allergies. We have since taken care of these issues and have them on permanent lifelong allergy medications and diet modifications. They are in our de-stress living room where they enjoy the comfort of their own couch, their own tv with constant movies playing, and comfortable rugs to keep them off of the cement floors of the kennel. They enjoy the attention of the staff and volunteers alike. However, these special girls need a forever home. If you could open your heart to these angels, please fill out an application today!\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project (www.animalrescueproject.org) is committed to the best possible veterinary care for the pets it rescues and it is looking for adopters who will be similarly committed.\n\nAll dogs and puppies are given a general check-up when they enter our program. They receive medication to remove any intestinal parasites (worms), fleas, and ticks they may have. Dogs greater than six months of age are checked for heartworm. If heartworm positive, the Animal Rescue Project treats the disease. Dogs and pups receive all age-appropriate vaccinations for distemper, and dogs greater than four months of age are also vaccinated for rabies, in compliance with State of Michigan laws.\n\nMost dogs and older puppies are spayed or neutered before adoption. In the case of puppies not old enough to be safely sterilized, a $50 deposit is required at the time of adoption and is refunded to the adopter with proof of sterilization.\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project requires every adopter to establish an active relationship with a veterinarian no later than 10 days after adoption. Adopters will receive a plan for routine veterinary care at the time of adoption and are expected to work with their vet to complete the plan.",

She is crate trained and house trained -- not one accident in her foster home. She picks up a toy and takes it to her foster mom if she needs to go outside. She loves chew toys and chasing balls -- not so good at bringing the ball back however. Glenda is the self appointed President of the Neighborhood Watch Committee and if someone walks by, she'll let you know. She is working with a trainer to learn how to greet other dogs and people when on a leash. She loves walks. And she loves her treats and learns quickly as a result. Maybe Glenda is your girl!!",

This playful, active lady will then tell you she's eager to go for her leash walks. Lots of walks, she says! She's a curious girl who loves being outdoors. With her spunk and energy, she is great fun to walk or run with. She's friendly to new people she meets, just hoping for a belly scratch. She's a house-trained lady who does well home alone, roaming freely or snoozing in her crate. This very easy-going, calm girl will fit well into any home. She hopes for people to take her on adventures, and possibly a dog buddy to hang out with. Come meet this loving, lovable lady!",

            "description": "Introducing Stevie Wonder, a gentle, housebroken Labrador Retriever mix. Stevie Wonder, like his namesake, is blind, but that doesn't stop him from living a full life with lots of activity. Stevie is fine with other dogs and cats, and will fit into a home with other animals. Stevie does well when he is alone in the house. He simply takes his spot on his bed, near his toys and water, while he waits for you to come back from running your errands. Stevie, being blind, is careful where he walks in the house and prefers carpets to hard-surface floors. Stevie walks on a leash, but is a little skittish since he can't see where he's going and will need encouragement on his walks. Stevie loves being outside which is where his playfulness shines. He enjoys rolling in the grass. Once his feet touch the grass he is rolling around with joy, and he would do well in a home with a backyard that he can explore. Stevie is very mellow and well-mannered. He enjoys play time with other pets, but is not someone who needs a lot of attention. He likes belly rubs and scratches, and is very affectionate. He also loves a good chew toy, and a yummy treat. Stevie would do best in a home without stairs and with carpeting. A fenced-in backyard would be his dream! He does well alone, but would likely also do well with another furry companion to play with. As Stevie will take some time to adjust to his new surroundings, he would ideally love a pet-parent who has experience with blind dogs, or who has the patience to allow him to settle in. Are you the one who can give Stevie a safe home with lots of grass? Then come meet Stevie today!",

Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nBrooke is a pretty 1 year-old Cattle Dog/Shepherd mix female who was surrendered to a county dog shelter along with her twin sister Brynn by their owner who could no longer care for them. These girls are beautiful dogs and are very outgoing and friendly but have had little training to date. Brooke does like to jump on people for attention but is responsive to correction and very food-motivated so is learning that all good things come to pups who keep their four paws on the floor. She is working on her leash manners and is pretty much all over the place at this point but with daily practice in her new home, will soon be walking like a pro on the leash. Brooke and her sister hated each other (sibling rivalry in full display!). We have found that Brooke is very particular about her dog friends so must be in the home as an only dog. She can also be very leash reactive when she sees other dogs so will need a home in a quiet neighborhood where she won't have to encounter new dogs on a daily basis. She also needs a cat-free home. Brooke has done well with crate-training in her foster home so we expect she'll pick up the house rules quickly in her new home. This girl has loads of potential and just needs a patient and active family who's got the time and energy to devote to molding a diamond in the rough into a canine good citizen. The reward will be years of love and devotion from this sweet girl. Brooke weighs about 45 pounds currently but is thin and needs to gain about 5 pounds to be at her ideal weight. Her adoption fee is $325. She's spayed, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Brooke. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Brooke and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

            "description": "Daphne von Damme is a delightful 1-2 year old German Shepherd. She is tall, dark and delicious. Her youthful energy generates admiration, and Daphne sweetly soaks up the limelight from her people. Motivated to get the show on the road, Daphne needs reminders that the performance isn\u2019t always about her.  A medium-energy girl, she is working on her manners around other pups -- pushy or unruly tykes will receive the cold paw or a warning. She's a no for cats. She cultivates an air of sophistication, possessing the attributes that would make an excellent partner on stage.  Daphne only needs you to provide the setting.\n\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website and Facebook page!

This medium-energy golden boy with a gorgeous black mask is working on gaining a few pounds and soon his stunning physique will shine. Rogan seeks a partner who is  serious-minded and resolute like him, one who will provide structure and guidance. He can be affectionate with his people but does require a no-nonsense attitude.  As he exits his kennel, Rogan looks forward to spending time with his people. He is not a fan of other dogs and will vocalize when he sees them, so he will do best as your one and only. An adult home in a more rural area without a lot of other dogs around would be ideal. \n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website! So, check in and log on often! \n\nWestside thanks you for looking at our amazing dogs and for choosing to save an animal's life through rescue. \n\nDon't forget to visit your local animal shelter...the source of many of our dogs.\n \nwww.sheprescue.org\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WGSRescue\n\n",

She is VERY earnest and mostly friendly with other dogs (not all but most), but overall probably would do best as the only dog in the home.  She was a throwaway stray in a neighborhood where a household just kept getting or maybe breeding dogs, and she was let to roam around the streets unsupervised.  Shawnee is very affectionate with people, and needs a better life than just being stuck in a kennel!  Shawnee needs to be an inside dog in a stable home where the people have experience with large and strong dogs.  Fenced-in yard a huge plus for this active girl.",

Now that she has become comfortable she is very loving to us all.  She is a very energetic spunky gal who needs room to run! \n\nNo children! No other pets! \n\nELLIE IS NOT AN APARTMENT LIVING TYPE OF DOG, SHE IS VERY VERY ENERGETIC AND LIKES TO BARK! SHE ALSO WOULD NOT BE A GOOD FIT GOING TO ANY DOG PARKS! ELLIE NEEDS SOMEONE WITH EXPERIENCE AND WHO HAS THE TIME TO DEVOTE IN GAINING HER TRUST. \n\nEllie is also one that is going to take multiple visits to gain her trust, she does not just warm up to people quickly. She needs patience and understanding. A quiet home without a lot of visitors is a must. \n\nTo meet this dog in person please submit an application, which can be found on our website chippewahumane.com. Once your application is approved a staff member will be in contact to schedule an appointment. Please call the shelter at 715 861 5748 with any questions.",

We aren't sure what caused them or if it will continue to be a problem for her in the future or if it is just that they weren't treated properly from the start so her ears do have quite a bit of scarring. A fenced-in yard would be ideal just because she can't hear you when you are calling her name, a long tie out or leash walking would also work for her.\n\nWe have recently discovered that Sookie would do best with dogs her own size or even bigger as she wasn't very nice to a smaller dog she recently met\n\nTo meet this dog in person please submit an application, which can be found on our website chippewahumane.com. Once your application is approved a staff member will be in contact to schedule an appointment. Please call the shelter at 715 861 5748 with any questions.",

Example of training techniques an owner will need to be comfortable with: Hand feeding training (he is excited around food so this will likely be stressful in the beginning).   He can live with kids, but no younger than 15 until food aggression and dominance issues are under control. Can live with small or large dogs.\nThe rescues trainer will work with Bacon at your home. \n\n fill out the application at this link: http://fs30.formsite.com/haarescue/adoptionapplication/index.html",

He is friendly to cats but should not be left alone with them as he is still a puppy and does not know his own strength. Allie definitely needs a doggy buddy who can be a good playmate and can explain the rules of the house to him. Allie has never been the only dog and becomes very anxious if he doesn't see or hear his doggy friends. Allie gets along with male and female dogs. He is very good at coming when he is called. He is used to living out in the country and might be too noisy for an apartment. Allie is used to being crated during the day. He is very gentle and not at all nippy or irritable.

            "description": "Bulldog lovers take note! This guy is ALL THAT.\n\nSosa is a neutered male English Bulldog, who weighs about 67 lbs, and is between 4 and 5 years old. Sosa is a complex guy. He is picky about his male humans. He will do best in a female-only, adult home. He is working with a trainer, and potential adopters should be prepared to continue to work with him. He likes his crate, and is house trained. He's the quintessential work-in-progress!\n\nSosa is, for the most part, good with the other dogs. He is headstrong, so his new home will need to closely monitor interactions with other headstrong dogs. He loves his food and was very overweight. He was well over 70 lbs when surrendered, but has slowly been losing the excess weight. \n\nIn typical bulldog fashion, Sosa has a lot of energy for a little while, but not a lot of stamina! He can be a bull in a China shop, then he easily wears out. He is good with people. He stands at the van and asks for help when trying to get in because his stocky body isn't able jump. He's a funny, quirky pup who can make a lot of noise, especially when he wants food. \n\nAdoption fees cover age specific vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip, heartworm/lyme/ehrlichia test, worming and transport fees. \n\nAdoption fees: \nThrough 6 months of age $450; \n7 months to through 5 years $400; \n6 years and under 9 years $325: bonded pairs are $500; \n9 years and older $250: bonded pairs are $300 \n\nAlmost Home Rescue of New England is a 501 c 3 non-profit rescue; rescuing dogs since 2005. All Adoption applications are completed on line at www.almosthomerescue.net \n\nThis dog is available unless it is marked as Pending, meaning Pending Adoption. This dog is in foster care locally, ONLY if Maine or New Hampshire is listed next to the dogs name; otherwise, the dog is still waiting with our partner rescue for an adoption or foster home in New England. \n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior dogs have a history of being kept up to date on rabies and distemper, have had annual heartworm tests, and are on heartworm preventative at least 6 months of the year. Current pets must by spayed/neutered. \n\nImported dogs are transported on a USDA approved transport with a Health Certificate. All imported dogs are quarantined 14 days prior to getting on transport.\n\n",

The people that found this boy wandering the streets could not locate his owners and fed him; they could not keep him because he can jump 4' fences.\n\nYeager is friendly and loves everyone. He is eager to please and even-tempered. He gets along fine with other non-reactive dogs. He will do best with older kids due to his size and his strength.\n\n We are working on basic commands. He is house-trained. He is calm but gets excited on a leash. He wants to be with his people and may whines  in his crate or when you leave. He is heartworm positive but no microfilaria. He was given a ProHeart 6 injection for slow kill. He is fully vetted, neutered and microchipped.\n\nPlease visit Regard4Life Animal Rescue at Petsmart in Longview on Saturdays for more information. You can also review our adoption album at http://Regard4Life.org or email regard4life.info@gmail.com.",

He is being fostered together with one of our other young male dalmatians. His Foster home reports:\n\"This 2-1/2 year old boy is full of vim and vigor. He is sure to steal your heart with hugs and kisses all day long. Pongo attaches very quickly to his humans, but needs very slow introductions to other dogs. He is currently fostered with another male dalmatian that is also looking for a forever home. His foster home also has a few dogs of their own and with slow proper introduction Pongo has done well with them.  He does love the girl dogs. He would probably do best living with another very playful female.  \nHe is the sweetest guy with one amber eye and the other a cool blue.  He loves his toys, the tougher the better as he chews on them constantly. He needs to be the only dog and in a home with no children under age 14. He doesn't play well with cats. \nPongo will do best with a single person or a couple who will keep him actively entertained so that he doesn\u2019t get bored, and who will take him to basic obedience classes. He has a soft little whine when he\u2019s left alone, but it doesn\u2019t last long.  He does need soMe training otherwise like a typical smart dalmatian he will counter surf and get into the trash in search of a tasty meal or trait. \"\nOTHER:\nBarks at someone when they come to the door.\nVery smart, already learned to open the wire gate.\nCute little crooked tail, probably a birth mishap.\nLoves the confort of a nice pillow to settle down and sleep with.\nHouse trained.\nAnswers to a whistle.\nNeeds leash and harness training for walking.",

I\u2019m known for my precious smile, and all 50 pounds of me is just one cuddly lap dog. My favorite toy is my giant Kong octagonal ball.

He is being fostered together with one of our other young male dalmatians named Pongo.\n His Foster home reports:\n\"Wesley will rock your world! He is 2 years old, 50 lbs of energy with a dash of charm. His markings are striking, complete with a \u00bd black and \u00bd white tail. He loves all people and quickly bonds to humans. He is currently fostered with Pongo in San Diego, and did well meeting the other medium to large size dogs that permanently reside in his foster home.  \nHe loves to give his humans hugs and kisses and holds on tightly.  He is very playful and needs an active single or couple to take him on walks, runs and playtime.  Wesley is just a happy-go-lucky dog who follows the pack.    So far he has been doing very well in his foster home.   He will need positive reinforcement training once he settles in his new forever home.   He wants every bit of love and attention that you have to give. Overall, he is the sweetest, most loyal dog you could ask for. He likes to have skin to skin contact when settling in for the night and everyone is asleep.  He is a snuggle bunny and very affectionate.  \nHe has not been introduced to young children, cats or small dogs yet.  Showed curiosity when he saw some feral cats but did not react as strongly as his foster housemate Pongo.\"\nOTHER:\nLoves treats, loves to play.\nGive him a pillow to sleep with, seems to settle him down quietly.\nHouse trained.\nAnswers to a whistle.\n",

Of course, we said yes. When the woman brought the dog NORI to cottage she said \"oh by the way, and she is heartworm positive and both her ACL's are torn.\" Gulp. Yes, we had committed and didn't want her to suffer, so we would take her - how could we turn this sweet pup down. Nori is about 5 years old, 65 pounds, and a mix of half malamute, husky and \"other breed.\"\n\nWe are treating her heartworm ongoing, and getting a surgeon lined up to do TWO ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) surgeries. If you would like to foster this sweetie post-surgery, please be in touch. You will enjoy her lovely temperament and great disposition.\n\nIf you would like to foster her as she goes through her treatments please let us know. She is one very sweet dog.",

Please call or text 253 208-0590 if you are interested in him.)\nButterball is an active 11-12 year old lab mix boy who is looking for a loving family without any other pets. He loves attention and adventures whether it be simple car rides or outdoor hikes. He is used to being treated like a member of the family and loves to squeeze up next to someone for some extra attention. He\u2019s house trained and walks well on a leash but unfortunately is pretty reactive to other animals.  As you can see from his photos, he\u2019s a professional napper and cuddle bug. He\u2019s extremely sweet with people and seems to be aging well with no known health issues.  Butterball needs a home with a fenced yard and with a person or family that doesn\u2019t need to leave him alone regularly long hours.\n",

He was literally a sack of bones. The \"owner\" said, he didn't want to eat. When the shelter staff offered him some food, he practically inhaled it. Buddy was too traumatized to be up for public adoption, so he came to our rescue to recover before starting the journey of finding a new home. Buddy is at a great weight now. He's a very, very sensitive dog and will not eat when he's stressed, so you can imagine how stressed he was with his previous owner to become skin and bones.\nBuddy does like certain men but in general he prefers women. He loves butt scratches and is a quiet guy. We are looking for a calm/adult (preferably 1 person household) with yard access. Buddy is great on walks but is content just being in the house and the yard.\nWill you be that special person that shows Buddy, that loving homes without abuse exist?\nIngrid\n(310) 480 6030\npcdrapps@yahoo.com\nIf you'd like to meet this cutie, please fill out our adoption application: http://www.pcdogrescue.org/online_application.html",

He right foot is rather uniquely splayed and turns inward but it doesn't seem to bother him much.  \n\nHis ideal home would be with a single man or woman.  He tends to guard the ones he loves the most.  So a single person who would be willing to understand his personality would be his best match.

He was literally a sack of bones. The \"owner\" said, he didn't want to eat. When the shelter staff offered him some food, he practically inhaled it. Buddy was too traumatized to be up for public adoption, so he came to our rescue to recover before starting the journey of finding a new home. Buddy is at a great weight now. He's a very, very sensitive dog and will not eat when he's stressed, so you can imagine how stressed he was with his previous owner to become skin and bones. \nBuddy does like certain men but in general he prefers women. He loves butt scratches and is a quiet guy. We are looking for a calm/adult (preferably 1 person household) with yard access. Buddy is great on walks but is content just being in the house and the yard. \nWill you be that special person that shows Buddy, that loving homes without abuse exist?\nIngrid\n(310) 480 6030\npcdrapps@yahoo.com\nIf you'd like to meet this cutie, please fill out our adoption application: http://www.pcdogrescue.org/online_application.html",

He does not care to be left alone for long periods of time. He is also alvailable for fostering.\nKona is the definition of a chill dog. His number one priorities are going on long walks and sniffing. He LOVES walks so he can use his hound dog nose and soak up all the smells. He is very good on a leash and responds wonderfully to a little tug on the leash when you want him to change direction. A low traffic household with a mature couple would suit him best. He is not a super cuddly dog, just wants a comfy bed and a window to look out of. He is potty trained and ready for his new home. If there is another dog in the house hold he doesnt mind the company but he would rather be left alone . Please fill out an application to meet him!",

He has a deformed front tibial/fibial fusion on his right leg and joint on left ankle appears deformed but that does not inhibit him at all. He is sweet and won't last long!

She is a huge fan of belly rubs and her most favorited past time is giving endless kisses. Kahlo is only 9 months old. She came to the rescue after suffering from a severe spinal cord injury that left her back end completely paralyzed. She now rocks a diaper and a cute little cart to help her get around. Some people might be taken back by her disability but not Kahlo, she strives to lead the most normal life possible; never letting anything get her down. With the right family, Kahlo will continue to beat the odds and change the world around her. The unconditional love she possesses allows her to accept every person and animal she meets. She is a true sweetheart! Kahlo is now looking for her foster-to-adopt family who owns their home in the central Florida area, where she won't be left home alone for more than a few hours at a time. Could you be that extra special family she is looking for? If so, please fill out our adoption screening form: https://mettarescuefamily.org/adoptable-dogs",

You can make an appointment to meet available dogs at our ADOPTION CENTER by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet and available cats at MEOW PALACE by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet1. \n\nFor animals in FOSTER homes, please submit an online application and an adoption team will reply with the next steps. We thank you for your patience as we work to keep saving lives during this difficult time. \n\nPLEASE VISIT THIS WEBSITE TO FIND THE ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE: http://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-forms/\n\nHi there! My name is Felix! I came to Homeward Trails from Russell County. My previous owners had to surrender me because they could no longer care for me. I am a beautiful 2 year old boxer. I love meeting new people! I am very social and ready to befriend every human I see. \n\nMy favorite things to do are wrestle in the yards with my friends and play with toys! I also love food. I haven't tried a food I didn't like! \n\nSo I'm perfect, right? Right! Except I'm large. People have met me and loved me but every time they say, \"Too big!\" I didn't know being big was a bad thing... I've always been a big boy...\n\nThere's gotta be someone out there who likes big dogs, right? You do? Really!? I prefer and adult only home as the only pet so I can be spoiled rotten! Okay, well reach out to my people to set up a special VIP appointment during the week! I would love to meet you! And guess what? I am a part of the Go Fetch Program! My adoption fee is waived and I come with free bonus items when adopted! Do you love free things and big boy dogs? Well, come on!\n\nAdoption Coordinator: Homeward Trails Adoption Center\nLocation: Adoption Center\n\nIncludes spay/neuter and microchip. \n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\nWe also provide free online workshop with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria/Falls Church/DC area. Start your new dog out on the right foot with this valuable, expert guidance FREE!\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program",

She is the full package of a dog and is patiently waiting to shower you with love and kisses. Jazz would love a home with a large yard. She is very playful and has lots of energy. Jazz is also potty trained, people friendly and dog friendly too! Don't keep Jazz waiting - come meet her! Jazz is available for foster or adoption.",

            "description": "AVAILABLE NOW\n\nShasta is thought to be around 7 years old.  She is mother to Beebee.  She was brought in from Lake Dr., Trimble.  Shasta weighs around 50 pounds.  Shasta is a dog that needs some time to warm up to meeting new people.  She loves furry squeaky toys.  We have found that Shasta appears to be housebroken.\n\nShasta came into the shelter with a rear leg injury and some pretty yucky skin. She was covered in fleas. Her elbows are raw, and her fur is sparse over much of her body. In short, she\u2019s looking a little tatty and used up.\n\nOur biggest concern about Shasta is that she has a torn ACL. We have her on pain medication, but she's going to need surgery for the injury to completely heal.\n\nShasta does not do transitions well and will need a patient, experienced adopter with no children. Once Shasta settles in, however, she is sweet, sweet, sweet.  With other dogs, she can be selective on who she likes and who she doesn't like.  Shasta will need a quiet place to call home. Can you give this sweet senior a cozy bed and some TLC?\n\nBecause of the pandemic the shelter is currently adopting dogs to Athens Co. residents only.  \n\nIf you have other dogs and/or children at home you must bring them in for a meet and greet to see if they are compatible. \n\nSupport the Athens County Dog Shelter by walking your dog or yourself!  It won't cost you a cent!  Download the app \"Walk For a Dog\" from http://wooftrax.com to your phone and select Athens County Dog Shelter and then take a walk!  It's great for you and your pooches plus it benefits the homeless dogs at the shelter.  Use the app each time you grab the leash.  You, your dog and the shelter will all benefit.\n\nPlease visit  http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/U0RLUOCMT7KI \nto see the wishlist of items that the Shelter is in need of.  Thank You!",

They decided they did not want to have a dog. She is crate trained and house trained. She has never had an accident in the house. She is not food aggressive with people, but can be food aggressive with other pets. She really enjoys the company of men and would do best with older children, 10+ years. Meili (Mimi) loves to play fetch with her toys and when she is really happy she hops like a bunny. She enjoys the outdoors and time in the backyard. I feel she needs to be an only pet as she doesn\u2019t know how to funnel her energy sometimes. She is protective of her owners, so she will bark at strangers. \n\nBest way to contact me, Debra, is by text 317-902-3159 or email thomcap4@gmail.com. I am located in Morgantown, IN.\n",

However, we do know that Cali is an absolute sweetheart and whatever may have happened to her has not stopped her from being friendly, loving, and playful. \n\nCali will be a fun-loving addition to your home.

Her owners abandoned her tied to a tree on a 3-4ft rope for over 2mos before we took her in. She spent her life tied up and being bred. She's had multiple litters of puppies and when she was found there were several decomposing puppies found around her. She is very affectionate and just wants to be close to someone at all times. She does have some vision impairment due to the chronic infections but she can see and gets around well.",

PLEASE visit our website BetterDaysRescue.org to read our policies as well as this dog's requirements/detailed profile.\n\n**\nOur dogs are placed in the Phoenix metro area, for proximity to our rescue (home checks, follow up visits, visit to finalize adoption) and for access to our veterinarian. Sorry, no exceptions.\n\n**\n\nAdoption begins with a Foster-To-Adopt period.\n\n**\n\nOpie's a bit of a conundrum - he looks like a small brown bear and moves like a fox. However, he has cat feet, laps water like a cat, and rubs gleefully on us just like a cat! He is the happiest and most grateful dog, and he's full of fun! Yes, he is a lap-pet even at his svelte weight. :) Vets estimate him as Cattledog but we're going to say there's something snuggly and gleeful in there, perhaps Husky.\n\nOpie has some scars and though they're not immediately apparent, we suspect he had some scary encounters in his previous life. Now, he is the life of the party and so grateful for everything. He takes snacks so gently! Opie's dog-selective, so will be carefully matched to a new dog companion (a female friend might be best).\n\nOpie seems especially considerate about using his dog-door to reach his outside patio. He prefers getting completely away from the living quarters to do his business!\n\nIf you believe you're a possible match for Opie, please complete an adoption application! Please include information regarding your experience with this breed, and with raising and training a puppy.\n\nOpie is not a barker and seems very house-trained so could be a good companion for condo living. He really enjoys running zoomies off-leash, so requires a fenced yard.\n\nWe encourage you to register on our site and \"Favorite\" the dog(s) that interest you, so that you will be notified when bio, photos, or status are updated.\n\n\"Fenced yard\" means, a backyard that is adjacent to and connected with your residence. (It does not mean a nearby fenced area/dog park.)\nGates must have padlocks and thresholds (cement or buried pavers to prevent digging.)\nYard and patio must be free of debris and have room for dogs to run and play *on a lawn and/or in a very shaded area.* Please do not invite us to your home if you have not yet landscaped your yard!\nWe do not place dogs in situations where there are \"drained\" or empty swimming pools, which are a fall hazard and contribute to the propogation of mosquitos.\nLast and not least, we DO NOT adopt to students as we have found that they often do not know or anticipate where life will take them.\n\nDiscussion about a dog - including scheduling of a home check or other dialogue - cannot occur until we have received your completed adoption application. NO EXCEPTIONS. Thank you!",

            "description": "This 8-year-old, 8lb, poodle mix is named Clark because he was wearing a Superman costume in his profile pic when AJL first saw him, which is fitting to who he is a Super Dog. He\u2019s had a rough life before AJL but he is a fighter and is as happy as a dog can be. He bounces up and down the stairs like a puppy, loves to go on short walks and enjoys car rides (he\u2019ll even beat you to the driver seat). He is good with all the people that he meets. He needs to go potty every 4 hours so easy access to a backyard is important. He knows how to go potty on a pee pad if needed but he is fine holding it through the night. Clark has some medical conditions - he has a stage 5 heart murmur and the vet had to extract a good bit of his teeth due to plaque buildup so he only eats wet food. Regardless, he would flash his big smile like he doesn\u2019t care at all. The vet recommends taking him back for a re-evaluation of his teeth next April and a re-check of his heart in November 2021.   \n\nHe would fit well in a family with a peaceful home and someone who can stay with him most of the day. He would not do well in an apartment or condo as he has a bit of separation anxiety and may cry when you leave. He would be great as an only dog or with another older dog but no cats. He does not like being in a crate and would much rather sleep next to you on the bed. He is ready for his forever home where he can give his unconditional love and find a family that can love him back. Pup, pup and away, Clark!",

            "description": "\"My charming black fur eye patch suits me perfectly. I like to imagine that it comes from a playful adventure.  For example, maybe it is a pirate\u2019s eye patch. A pirate (or other) adventure with you sounds like fun!  Maybe I got a bruise while I was showing my love like a WWF wrestler, as I sometimes do, with my abundant affection, enthusiasm and 46 pounds of energy.  Or maybe my patch is there simply to make me look handsome and dashing (which I am!).  In any case, let\u2019s become a team, so we can enjoy our next adventures together!\n\nI am about three years old but puppy-like in my zest for life. I could be a good running partner. I enjoy treats and attention.  Some of the volunteers who walk me say I am smart and learn nicely for treats. My forever family will be an active & patient, dog-experienced one who can provide me with the mental & physical enrichment I need to be the best version of me.\n\nMy ideal home will be calm and quiet without many visitors, and I\u2019ll be the only four-legged family member.  The staff feel that I'd likely do well with kid roommates ages 15 & older. \n\nI recently spent some time with a fabulous foster in a comfy home and here are some things she says about me: \"He is a love bug who sleeps through the night and totally housebroken; we only use the crate if we are leaving for a while, short trip he will just lay on the couch. At night he sleeps with us, as he has to be near people! Loves to snuggle on the couch a lot of the time.\"\n\nSo, if you think I sound like the fur friend you could love forever, schedule an appointment here (ProvidenceAC.org/AdoptADog) today to meet me! I have my bags all packed \u2013 I just need my forever family to find me.\n\nP.S. Someone is so excited for me to find my fur-ever home, that they have sponsored my adoption fee! That means I can join your family today for FREE! Woohoo!!\"\n\n\n\n**Some of this pet's photos have been provided by Crissy Everhart Photography (https://www.crissyeverhart.com) & sponsored by Subaru.\n-------\nDuring your appointment, you will be able to meet a selection of pets in the Kennels or Cattery that day. New pets are arriving daily!\n-------\n\nProvidence Animal Center relies on adoption fees and donations to save pets! Adoption fees vary per pet. \n\nCan\u2019t adopt? Consider fostering or donating!

I am very loving and roll on my back for belly rubs and I am a happy go lucky guy.  I would do best in a home without small kids as I have been known to resource guard my bones and some toys. I had originally come from a bad neglect case of starvation - so feed me by myself and that may explain why I sometimes resource guard my busy bone.  I absolutely love toys....as where I came from I was deprived of all the fun and normal stuff a dog should experience - so I am living life now!  I can also jump VERY high and run very fast...so a fenced in yard would be great for me to run around and play in. I recently went home on foster with 2 wonderful people who saw my potential. I was able to watch my first football game and instantly became a Bills fan while cuddling on the couch with my foster parents. We enjoyed walks and I was eager to meet new people during our outings. I even enjoyed greeting the contractors that were in and out of the home. But unfortunately due to one of them having allergies they had to return me to the shelter after just a week. I ride wonderfully in a car and enjoy traveling. Please email or call the shelter if you think I would be a good fit in your home.",

            "description": "This handsome boy is Silvio! He is around 6 years old and he is a purebred Doberman Pinscher. He is on the smaller size for a Doberman. Silvio is true to his breed and quickly warmed up to all the humans in his foster house. He is a sweetheart and loves to cuddle, but does not appear to be too interested in other dogs at this time. He is great with kids. He is more of a couch potato than a marathon runner and is always down for a good snuggle session. If you are interested in meeting Silvio, please submit an adoption application on our website. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed.

            "description": "Bobby, 5 year old, American bull dog. He was saved from a high kill shelter in Houston TX and spent some time with a trainer.  Bobby is a great dog. Extremely affectionate and obedient.  He is your typical bulldog that is independent and stubborn at times. But eager to please and Extremely food motivated.  He is medium to low activity level. He truly enjoys a good snuggle or long lasting chew toy to keep him satisfied.  He is non reactive to cats or dogs while out on walks leashed. He will coexist with female dogs but is selective and will become dominant.  Male dogs are a NO, at this time. An experienced handler will help him to continue his success.  He should not be placed in a first time dog owner or an under confident adopter, he will rule the environment.  He's not pushy, but stout and strong minded. Bobby would do best as the only pet in your home. To help Bobby and his family be successful his trainer will continue virtual sessions for a period of time. \n\nIf interested in learning more or adoption please fill out an application \nhttps://heartoftheunderdog.org/adoption-application",

He is a very sweet, gentle giant who loves to be an inside dog. He appears to be housetrained and loves, loves, loves being around people. He is crate trained and we are working on leash training. He will sit on command and listens well and is a big cuddle bug.  He has done well with other dogs his size. He's a little too interested in cats and we believe he would likely give chase.  He weighs about 70 pounds and is approximately 4 years old. He appears to be an American Bulldog mix.  He has been neutered, fully vaccinated and microchipped and is heartworm negative, so he is ready to be adopted! This big hunk deserves a family as awesome as he is! \n\nRufus' adoption fee is $350.  Rufus is currently in his foster home in Sheridan, TX and will remain there until adopted.",

She loves to sit in your lap, snuggle, and give kisses. She can be a little reactive when on leash but is otherwise great.  She can get pretty attached to people and will growl at other dogs if they get too close; this has improved as her fosters are doing a great job working with her on this. She is a very confident and assertive girl and will resource guard her food and crate to the other dogs in the home so she will do best as the only dog. She has never shown any aggression to people and is overall a super sweet girl that is just looking to be with someone to make her their number one.\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give.

But MAN once you have his trust, you have your best friend for life.   Monty is now happily in a foster home where he shares with two -four legged friends, a feline and a 8 year old boy and is such a love with the entire family.  But as most chows -does not like strangers coming in the home - thinks he has to protect his people.  He will lunge and try to nip at strangers so a home where there is a lot of kids/people coming in and out of the house would not be a good fit.  He walks great on a leash, house trained, and doesn't chew.  I am looking for an experienced rescue dog owner/s, fenced yard, no young kids, other dogs in the home are great but lots of experience introducing dogs... and  A LOT of patience and love.   He truly is a good boy but needs to find his family who loves him for his quirkiness and will work with him and help him feel safe.   If you think you can be his person please email me at melissau.safehaven@gmail.com or use please cut and paste our direct link: \n\nhttps://mamasshelter.rescuegroups.org/forms/form?formid=5826\n",

My name is Charlie Brown, as I'm from the southern land of TN where everyone has two names! I'm quite the character and would love an active home that will take me on adventures like hikes and long walks! Have errands to run? I LOVE car rides and would be happy to be your copilot! I can be active, but I do come with an off switch and LOVE to nap! At home, I tend to bark at people and dogs outside of my home and alert the neighborhood (Isn't that what hounds do?!). I would benefit with structure and a daily routine in the home to keep things consistent! I plan to work (hard!) with a trainer in my next home to help with some basic training and my barking at things. I love to learn and I'm very food motivated with this sniffer of mine!! My ideal parents would have experience owning dogs. I'm a bit of the jealous type so I'd prefer to be the only animal in the house! And while you're at it, kids are scary and unpredictable so let's skip them too! \n\nSo.. whatta ya say?! Long walk on the beach, dinner and nap and we'll say it's a FOREVER home?\n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please fill out an application at survivortails.org or email adoptions@survivortails.org with any questions.\n",

This did nothing to improve her trust in human kind. Yes, she was a hot mess. She was scared, snappy and defensive. She spent her first three weeks here slowly learning that the world is not such a bad place. Now, she is remarkable on the leash, is crate trained and does well with other dogs. Admittedly she still has a ways to go but she is so worth it. Kat will need patience, love and consistency to continue to grow into the dog she's supposed to be. Everyone who has witnessed Kat's journey has been amazed with her progress. We don't do many dogs that came in like Kat did and while they are never the easiest stories they are the ones that teach us the most.\n\nAdoption donation $700\nCall Kim at 425-888-9322\nPlease do not email",

When I am not playing and goofing around, you will find me curled up next to my Foster mom and sister. I love giving hugs and kisses. I make friends with everyone I meet!  I have a lot of energy and love to run!  I get bored and need lots of toys and a friend to keep me company. I would be the perfect addition to your pack.",

She was pregnant and had a litter of 6 pups...She was a good Mom but is now ready for a home of her own...But after thinking it through, We believe that Jolene will be happier being adopted with Venus who came from the same hoarding situation ( and we believe Venus is Jolene's Mom!) Both girls are very cuddly with each other and happy to be together...If you could open your home and heart to 2 little gray girls with a difficult past...It would be Wonderful!!!!",

            "description": "Bootch is the shelter gossip! He loves to know what everyone is doing and wants everyone to know what he is doing. He gets right up in your business, seeks attention, and wants to cuddle in your lap. He will press his whole body into you for petting. When he's not seeking attention, he adores going for walks. The longer the better. He likes it even more if he has a running partner. Bootch also adores toys, playing and running the agility course. He is just a goofy guy who adores people and likes to greet everyone he meets. Bootch has been training wearing a muzzle due to some reactivity towards other dogs on walks. He does well in the car, and already knows some basic commands (sit, down, shake) but will need a basic obedience class and lots of structure to guide him in good doggie manners. He will thrive in an environment where he can receive lots of attention, love and exercise. He doesn't have much experience with other dogs and would need a slow and careful introduction. Want to have Bootch tell you everything that's going on in the shelter? Come to our Westside Shelter to say Hello to him! Bootch can't wait to say Hi to you. Weight: 67lbs Housetrained: Keeps his kennel clean in the shelter Dogs: meet and greet, would need a slow and careful introduction Cats: Unknown however most likely best without Children: Over 8 years old due to size, energy and food possession",

            "description": "THIS IS A COURTESY LISTING - PLEASE SEE CONTACT INFO AT THE END OF THE BIO\n\nSweet Marley was in one home all of his life. Then things changed at home and Marley was no longer wanted. He's the perfect size at about 40 lbs. Marley can be apprehensive with new people but very affectionate once he's comfortable. Marley is generally a very quiet dog but when he gets excited when you come home, he will talk a little. Very cute. Marley loves soft blankets and dog beds and rides well in the car. He's great on walks and makes sure, he doesn't leave any flower out, to be smelled. He's a bright guy who would love to spend the rest of his life in a home and not in a boarding facility. Marley is also available for long-term fostering which means, the rescue will cover any medical expenses for him. He's looking for an adult household with yard access.\nDon't wait, contact us to meet Marley!\nIngrid\n(310) 480 6030\npcdrapps@yahoo.com\nIf you'd like to meet this cutie, please fill out our adoption application: http://www.pcdogrescue.org/online_application.html",

He can also be a little mouthy when he meets people so we ask that he meets all kids prior to adoption. Baloo has a ton of energy that will need to be worn out every day. He loves to race around the backyard and will need some training to walk nicely on the leash. Baloo loves to show off his tricks that he knows and works hard for food. When meeting another dog his size, Baloo was friendly but very energetic. We ask that he meets all dogs prior to adoption and recommend he goes to a home without small dogs. Baloo was surrendered to the shelter because he had too much energy. He would do best in a home that can provide daily exercise. \n Primary Color: Brown Secondary Color: Tan Weight: 100lbs Age: 5yrs 8mths 3wks Animal has been Neutered",

My name is Nico, I am around 2 years old, about 43lbs, already neutered, microchipped & up to date on vaccinations and all set to move right into your home and heart!\n \nMy friends here call me the cutest little chicken nugget and baby hippo. I do love chicken nuggets, and, like the hippo, I am very shy, loving and loyal to my people and fellow hippos. I would love an adult-only, kitty-free, calm, quiet home with another dog to help me build confidence. I take a little time to warm up to new people, but my friends say that once I warm up, I will give you my heart, endless laughs, kisses & cuddles. I love to play with my adult human friends, I love toys, chasing tennis balls and spending time cuddling in the warm sun. \n \nMy friends here at PAC say I am a big goofball and I make them smile. I do love making them smile. I love that they are so patient with me and let me choose when I am ready to cuddle up or try new things. If you give me a chance, I would love to cuddle up with you too.  \n \nIf you want to meet me, please complete an adoption profile (located here: https://providenceac.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Adoption-Profile.pdf) and email it to my friend Stevie at srementer@providenceac.org and then we'll be in touch. I can't wait to meet you! XO - Nico\"\n\nP.S. Someone is so excited for me to find my fur-ever home, that they have sponsored my adoption fee! That means I can join your family today for FREE! Woohoo!!\n\n**Some of this pet's photos have been provided by Crissy Everhart Photography (https://www.crissyeverhart.com) & sponsored by Subaru.\n___\n\nProvidence Animal Center relies on adoption fees and donations to save pets!

            "description": "Big and beautiful, Cora is a large mixed breed dog weighing in at 73 pounds. Cora is strong on a leash and needs an adopter that is physically able to handle her. Overall, she appears to be human and dog friendly, but due to her strength and playfulness, we would not recommend a home with toddlers. Cora will need a family to give her daily exercise and work on her obedience and manners. In some instances, Cora can be a bit timid in some circumstances but give her a little patience and gentle positive reinforcement, she does very well.\n\nUPDATE: Cora, although 5 years old, acts like a puppy and I suspect she has never had a lot of guidance or obedience training. She can be quiet \"mouthy\" and will try to jump on you - but she does listen when told \"no\". For these reasons, she is hard to walk on a leash, but once she calms down she will walk well. She does not seem to understand what a ball is or why you are throwing it, but does enjoy playing with ropes and is treat motivated. Cora is also very loving and will lean her whole body into you for a hug. Cora needs an adopter who will be committed to her obedience training.",

We don't have much of a background on his home life before the shelter, but he is a very independent dog who doesn't mind getting some attention, but otherwise is very content to be by himself. If you are sitting in the backyard with him, he likes to come over and sit at your feet and get loves and scratches. Scooter walks well on a leash and loves to go for rides in the car! When outside, Scooter needs supervision as he can easily scale a 6 foot tall fence or will dig underneath of it. Scooter would love to go home with you and lay with you all day! Scooter is Lyme positive and our vet has deemed him nonclinical, which means he has shown no symptoms. Lyme positive dogs can lead happy, healthy lives with no issue. If you had more questions on Lyme, ask your vet for more information if you were interested in adopting a Lyme positive dog!  If you would like more information on Scooter, please give us a call at (540) 778-2101 to ask for an application!",

Honey is a petite little girl, about 43lbs. She's high energy and a snuggler all rolled into one tiny package! She LOVES kids!! But she HATES cats. Honey would do best in either a only dog home or with a dog who matches well with her after the alloted shutdown decompression time. It takes her a minute to warm up to them. She currently lives with a small dog who doesn't care for her and a large Husky - who she gets along great with. Honey will follow your kids around ALL DAY LONG\u00a0 then snuggle up to take a nap. She needs to work on her leash manners though - she gets SUPER excited and can sound intimidating (like a Hyena) When she's not screaming like a Hyena with excitement, she snorts like a little pig when she's playing with the kids. Honey is crate trained, and has zero accidents in the foster home. Due to her still having lots of puppy energy, a home with a fenced yard is best. She can be walked daily as well, but will need an owner who will devote some time to leash training as she was never walked much prior to coming to rescue. If you are looking for a pretty little pitty, Honey is your girl. \n\nTo schedule a home visit and meet and greet, please fill out our adoption application. https://queencitypitties.com/adoption-application/\n\n\nWe cannot accept applications from Canada or far distances from Buffalo.",

            "description": "MEET ROCKY-Little dog, BIG personality! Rocky prefers to be your devoted one and only and is looking for a quiet home without other pets or children in a quiet neighborhood.\n\nRocky is looking for his fairy tale ending. Our story begins with our hero down on his luck, found as a stray, heartworm positive, and desperate for a safe place to lay his head. When all hope seemed lost, animal control swooped in to save him.  Puppy Paws Rescue was contacted, and this is where Rocky\u2019s story turned to one of hope. Nervous, confused, and unable to believe this dream could be his new reality, Rocky slowly learned to trust his foster family. Rocky has been treated for heartworms, neutered, microchipped, house and crate trained. There is only one final step-to find his happily ever after.\n\nRocky is a 3-4 years old, 10 lbs Chihuahua mix. He is spunky has a true ZEST for life! He loves to prance around the neighborhood on his walks and explore all the sights and sounds. Rocky is completely devoted to his people; he is very loving and playful with the children and other family members in his foster home. Due to his size, Rocky will need a home with no children as he can easily get under foot and can be nippy when excited. He can also be growly if he is scared. Rocky loves to be curled up in a lap or snuggled up on the dog bed under his foster mom's desk while she works. For that reason, he is looking for a home where someone is home more often than not. \n\nRocky can be very shy/nervous meeting new people and will need time to warm up in new situations. Any potential adopter will need to understand that the shy/nervous dog they meet initially will transform into one that is happy and playful- once settled-he will be all smiles as he playfully  darts around the house.\n\nOverall, Rocky is fine with the big dogs in his foster home, he loves to play with them and curl up with them. However, just like any typical chihuahua, he is jealous and protective of his person's lap. He will growl and snap if other dogs come to get attention when he is with his person. Rocky's ideal home would be where he has all the love and attention as an only dog. Rocky cannot be in a home with dogs larger than him who may not tolerate his confident attitude as he could be injured. He has not been cat tested.\n\nRocky is an active little guy that will need daily exercise, but he also loves to hang out on the couch. He loves his chew toys and his stuffed animals-and is very good at entertaining himself with those toys. He finds sheer joy in each and every moment. All he wants is your love and attention- in return he will be your absolute best and most loyal friend-always sure to bring a smile to your face with his silly antics and devotion.\n\nRocky has recently finished his crate rest period after being treated for heartworms. After heartworm treatment and crate rest, dogs can be expected to test positive for up to 6 months.\n\nIf interested in adopting please fill out our no obligation online application at www.puppypawsrescue.org\n\nNote: Our rescue requires that all adopter's current and prior animals are up-to-date on vaccinations (DHLPP & Rabies) and preventatives (heartworm and flea and tick), unless there is a medical reason not allowing it. All animals in your household should be spayed or neutered unless medically indicated that they should not be or are currently still too young.\n\n",

Peanut was being starved on a drug property in LA and Felix was found on the highway with a rope around his neck. They were both traumatized when they were first rescued. But then Peanut and Felix met at our rescue and fell in love with each other. They play together all the time and follow each other around. Both are apprehensive with strangers so we are looking to place them into a calm, adult (no children) household with yard access (no apartment or condo situation). They are fine on car rides and have started obedience training. Once comfortable, they are both very affectionate and they will never turn down a yummy treat!\nThank you for your interest in adopting. Please make sure to read the dog's bio carefully.

            "description": "TO CONTACT THE FOSTER HOME, email mrulffes@gmail.com. DO NOT use the Petfinder form. Inquiries don't reach us.\n\nHi!  My name is Pinn (short for Pinnacle as mama says I am destined to rise high to the top).  I am a 38 pound, 9 year old blue girl who is very very shy.  I really don\u2019t like to talk about myself, but mama says you need to know a little bit about me to fall in love with me.  Please don\u2019t ask me to tell you where I came from or all I have been through as it makes my heart hurt and makes mama cry.  Mama says no looking back, we are only looking forward to all the things I am going to accomplish in the rest of my years!!\nAs you can see, I am truly a beautiful girl.  Mama says I have very good manners and am very well behaved.  I walk nicely on a leash, but when out playing in the yard with my friend Abbie, I always come when mama calls me.  I am completely house trained, no accidents for this girl; and I am crate trained.  My favorite thing in the whole world is belly rubs, lots and lots of belly rubs and I know how to use my nose to push your hand and arm to the right spot on my belly.  I am starting to like kisses and occasionally I will give mama a kiss right on her nose.  I like pillows and blankets when I am on the couch and have learned how to arrange them just right so I am comfy.  My foster mom and dad are crazzzzzzzzy and have ten other dogs in the house right now that I do pretty well with.  I have just one I am not particularly fond of, but mama says nobody is particularly fond of her.  But\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.I honestly would prefer to be your one and only as I like a nice calm space and want to make sure you have plenty of time to rub my belly, just my belly!\n\nNow mama says we have to not only share the good, but we also have to share things to work on.  My start in life wasn\u2019t ideal so I need a quiet, calm home that will be very patient and understanding that I need some time to make sure I can trust you.  I trust the ladies much quicker than the guys!  Foster dad has been very patient with me and lets me take the lead in our relationship.  The good news is after several weeks I let foster mom pet me, snuggle me and oh does she ever give the best belly rubs.  Recently I have even let her wrap her arms around me for a real hug.  Small humans make me very nervous so mama says no homes with small ankle biters.  I like nice quiet spaces so mama says city life is not for me and apartment/townhouse living where I might have to meet lots of new people will make me very anxious so a nice country setting would be my happy place.  Oh and I love to go on car rides with mama, and I ride every so nicely.  So if you would like to take a chance on an old lady, foster mama says fill out an application and she will be in touch!!\n \nFoster mom here:  Our Pinn is a very special girl who will need a calm, quiet, patient home, who will be willing to give her several weeks to warm up to any new person.  She does not have one ounce of aggression in her body, she distances herself in the beginning until she is ready for you to come into her comfort zone.  If she is uncomfortable she removes herself from the situation until she is ready to try again.  She is very fearful of new men, tolerates my husband and will occasionally give him a nose bump while he is sitting in his office.  Kids make her very very nervous; she removes herself from the room when they are too close.  She has become my Velcro girl as she follows me everywhere and keeps me in her sight at all time and I am confident she will do the same with her new people.  She loves a good car ride!  \n \nPinn is being fostered in Canton, NY.  If you would like more information about Pinn or have any questions you can email her foster mom at mrulffes@gmail.com  If you would like to submit an application for Pinn, please visit our website at acdra.org.\n\nCOMPLETE AN APPLICATION\nhttp://www.acdra.org/adoption-application\n\n\n\n",

Interested adopters\u00a0should visit his page at www.buddydoghs.org/nacho to view his story, adopter requirements, and more photos and videos!\n\nKey Notes:\n-6 year old neutered male.\n-Chihuahua mix.\n-24 pounds and overweight.\n-Surrendered by extended family to a rescue in Alabama when his elderly owner passed.\n-Experience with reactive or aggressive dogs needed.\n-Adopter must own their home. No apartments, multi-family homes, or cities.\n-Needs an adult-only (18+) home.\n-Should be an only pet, with the exception of his friend, Candy. May be able to eventually live with another dog with training.\n-Territorial of his space; needs little to no visitors and a separate and secure space for when there are visitors.\n-No more than 8 hours alone a day.\n-Low-medium energy; loves walks and the occasional run, but happy to laze around.\n-Ideally just 1-2 adults for him to bond with.\n-Very housebroken and good on leash.\n-Behavioral training recommended.\n-Overweight; needs help losing weight with diet and exercise. He's already successfully lost 12 pounds!\n-Nacho is typically his most well behaved on walks and for treats. These will both help bond with him and help him lose weight.\n\n--THE ADOPTION PROCESS--\nIf you are interested in adopting this animal, please submit an online application. Applications will be reviewed as received. If in our opinion a pet is a good candidate for you, an adoption\u00a0counselor will contact you to schedule a zoom chat. If you do not hear from us it simply means either the animal has been adopted or we have not received the right pet for you. The application process is at no charge to you and only needs to be completed once as all applications will be kept on file.\n\nOnline applications can be found here: www.buddydoghs.com/forms\n\nCheck out our FAQ for answers to most questions here: www.buddydoghs.com/faq\n\nAdopters must be at least 21 years of age and a Massachusetts resident.",

My ID number is 334953.\n\nI am available for adoption; however due to my breed my adoption will have to be facilitated through a rescue organization. Please see the front desk staff or contact the Shelter at (248) 858-1070 for more information.\n\nMeet Wednesday! This sweet girl has been through a lot! When she came to the Shelter, she had been treated for bite wounds..poor thing! Since then, Wednesday has been diagnosed with Heartworm Disease...double poor thing! Despite all this, Wednesday is a lovely girl, who enjoys being with people and her fellow canines! She deserves, very much, to be in a loving, safe and secure home. Wednesday will thrive in a home with adult children, who can be helpful with her ongoing care! Don't miss the chance to meet this incredibly wonderful girl.\n\nThe following descriptions describe behaviors that were observed during testing and/or veterinary examination: Evaluated for temperament with 335035 (male) and 334858 (female). Did well with both. She does vocalize when the other dogs are removed from the room. 10/29/2020\n\nAmerican Pit Bulls are a misunderstood breed; for this reason, we implore adopters to these beautiful dogs to be very vigilant in training and socialization. This breed is very energetic and will need daily exercise. Because of their strength and energy, apartment living may not be the best fit. This breed can be loving, loyal and very smart. \n\nThe above behaviors and personality traits have been observed while at the Shelter. If this animal was relinquished, information is gathered from the owner regarding behavior. Our wonderful volunteers spend time with these animals and give input on behaviors and traits. However, this description may not be all inclusive to how this animal will act in a loving forever home. Introduction to established family pets should be slow and monitored always. The same goes for children and other family members. Adopting a pet is a big decision and should be thoughtful. We suggest researching different breeds to match traits and personalities to your lifestyle. When adopting a pet, please know that this pet will be with you for their lifetime; patience and consistency will make for a successful adoption.\n\nWednesday has heart worm disease, and is currently in treatment. She will be on restricted activity (SHORT LEASH WALKS ONLY, NO FREE RUNNING!) until her treatment is completed. She will require regular visits to a veterinarian, and a monthly heart worm preventative for the rest of her life.\n\n**Age is estimated**\n\n\n\n Primary Color: Brindle Weight: 71lbs Age: 5yrs 3mths 1wks Animal has been Spayed",

She's your girl.  Fixing for a game of catch in the backyard or a nice brisk walk? So is she! Millie is as active (or inactive) as you want her to be, making her an ideal household pet! She loves to have the full attention of her humans, so her best home would be one with no other dogs, and older kids would be best. \nShe adores people and everyone who shows her affection!  \n\nMillie is approximately 8 years old and weighs about 50lbs.  Millie is fully vetted including all vaccines, spayed, microchipped, and has had a dental.  Millie also had surgery to remove polyps from her ears due to years of neglect, but it does not seem to have affected her hearing.\n\nMillie's adoption fee is $275, please consider this sweet senior!\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING, PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n- The first step towards adoption is to complete an adoption application, which can be found online at our website www.roadtriprescues.com, under the \u201cADOPT\u201d tab.\n\n- Do not use the Petfinder links or email to ask us about our adoptable dog listings - we do not always receive these messages and will not respond to them.\n\n- Please do not ask if a dog is still available - we do our best to update their status as quickly as possible.  If a dog is listed for adoption, it means we have not yet approved an adopter and are still accepting applications.\n\n- PLEASE NOTE THAT ONLY APPROVED ADOPTERS WILL BE PERMITTED TO MEET OUR RESCUES - WE ARE A FOSTER BASED RESCUE AND ALL OF OUR DOGS LIVE WITH US AS FAMILY. \n\nThanks for considering a rescue pup!",

I am about 8 years old and discovered 4 months ago that there are so many things I've missed out in life so I'm ready to try out anything you introduce to me. So far, I've discovered belly rubs, nice comfy beds, and a clean bath and I love them all.  I will even let you wash me every other day if you really want to. In fact, my foster mom tried to \"torture\" me by washing me every other day so I just hang out in the bathtub and wait for my next bath! I also absolutely love any treats but prefer big bones to chew on. Cats and small dogs are great friends because we all just mind our own business. Big dogs are great as well but it just takes me about 2 weeks to get used to them. Once I know them well, I prefer to do whatever they do! I am heartworm positive so I prefer short walks throughout the day because I get tired after about 15 minutes of walking on the leash. I haven't been trained until recently so I don't really know any tricks and cannot fetch but I have a great attitude and will smile at you all day if you teach me positively. I've been telling Santa that I've been a good boy and would like to be \u201chired\u201d to love my own humans. Are you ready to hire/adopt me?\n\n\nImportant notes: Sherman needs to be introduced to dogs slowly but should fit in just fine. However, he's great with cats from the start.",

            "description": "Bear is a 1-2 year old Shar-Pei mix. He is soooo darned handsome! He is a bit tentative until he gets to know you. Patience will be key when working with him. A couple of visits may be required until he has warmed up to you. We have a volunteer program at the rescue called our \"best buddy\" program. A volunteer will choose a specific dog to spend time with on a weekly basis. It help the dogs to learn to develop trust, and builds relationships between the dogs and humans. Bears' \"best buddy\" takes him for car rides and ice cream on a regular basis and they truly are the best of friends. His tentative nature is replaced with joy when he sees his best buddy. All it will take is patience and a bit of time and Bear could be a loyal, loving companion. We would suggest no small children. Older kids who understand boundaries would most likely be ok. He did get along with the dogs in his previous home since he was raised with them, but there would be a meet and greet required with any other resident dogs. A physical fence would be required.\n\nAHeinz57 Pet Rescue and Transport is a 501c3 no-kill animal rescue located in De Soto, Iowa. Our pets are located at our facility and in foster homes around Central Iowa. We do adopt to out of town applicants, however we do require new family members be picked up in person. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting one of our adorable adoptables, the first step in our process is to complete an adoption application. To complete an application or read more about our adoption process, please visit our website:\n\nhttps://www.aheinz57.com/adopt-a-pet/adoption-process/\nOur adoption fees are:\n\n$300 - Puppies (up to 6 months)\n\n$195 - Dogs age 6 months - 7 years\n\n$100 - Senior Dogs (age 8 and up)\n\n$200 - Bonded Buddies\n\n$100 - Kittens (up to age 6 months)\n\n$150 - 2 Kittens\n\n$60 - Cats age 6 months and up\n\n$90 - 2 Cats\n\nFor the most up-to-date listing of adoptable animals, please visit our website: https://www.aheinz57.com/adopt-a-pet/\n\nThank you for considering adopting a rescue animal!",

            "description": "This beautiful girl is Taren, a 5-6 year old American Bulldog/Shepherd mix.  She is mostly white with black markings.  Her coat is a little rough and her ears, when straight up, remind us of a shepherd.  Taren is a large dog, weighing 70 pounds and could stand to lose a few pounds (don\u2019t tell her we said that!)  \n\nTaren was pulled from our local animal shelter where she had been picked up as a stray and no one came to claim her.  Taren is very sweet, loving and social.  She is pretty laid back but does like to talk to you if she is not getting attention!  \n\nTaren has nice energy and will require a fenced in backyard to run and play in.  But she is NOT to be an outside dog only cause she loves to be with her pack.  She is too big for an apartment.  \n\nShe seems to get along with other dogs and should be fine with older children, just not young children she might could easily knock over by accident.  We have started on her crate training.  Taren is up to date on her vet care, spayed, heartworm negative and is microchipped.  She is on heartworm and flea/tick preventions.  What a great dog to snuggle up with on a cold night!!\n\nAll HSWA dogs are either at our Dog Adoption Facility or in foster homes. All dogs require an appointment to meet.  Please call us at 205-554-0011 or email humaneswa@yahoo.com to request an appointment to see the dog/puppy and to check availability.\n\nVisit us on Facebook! www.facebook.com/humaneswa\n\nOur adoption fee is $75.  Read more information on our adoption process at www.humanesocietyofwa.org/howtoadopt.html.  Then, if you feel your home might be the right forever home and you would like to adopt a dog, submit an online adoption application. The online applications may not work on mobile devices. If the online application does not work on your device, look to the right side of the forms page for a downloadable .PDF copy of the application.",

She is tolerant of other quiet dogs, but she would likely prefer a quiet home where she can be an only dog, or where the other dog also wants a bit of space.

            "description": "Pixie is small but mighty. Her foster mom says she is a happy girl and her tail never stops wagging. She is very smart and is learning new tricks for treats. In fact, once she figured out there are always treats in her crate, the race is now on to get there. She seems curious about cats but not aggressive, so she may be ok with cats with the proper introduction.\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur Adoption Questionnaire is at http://www.scgsr.org/aq/\n\nAbout Second Chance German Shepherd Rescue\n\nSecond Chance German Shepherd Rescue is a non-profit, volunteer-run, foster-based German Shepherd Dog rescue serving the greater Bay Area and Sacramento/Roseville regions of Northern California. \n\nOur primary focus is rescuing German Shepherd Dogs from life threatening situations in overcrowded shelters where they are in danger of being put to sleep. We adopt our dogs into loving, responsible permanent homes. German Shepherd Dogs in our care are spayed or neutered, and receive basic veterinary care while they await placement in their permanent homes. We work with area shelters and other rescue groups to develop a network of support for German Shepherd Dogs in need.\n\nSCGSR Adoption Process\n\nWe get most of our dogs from the shelters where their previous owners did not provide much training or socialization so they tend to need some training and/or management in order to successfully integrate them into a new household. We have an adoption process to help decide which type of home would be good for the typical dog we get into our rescue. \n\nOur adoption process is:\nFill out and submit an adoption questionnaire. Have a phone interview. Have an in person home visit - this requires you to be located in one of the following areas where our volunteers live so they can do the required in person home visit: East Bay, South Bay, Peninsula, San Francisco and Marin areas, and in and around the Fresno, Sacramento and Roseville areas. We do not adopt outside of our volunteer area for the safety of our dogs as we need to be able to remove them from a home if things are not working out well e.g. with existing pets.\n\nAdopters who already have had an approved home visit have priority to adopt available dogs. Our adoption fees are $350 for dogs under one year, $300 for dogs one year to six years, and $250 for dogs older than six years. If you do not own your own home your landlord must sign our landlord approval form.  Email us at info@scgsr.org to get our landlord approval form.\n\nThank you for considering a rescue German Shepherd Dog.",

She loves snuggles and makes adorable snorting noises when you scratch the right spot.  She will also politely ask for more scratches if she hasn\u2019t had enough.  She plays well with other dogs but wants a home where she can be the only princess.\n\nShe is sponsored by Kennel To Couch, meaning she has prepaid training sessions with SitMeansSit of Baltimore.  Additionally, she has already had a professional training evaluation where she got great reviews!\n\nShe is in the end of treatment for heartworms.  She has received injections and in 4 weeks will officially be considered heartworm free!  We can answer any questions you have about the process and are delighted to support you through it!  All costs are covered by the rescue.\n\nTo apply please visit theherorescue.com/available-for-adoption .  \n\n#beahero #theherorescue #availableforadoption #pibble #pittie",

They were found in the Redland, FL area by good Samaritans that were not able to care for them. As any puppy, they are both full of life, love to run, play outdoors. \n\nSoon they will be having surgery in hopes that they will both get to see the world for the first time and get to have the quality of life and family they deserve.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Elizabeth, or both girls, please visit us online to fill out an adoption application, www.resqmedogmission.org/adoption-application \nYou can feel free to call us for any questions about Elizabeth or Victoria at 305.970.5970.",

Landry has had a rough start to life and was found very underweight and living in a hoarding situation with many other dogs. Due to her past situation and having very little human interaction, Landry is fearful of new people and can be quite skittish. She will need someone who is willing to come meet her several times and spend some time getting to know her before she is comfortable with you and trusts you. Once Landry warms up to you, she's a big lovebug who just wants to follow you around and get lots of belly rubs. Time, patience, and lots of treats will help win this sweet girl over. She currently weighs 51 lbs. She has been dewormed, is UTD on shots. She came to us heartworm positive and received heartworm treatment early January. Our minimum adoption age is 23 and our dog adoption fee is $275. Call us at 843-427-4388 to make an appointment to meet our adoptable dogs!\n\nDog adoption fee is $275 and includes spay/neutering and immunizations required based on age prior to adoption.

I\u2019m a 5-year-old female Boxer and I\u2019m gentle and enjoy being around children of various ages. I also enjoy the companionship of other members of the house. I can use the doggie door and I\u2019m crate trained and ask to go out. I sit when asked and understand the word \u201cno\u201d. I\u2019m leash trained and enjoy going for walks, but I\u2019m not allowed to chase rabbits or javelina. I\u2018m not allowed to chase cats either, so a cat-free environment would be best. I obviously need a secure enclosure that I can\u2019t climb over and if you have this, please call for an appointment to meet. I\u2019m certain you will be happy you did!\nTo view additional animals and find out more about The Animal League of Green Valley, visit our website at www.talgv.org or call (520) 625-3170 between 10 am and 2 pm Monday though Sunday.",

            "description": "My sister, Princess B, and I recently returned to TALGV after we jumped over a 6-foot fence, twice. I\u2019m a 5-year-old male Boxer who\u2019s gentle and tolerant around children of different ages and I love playing with toys. I\u2019m good on a leash but I need a strong handler. I can use a doggie door, I\u2019m crate trained and also ask to go out. I\u2019m a good companion to people with whom I share my life. I sit when requested and if I jump while playing, I respond to \u201cno\u201d. There seems to be one thing that I absolutely won\u2019t tolerate, that is those of the feline persuasion. If you have a secure enclosure that I can\u2019t climb over, please call for an appointment to meet.\n\nTo view additional animals and find out more about The Animal League of Green Valley, visit our website at www.talgv.org or call (520) 625-3170 between 10 am and 2 pm Monday though Sunday.",

Betsy is one of those special dogs that will truly be your best friend and loving companion. She is a 5 year old, 55 lb, Black Mouth Cur/Bullmastiff/Boxer mix. Betsy can be a bit shy when first meeting you but quickly warms up with some gentle pets or a treat. She loves walks and does great on leash. Betsy is playful and loves to run and do zoomies around the backyard. After playtime she will be snuggling up next to you on the sofa. Betsy can be iffy with other dogs so she would prefer to be the only dog in the home. Betsy is a loving dog and a wonderful,  companion but she is definitely a dog that attaches to her person(s)  and can be protective of them. She would do best in an adult only home without alot of visitors coming in and out and one that is able to provide a safe and separate area that she can go to when company does come for a visit.  Betsy is house and crate trained, fully vetted, UTD on all vaccines and preventatives, HW tested, spayed and microchipped.  \nif you are interested in meeting Betsy please email us at huntershoperescue@gmail.com for an application. \n\nQuestions? Please email is\nus at huntershoperescue@gmail.com. \nWe are all volunteers with jobs and families in addition to our rescue dogs. We do our best to respond within 24 hours but please be patient. Applicants under 25 years of age will need to demonstrate an adult lifestyle. If you rent your home we require a letter from the landlord submitted with your application granting permission for a pet.  A fenced yard is preferred.",

I\u2019m a 1.5 \u2013 2 year old Cattle Dog mix boy that weighs 45 \u2013 50 lbs. \n\nI was returned because I wasn\u2019t the right fit for my former family. Fortunately, I landed in a perfect foster home here in New Hampshire and they\u2019re really honing in on my skills! You see, I have a super sniffer! I recently had an evaluation done and the trainer confirmed that I have a \u201cnatural talent\u201d for tracking and scent work! \n\nI am looking for an experienced owner who will put me to work and continue my training with all things scent work! I am an active boy who also enjoys walks, jogging with my foster mom, and hiking! \n\nNo children under 14 and no small animals, including cats. \n\nBreed experience is preferred!\n\nWould you like more information on this adorable pup?

            "description": "Meet Teddy! Teddy arrived here in Mid October and we are still taking the time to get to know him. Teddy is a medium 1-2 year old 40 lb shepherd mix that was previously removed from a hoarding situation. His future home would require a fenced in yard and another dog that would be a suitable playmate/companion for him. Teddy requires a home without children, preferably a home without children that visit often. Teddy is crate trained, dog friendly/social, up to date on vaccines, neutered and microchipped. He has not been cat tested. He will need work on leash manners and basic obedience. Teddy will likely be available for adoption mid November. If you are interested in meeting and potentially adopting Teddy please fill out an application on our website, bighairanimalrescue.com",

Great dogs like me end up in animal shelters every day- I know, it\u2019s so hard to believe but it\u2019s true!\n\nMy name is Bonnie, and I just joined the adoptable doggy crew at Providence Animal Center. I traveled to PA all the way from Georgia after I was brought in as a stray. I'm around 1 year old, about 43 pounds, and I'm all set to move right into your heart & home today - already spayed, microchipped & up to date on vaccinations. \n\nThe staff think my ideal home would be a quiet home without a lot of visitors or dogs. I'm a sweet girl but I get nervous meeting new people. It takes me some time to get comfortable with new people, but once you gain my trust I'm just a wiggly, happy love bug. I will offer lots of hugs and kisses.  I also take treats gently and I already know \"sit\" and \"down\". I have a love for the outdoors -- often  getting super pumped to go on hikes and walks. What can I say, nature soothes my soul. Bonus (not a must) in my forever home would be a fenced yard, as I love running around in free space! \n\nI have responded well to marker/clicker training and if you don't know what that is here's a link to a video explaining what it is: https://youtu.be/_wv1uvvqaSw, Oh, the staff also think I may be able to have a feline roommate with a proper introduction AND if you have children, they think I would do best with children that are 15 years old or older. \n\nSo who's into learning how to clicker train with me? I'm promise I will be worth the time and effort! The staff would love to match you with your new best friend forever - and hopefully that's me! If you are interested in meeting me in person, please email your completed adoption profile (located here: https://providenceac.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Adoption-Profile.pdf) to my pal Stevie at srementer@providenceac.org. My paws are crossed I will see you very soon! \n\nXOXO Bonnie\n\nP.S. Someone is so excited for me to find my fur-ever home, that they have sponsored my adoption fee! That means I can join your family today for FREE! Woohoo!!\"\n\n-------\n\nProvidence Animal Center relies on adoption fees and donations to save pets! Adoption fees vary per pet.

He even slows us down a bit to be really present sometimes! We have a feeling he will listen to you for hours if you want to tell him your life story or your latest woes. He loves treats, especially hot dogs and hamburgers. A true American boy. Buddy is aching for a family of his very own, and he promises to be the bestest buddy youve ever had.

She knows sit, shake and fetch and loves chasing balls and playing tug of war with rope toys. She also loves walks, but these days they don't have to be very long. She gets along great with other dogs and lives in foster with a male dog. She shows promise around children but her foster dad hasn't seen her interact directly yet with small children. She's potty trained and well suited for a single family home environment where she can have the freedom to be vocal from time to time without disturbing apartment neighbors. She does bark some when she is left alone at them home but calms down quickly. Her foster dad says his favorite thing about Sasha is how sweet and smart she is. For more on Sasha, email her foster dad at willdotter@gmail.com",

            "description": "I weigh approximately 48 lbs. Are you ready to get down and boogie? Then we have just the pup for you! It's... wait for it, wait for it... Boogie! His shelter friends have described him as sweet, ridiculous, firecracker, hilarious. So basically, the total package! Boogie loves to meet new people but he can be a bit... um, enthusiastic with his greetings. What we mean is, he may accidentally headbutt you while trying to give you a kiss. Ruh roh! Boogie is working on reigning it in, but it's hard y'all! All that energy and living in a shelter kennel most of the day... it's tough on this young, smart pup. Boogie is also an athletic dude... zoomies, fetching, and toy-tossing are his current top 3 sports. We have no doubt he would excel in agility if given the opportunity! Boogie went on a hike recently and omigosh... all the smells! All the sights! All the everything! He declared it was the Best Day Ever. Boogie got an A on his report card after a recent outing with our trainer. He loved riding in the car... just looking out the window and taking it all in. At the house, he was excited initially and then settled in and entertained himself with various toys. The trainer said Boogie is a super smartpants with plenty of energy and a soft heart. We agree! Boogie would do best with an active adopter who takes him on walks (or runs!) and also works his brain with puzzle toys and focus games. We think he'd do great with teenagers but he's too much doggo for little kids. Boogie may be able to live with another dog in the future but he needs to go to a pet-free home for now. Boogie needs someone willing to give him time to decompress and help him find his groove. Boogie will go home with tons of support from the Orange Dot Crew (a volunteer advocacy group at the shelter), a goody bag of enrichment items, and free training support thanks to Friends of AAC and their Behavior Assistance Program!",

She's a big fan of cuddling on the couch and she will try her hardest to also cuddle with you on the bed too (I let her up every once in a while). She likes being as close to you as possible and will squeeze her way in so that she will basically merge with you. Every time someone opens something up that vaguely resembles the sound of her treats, she'll check it out right away. She knows the commands crate, sit, paw, down, stay, and roll over and I'm sure she will learn more things as long as there are treats. She loves doing zoomies in our backyard especially if her kong is involved, and even more if there's a treat in there! She also enjoys her morning and evening walks and would scrunch up her face in excitement the moment she sees me with her leash and harness. She's been good with not pulling on her leash unless there's a squirrel involved. I weigh approximately 50 lbs. Click here to view my paperwork.",

His current foster reports that this sweet, silly old man likes to go for brisk walks and then nap hard. Having lived a life without comforts prior to arriving at AAC, Rocky is ever so grateful for even the smallest of kind gestures like being given a soft spot to rest. Rocky is good with kids and is looking for his forever home to continue to thrive. Could it be yours? I weigh approximately 55 lbs. Click here to view my paperwork.",

Annie loves being around people and her favorite thing is getting some snuggles and pets. She recently got to go on a hike with some other pups and she had SO much fun sniffin' all the things and meeting all the people! Annie also showed friendly and curious interest in the other pups, so there is potential for her to live with a confident and playful resident dog. Annie loves car rides and is ready to zoom-zoom right into a home! The Orange Dot Crew (a volunteer advocacy group at Austin Animal Center) will be there every step of the way to make sure that Annie is set up for success with her new family.

Penny is affectionate and wants to know what you are doing around the house or yard but she is also fine spending time on her own and can be trusted to stay loose in the house. Penny will enjoy a family who wants a companion at home and to go on occasional short outings. To learn more about Penny contact her foster mom at emily_s@utexas.edu",

While in the home, he behaved well and never once had an accident in the house. He does FANTASTIC on car rides! Dodger does okay with cats as well. He loves to show off the tricks he knows for a tasty snack! Dodger would love to be back in a home soon! He is microchipped, neutered, and up to date on all shots. \nHis estimated date of birth is 3/27/13 and he weighs 79 pounds (he's currently on a diet!)...All pets have lifetime sanctuary at Haven of the Ozarks. If they cannot remain with their adopter, they must be returned to the Haven.\n\nAdoption fees are as follows: \nPuppies under the age of 6 months - $125\nDogs weighing 30 pounds and less - $125 \nDogs ages 6 months to 5 yrs old - $90\nDogs over the age of 5 yrs old - $75.\nCats under the age of 6 months old - $75\nCats over the age of 6 months old - $65",

            "description": "Little Tyson (formerly known as Maloney) found himself at risk of euthanasia at a NYC shelter where he arrived as a stray. Now, Tyson is with a foster family that can no longer keep him due to their own personal/medical issues.\n\nHe is a 4 year old, 40 lb. boxer mix that is a sweet (but stubborn) medium-energy level pup. He does have some health issues and some behavior issues, but nothing major that can\u2019t be overcome as he has so much to offer the right family! \n\nHere\u2019s what Tyson has to say:\n\n\u201cI am a funny little guy - apparently I do things to make my foster moms laugh everyday. I love being near my humans and I will cry if I don\u2019t know where they are because I\u2019m so afraid of being abandoned again. My favorite things to do are curling up and hanging out with you, eating, and sunbathing! \n\nI am not sure what happened to me when I was on the streets of the city, but I must've learned I had to protect myself so sometimes I can be reactive when I\u2019m surprised or scared - especially if you startle me out of a sound sleep, or if you come into a dark room and I can\u2019t see you\u2026.it takes me a minute to realize you aren\u2019t going to hurt me. I\u2019m told I can also be super stubborn at times, but my Kryptonite (my favorite treats that I can't resist) is fresh vegetables, believe it or not - carrots and tomatoes especially! My foster moms have gotten me on a very healthy diet.\n\nI also really love having a fur-sibling to run, play, and wrestle with. My foster moms also think a fur-sibling is important because it helps remind me how well-adjusted dogs behave due to my underdeveloped social skills early on in my life. But - I don\u2019t necessarily love *all* other doggies - I\u2019m selective and will need to decide for myself if we can be bff\u2019s.\n\nI do have a health issue (kidney disease) but that just means special food that the vet orders for me and having the vet check my kidney levels twice a year. I need to drink lots of water, too, and be able to go potty every few hours. This condition probably happened to me when I was on the streets of NYC and did not have a family to care for me. I also have a seasonal skin allergy (seasonal alopecia). It is not a big deal, and I\u2019m told it\u2019s common in Boxers; just a special shampoo and some sunbathing time to keep my skin and fur nice. \n\nI walk really well on my leash, am housebroken, and I know my basic commands. I\u2019m also very intelligent! I\u2019ve even learned that when my fur-brother runs zoomies through the house, instead of chasing him, I\u2019ll just wait for him to come back around to start wrestling again! :-D\n\nI really want a forever home but I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t find one\u2026.do you think you can help me?\u201d\n\nTyson's current foster moms have done a fantastic job with Tyson\u2019s health and diet, his leash skills, and basic training \u2014 now he needs someone to take him to the next level. \u201cUnderneath his challenges, Ty really is a wonderful dog!\u201d say his foster moms. \u201cHe\u2019s such a goof ball (just don\u2019t tell him that!), and his face could melt a thousand hearts. He deserves to be with a family who is ready and able to invest the time and effort into helping him be the best pup he can be. To help keep his moods even, medication might be an option worth exploring.\"\n \n------------------------------\n\nTyson will do best in a home with:\n\n- A fursibling that he can play with! (exuberant/playful medium sized dog/s)\n- An experienced, adult-only home where someone is home all or most of the time\n- Low to moderate-energy activity level home\n- Committed to his special needs (kidney diet dog food, fresh vegetables, seasonal medicated baths)\n\n------------------------------\n\nTyson is neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped. To learn more, please contact AmsterDog at info@amsterdog.org or fill out our application at www.amsterdog.org/application to get the process started.\n\nThank you for caring about a pet in need!\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Faith. I can't sing, but I do have many nicknames, wigglebutt being the number 1. When you see me, you'll know why. I get so excited when people give me attention that I wag my tail so hard, that my whole butt shakes. You can see it in the video attached to my bio. \n\nMy foster parents brag about me all the time. Everyone can see how cute I am and feel how soft I am, but once you get to know me you'll see what a good girl I am. I am just the perfect size for a pet (about 40lbs) All I want is to be loved and snuggled. My foster parents finally figured out that when I say \"\"love\"\" I mean everything that goes with it like boundaries, a routine and a safe environment like my crate at night. I sleep really well in there. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I love to be spoiled, but I am a very smart dog and respond well to structure. I am a little over 2 so I am a pretty good house dog too! I know lots of basic commands, I don't get into anything I shouldn't, I am well potty trained and I don't even beg. I go lay on my dog bed with my sad puppy eyes like a good girl when my humans eat...if they tell me to. I love to play catch outside, play with my Kong and stuffed squeakers. But my favorite thing is to rollover and have you rub my belly. I'm really enjoying my current foster home that has no pets. I have been known to play well with other dogs, but have been having trouble settling in to Minnesota. I think I might need a little time on other pets for now. \n\nOther than that, I really want to make my forever home with you as soon as you see me. I know you want it too. Set up a time to meet me, you won't be disappointed. \n\n\n\nFOSTER TO ADOPT:\nFaith Hill just completed Heartworm treatment and is waiting for a negative test result which can take 2-9 months after treatment. During these months, she will need to make sure her heart rate is not elevated due to high energy play or exercise. Faith Hill is only available through the Foster to Adopt Program at this time. The commitment will be for an adoption but will be fostering until she is cleared with a negative Heartworm test result. All of the medical expenses will be paid for by the rescue while she is in a foster to adopt home. Food, kennel, grooming and other supplies will be provided by the foster in the foster to adopt program. \n\n\nFor a video of Faith please visit: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEpfVJlbopI&feature=youtu.be\n\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nAll our Warrior Dogs will have all age appropriate medical care and vaccines, a microchip, and spay/neuter before adoption unless age is a factor with a puppy younger than 6-12 months at the time of adoption. If that is the case, the spay/neuter will be covered in the adoption fee and the owner will be responsible to have the procedure completed at a Warrior Dog Rescue Veterinarian at the appropriate time.\n\nPlease note that the majority of our dogs in rescue are from shelters where they have been found as strays or abandoned. Their breed description is based on our very best educated guess based on physical characteristics and their dispositions. If they came to our rescue as an owner surrender, the breed description will be listed as provided by the previous owner.\n\nAdoption Fee - $450\n\nTo apply for this pup, please submit an Adoption Application at http://warriordogrescue.com/adopt/adoption-application/",

If you are interested in meeting this pet, please email information about yourself, family, residence and current/prior pet experience. If it is a good fit you will be sent an application. Once that is approved, arrangements will be made for a meeting. Thanks for your understanding!\n\nMeet Casper! Casper was brought to us when his time was up at a Kentucky animal control. Casper was brought in as a stray and never reclaimed after another dog attacked him while he was running the streets. His leg injury was so severe that he needed a leg amputation upon arrival. Casper is a very good boy and very friendly with people.  He seems to do well with most other dogs, but has been stand offish with some. This isn't surprising due to his history of being attacked. We believe he would do well with a vast majority of dogs. We are unsure if Casper is good with cats. Casper's adoption fee is $259, which includes his medical since arriving, neuter, microchip, vaccinations and routine labwork. If interested in adopting, please email us about your household so we can begin the application process. Once approved, we can move forward with scheduling a meet and greet/adoption appointment.\n\n\nEmail inquires can be directed to availablepets@gmail.com.\nAdoption donations for adult dogs range from $59 to $299 and puppies from $159 to $599. This includes: \n-  Spay or neuter surgery\nVaccines current to the date of adoption*: \n  -  Rabies vaccine\n  -  Bordatella vaccine\n  -  Booster for canine Distemper, Adenovirus type 1 & 2, Leptospirosis,\n      Parainfluenza, Parvovirus, and Coronavirus (DHLPPC)\n  - Canine Influenza vaccine\n-  Fecal test\n-  1st worming \n-  Heartworm test (+6 months old) \n-  Capstar flea treatment\n-  Microchip identification implant\n* Boosters required for puppies and kittens (depending on age) POST adoption are the responsibility of the pet owner.\n \nHeartworm prevention must also be purchased at the time of adoption and prices vary depending on the size of the animal being adopted.  Puppies under 6 months old are required to sign up for a puppy obedience class. ($89 deposit required, refundable upon completion)\n\nCome Ready to Adopt: \nIf you rent or live in a condo/townhouse with an association, bring your lease/bylaws indicating pets are allowed and if there are any restrictions.

            "description": "Thank you for considering a homeless/rescue dog, it does not matter where dogs are from what matters is where they will live the rest of their life. \n\nGracie is a precious Plott Hound mix her face is all hound with big floppy ears all sweetness from her head to the tip of her tail.  She is 55 pounds of sweetness, her age is difficult to identify without proper knowledge of ancestry; a guess assessment of breed and age has been made at 2 \u2013 2 \u00bd years old.  \n\nGracie was once a stray undernourished, homeless and neglected looking for her next meal.  She had an unhappy beginning no one to hold her with loving hands, no socialization she deserves a second chance at happiness.  She was extremely shy and timid but much progress has been made Gracie is in foster care in a loving home with a very understanding, patient loving foster mom.   As shown in her video she allows her foster mom to pet her, feed her snacks and she comes to her when called, Gracie has gained her trust which did not happen overnight.   She is also friendly with her feline friends she enjoys playing with them.\n\nWhen Gracie was rescued she was extremely skittish around new people/strangers her foster mom is working diligently showing Gracie that not all people are bad.  Gracie will enjoy a home with a resident pooch to play with and learn confidence from her friend.   \n\nGracie will need a patient family who will allow her to open up on her own time.  Gracie will learn through another dog friend and she would be her happiest with a confident, independent dog in the home learning to mimic the positive behaviors of the confident dogs around her. Time, space, and a confident dog friend and family will be the key to allow Gracie to be her true happy self. It won't happen overnight, but with patience Gracie will definitely come around and look to you for affirmation.\n\nGracie is smart, silly and playful she loves her toys and enjoys running in a secure fenced yard which will be necessary for her to experience freedom in the safety of her own yard. a fenced yard is preferred which will be necessary for her.  Gracie has a sweet and playful personality; she will be a good companion and a friend for life.  She loves the outdoors; smelling all the great outdoors whiffs.  She enjoys her one-on-one time and being scratched and a serious belly rub she will always welcome, last but not least a good tasty treat.  \n\nOn first encounters sudden, fast, jerky movements and loud sounds may intimidate Gracie.  She\u2019s looking for a nice quiet home to hang her leash and call \u201cHome sweet home\u201d.  Please be that special person Gracie needs.   Timid shy stray rescue dogs have not been adequately socialized with people so it can take longer for them to warm up to people with whom they are unfamiliar. It could take several weeks/months before Gracie begins to warm up and open up to you. It maybe difficult for you emotionally because you will not understand why the process is taking so long given all of the love, please be understanding.  \n\nGracie may never be a social butterfly with all people as long as you can accept this, adopting and then watching a shy dog blossom into a loyal and loving pet is a gratifying and rewarding experience.\n\nGracie is up-to-date on her vaccinations and spayed. If you would like additional information and an application; please contact Delia at email address:  rubsch@sbcglobal.net          \n\nOur rescue dogs come in all shapes, colors and sizes they love unconditionally they don\u2019t judge and they\u2019re extremely loving and loyal.  Rescue dogs form a lifelong bond with their families and are forever grateful for their new happy family and life\n",

Adopters must live within 30 miles of King of Prussia, PA. \nCOTTON\nBreed: Cocker spaniel/poodle mix\nGender: Female\nApproximate DOB: 1/1/2015\nSize: Medium\nWeight (Potential):  15 (15)\nColor: White/tan\nHealth: Visually impaired\nShedding: Moderate/Low\nGrooming Needs: High\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\nGood with Dogs: Yes\nGood with Cats: Unknown\nGood with Children: Good with older children\nCost to adopt: $300\n\nA secure, physical fence is required. Adopters must live within 30 miles of King of Prussia, PA.\n\nCotton was born in a Pennsylvania puppy mill and used for breeding from an early age. Despite being a productive breeder, she was passing her genetic eye condition down to her puppies so Finding Shelter volunteers were able to secure her freedom through educating the puppy mill operator. Cotton was filthy, shy, shut down and petrified when she was rescued, but she is becoming comfortable in her foster room and learning to enjoy the simple things in life, including toys. Once she learned that she could roam on the grass in the fenced yard and would be treated with love and kindness, she responded with joy and every day trusts her humans more every day. Cotton has cataracts and is taking daily drops from high eye pressure. She is expected to lose her vision completely at some point and could potentially lose her eyes if she develops severe glaucoma. But Cotton adjusts even though she bumps into things sometimes. She loves to play with other dogs and needs a resident dog companion. She is becoming a happy girl and can\u2019t wait to find a loving and patient home where she can continue to flourish.\n\nThe first step is to submit an application at https://www.findingshelter.org/portfolio-items/cotton/",

He is currently being boarded and he's very stressed.\nFelix is about 3.5 years old and a very sensitive guy. He's apprehensive with strangers but super affectionate and silly once comfortable. Felix also has a girlfriend named Peanut (in one of the pictures) but he would be ok going to a home alone as well.\nFelix needs: an adult household (max 2 people), no children, with yard (no apartment/condo situation), not cats or tiny dogs. It would be great if his new foster/home has had experience with Border Collies and/or dogs with behavioural issues. Felix has received some obedience training and is also crate trained. Felix has a happy personality and makes a great companion. He is not an off-leash candidate and rides well in the car. Felix just needs someone with common sense who will give him a chance.  A foster must not have time restrictions.\nPlease contact us about Felix.\nThank you for your interest in adopting. Please make sure to read the dog's bio carefully. We get to know the dogs very well to make sure, they find the right match for their forever home. Due to limited staff during this crisis, please only contact us, if you meet the basic criteria listed in the dog's bio.\nIngrid\n(310) 480 6030\npcdrapps@yahoo.com\nIf you'd like to meet this cutie, please fill out our adoption application: http://www.pcdogrescue.org/online_application.html",

            "description": "Stan is just an adorable 12 pound puff of personality. Stan and his brother Scooter were taken with many other dogs from a hoarding/abuse case in Texas. Their life was one of cranking out puppies, living in outside huts made of broken pallets and rusty wire. They were nearly feral. Stan arrived about a month ago and was extremely traumatized by the trip and being separated from his brother. His brother tested positive for heartworms and had to stay behind for treatment. Our team has worked long and hard with Stan, to win his trust, get him in great physical condition and begin leash training. He has made huge strides.  He is simply a shy boy who experienced too much abuse and neglect. Stan will need a loving and patient adopter who allows him to unfold at his own pace.  If you are that person please fill out a non Bulldog application on our website; www.vermontenglishbulldogrescue.com",

He's apprehensive with strangers but super affectionate and silly once comfortable. Felix also has a girlfriend named Peanut (in one of the pictures) but he would be ok going to a home alone as well.\nFelix needs: an adult household (max 2 people), no children, with yard (no apartment/condo situation), not cats or tiny dogs. It would be great if his new foster/home has had experience with Border Collies and/or dogs with behavioural issues. Felix has received some obedience training and is also crate trained. Felix has a happy personality and makes a great companion. He is not an off-leash candidate and rides well in the car. Felix just needs someone with common sense who will give him a chance.  A foster must not have time restrictions.\nPlease contact us about Felix.\nThank you for your interest in adopting. Please make sure to read the dog's bio carefully. We get to know the dogs very well to make sure, they find the right match for their forever home. Due to limited staff during this crisis, please only contact us, if you meet the basic criteria listed in the dog's bio.\nIngrid\n(310) 480 6030\npcdrapps@yahoo.com\nIf you'd like to meet this cutie, please fill out our adoption application: http://www.pcdogrescue.org/online_application.html",

Age and weight\nHunter is 10 Years old and 6 months\n2. Spayed/Neutered or not\nNeutered\n3. Vaccination status (rabies, DHLPP etc)\nUp to date\n4. Being wormed/flea/tick treated monthly?\nCurrently on Trifexis, monthly\n5. Any medical issues (when did he/she last have a vet check up?)\nLast vet check-up a month ago. Occasionally gets ear infections after baths (water got in his ear). We usually get prescribed ear drops and administer for a short period of time. Other than that healthy dog.\n6. How does he/she behave around men/women/children/strangers/people on the street/other animals\nWhen he is not familiar with the person he is very shy and reserved. There needs to be some kind of warming up period with a person that will allow him to get accustomed and use to the person. Generally he does better with new women than men, but he still needs a slow introduction to the new person. I\u2019m not sure how he does with children, because we\u2019ve never put him in an environment with kids. On the street, people cannot randomly pet him, because when he is unaware of a person around him, especially if it's a stranger, he can become startled, and possibly bite the person. He does pretty well with other dogs when slowly introduced in a controlled environment, but when startled he may bite.\n7. Normal daily routine (food/exercise)\nFood twice a day morning and night Daily walk 20-30 minutes.\n8. Indoor or outdoor dog? (or both)\nBoth\n9. Level of training (what commands does he/she know/how does he/she walk on leash/reaction to seeing other dogs when on leash)\nCommands: Sit, paw, out, no, off.\n Usually towards the beginning of the walk he tugs and pulls on the leash a lot because he likes to smell everything around him. Afterwards he tends to relax, it also gets easier if using a dog non-invasive collar that tightens a little when he pulls. Sometimes he gets riled up and excited when he sees a dog and pulls (usually when another dog barks and starts acting sporadically) other than that he does pretty well just starts marking trees more often for a few seconds.\n10. Any particular likes/dislikes (how is he/she about being handled/petted \u2013 any sensitive areas, like ears, feet etc.)\nWhen pet he is sensitive on legs (especially both back legs), paws, and tail.\n11. How does he/she react to riding in the car/going to the vet/can he/she be lifted\nHe does pretty well in the car. At the vet, however, he can get aggressive and so we give him sedatives a couple hours beforehand. At the vet they use a muzzle and everything usually goes well. He does not like to be lifted and could cause him to bite, unless he is sedated.\n12. Has he/she ever bitten any other animals/people? If so, what was the severity and was medical action needed?\nHe has bitten one dog before, it was not severe, and there was little to no bleeding on the smaller dog. He has bitten people a few times before, the severity has varied. Sometimes his bites do not puncture the skin. The worst bite mark was when a construction worker got close to him while he was on a leash tied up to a rail, and he lashed out and bit the worker's leg. The bite mark broke the skin, and there was bleeding, the worker needed some stitches.\n13. Any separation anxiety issues or other behavioural issues?\nHe has some kind of separation anxiety. When left out for too long he gets anxious. Behavior issues would include not reacting well to strangers, and not being socialized as well.\n14. Where did you obtain the dog from and why are you attempting to rehome the dog now? How long have you owned the dog?\nObtained dog from a jindo breeder in Texas. We are rehoming because I primarily took care of him, but since I am moving out and he recently bit someone, my parents would no longer like to take care of him.\n15. Have you contacted any other rescues for assistance?\nNo\n16. What are the best methods of contact for people interested in either fostering or adopting your dog?\nEmail: brandong512@gmail.com\n\n(Located in Los Angeles, CA 90024)",

He listens pretty well, knows basic commnds, and is not destructive, unless you leave pieces of paper or cardboard around. He has been know on occasion to shred those things, but hey maybe he can help out and you can retire your paper shredder for good. He does that good of a job! He is potty trained and crate trained. Never marks in the house. Likes most other dogs. He doesn't like his toes or feet touched but to make up for it, he will let you rub and scratch his butt all day long . He is good letting me touch, rub and even put my fingers in his ears, but i highly suggest that you don't try to put a cotton swab or cotton ball on his ear! He is very cuddly. Loves to plop his big head in your lap any chance he can. We do not recommend him with children. He can be around children on occasion but not suggested he live with them.

He was returned fairly quickly because he is vocal when he plays, which can be misinterpreted as being growly. George is very active, likes to jump, and is so talkative that it surprises people, and can be misread as growling when he's excited. Because of his energetic behavior and being vocal, he needs an active home with a yard. No apartments, and no children. He likes most other dogs, and will play with them, as well as you. If you'd like to meet George go to adoptocpets.org/adopt to download an adoption application.",

Lulu settled well into her foster home, but looks forward to a forever family with whom she can cuddle this winter!\n\nLulu is a young 12 years old and weighs 8 lbs.\n\nLulu is easy going and will enjoy joining you on walks. She can be shy meeting new people and dogs, but eventually warms up. She will alert bark to unknown noises outside her yard, but is not yappy otherwise.\n\nShe gets along well with the other dogs in her foster home. It\u2019s unknown how she will react to cats, but given her friendliness, will probably do fine with a cat used to dogs.\n\nLulu enjoys lying on a bed where she can watch her family during the day and is happy to sleep quietly in a dog bed at night.\n\nLulu is located in San Francisco.\n\nIf you are interested in Lulu, please fill out an adoption application at:\n\nwww.casadeloveanimalrescue.org",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Gracie Bess is an absolutely gorgeous girl! But of course we don't have to tell you that -- you can see for yourself in her photos. Gracie is a lively young girl who is safe with chickens and other livestock BUT she is not cut out for life in the pasture. She enjoys time outside, and that girl can find a mud puddle quicker than any other dog we have! But she prefers living close to her people instead of staying in the pasture with livestock.\n\nGracie is house/potty-trained and crate-trained. Her only bad habit in the house is that she's a stealthy counter-surfer, and since she's a tall girl, she has no trouble getting whatever she wants off the kitchen counter.\n\nGracie is quite the athlete and has no trouble clearing a 5' tall fence, so 6' tall fencing is a must for this pretty girl.\n\nShe gets along with other dogs (as you can see in some of her photos), but she plays rough. Some dogs don't like that, and will react negatively, which can lead to a fight. This has happened twice in her time with us. One female dog interpreted Gracie's play as an attack, and it turned into a fight that resulted in the other dog needing a trip to the vet to have several puncture wounds treated. When Gracie played too rough with another dog, he yelped and ran away, so that was the end of it. Gracie has ignored the small dogs in our home, so we're confident that she's not really a mean girl -- she just doesn't realize that her style of play is too rough for some dogs. A meet & greet will be really important if you have other dogs.\n\nIf Gracie sounds like the perfect match for your family, please visit our website to read about our adoption process and submit your application.",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Colby!  I am an older boy, approximately 11 years old.  I came to HSJC from another shelter where I'd been surrendered by my people who could no longer care for me.\n\nI'm a very sweet boy who has been getting some well-deserved TLC in foster care.  I adore my leash walks with my foster mom - I like to sniff everything!  I like to nap in a warm lap, and I like to lay in the sun.  My foster mom says I run around excitedly at mealtime, and I always remind her when it's dinner time (sometimes far before dinnertime).  In my previous home I did not appreciate small children, so I'm seeking a home with no kids under 10.  I do not like other doggies, and am looking to be the only dog in my new home (I DO NOT want to visit dog parks either)!\n\nWhen I arrived, my teeth were all bad.  I only wanted to eat kibble at first (likely what I was used to), and my teeth actually moved as I ate.  :( My mouth was very painful and I just didn't feel very good.  I had all my bad teeth removed and am now on a diet of canned food (though I could eat kibble, but I can't chew it).  I also got neutered, micro-chipped, and caught up on my rabies and DAPP vaccines.  I have a grade 2-3 heart murmur.  This means anesthesia is riskier for me and exercise should be somewhat limited.  \n\nMedical care for seniors like me - particularly dental procedures - are very costly.  If you're looking at me and you appreciate the care and attention I've gotten here at HSJC, please consider sponsoring me with a donation!\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 (+ $20 county dog license, if residing within Jefferson County).  IF YOU ARE SEEING MY BIO, I AM STILL UP FOR ADOPTION - PLEASE FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS BELOW.\n\nADOPTION PROCEDURE: HSJC is currently CLOSED to the public due to the pandemic. We are accepting applications for Colby, and you can submit one via our website here: https://hsjcwa.org/adopt-a-dog\nWe do not ship animals, and due to COVID and border issues cannot adopt to Canada at this time.\n\nIf we find an applicant who seems to match Colby well, we will contact you to schedule a time for you to meet him at our facility. If you have trouble submitting your application, please send an inquiry and we can email you one!",

She is healthy as validated from a recent blood test and x-rays and her teeth were recently cleaned while spayed. She has a microchip as well. READ,READ, READ, please ----- Sophie can walk, more like a hobble, her rear legs do not bend so Sophie\u2019s must be picked up to get up a small step. She loves lying on the sofa next to you when you are watching television, but you must pick her up and take her back down off the sofa. Sophie is not a dog that enjoys walks because she tires easily due to her back legs, however she would love being walked in a stroller and maybe walking a few feet for some exercise. She is an inside dog 100% of the time and is only taken out to go potty and you must wait for her to go she cannot be left outside. She is still learning to go potty but as long as you carry her outside on a regular basis, she does not potty in the house. She sleeps on the bed and can hold her potty all night. Sophie is a wonderful, sweet girl. She loves sleeping in the bed and lying on the couch watching TV.\nSophie was found on the side of the road by a Poochmatch volunteer. She is a senior dog. Her rear spine is fused together, probably from an accident and someone never sought veterinary care for her. Her injuries were left to heal on their own. Poor Sophie but let me tell you she is a sweetheart and has a wonderful temperament. Sophie is a special girl with special needs, she deserves to be spoiled, loved and cared for. Her adoption fee is $495 which covers the cost of her x-ray, spay, all core vaccines (Rabies and Distemper/Parvo), professional grooming, microchip and microchip registration. If you are interested in adopting, please complete an application, available on our website, poochmatch.com, under the adoption tab and please read the paragraphs below for more details on our process.\n\nIf this listing is still posted, we are still accepting applications for him/her. We do not do out-of-state adoptions on highly adoptable dogs; we would only consider out-of-state adoptions for dogs that prove hard-to-place locally. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nUPDATE: ADOPTION EVENTS CANCELLED DUE TO PANDEMIC AND SOCIAL DISTANCING. If you are interested in meeting any Poochmatch dog at our weekly adoption event on Saturdays at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda, CA (5521 Mirage St.) between 1-5 PM, please fill out an application from our website, poochmatch.com, and submit it no later than 11 AM on Fridays. Upon receipt AND approval, the dog you are interested in meeting will be made available to meet on a Saturday. Due to the high volume of dogs and puppies in our foster homes, it is impossible to bring them all every Saturday. The only way to ensure that the dog that you are interested in will be at the adoption event is to FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AND BE APPROVED. Otherwise, we cannot guarantee that the dog you are interested in will be at our adoption event. If you cannot make the time frame of our events, appointments can be made at another time and location solely at the discretion of the foster parent. Please understand that private appointments will be coordinated to meet the convenience of the foster parent/transporter. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nAll adoption fees cover the mandatory and non-negotiable spay/neuter, rabies, microchip, microchip registration, full sets of core vaccinations (rabies and 1 set of distemper/parvo for adults, 4 for puppies) and deworming. Adoption fees vary based on age, breed, size and the costs incurred on the dog's behalf by us i.e. medical, behavioral training, etc. and they range from $225-$495.\n\n\nCOVID-19 PROCEDURE:\nIn an effort to create a safe environment for our potential adopters and our staff, we have changed our protocols and procedures during these difficult times. Starting immediately, our procedures will change from what\u2019s written on our website and other social media platforms. Our weekly adoption event at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda is temporarily cancelled due to COVID-19 and social distancing. The only way to meet one of the dogs/puppies we have available for adoption is through completion of our adoption application through our website, poochmatch.com, before 11 AM on Fridays. On Fridays when we review the applications, we will pick the best fit for each dog or puppy applied for and coordinate mutually agreeable appointment times for the applicants who are approved that week. Private appointments are currently only scheduled on Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday of each week. Masks or bandanas are mandatory; faces must be properly covered.\n\nWith the overwhelming desire of the public to adopt at this time, we have received as many as 30 applications for one dog in just one week. Working with a staff of volunteers, we are only able to reach out on Fridays to the people we have approved to adopt. If you have not heard from us by Friday, we have selected a different applicant. If you have multiple dogs/puppies that you are interested in, please indicate each dog/puppy of interest on the application at that time so we don\u2019t rule you out for another dog/puppy available for adoption.\n\nPlease understand, we have an influx of texts, phone calls and emails that makes it impossible to get to each and every one of you. Not just for adoption interest, but also from veterinarians, people who must relinquish dogs, people who have found a stray dog in need of pick up, etc. We are currently not in need of fosters. Due to the fact that there is such a high demand, we are sticking with strict protocol to not adopt out of Southern California. We apologize for this inconvenience and difficulty to be able to get in touch with us while there is an overwhelming desire and demand to adopt at this time. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we navigate through these difficult times with every intention to keep the public and our staff safe.",

            "description": "Kenzy Kensington was saved from a family in Kensington. This lovely family first saw Kenzie running down the street when she was almost struck by a car. They stopped and Caught her and other passerby\u2019s told them she lived right up the street and was loose often. They let Kenzie lead the way up to a home. Wanting to make sure she got in safe and sound they knocked on the door. Then gently told the man at the door, we just wanted to make sure she made it home - she almost got hit up the street. Then to their absolute surprise and shock the man who was once Kenzie\u2019s father said that ain\u2019t my problem we sent her out we got other dogs and we don\u2019t need her keep her if you want to! Well this couple was horrified but said are you sure- well take her right now! And he said that\u2019s great good luck goodnight and shut the door! WTF this nice couple was in no position to keep her permanently but they certainly weren\u2019t gonna leave her out on the street, so take her home they did. They soon after reached out for help and we were happy to be able to step up! So our sweet girl has gotten the full veterinary package and is now getting doted on with her new foster brother. She is house trained, overall polite in the house, a very rough player. Not ready to share bones yet but low level toys don\u2019t cause an issue. She is crate trained and loves it and will choose to take naps on the fluffy comforter inside. She\u2019s friendly and approachable, Very strong on leash but seems like she\u2019ll be easy to teach.

He has allergies which cause him to hack and sneeze and sometimes has snotty nose stringers.\n\nHe gets along with chickens, cats, and children. Does not like babies that can walk. He likes camping and is very obedient.\n\nIke gets a little yelpy when hugged suddenly from behind. I suspect that is due to failing hearing. He can hear, but I don\u2019t think his hearing is what it once was. \n\nIke is good at communicating his need to go outside and barks only twice when he\u2019s ready to come back in.\n\nHe is very good on the leash so that there really isn\u2019t a need for one. He\u2019s very patient and affectionate. Also very gentle and sweet.\n\nYou can apply to meet/adopt Ike at www.muttmisfits.com/adoption-application. \n",

            "description": "Meet Little Lily Pad!\nThis little short & round sweetie is full of personality. \nShe is sooo people friendly & yearns for a human of her own:)  \nLooking at the scars all over her tiny body, its possible that she was used as a bait dog so she has NO desire to be around other dogs and who could blame her.  \n\nShe is learning to walk on a leash without pulling and doing well. She responds to affection and treats... she cannot get enough. The shelter environment is a little stressful on her so she will calm down and show her personality/cuddliness when she is on walks...away from the other barking dogs.\n\nLily, along with Horn Lake Animal Shelter, is looking for someone who can make Lily  feel safe and loved with lots of hugs & treats, probably for the first time in her life. \nPlease help us to show Lily what its like to have a family.\n\nApproximate Age: 1 yr\nHeartworm Status: Unknown\nVaccinations: None / Unknown",

ADOPT HER!! \nJersey's adoption fee is $100 and includes her spay, vaccines, deworming and microchip.  Apply on our website if interested: shelterfriends.org \n\n**NOTE** We do not have a facility, all of our dogs live in foster homes.  Thanks!",

            "description": "Boo is a very sweet senior boy! He is 11 years old and weighs 15 lbs. He has great potty manners and loves to walk on his leash. Boo is good with children, and happy to be an only dog, although he is content around other dogs. Boo has low thyroid and needs eye drops, and will for the rest of his days.  Due to his limited vision, he cannot manage stairs on his own, a single story home would be best. He wants to find his forever home, complete with hugs and snuggles.\n\nPlease apply at tzuzoorescue.com if you are interested in adopting from Tzu Zoo Rescue.  More information available by contacting tzradopt@gmail.com.\n\n[NOTE: We are a rescue NOT a shelter, meaning WE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY THAT OPENS TO THE PUBLIC. Typically, an application and home visit (both of which are required for adoption) MUST be completed, BEFORE a potential adopter will be introduced to one of our pets, in order to first determine that our basic adoption requirements are met, prior to introductions being made. We also utilize personal reference and vet checks (to ensure that any pets already in the potential adoptive home are current on vaccines, heart worm prevention and sterilized) in our adoption process, all of which is intended to ensure that the best match, between pet and people, is made. The adoption fee is based on on the dog's age.",

These little boys are 10 and 8 years young, they are sweet, loving, still very playful, plus they are fully vetted and even had a dental! The boys are bonded and need a home together forever.  We will not consider separating them.  Brooks seems to have some motion issues with his rear legs, but the vet wasn't too concerned and neither is Brooks, look at him go!   Dunn, the taller but younger brother loves to sit on your lap and get some pats and rubs, he also likes to sit on soft furniture.  Brooks is also very cute and loving and even though he likes your lap, what he really loves are belly rubs.  The boys require a loving and responsible family who has a history of caring and providing for dogs in the past. The boys also require a home with a secure fenced yard, this is mostly for their protection from larger dogs while enjoying the outdoors.  Adoption fee for both dogs is $200.00.  Please apply online at hartshelter.org or give us a call for more information 217.283.0779.",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Taya! I was rescued, along with my 7 puppies from an animal shelter in Alabama before arriving at Big Dog Ranch & Rescue. I am a super sweet girl who loves everyone I meet but I may need a little bit of training in order to learn how to control my excitement. I love to play with other dogs, big or small. I have. a lot of energy and can be a jumper so I would probably do best in a home with children over the age of 12. I also have a strong prey drive and wouldn't like to cohabitate with cats or other small animals. I would be the best fit for an experienced dog owner who might know how to correct my excitable behavior and keep me focused. I am definitely a dog who needs to have a big yard to run around in and my energetic spirit would lend itself best to a busy home. I would like to learn how to behave in public so that I can go with my new family on lots of adventures. Some further training would absolutely be helpful in helping me to be the best dog that I can be for your family. I am already potty-trained and I love to go on leashed walks....maybe a little bit too much! I will never tire of playing fetch with you, enjoying my toys, or cuddling on the couch with my new favorite people.",

Attached to the exterior gate was a hastily scrawled note that read, 'My name is Bobo, I need a home.'\n\nDespite having been let down so cruelly and coldly by her previous humans, our little Lady is a loving and gentle soul. Though it, of course, took her a few days to feel comfortable, safe and begin to trust again, Marmalade has bounced back in a huge way!\n\nMarmalade loves to cuddle with her humans, first and foremost. She enjoys the company of other dogs, and is beginning to play with her foster siblings. She doesn't seem to know what toys or chews are, but she sure does love her breakfast and dinner! Marmalade likes her crate, and finds comfort and security there when she's uncertain. She's also house trained in her foster home, and has been an absolute angel inside the home.\n\nA note from foster mom: She will use both her paws at the same time to pull my hand far enough off my lap so she can rub against it to get me to pet her. She does not understand the concept of a leash or walk (yet!). Spinning in a circle is her go to happy dance!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete an adoption application. Because we expect a large number of applications, and are still understaffed due to COVID19, we will only be able to email those applicants that are approved to schedule a meet and greet. Thank you in advance for your understanding if you don't hear back from us regarding your application.",

She recently lost her foster home due to no fault of her own and is in immediate need of a foster or adopter so that we can keep her out of boarding. Chardonnay has had professional training and is a loving, affectionate, intelligent girl who enjoys being with her people. She has low-med energy and would do great in a home with a fenced yard and a male, submissive dog. Her ideal person/family will be committed to continuing her training and offering her the leadership she needs to live her best life. She is housebroken, crate trained, spayed, fully vaccinated & microchipped. \n\nFor more information about Chardonnay, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org.

I love other dogs but I am a bit of a rough and rowdy player so I'll need someone who can handle me. My favorite thing ever is squeaky toys!

PLEASE LEAVE US A VOICEMAIL IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO REACH US. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING.- CCDP STAFF**\n\nHi there. My name is King. I'm about 3 years old and I weigh about 45 lbs. \nI was left here in a kennel at the pound overnight one night. My owner left me here with a note that said \"His name is King\". Nothing more. When I first arrived, I had horrible entropion which made my very sore. The pound had the surgery on my eyes and I am feeling so much better and I'm much happier. I do still have a little cloudiness in my left eye from ulceration and scarring from my entropion, but it is healed and no longer painful. \nI can be a little timid and unsure of new people at first, but once I get to know you, I am very sweet and loving. I listen pretty well and I love to cuddle. \nI do okay with some other dogs, but I definitely need to meet any other dog(s) that I would potentially live with, prior to being adopted, to make sure I like them.\nIf you're looking for a nice dog to add to your family, please consider adopting me.\n\nOur adoption fee is $150.00. The pound DOES NOT accept checks for adoption fees. We're able to accept cash for adoption OR Visa/ Mastercard/ Discover Card. A convenience fee of 2.39% will be applied to all credit/ debit card adoptions. If you intend to do a foster-to-adopt, the fee must be cash. ALL dogs/puppies adopted from our shelter will receive their parvo distemper vaccine, bordetella vaccine, rabies vaccine (if aged at 12 weeks or older), be dewormed with a 3 day course of panacur dewormer, be microchipped, receive their current Ohio dog license and will be spayed or neutered. ALL DOGS/PUPPIES WILL BE SPAYED OR NEUTERED unless a health issue prohibits the surgery from being performed. Not all dogs posted for adoption are spayed/ neutered yet. If you're driving a long distance to adopt, please verify that the vetting process has been completed and dog you're interested in adopting is still available for adoption. The above mentioned vetting is all included in your adoption fee. The adoption fee and what is included in the adoption fee is NON-NEGOTIABLE.\n\nAdoptions MUST be done at the pound and in person as there is paperwork to fill out and an adoption contract that must be signed by the adopter. This means you must be willing to travel to our shelter to adopt.\n\nIF the dog you're interested in adopting has medical conditions or injuries which require medical treatment, we ask that you help with the medical bills so we can continue to help the dogs coming in who need additional vet care.\nWe are a county run shelter, therefore we cannot control our intake or the health or behavior of the dogs that come in to our shelter.\n\nAlthough we try our hardest to place all of our adoptable dogs, there are certain circumstances in which any dog in our care could be euthanized at any time and without further notice (IE: sudden untreatable medical condition or injury, temperament or behavioral problems which may not be apparent when the dog first arrives, lack or space, etc.), therefore all dogs at our shelter should be considered urgent. The adoption of a more highly adoptable dog will mean more time for the less adoptable dog in the kennel next to him!\n\nShelter hours are: Monday-Friday: 8 am- 4 pm\nSaturday: 8 am - 11 am.\nSunday: 8 am - 11 am.\nAdoptions are always welcome during hours of operation. We will make special arrangements for adoptions in advance.\nThere is nobody in the office on Saturday and Sunday, so therefore we are unable to answer or return phone calls over the weekend.\n\nCan't adopt a dog? We would love to have more volunteers who are able to spend time with our dogs! The dogs LOVE going for walks and the socialization and exercise helps make the dogs more adoptable.\n\nContact information:\n8455 County Home Road\nLisbon, OH 44432\n(330)424-6663\nEmail: hpecorelli@ccclerk.org",

Bowie definitely needs someone who can continue to work with him on his basic commands, manners, and potty training.\n\nHe is crate trained and voluntarily goes into the crate. He needs a husky experienced home with a 6ft fence, and he needs a home who can provide structure. Bowie is great with all people, and thanks to training he is now very dog friendly.  Bowie loves to be around other big dogs and he loves to play. \n\nBowie went through two weeks of obedience training to work on his socialization and to build up his confidence on the leash. Bowie used to be very scared of cars and other distractions while he is on walks. With training, he has made great progress but he is still going to need a home who can continue to work on his socialization as well as building up his confidence on the leash. Bowie also needs a home with no small children.  He needs a strong owner who can help him grow. \n",

            "description": "**** SPECIAL NEEDS ********\n\nAll Hail King Louie! A regal and majestic addition to the Boston Buddies Royal Family. Louie was banished from his original kingdom when his family felt they were no longer able to provide Louie the life style & care he requires. Louie came to Boston Buddies with severely inflamed skin, infected ears, hair loss, hind end weakness & urinary incontinence. To figure out what the heck was going on, Louie was whisked off to the Veterinary Specialty Hospital for an evaluation. First he met with the Neurologist and underwent a MRI. The MRI identified 3 disk herniations. The doctor confirmed that too much time has passed since his initial injury so sadly Louie is a not a good candidate for surgery. Louie will not regain full control of his bladder or bowels so he will need to be expressed, wear a belly band or diaper and have easy access to a yard. Physical Therapy and acupuncture were recommended to help him build and maintain strength in his back legs. Our handsome dignitary went to see the Dermatologist for assistance with his skin issues. He eats a Royal Canin prescription diet and gets weekly medicated baths. His majesty's skin is looking much better and you can tell he feels much better too. This 8 year old, 25 pounds French Aristocrat loves stuffed toys, other dogs (except the ones on TV), people and meal time. A little hind end weakness doesn't stop this dignified dog from visiting his royal subjects. He struts around with is head held high. Sometimes he travels on foot, sometimes he travels in his prestigious mobile device (doggie wheelchair) or in his royal carriage (doggie stroller). Louie came into rescue without the family jewels (meaning he was already neutered), he is up to date on vaccines and microchipped. If you are looking to upgrade your social status and want welcome a very special pooch into your castle, report to our website @ https://www.bostonbuddies.org/adoption-application/ and complete an adoption application.\n\nView more pictures on our facebook page - facebook.com/BostonBuddiesInc\n\nAdoption Donation is $200.00\n1/18/21 4:58 PM",

            "description": "I AM ON HOLD PENDING AN ADOPTION APPOINTMENT. Meet Yo-You! He is a handsome pooch who currently weighs about 68 pounds. He came to the shelter because his owner could no longer care for them and he is now ready for a new family. He is about 5 years old which is a good age to cuddle on a couch together. An ideal day for Yo-You would include a lovely long walk with his favorite person and lots of treats! Here at the shelter he has been quite energetic and sweet. As always, if you have another dog at home you're more than welcome to bring them in for a Meet n' Greet. Yo-You's adoption fee is $130. He has been neutered, microchipped, has age appropriate vaccinations! Come in and meet him today. We're excited to announce that our training classes have become virtual and are facilitated through Zoom meetings. See https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/group-training-classes/ for more information about schedules and registration for online training classes. We are also offering support for recent adopters through our Trainer Talks also through Zoom meetings, prior registration is required. For schedule and registration please see https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/special-seminars-and-workshops/. To see more of Yo-You click on the video!",

            "description": "Lola is 1.5 years old and 52 lbs. Good with dogs and kids over 12. Must have other dog in the home of similar size and secure fenced yard.\n\nMeet Lola! This wonderful girl was part of a litter of puppies born on a rural property. The pups were not socialized or handled by humans when they were little. As a result, Lola is shy with humans but now is much more comfortable. Her temperament is just wonderful. She is kind and funny and just a goofy puppy. She loves affection and lives for belly rubs. She is eager to learn and eager to please.\n\nLola is more confident every day and is a lovely pup that will continue to blossom if you are willing to work with her to gain confidence. She is nearly there! She is learning to walk on a leash and is getting the hang of it - the world is a bit scary to her still. She is starting to really enjoy her time sniffing around on walks.\n\nLola does not have a mean bone in her body, but living with young kids is probably a bit stressful for her. She cannot live with cats. Lola is quite bonded to her sister, Louise, who is also with us, so in order to thrive in a new home, she will need another dog pal to live with her. Alternatively she and Louise can be adopted together. They do love each other.\n\nWe would like to see her in a more residential neighborhood rather than a busy part of town.\n\nShe is now updated on all shots, spayed, and chipped.\n\nHer adoption fee is $495 and you can submit an application via savinggreatanimals.org\n\nWe cover the medical to prepare the pet for adoption and the adopt donations go directly to cover those costs and range from $295-$495. Thank you for stepping up to save a life!\n\nTo expedite to meet with this dog, please go to our site at www.savinggreatanimals.org and fill out an application. We look at the first applications to arrive, so we hope to hear from you soon!",

Being bred to run across the frozen tundra, he does like to test his boundaries so a secure fence and lots of exercise is a must for this guy! Skylar is a sweet boy and has recently arrived so we are still getting to know him a little better. He loves his walks and loves to be petted. Rides well in the car! He does have some issues with handling his neck/collar area - he may have had a bad experience with rough handling at some point. He does easily let us hook a leash to his collar but was a little mouthy with the volunteers at the shelter where we got him from when they were putting on and off a slip lead over his head. He was very polite about it and didn\u2019t bite down but because of this we prefer him to have a home without small children. We would love Skylar to go to a family with husky experience! He is scheduled to be neutered on November 3 and will be available after he recovers from his surgery. Skylar will also be vaccinated, heartworm tested and microchipped.  If you are interested in adopting this handsome boy please fill out an application at www.companimals.org. Adoption $250",

I WANT you to put me to work and I will be your best friend if you time to pet me and love me. \n\nI can be a bit shy when I first meet people, but I generally warm up really fast to people. You should know that I am a strong dog, and I want to chase all the critters in the neighborhood when I go out on walks. I just need someone with some time to help me learn. In return I will be by your side at all times, I will keep you warm in the cold of winter if you will just give me a chance!",

She had a hard time taking care of these babies by herself, so we sent her pups off to foster to be bottle fed. She is a kind and sweet girl. She's very shy, but has the energy to play with her fellow dogmates all day. She is opening up to us day-by-day, and is now coming up for sniffs and pets when she feels like it! Would do good in a child-free home, where someone could offer her time, patience, and love.",

Please make sure to read the adoption fee below in the bio.\n\nBREEDS: We are not breed experts. The breed(s) listed for each adoptable are best guesses or suggestions.\n\nSTEPS TO ADOPT:\n\nRead the adoptable\u2019s bio below, including their adoption fee\n\nRead \u00a0ADOPTION PROCESS page under the \"Adopt\" section\n\nComplete the \u00a0DOG ADOPTION APPLICATION (located on our website RARErescue.org)\n\n*Applications will be attended to before general inquiries. We may or\u00a0may not\u00a0have time to respond to general inquiries if you have not submitted an application.\n\nWe understand that it is important to you to find the right fit for your family. We feel the same way! The application is important and necessary for this reason.\u00a0\n\nAll of our Adoptables are:\n\n*spayed/neutered\n*up to date on vaccines\n*heartworm tested if six months or older (and kept on heartworm preventative and treated for heartworms if positive when entering our program)\n*microchipped prior to adoption\n\nBASIC INFORMATION:\n\nSuggested Breed(s):\u00a0Pit Bull Terrier\nGender:\u00a0Male/Neutered\nApprox. Age or D.O.B: 4-5 years\nApprox. Weight: 80 lbs\nCoat Type: Short\nGood around most dogs: Yes\nGood around most cats: Yes\nEnergy Level: Medium\nFence yard may be required: Yes\nAny other specifics:\u00a0\u00a0Rudy is a lover and a charmer! He is being fostered with his good friend Dixie, the light brown brindle dog in his pictures. His foster mom also has dogs of her own and they all get along very well. Rudy would prefer to be in a more quiet household without a lot of loud noises. He loves people, but can be scared by a lot of fast movement, so a person or family without small children would love to spoil on Rudy and make him their cuddle buddy! He will ask for belly rubs and loves to cuddle. Once you meet Rudy, you won't be able to stop yourself from falling in love!\u00a0 \u00a0*Note - in case you are looking for a pair, Rudy and Dixie are great buddies and their adoption fees would be discounted if adopted together. But they are also fine with being adopted separately as well.\u00a0\n\nWill you be a Hero in Rudy's story?\n\nVisit our website/Click on Adopt to APPLY today!\u00a0 RARErescue.org\n\nAdoption Fee: $185.00\n\n\n\nPlease REMEMBER, All of our Adoptables are:\n\n*spayed/neutered\n*up to date on vaccines\n*heartworm tested if six months or older (and kept on heartworm preventative and treated for heartworms if positive when entering our program)\n*microchipped prior to adoption\n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: We are a non-profit organization without municipal or government funding. Veterinary/Medical expenses are constant for an animal rescue. Our adoption fees not only help to provide vetting and care for the animal being adopted, but they also help to cover heartworm treatments and other treatable ailments that many animals, that would otherwise be euthanized, need in order to be made available for adoption.\n\n\n\nPlease understand that adopting an animal is a LIFETIME COMMITMENT to that animal and there will be veterinary expenses throughout their life that can often cost several hundreds, if not thousands of dollars (without pet insurance), especially without annual checkups and preventative care.\u00a0 As a potential family for this pet you are responsible for their safety and that includes keeping them on your property.\n\n***If you are not in the middle Tennessee area, transport can potentially be arranged to approved homes, depending on distance and local adaptability. We normally do not allow adoptions outside of 1.5 hours driving distance.\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt, foster, or aid in the rescue efforts of RARE!",

            "description": "Princess Penelope is a 1 year old Boston Terrier that weighs about 14lbs. She is spayed, microchipped, up to date on all of her vaccinations, and on heart worm prevention.\n\nPrincess Penelope is a sweet girl that is very friendly with everyone she meets! She was born with a condition called spina bifida, which causes her fecal and urinary incontinence, as well as occasional mild weakness in her hind legs which is almost unnoticeable. Although this will be a lifelong diagnosis for her, her condition is very manageable and her quality of life is still great. She wears a diaper in her foster home and doesnt seem to mind. Keeping her on a strict diet of her dog food helps manage the incontinence issues. Daily expression of her bladder and monitoring for signs of UTI are also an important part of her care. You would never know Princess Penelope is a special needs dog from the way she runs and plays! She loves to be around children, and does well with cats and other dogs. She walks well on leash and will come to her foster mom when called. She is an affectionate girl that likes to cuddle up after playing. \n\nIf you would like to give Princess Penelope her forever home, please submit an application at southerncrossbtr.com. Her adoption fee is $375. She is being fostered in Lafayette, IN area. If you have specific questions about Princess Penelope that are not addressed in her bio, please reach out to her foster home at ddscanlon@gmail.com.\n\nFor a complete listing of all of our available Bostons, or to learn more about SCBTR, please visit our website at www.southerncrossbtr.com. You can also find and follow us on Facebook at facebook.com/southerncrossbtr. Thank you \n for choosing rescue and for considering Southern Cross for your next furbaby.\n\n ** IF THIS AD IS STILL ACTIVE, THEN THIS PET IS STILL AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION **",

He was scheduled to be euthanized at an overcrowded shelter because his stray hold was up and there was no more room to house him, but fortunately, BarkVille was able to save him before his time ran out.  Wagner's foster mom says he is gorgeous, sweet, curious, loves car rides and would be fine in a home with or without other dogs. He has a confident dog with a strong personality so slow introductions to other dogs would be required.  He is a playful, intelligent, energetic boy who needs a fenced yard (6 ft high at least cuz this boy can jump) and an experienced, active owner with a firm hand to give him structure & guidance. He has terrible leash manners (still a work in progress), but he is young, smart & treat motivated which makes him highly trainable!  He is housebroken, crate trained, neutered, fully vaccinated & microchipped.\n\nFor more information about Wagner, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org. If you would like to adopt sweet Wagner, please submit an application for him at https://www.barkvilledogrescue.org/applications",

            "description": "Preference is being given to Boulder County area and to a home with a friendly, confident dog to be a mentor for Foxy.  In addition a fence is almost certainly a must (rare exception made here). Thanks for your interest!!! Also, no condos, townhomes, apartments.\n*Foxy is finishing up heartworm treatment. We expect her to be heartworm free by July. Her treatment goes with her and SDR will support her heartworm treatment costs until she tests negative. \n\n-------------------------------------- \n\nHello, My name is FOXY... not only do I look like a fox, I'm quick and smart like one, too. My foster dad calls me Foxy Bear as I zoom around my yard! I am only 30 lbs, which is a perfect size for a Colorado dog. I am looking for a gentle and kind person to show me the wonderful  life I deserve. \n\nI love playing with my foster brother who is twice as big as me. I would do better in a home with a resident dog like him to show me the way! In fact, I think it is a must. \n\nI also love food! I'll do almost anything for a food reward. My foster dad has taught me to sit, shake, and touch his hand already. I'm starting to learn about a \"clicker\"... I know it means I did something good and a tasty treat is coming.\n\nMy favorite place to hang out is on the big bed. I've slept there with my new family every night since I arrived, and I like to nap there when we're not busy. If I'm bored and want some attention, I go into my foster dad's office and give him a gentle nudge with my nose. If I sit nice with my tail wagging, I usually get some pets and sometimes even a treat.\n\nI also like to hang out in the yard when it is nice outside. Usually, I just nap in the grass or watch whatever is going on. My yard has to have a pretty good fence.\n\nI am a little slow to warm up to new people when we first meet, but if you give me time I quickly am your friend, too!  *Foxy is not a brew pub dog, nor will she be a farmer's market girl if they ever start back up again. She needs a more quiet home with a loving person. \n\nI'm also friends with every dog I've met so far. My big foster brother is fun, and we greet a bunch of neighbor dogs hanging out in their yards when we go for walks. But, squirrels are absolutely fun to chase! And rabbits too! So, be assured that I'll keep them away from you and our home.\n\nI really like my coat... it gives me a nice warm hug when it is cold outside.\n\nSpeaking of rough life, it turns out I came down with something called \"heartworm\" while at the shelter this summer. It doesn't really bother me and it isn't catchy for other dogs this time of year, but everybody says it is bad so we are trying to fix it. Right now, I get an extra treat every morning and evening. My foster dad calls it \"medicine\", but it tastes like turkey to me and I gobble it up. In a month or so. SDR is committed to paying for all of Foxy's heartworm treatment until she tests negative! \n\nHere are some details about me according to SDR: I'm a 1-1/2 year old Shepherd/Sheltie mix female born 5-1-2019. I'm spayed, microchipped, housetrained and up to date on my doggie shots. I'm on heartworm treatment and soon I'll be good as new.. \n\nI\u2019m working with a wonderful behavior consultant named Elisheba Fey, and she is helping me become more confident! \n\nI really like when new people gently toss treats next to me instead of staring at me and calling my name, or making me come to you for a treat. This protocol is called \"treat and retreat\" and used by the best dog trainers in the world. It makes the process of me trusting you, so much faster! And we will soon be buds if you can just follow this protocol! \n Included in my adoption fee is a session with Elisheba, so you can learn what we are learning! https://www.artandscience.dog/\n\nFor more info and/or to apply to adopt me, go to SummitDogRescue.org, fill out an application and send it in. A nice volunteer from SDR will get back to you as soon as they can.",

She was lost, confused, lonely and it looked like she JUST HAD a litter of puppies. When she woke up the next day, the foster mom noticed her tummy looked a little different. She was taken the next day to the vet and it was confirmed SHE WAS pregnant! She had 3 healthy puppies the following week. She was the best mamma dog to her babies. She loved and cared for them dearly.\n\nDanni is quiet and loves her person. She is affectionate, gives kisses and likes to snuggle. She is food motivated and is learning the \"Sit\", \"Down\", and \"Place\" commands. She is active, playful and likes to run in-yard. She is good with other dogs and people but we don't know yet about children.\n\nShe is  house- and crate-trained. She came to us heartworm positive and had to wait until after nursing to go thru the aggressive treatment. She has now finished her treatment and is looking for her furrever home just as her babies have. She is fully vetted, spayed and microchipped.\n\nPlease visit Regard4Life Animal Rescue at Petsmart in Longview on Saturdays for more information.

            "description": "Kate recently lost her family and needs a new one. She is a sweet girl who loves to give hugs and kisses if you let her. She is spayed, up to date on vaccinations and negative for heartworm disease. Kate will be a loyal family member and really wants a yard to run in so she no longer has to be in puppy prison. When she lost her family, she had to go outside to an aunt's house and was living in a small pen with a barrel house and very little companionship. She misses her people and their rambuctious children and the comforts of a home - beds and couches and little people to love her and give cuddles. We want the best for her and want to help her find a home! Because we are foster based, we require an approved application before a meet and greet can be scheduled. We think that is fair for our fosters, so every meet and greet has the potential to result in an immediate adoption. The application is available on the rescue website and can be completed online. We work with many rescues and strive to find every rescued dog in our care a great home. Sometimes that means transferring that pet to another location where adoption may be more likely. We currently have partners in New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont.\n\nIf you are interesting in meeting any of our pets, the process is to complete an application. It can be downloaded as a pdf document from our website and submitted by email to WindyRidgeRescue@gmail.com as a scanned document or as photos OR can be completed entirely online. Both links are in the header of our website.\n\nBecause we are foster based, we require an approved application to schedule a meet and greet. We feel that is fair to our fosters and rescues so every meet and greet can result in an adoption.\n\nWe do not have set adoption fees for dogs, but hope adopters will donate generously so we can rescue more. The medical care for every dog can easily exceed the adoption donation. Average adoption fees for dogs in the area range from $175 up to $450.\n\nWe ask for a minimum adoption donation of $50 for cats regardless of age. Each cat is up to date on vaccinations, dewormer, and microchipped. Larger donations are always welcome so we can rescue more. Medical care for each cat easily exceeds the minimum donation.\n\nAs with every rescue, our resources are limited and the need for rescue help is unlimited. Your generosity helps us to rescue more.\n\nAdopting or fostering for a rescue frees up a space where a new rescue can reside.\n\nIf you can't adopt or foster, than please consider donating.",

            "description": "Housetrained? Yes. Experience with dogs? Yes.Resource guarding is possible, also possibly dog selective. Experience with cats/kids? History states he's not good with cats. Unknown how he is w/kids/ Here is what my foster mom had to say about me! Saddles has worked very well with me on leash. Very responsive to chicken and is able to walk very appropriately. He will sometimes lunge and bark when walking head-on towards another dog. He is crated at night and when he is home alone. He never complains and seems quite relaxed and comfy. He also knows: sit, down, shake, wait, take it, leave it, stay, back (aka go away), off, hoop (he loves jumping through a hoola hoop), heel, and more. Saddles arrived at the shelter as a stray. A kind person picked him up intending to keep him. The problem was, he didn't get along with the cat. They brought him to PACC where his behavior was deteriorating after being there for almost 2 months. Once I brought him home as a foster pet, his personality really came out! He is super affectionate, he loves to give hugs and kisses. He will also happily roll on his back to get belly pets. He is playful, mostly likes tug ropes, tennis balls for fetch, and his favorite toy is a plushy with a squeaker. Although he loves to play, he is on the lazier side, he just always wants to be pet! Saddle is the perfect combination of smart, lazy and a people-pleaser. He picks up basic commands like a wizard. He will also do things like put his tennis ball on the coffee table! He's lazy because most of the time, he likes to lay down in the sun that shines through the window and sleep. He shows us he's a people-pleaser by always coming when you call him. He also shows us that by listening intently to our voices on walks and during training. He's always willing to cuddle when we are. His best quality is that he's a great listener. He makes an excellent companion! My favorite behavior of his is when he gently puts his paws on my legs when I'm sitting on the couch. They are the gentlest hugs. Saddles would do best in a calm environment where he has a good day to day routine. His ideal owners would spend time reinforcing his training and take him for daily walks. He might even enjoy some sort of dog-sports to stimulate that mind of his!I think he enjoys being the only dog of the house but adopters need to be mindful of resource guarding if he is around other dogs. EMAIL PACC.FOSTER@PIMA.GOV to learn more!",

            "description": "Our rescues mean a lot to the vet staff and DunRoamin' volunteers. We do everything we can to find the perfect homes for these pets, who are being given a second chance at a happy life. The application process requires pre-adoption applications, references, and interviews with you and those listed on your application in order to ensure a successful placement. If you are interested in learning more about the pet featured in this listing, please complete an adoption application at  https://form.jotform.com/60793520585259 and a representative from DunRoamin' will get in touch with you. \n\n***This email account is not actively monitored and inquiries submitted through any of our listings will not receive a reply.\n\nNBSPCA license #0082\n\n\nWahlberg came to DunRoamin' Stray and Rescue on October 5th 2020 after his owner had passed away and he was no longer able to be cared for. He is a bright, handsome, sweet, senior black Labrador. The transition to a foster home was definitely a big change for this 14 year old boy, but his happy demeanor helped him settle in no time.\n\nWahlberg gets along great with other dogs but sometimes trips over smaller animals when he is excited and doesn't notice them. He is very respectful of cats, especially if he thinks they might deliver a swat! Wahlberg is definitely a people dog, preferring the company of humans over anything else. His hiking days are behind him, but he is always up for a cuddle on the couch or to lend a supportive ear.\n\nWahlberg is on medication for arthritis but he gets around fine. H would do best i a home with older children. He is kennel trained but does well loose in the house for short periods of time. He is an amazing boy who would be a great addition to a home. Please fill out an application for  Wahlberg here: https://form.jotform.ca/60793520585259\n\n",

Her leg has been surgically repaired and she is now going on her sixth week of recovery.  No running or jumping for Zoey until November 14 when she has a recheck and should be able to return to normal dog activities.\n\n\t\tZoey lives in a multi-dog home and gets along with her both the males and females in her foster home.  You can tell she wants to play with her dog buddies, so longer term she would probably like a dog buddy to play with.  Zoey has been a little snarky with the young female in the home.  She corrects very easily, but should be the only female in her forever home.\n\n\t\tZoey is housebroken and can sleep in a crate, or is trustworthy sleeping free on her bed.  Because of her leg, Zoey is in a large kennel while her people are at work, she protests for a bit, then will settle.  Zoey become very attached to her people and would love a home with someone home most of the time.\n\n\t\tZoey is a great girl who is curious, and very engaging.  Continued socialization and training will help her become her best self.  She will make a great addition for the right family. \n\n\t\tCats and other small furry critters unknown.\n\nThis dog is a Level 2. Please be sure you understand what a dog of this Level requires. Go to our home page for an explanation of the Dog Rating Levels.\n\nFor more information and to see when this dog will be attending an Adoption Day, please see our Dogs page on our main website at www.gcgsr.org. \n\nWe operate within a reasonable driving distance from the Greater Sacramento area, the \tCentral Valley down to Merced, and Lake Tahoe. A reasonable driving distance is determined by where one of our volunteers is willing to drive within our areas of service. That means we don't adopt out of our area, to Southern California, or Out of State. \n\n\nThank you for visiting!",

After about 6 hours we actually watched her start to understand what it was like to be a dog and not have to search for food and love on the streets. \n\nShe gave us what we like to call \"The Super Six\". Six of the most unique amazing pups we have ever seen. So amazing, in fact, that we adopted one of them!\n\nShe needs love and attention, she deserves it. She loves to run. Caralina would thrive with a big backyard to frolick around in. She is great with kids and other dogs. \n\nCaralina is about 35 pounds. She looks very large in the pictures but she stands about knee height with an athletic build. Did I mention she loves to run? \n\nApply now at ruffhouserescue.org/adopt",

However, Rae forms a strong bond with the people she knows and is very attentive to their emotional needs. She absolutely loves to chase soccer balls in the yard and could play forever! Rae can be jumpy and is very vocal at times as well, especially during playtime. Rae would be best in a home with older children (12+) who know how to respect her boundaries. She is able to co-exist with dogs in the play yard, but she is quick to tell them to get out of her space and isn't terribly interested in playing. She would likely prefer to be an only dog. Rae has seen our office cat many times in the lobby and after the initial excitement, she has decided to ignore his existence, so she may be able to live with cats. She will make a wonderful companion and will alert you if someone comes to your door!",

However, Rae forms a strong bond with the people she knows and is very attentive to their emotional needs. She absolutely loves to chase soccer balls in the yard and could play forever! Rae can be jumpy and is very vocal at times as well, especially during playtime. Rae would be best in a home with older children (12+) who know how to respect her boundaries. She is able to co-exist with dogs in the play yard, but she is quick to tell them to get out of her space and isn't terribly interested in playing. She would likely prefer to be an only dog. Rae has seen our office cat many times in the lobby and after the initial excitement, she has decided to ignore his existence, so she may be able to live with cats. She will make a wonderful companion and will alert you if someone comes to your door!",

            "description": "Meet ZEKE, a profoundly handsome Blue Nose Pit Bull. \n\nZeke was homeless, hungry, abused, defeated and extremely heartworm positive. Luckily, he was found by a Texas Animal Society (TAS) foster that gave him a soft bed, good food and lots of love. After an extensive search to find his people, Zeke became part of the TAS family. Once he started trusting again, he was bathed, nails trimmed and off to the vet he went. Zeke was fully vetted and x-rays were done to show the extent of his heartworms, which had already migrated into his lungs. We were devastated! The 3 shot fast kill treatment was started, only to end after the first shot. Zeke's poor body couldn't handle it and he became very ill. Everyone agreed to move him to the slow kill method. That was okay with his foster family because he was no longer on crate rest and able to run & play with all the pups in his foster home! \nZeke is the most loving dog you'll meet. He absolutely adores his human and is so willing to please. He wants to be pet or get a belly rub 24/7! Zeke is shy, timid and confused at new things and/or people but wants to trust and recovers nicely. He is approx 5 years old but a BIG puppy! He plays hard, sleeps hard and drools like a St. Bernard! Zeke is unaware of his surroundings, aka...Bull in a China Cabinet...just full speed ahead when he's in go mode!! He does spend a lot of time relaxing, sunbathing or under the patio fans. Zeke likes a constant temperature of 71, so here in South Texas, he is mostly an inside dog. He loves to chew on bones and carry shoes around but they are never damaged! He truly is a gentle giant!\nThis love bug will do best in a home with an experienced dog owner that understands Pit Bulls; his size and power. So NO small dogs, NO small children, NO cats and he does best with female dogs. This list could change as he settles into his new home but to start these are the requirements. Zeke is crate trained but does exhibits some separation anxiety. He is leash trained, loads & rides in a car well, has good food manners and is easy to bathe & trim his nails. He knows some basic command and how to fetch, although not perfect at these, he tries. Zeke needs a loving, patient home with people that will spend a LOT of time with him. He will need people that are diligent about administering his monthly heartworm meds to get him free and clear of these deadly parasites. Zeke has never shown any aggression to people or dogs. He is definitely a lover! Zeke will make a loving addition to the right family! Will that be you?Interested in adopting a companion dog or cat from Texas Animal Society?\nPlease email info@texasanimalsociety.com and complete online adoption application at texasanimalsociety.org\nCome visit our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/www.texasanimalsociety.org/",

She would do best in an active home with a doggy friend to play with She LOVES to run! She has been in boarding the past few months, so we know she will be so grateful to be in a home with plenty of pets and snuggles!\n\nCindy is a 2-4 year old Black Mouth Cur mix, kennel trained, vetted, and microchipped. Like a lot of our dogs, she is heartworm positive and we're doing a slow kill treatment on her currently. Please don't let that deter you from adopting her! \n\nPlease email questions to contact@hopeforpetsrescue.com \n\nwww.hopeforpetsrescue.com/adoptionapplication",

Aggie would be best as an only dog she can be selective with other dogs and protective of her humans. Older children might be best for her. You can win Aggie over with food and treats quite easily. She enjoys a good snuffle mat to search for yummy treats which helps keep her young. Aggie loves plush squeaky toys and maybe a small game of tug. She is not too old for a good game of fetch as well. Her favorite thing to do is cuddle and get loves from her people.",

They reported that she was house trained and crate trained and that she was very loving. Isabella has a lot of energy, so she would do best in an active home, and would also love to have a fenced-in yard. At 36lbs. she is a compact beauty. Isabella wants all of the attention for herself, so she should be the only animal in the home. Isabella is a young one year old (est. birth date 12/11/2019), and her adoption fee is $275. If you want more information about Isabella, please submit a survey at https://furkids.org/dog-adoptions/application. At this time, meeting our dogs is by appointment only. After submitting a survey, an adoption counselor will contact you to give you more information about the dog you are interested in adopting and to arrange for you to meet the dog. Must be at least 21 years of age to adopt.",

            "description": "Missee Lee is an 8 year old pittie mix that is about 60lbs- she is laid back and just goes with the flow! She has impeccable manners in the home. Even though she would love to cuddle you all the time, she will wait for you to invite her on the couch or bed. While she waits for her personal invitation to join you or to be by your side, Missee will sleep on her bed & will wait until you are ready to take her out for a walk.  She's a quiet dog, house broken, & has a hearty appetite. Fearless and confident, Missee is a tough little chick with a frosty face and plenty of pep still left in her step! Dont let her age fool you!\n\nWhen we agreed to take her, she was at the city shelter for 260 days! Most of this time, fortunately, was in a foster home, which she remains in with us. \nMissee is a sweet and well behaved girl. Unfortunately, she was plagued with severe ear infections. For 7 months, nothing helped. Her pain persisted and the swelling was unbearable. Finally, she received surgery to correct the issue. This care was possible with a private donor, a friend of the foster mom\u2019s, who was her cheerleader since she was at the shelter. Missee is also allergic to a great many things, which everyone ignored until she entered foster care.\n\nAfter healing from her surgery to open up the ear canal and a partial ear oblation, Missee is now ready for her forever home! Missee is also working with our trainer on manners. As she starts to feel better, her personality is really shining through. We learned that Missee loves other dogs, dressing up in clothes, and going for walks. Missee will pull towards any dog she can meet. Unfortunately, sometimes her approach is not well received, but she means well! She is a strong little tug boat and should be with someone that will continue working with her on training and manners. Missee is a dream in the home, house broken, and loves those who care for her! \n\nMissee would love a home that will continue to let her flourish. She asks that her forever home have no cats, but dogs are loved and welcomed! Our angel is a lower energy dog, so a mellow home is ideal! She howls with joy when happy and makes the funniest sound when you rub her belly. It's almost a purr! \nThe ideal home should know that her ear issues likely stemmed from years of neglected energy. She should be on a poultry and potato free diet. \n\nIf interested in adopting, email us at twentypawsrescue@gmail.com or info@twentypawsrescue.com.

He loves to cuddle and especially loves getting rubbed on!\n\nTo set up a meet and greet or inquire about a dog, please first fill out an application at https://savinghoperescue.org/contact.

Inquiries requesting additional information will not be returned, due to limited volunteers. Thank you for your understanding **** \n\nMeet Milo.\n\nMilo was pulled with 2 of his siblings after being surrendered to the shelter because they had \u201ctoo many\u201d. They were very young and malnourished. \n\nMilo is now approximately a year old and healthy, has received vaccinations, and is neutered and microchipped. Milo would do best in an active home with no other dogs, or with a strong handler if there are other dogs in the home. He can be good and play with other dogs, but Milo lacks confidence and will growl, bark, and lunge during the initial meeting. If you are confident and comfortable with dog behavior and socialization, we would consider your application to adopt Milo if you have other dogs. \n\nMilo is a very active guy and needs to be adopted into a home with a yard, and preferably a pool as he LOVES to swim!\n\nAll PETronus Rescue dogs receive basic vaccinations (distemper/parvo, bordetella, & rabies), spay/ neuter, and microchip prior to adoption. We also treat any know medical issues, including heartworms.\n\nOur dogs live in foster homes while they wait patiently for their forever families to find them. This is beneficial in that they learn house manners, crate training, housebreaking, etc while they wait and we are also able to get a very realistic picture of their energy level, temperament, etc so that we can place them in a home that is the best fit.\n\nOur adoption fees are $200 for dogs over 1 year of age and $250 for dogs under 1 year of age. Puppies receive 3 rounds of puppy vaccinations.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our amazing dogs, please fill out our adoption application here http://bit.ly/PRAdoption and we will be in touch!",

            "description": "OUR ADOPTION PROCESS AND APPLICATION ARE AVAILABLE AT WWW.SOHODOGRESCUE.ORG AND OUR FEE IS $275\n\nSherlock is a wonderful, medium-energy Australian Shepherd who is ready for his forever home! Sherlock is about 2 years old and has a gorgeous black dilute coat with copper and white trim, and a natural half tail. He weighs about 45 lbs and is house-trained, crate trained, knows his basic obedience commands and is quite food motivated! Sherlock enjoys riding in the car and walks pretty well on the leash.\n\nSherlock is a total lovebug to women and is learning to trust men. He is a very high Velcro guy and wants to be with you pretty much 24/7. He loves being in the midst of the action and pretty much being underfoot! He is typical of Aussies in that he is incredibly devoted and attached to his people - he loves being with them and hanging out on the couch, going for walks, or being underfoot when you are cooking. He also enjoys the company of other dogs and would do best in a home with at least one other confident, playful female dog to emulate. He has been tested with cats but is a little too interested in them for comfort - his best home will not have cats as he fixates on them. \n\nSherlock's ideal home is either a quiet suburb or a rural area, as he gets pretty excited when he sees a lot of traffic. He is a medium energy guy that loves a good hike, but doesn't need a 5 mile run to keep him happy. He doesn't love men right away but adores women, and would do best in a home without young children as he seems to do best in a quieter home. He has good recall but because of his shyness, his foster family recommends a home with a physical fence just in case he gets spooked. He is extremely intelligent and loves to learn, and his favorite spot is curled up beside your bed at night. He would do great in a home with someone experienced with training shy dogs to help him reach his full potential. If this guy has stolen your heart like he's stolen ours, apply today at www.sohodogrescue.org!",

She had a really harsh life before and came with a highly concerning behavior evaluation from the city shelter, which made her rescue only. Since she was a stray, her past is unknown. One of our experienced foster homes stepped up and offered to give her a chance! Before coming to us, Plum was a dog that didn't allow humans near her. Now, she is beautifully coming out of her shell! Plum is truly a dose of bunny eared perfection. \n\nAfter completing behavioral rehab and recovering from kennel cough in her foster home, Plum emerged an absolute sweetheart. Plum still requires a slow approach when meeting new people, though. Just give her a day or 2 to learn you are her friend and she's sugar, spice, and everything nice! Plum loves car rides, hikes, frolicing in the park, and meeting other dogs. Generally, she LOVES to play with them, but can be overwhelming to some. For this reason, she should be paired to tolerant and playful dogs in her forever home. Plum would love to be your only pet as well, so don't worry if you have no other pets at home. She loves to be your only shining star. \n\nPlum loves to jump into your lap and solicit pets. She is also a great student and attends online school with her foster sister. She is all about safety and virtual schooling! She would be a good candidate for an adult only home or one with older children that understand a patient and slow approach. \n\nOur little Plum is extremely receptive to training and positive reinforcement. Will you be the right one for Plum? She will return your love with so much kindness, warmth, and wiggles. \nIf interested in adopting, please email us at twentypawsrescue@gmail.com or info@twentypawsrescue.com. Please note we respond to all emails. If you do not hear back from us, please follow up! Sometimes, emails get lost in cyberspace.\n\n",

She appears to be a Catahoula Leopard Dog mix (the state dog of Louisiana) with a striking specked coat and her left eye is half blue/half brown.  As of late October, Dixie is around 9 months old and 35 lbs. \n\nHer foster mom says, \u201cDixie is a very sweet and affectionate dog who loves everyone she comes in contact with.  She loves kids, other dogs and even responded well to a very dog friendly cat in the neighborhood.  Based upon that interaction, I would think she can be considered cat friendly. \n\nShe has done very well on house training.  If taken outside at regular intervals, toileting will not be a problem.  I do crate her when she must be left alone, as she does have a tendency to chew on things when given the opportunity.  However, with proper exercise, chew toys and supervision, that will be less of a problem, especially as she outgrows her puppy ways.\n\nDixie does need daily exercise, including long walks and the ability to run and play.  A secure fenced in area would be a great help.  She is very good on a leash and looks forward to her daily walks.  Also, she does well riding in the car.\n\nI do not crate her at night, and she does fine sleeping in her bed in my bedroom, although she would love to be invited as a bed partner.\n\nShe knows basic commands and seems to be a quick learner.  She loves my dog and plays well with him, even insisting on sleeping with him at night.  I separate the dogs during feeding, but she shows no signs of being food or toy aggressive. \n\nDixie has a good temperament and will make a wonderful companion for someone who has the time and ability to spend time with her and give her the exercise and attention she needs.  All she needs is a loving home.\u201d\n\n \n\nDixie photos:  https://photos.app.goo.gl/5XTk5EbuHkEky5qk7\n\n\n\nVideo of Dixie with a food puzzle:  https://youtu.be/WMMdclxJrgY\n\n\n\nDixie is spayed, microchipped, fully vaccinated, heartworm negative and current on monthly heartworm/flea prevention and deworming.  This darling girl just needs a forever family! Please email us at TheChiSociety@gmail.com to apply for this girl from Dixie!\n\n",

Through no fault of my own, I seem to always be overlooked and I am a really nice dog! Here is my story.. I was the only girl in a litter of 4 rescued from underneath a porch on a cold January night. My 3 brothers found their forever homes pretty quickly but I was a little bit shy and didn\u2019t get picked. I am a very sweet girl, cuddly and playful. I have a beautiful face, always smiling and when you look into my loving eyes you will see I am very special and deserving. I am very loyal, I am friendly and I get along great with boy dogs, not at all with female dogs. I may already be housebroken. My mama is a Border Terrier mix and pop may be a shepherd. See my puppy picture and a picture of my mom attached too.\n\nBirthdate: 12/20/2017\nWeight: about 35-40 lbs.\n\n",

We are also told both dogs are in very good health.  Proof of vaccines will be provided.  Ruka has been spayed, and Taz has been neutered.\n\n  If you are interested in these dogs, contact Vicky at 760-672-2258. \n\n            \n",

I am tall and lean, in excellent shape, active, and incredibly smart. I just got home from a 2-week training program where I learned Sit, Down, Come, Heel, and other commands. My trainer will also meet my new family to teach them what I have learned. I am fun-loving, very social, I love my people and I love to be snuggled and cuddled. I love to play with other dogs, big or small, but I can be choosy. I would be best in a home without a cat. I am eager to please and I love getting treats and compliments. I come fully housebroken and crate trained.\n\nBirthdate: 11/1/2017\nWeight: 60 lbs",

At first, you may think I am not the most handsome boy, but remember that you cannot judge a book (or a dog) by its cover. Once you know me I will be irresistible! My sweet face will melt your heart because I am such a good boy.\n\nHere is my story.. I used to live in a home and sleep in my owner\u2019s bed but he could no longer care for me. My foster mom took me in and I am now seeking a new forever home. I am a sweet and intelligent boy with an adorable underbite and striking blue eyes. I'm a Labrador Retriever and American Bulldog mix with a heart of gold. I am well house-trained, I get along with other dogs and I love belly rubs. I am energetic, and I love to run around outside playing. I am a loyal boy and love my people. I can be a bit nervous in large crowds but I would rather be at home being loved on anyway. I am only 4 years old and I already know how to live in a home, so I would be an easy and grateful addition!\n\nBirthdate: 7/1/2016\nWeight: 60 lbs.\n",

I am still young at heart and active. Here is my story.. To say I am lucky to be here is an understatement. I was hit by a car and then left outside a shelter where I was put on a list to be euthanized. A very kind lady saw my story on Facebook and rescued me. I had surgery to fix my broken leg but I was left with a bit of nerve damage on another leg. My lower incisors are missing so I may have been chained and tried to chew through. Yes I had a horrible and tragic start to my life, but us dogs are amazing and resilient! I am the sweetest and friendliest boy you may ever meet. I was left with just a limp but I am happy and healthy and grateful to get a chance to find a wonderful forever home where I will be safe and loved! I get along with everyone.. people, dogs and maybe even cats. I am a medium size Lab mix and weigh about 30 lbs. I am about 7 years old and just a good natured boy.\n\nPlease know that it can be scary for an old fella to move into a new home. Just a little patience and tenderness until I feel safe and loved would be wonderful!",

I am a beautiful 6-year-old lab mix with a gorgeous cinnamon-colored coat. In fact, that is how I got my name.. Canela means cinnamon in Spanish! I was dumped on a road near my foster mom\u2019s house. She thought I was too pretty and friendly to be left all by myself but I didn't have a chip or collar and nobody claimed me. I am a very sweet and loyal girl and I love people. I can be picky about having a dog companion, preferring boys over girls, although I wouldn\u2019t mind being an only dog either. I love to run and play, I enjoy riding in a car and I am very well behaved. I may also be housebroken. I am totally ready to find my forever family and make them thankful to have found me!\n\nBirthdate: 3/25/2014\nWeight: 55 lbs",

My name is Smuckers. Have you ever tasted Raspberry Jam? If you have then you will know why I got my name as Smuckers jam is super sweet, just like me! I came into care with the good folks at MUR along with my two pups- Jif and Skippy. They have been adopted into wonderful homes and now it's my turn to find a place to call my own. \n\nI have been learning a lot of things with my foster family. I am fully house and crate trained. I'm not a huge fan of little humans as they can make me uneasy, so a home with no kids under 16 is a must for me. I'm good with cats inside my home but when I'm outside small animals are pretty exciting for me so I need someone to help me learn to leave them alone. I am pretty good at walking on a leash but sometimes need to be reminded about leash manners. But I can be easily redirected with treats if I get too excited. I would also like to take some more classes with you so we can learn and grow together! Maybe a reactive class would be good so we can both learn how to redirect if something gets me overly excited. \n\nI know sit, stay, down, leave it and even shake. Shake comes in handy when you like swimming as much as me so I don\u2019t shake at the wrong time and get everyone wet. I appreciate being introduced slowly to canine companions, so that I don\u2019t get overwhelmed with our first hello. \n\nI do love a good bone to chew on; there is nothing quite like it. Foster mom says I am gentle but also curious, which I am told is a great combination. I do have some allergies, both food and environmental, so I am on a strict hypoallergenic diet. I need my new family to make sure they keep watch so I don\u2019t get a flare up and we can catch it quickly! \n\nIf you are looking for the perfect companion to warm your feet while you relax, I am the perfect gal for you. \n\nI have completed the following classes: \nBasic Obedience with Pliant Pack Positive Dog Training \nImpulse Control with Pliant Pack Positive Dog Training \nReactive K9 with Pliant Pack Positive Dog Training \n\nPLEASE NOTE: Because we do not have a public shelter, an adoption application must be filled out in order to be approved to meet any of our animals available for adoption. No exceptions. Serious inquiries only.",

            "description": "I AM aLIKI and I am AvAiLaBLE for AdOPtIOn I just turned 7 and am a 60 lb. male husky mix. My original owner had me since I was a pup but turned me into the Baldwin Park shelter during the 2019 holidays because I am epileptic. I get grand mal seizures. I was freed by Shadow Husky Rescue, Inc. on January 4, 2020. I went to the emergency vet three times this year, in March, June and October 2020. Finally, the proper dosage of phenobarbital was figured out plus I take keppra, potassium bromide and milk thistle daily. I need a savior to help me if I ever feel vulnerable and experience a seizure again. I cannot survive without proper oversight and treatment. When I get a grand mal seizure, my whole body gets rigid and my head and lips get thrown back, my teeth are exposed, my legs are flailing around and I drool a lot of saliva. I usually chatter my jaws. It really helps when I get ocular compression to stimulate my vagus nerve to help redirect the electrical stuff in my brain so I can come out of it quicker. My head weaves a little bit while I am upright lying down. It\u2019s a really icky feeling. I enjoy being held and told everything is going to be all right, getting iced down or having a bath towel soaked in cold water placed around my belly, chest and back of neck. Then, I get yummy ice cream to raise my blood sugar, and extra protein because I burn calories when I shake. I hate crates and confined spaces. I also feel hungry all of the time due to the pheno so keep me out of the kitchen. Haha! I am good with other dogs but laid back and low key. I love to prance and follow my humans. I LOVE belly rubs. I never get separation anxiety with other furry friends or a human at home. I love stuffed animals, especially ones that squeak. I love to fetch balls and bring them back. I get along with cats. I love walks and walk so easily on a leash. I don\u2019t like dog parks, but dogs can come to my home or I like to go places like the river. I need to find ??MY 4-eVEr hO?me ??. Other furry animals at home are great but not a necessity. P.S. I love you, Aliki We recently obtained the results of Aliki's DNA breed test.  He is 71% Siberian Husky, 16.5% GErman Shepherd Dog a nd 12.5% Chow Chow",

They are all adopted out to great families and we are working on finding \"mama's\" perfect match. \n\nHere is what we have learned about her in the 7 months she has been in our care:  She never has an accident in her building, but uses the dog door. She is a sweetheart with people and never has met a stranger to this day. She will play with other dogs if they are submissive and nonreactive when she meets them. However, if they bark at her, she is in protective mode and the fight is on.\n\nHer favorite games are keep away and tug a war.  She loves to chase the ball if you keep a second one in your hand to entice her to drop the first one, ha!\nShe loves to play with older children. (they probably need to be at least 7 or 8 yrs old)\n\nShe is 48-49 lbs, 2-3 yrs old, and a shorty. She has not chewed up her toys or bed, neither has she dug in the yard. She does love to sneek my husband's garden gloves, though.\n\nShe sits and waits to pray before she eats. \nShe would do best with a family that has a fenced yard.\n",

Cookie is house broken, dog friendly, and super sweet\n\nCookie is a perfect lady in the home and rarely barks. While she is currently in the city and well behaved in the apartment, Cookie asks for her future home to be in a suburban area or home with a yard. Sadly, the city life can be a bit overwhelming for her.\n\nWe hope her future home can help her learn to be the best leash walker she can be! She can get scared and nervous outside, which makes her harder to walk. In the yard, she will frolic, roll around, and play! It looks like our Cookie monster his the jackpot when she is able to stretch those legs. She would love to have a canine sibling, human siblings, or anyone to love her!\n\nSadly, Cookie was surrendered to the shelter after her family moved away. She was adopted from there and her adopter is facing hardships beyond her control. In Cookies best interest, she made the painful and selfless decision to surrender her to us in order for Cookie to have the home and attention she desperately needs.\n\nIf interested in adopting or fostering, please email us at twentypawsrescue@gmail.com or info@twentypawsrescue.com. Please note we respond to all emails. If you do not hear back from us, please follow up! Sometimes, emails get lost in cyberspace.\n\n",

            "description": "Piggy Pie is a velvet hippo, piglet, koala bear, trex, alligator, pittie girl that joined our medical foster care program July 2020! She is a show stopping little gray brindle American bully 50lb girl, about 6 years old, and rescued as a \u2018stray\u2019 from the city shelter. This snorting (and snoring wonder) came to us with skin infections ravaging every part of her. You touch her, hair (where there was hair) would fall out. Her skin was scaly, peeling, red, hot, and painful. Her paws were covered, top and bottom, with painful overfilled blisters. This impaired her ability to walk, since any surface was painful. Her ears were filled with fluid, neck inflamed, and still lactating. Someone used Piggy Pie as a breeding machine, took her puppies, and left her out in the streets. They were sore, red, hot, and swollen. The one thing that was unharmed, her spirit. Piggy Pie LOVES to love! \n\nAfter spending about 4 months in medical foster care healing from her past, she is ready for her forever home and to officially enter retirement from being used as a breeder dog. Graduation is a beautiful thing! Unfortunately, we don't know the fate of her puppies, but we can assure Piggy that there will never be heartache in her life again. In medical foster care, she received round the clock care for her medical conditions. Twice a day, Piggy takes several pills and has her ears cleaned. Every other day, Piggy Pie gets a medicated bath/massage. Her routine is complete with lots of naps, love, snoring, and cuddles with her foster siblings. Piggy Pie required regular check-ins to monitor her progress and rest. While in our foster home, Piggy Pie is enjoying training to work through her trauma and learn basic obedience! \n\nPiggy Pie is incredibly affectionate, loving, and the funniest girl you will ever meet, with the chubbiest little paws. When she pouts, she will stick her head between her paws, show her little underbite, and pout her bottom lip! While she loves people, and is very respectful around children, she does ask to be the only pet in the home. She can get along with other dogs, but she rarely takes no for an answer from other dogs and can easily get too sassy for a situation. For this, we nicknamed her Piggy 'No Neck'.\n\nOur little gangster is crate trained, housebroken, fantastic in the car, and is happy to share her toys with her humans. She loves toys! Much in line with the fingerfood pigs in a blanket, Piggy Pie loves to be rolled up and nuzzled in a blanket for bed or naptime. She will gladly snooze the day away curled into your side, neck, or hip- while hugging you! Just as much, she is happy snoring in her bed on her own.\n\nWe must warn you, the noises this Piggy Pie makes are like no other! Adopt her and you might think you adopted some new barn yard animals! No worries, though, this is just her- a koala piglet crossed with an alligators self.  \nPiggy's former skin infections left her with scars on her chin. The person that adopts her MUST be prepared to give her a medicated bath twice a week and clean her paws and chin twice a day with a special solution. Skipping a bath or wipe results in a flare up!\n\nIf interested in adopting, please email us at twentypawsrescue@gmail.com or info@twentypawsrescue.com. Please note we respond to all emails. If you do not hear back from us, please follow up! Sometimes, emails get lost in cyberspace.\n",

Although I\u2019m originally from Mexico, don\u2019t let that fool you. I love being outside, even with all of this snow! As many people have felt cabin fever during this whole pandemic, well that\u2019s how I feel when I don\u2019t get enough exercise! I get very happy when my humans take me outside on a walk and let me sniff the shrubs, fire hydrants and poles we may pass. I really would make a great hiking or running partner! I am not a dog that would enjoy a dog park but would rather spend time outside with my family! I don\u2019t like it when dogs come into my face too quickly! Like hello, I need my space!\nSpeaking of spending quality time with my family, I would really enjoy taking an obedience class together so I can learn new things. I am a dog that needs some boundaries and rules to make me the most successful! I do like cuddling up in my kennel for some down time too!\nIn my previous home, I didn\u2019t get along with the other animals so I would prefer a home all to myself. I also think it would be best to be in a home with humans who are experienced in owning a dog as I sometimes need support as I don\u2019t always know how to act when I get overwhelmed!\nHave I mentioned how much I love people? I love getting some cuddles, curling up on the couch and interacting with everyone. I am a young boy who has lots of energy! I am good with older kids but I need to be supervised to make sure both me and the kids are being respectful of one another!\nSo, if you know you can give me daily exercise, want to do some obedience classes with me, have an animal free home and promise to love me and give me all of the scratches, I think you should apply to adopt me! Hasta Luego! \n\nEvery dog with the Windy City Canine Rescue will be vaccination, microchipped and spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Our adoption fee is $550. If you would like more information about the Windy City Canine Rescue or the dogs in our care, please visit our website at www.windycityrescue.com or e-mail us at info@windycityrescue.com.",

This handsome dude is a house and crate trained approx 1 year old (according to his records, but we think he's closer to 8 months), 35 lb Plott Hound/Pit mix (best guess!) who is going to make one family VERY happy. His Long Island foster mom says, \"Tanner is such a sweet boy! He plays with the neighbor's dog (and even shares his toy), walks nicely on the leash, LOVES playing with my kids and snuggling with them, sleeps quietly in his crate through the night, and follows us all around the house. He really just wants to be right by his people. He's still young, and he needs some basic training but he's very eager to please and seems to learn quickly. Right now we're working on some basic commands. He's still a bit mouthy when excited (typical puppy nips), so kids who can understand puppy mouthing are the best fit.\" We don't know about cats. Tanner is neutered, microchipped, and vaccinated, and his adoption fee is $500.",
