            "description": "Eli is a sweet boy who has quickly adjusted to life in a new foster home. While he is still a big puppy at heart, he has been adjusting to living inside a house and is doing great. He is doing very well with his house training and generally has good manners inside. He likes to walk on a leash and enjoys lounging outside on the deck, preferably with a nice bone to snack on. At some point in Eli\u2019s past, he developed a fear of other dogs and so does need a home where he won\u2019t have that exposure and  be the only pet in a home with a fenced-in yard.  In fact, a fenced yard is required to adopt Eli.  He couldn\u2019t be sweeter with people - whether they are big people (adults) or older children).  He should probably not go into a home with kids under 8. Eli is super smart, a quick learner, and very eager to please. Once he gets to know you, he won\u2019t want to leave your side unless it\u2019s time to hide a bone or play with a toy. He is ready to thrive in a forever home as a great family companion.",

Maple is a very special girl and what her new family is going to have to understand is that she's not going to instantly love you and jump into your laps for kisses, because she still has trust issues it takes her time to get used to people. She is a sweet and lovable girl, but there won't be any instant love connection from her, the reward will come later. Maple does adore other dogs and bonds so much quicker to them than humans, so Maple is perfect for someone that is looking for a companion for their dog and is ok with her needing some time to come around. She has also now learned to walk on a leash, although a bit nervous still this is a work in progress and she does have a curious nature so I'm sure with time she will become more confident on her walks.\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give. We rely on the generosity of others to make rescuing dogs possible.\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS DOG, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE READ THE DOG'S INFORMATION CAREFULLY.

He loves to be outside, but knows when it is time to settle down and does great in his kennel. He is a sweetheart with other dogs but he occasionally gets protective and barks when meeting new people (we are working on it!). Prince is an energetic, puppy-spirited lab mix and he is going to make a great companion for an active owner willing to work on some of his manners! \n\nAll dogs come with a microchip, annual vaccinations including EBR rabies license and tag, dewormer, vet exam and spay/neuter. Adoption fee is $95-$175.\n\nCompanion Animal Alliance\n2550 Gourrier Ave.\nBaton Rouge, LA 70820\u00c2\u00a0\n\nphone: 225-408-5360\n\nOpen 7 days a week - 10 am to 5 pm\n\nAll animals in foster care are adopted on an application basis. To fill out an application for adoption, please email foster@caabr.org",

She is the kissing bandit. She loves to give kisses if you allow her to! Many people wanted to meet her, but she was a couple hours away so we brought her back here. She has been in boarding for over a year. This beautiful kissing gal stole my heart over a year ago. Bandita is definitely an alpha female that needs a firm handler. She does mind well though. She is so sweet, she loves to kiss, but only if you want to! She knows sit, and down. She is also kennel trained. She has done well with male dogs her size. I would recommend only one male dog or her as an only pup. She has plenty of love to give! Bandita should be with kids over 12+. She is potty trained too! This kissing gal loves everyone she meets. She needs a home with a yard. PLEASE CALL 520-800-4633 ASK FOR Terri Boarder. Remember my name Kissing Banditas! I'm in Phoenix waiting for you! Hurry up, I don't really like the boarding place where i'm at, too much noise and too many dogs. I was hurting myself the other day, so I need out quick.....Please call asap!\n\nFor more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\nIf you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page\n\nat www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals\n\nfor more photos and details.",

Are you the one who will give me that chance?\n\nYou can complete an adoption application on our website at:  \n     www.onceuponatailrescue.com\nor\n     Scroll down on this page & click \"More About Us\", & then click \"Adoption            Application\" underneath our bright Pink logo. \n\nIf you want to meet a pup in person, Once Upon a Tail Rescue does adoption events at PetSmart in Covington, LA on most Saturdays with many of our adoptable dogs there. \n\nDon't forget to complete your application ahead of time, so you don't miss out on the pup you've connected with.  If pre-approved, you have first priority & can usually take home your new best friend the same day!  \n\n*Please note that there is no obligation to adopt by completing an application.*\n\n**All dogs are required to be fully vetted.

She had a beautiful litter of puppies & was a wonderful mother! Unfortunately, her leg isn't able to be saved & is scheduled to be amputated. We don't think it'll slow her down at all! This sweet girl deserves an amazing life after everything she's been through! We're so glad that we were alerted to her & were able to take her in! She's a special girl & will make an amazing companion. \n\nCOMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES!

They say that Vince is not getting the attention and exercise he needs since they now have two very young children.   He loves the attention of his humans and being pet and cuddling on the couch with you.  His favorite game is fetch and he could play all day if you wanted him to.  He  currently lives with two other dogs but would have no problem being an only dog. He can be selective with other dogs that he is not familiar with so slow introductions would be necessary. A home with older kids or an adult home is best. Vince is microchipped and current with his medical.  Est birth date 1/17/16\n\n\nhttp://homefurever.com/online-application/",

Thankfully a rescue hero in the community pulled her & has been working with her ever since! Daisy is the sweetest love bug & gives hugs & kisses to everyone she meets. She loves to play with other dogs but they must be tolerant because she is very exuberant! Older kids in the home would be best also for the same reason. Sadly Daisy is heartworm positive but she is currently undergoing treatment & doing very well! Don't miss out on this beautiful girl!

Cliffy was picked up as a stray, but he automatically sits for treats so we think he belonged to someone once upon a time. He's sweet and gentle with humans, but loud noises can startle him and render him sheepish till he knows all is well. He gets along with other dogs but appears to be an alpha (when he was hanging out in the park with his girlfriends, the other males didn't stay long). Cliffy is scheduled for neuter this week. He is heartworm positive but undergoing slow-kill treatment which should clear him within 8 to 10 months. No outdoor-only adoptions considered. Adoption fee of $150 will help offset vetting costs. Contact tendogtattoo@yahoo.com with questions.\n\nTo make the best possible match for you and the pet, please click below to complete the Adoption Application. \n\nOnce your application has been processed, we'll be in contact. \n\nWe cannot schedule a meet and greet without a completed application. \n\nIf you are viewing this page through PetFinder, Adopt-a-Pet, etc., please go to http://ootwrescue.org/adoption.html to fill out an application or review our Adoption Process.",

I have lots of scarring and my teats from having so many liters of puppies have never shrunk back down.\n\nI came from a fighting ring and was over used for breeding and when I got older, they decided to use me as bait.  I\u2019m not the prettiest gal in the bunch, but my heart is huge and I\u2019m so loving and trusting!  \n\nI love kids, but have not been around many except my foster mama's grandkids who are 3 and 5 years old.  I love my kennel buddy Ceasar.  He keeps me company!  I love, LOVE walks.  I was chained to a tree until I came here and I get to walk the neighborhood everyday now!  I will need lots of patience as I\u2019ve never been in a real home before\n\nPlease contact Top RJs and set up a meet and greet.  You won\u2019t be sorry!\n\n",

He has scars all over his body from life in the junkyard, but that\u2019s all behind him now. His coat gives him a magical unicorn appearance with its unique grey coloring and highlights of brown.\n\nTowbar was adopted to a family a few months ago, and they've come to realize that their busy lifestyle isn't the best fit for Towbar, so he's back with us and ready to find a family that has the time to love and guide him through new life experiences!\n\nHe gets along with other dogs and isn't a big fan of cats. We think he would do best with children who are 15 and older. Towbar is a big lover and wants nothing more than to please you. He is very chill, love to look out the window, chew toys, and all mental stimulation toys. He enjoys naps on the couch and smothering you with kisses.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for someone to make those road trips a little less dull, fill out a survey today at www.playersforpits.com/adoption-survey!",

            "description": "PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE BIO ON THIS DOG BEFORE REQUESTING AN APPLICATION.  MANY OF OUR DOGS HAVE STRICT REQUIREMENTS FOR THEIR ADOPTION.\n\nShorty is a 5 year old male Chihuahua, about 10 pounds. Shorty and Tinker came into rescue together when their owner passed away. While they lived together, Shorty was ruling the partnership, being overly protective and did not allow Tinker to thrive. They now live in separate foster homes and are doing fantastic apart. Hi there, my name is Shorty. I am somewhat of a mutt but have been found to look similar to a chihuahua. Also, I have a cute little curly tail so I think I might be a part pug also. I was recently separated from my brother Tinker and while I liked bossing him around, I feel I am doing just fine without him. I would not mind having another dog to live with. I am fairly young and love to play, eat, and run around in the backyard. I love going outside and barking at all the people and birds that fly around. It\u2019s one of my favorite things to do along with walks. I have found that some of my foster siblings hate rain but I find it so refreshing. I feel that I would do best in a home with no children as I am protective of my personal space. I am willing to nip if I am scared. As you know I did live in a home where my male owner died so I tend to sometimes be more friendly to men than women. I am a man's man, so to speak! Overall I do consider myself to be a fun and happy dog that can also be very playful. I would love to find out if you might be my forever home. Owner surrender\n\nAdoption contract and fee applies.  All adoptable dogs can be met at adoption events hosted every weekend. For a list of scheduled events go to: https://www.facebook.com/SmidgetRescue/events .  Smidget Rescue is not a shelter, and dogs cannot be seen at the Rescue location. All dogs are fostered throughout the Puget Sound area and are brought to the events where they can be met by prospective adopters. Additional pictures of adoptable dogs can be seen at: https://www.facebook.com/SmidgetRescue/photos_stream?tab=photos_albums.   All adoptable dogs are spayed or neutered at 6 months of age or older, and always before being placed in their new homes.  APPLICATIONS CAN BE OBTAINED BY EMAIL ONLY. Adoption process includes application, meet & greet, home visit and reference check. Email Jamie at smidgetrescue@hotmail.com or click on the CONTACT link on this page.   Notice:  We do not ship dogs out of state.  If you live within a five-hour radius of Seattle, WA, (such as Portland, Vancouver B.C., etc.), we can arrange for a home visit.  If your home seems like a great fit for the dog you would like to adopt, you must then drive to meet the dog at one of our weekend events or at the fosters home.",

            "description": "Okay ladies and gentlemen if you are looking for an awesome hiking buddy and ball player then look no further. Let me introduce myself, my name is Mary Belle and I am an approximately 2 year old tri color Catahoula Curr Mix and about 45lbs. I love to go on adventures and playing ball in the yard.\nIf you are interested in adopting me, I need to be the only fur child of any kind in the house or outside. I mean who really needs friends when we have each other. Also kids, I would prefer them in there teens and to be very dog savvy. I do have a few quirks that I\u2019m hoping you could look past and help me work on them to make me the best dog possible. I prefer not to be picked up, or restrained. If you do I may nip you, and that\u2019s only because I didn\u2019t have the greatest upbringing before I came to CAFA. Also when we first meet I may be a little shy, but give it some time and I will warm right up and be your pal. Also in July of 2020 I had to undergo the dreaded heart worm treatment that a lot of us end up having to thru down south. But I have been given the green light and am now looking for my forever after. So please if you are interested in meeting me click that button that says ask about Mary Belle and someone will get back to you. Don\u2019t worry I\u2019m not going anywhere since I want my forever home too.\n\nAdoption fees details:\u00a0\nPuppies - Adults $ 550, Seniors $375.

Please fill out our app at nycteensforanimas.com. This pup will also require multiple meetings with his new pet parents.\n\nThis gorgeous boy needs a special foster or adopter. Roscoe was rescued in Afghanistan by the wonderful organization Nowzad and Roscoe is in Brooklyn now looking for his forever home !\n\nHe's great on leash and needs someone who can walk him several times a day.\nHe does not need a yard. Roscoe would most likely jump a six foot fence and he cannot be let out without a leash or unattended.\n\nRoscoe can be wary of new people and he needs a quiet home with no other pets and a dedicated, patient person to follow through with training and positive reinforcement.",

He does well with other dogs in the home(with proper introductions)...small, large, male, female. He gets extremely nervous in public settings, so meeting dogs in public isn't ideal for him. He loves to run around the yard, so a fenced in yard is a must for Zeke. He is quite entertaining when he doesn't know you are watching. He is all legs and sometimes they get in the way? He is kennel trained. He isnt a fan of loud noises or quick movements. While he is currently residing with multiple pets, we feel he would feel more comfortable in a house with less commotion. He does have a voice and will use it when people come to the house. He does well with men and women. He has not been around children under 14. If you are interested in pampering(oh I mean adopting?)

            "description": "Max is a senior now at around 10 years old and is now looking for his forever home. Max has always been overlooked as he is a lab mix and because of his black colouring most people will overlook a good boy like this. Max has had no easy road and although it is not one of those sad stories you always see it really is a sad story. Through no ones fault months and years past for Max as he had no interest in him at all. The rescue is currently seeking a foster or an adopter as Max needs somewhere to call home or a place to rest his head. Although at his age he should be slow he is not. He is spry and loves to interact. A home with older children over the age of 12, for no other reason than his age and fast rapid movements. \n\nMax is fully vetted, housebroken and crate trained.  He is capable and needing of smiles, affection, and love, but he doesn't just give his heart away quickly and with abandon. Who can blame him?!!!  If you understand there is a story behind the soulful eyes and you give him some time and space, Max will let you in. Believe me, when this boy loves you, he loves you forever, and it's all worth it!! He is laid back but still loves a good play session, and boy does he love toys and treats!!! He is an amazing companion, a great listener and will be your best friend!\n\nHe's getting older and we need to make his golden years his best years!! His ideal home would be an experienced, adult only home where he is the only pet. We really want him to have it all and he deserves to be your one and only!!! A back yard would be amazing (but not required) since he does like to relive his lost puppy years and run around every now and then.\n\nEmail harescue1@aol.com to inquire",

Emma is worth the time to get to know and love, a beautiful dog that is excited to greet her family when they come home. Emma would be best in a rural setting (fenced) or large backyard. She alerts (barks) when she sees strangers or other dogs outside of her home. A very good watch dog. Emma likes routine, sleep in same location of home, eat at the same time. Visitors to the home need to know to ignore her at first and let her come to them.",

He plays fetch, which is amazing for an older fellow, and he knows lots of commands, particularly \"sit, down and shake.\" Not a fan of cats, he is house trained.\n\n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix.

He is very athletic and loves to play catch and swim. He soars through the air to catch a frisbee, but also lays around the house a good majority of the day.\u00a0 His current home teases that he is the laziest most energetic dog.\u00a0\n\nCisco is compatible with some dogs.\u00a0He currently lives with another small dog that he gets along with really well. He does well with friendly dogs, and is not a fan of aggressive dogs or being ganged up on (who can blame him?). He's had very limited\u00a0exposure to cats, but barks loudly at them on walks. He would do well with older kids. He always wants to play with older kids, but he is nervous around young children.\n\nWe take turns going to adoption shows to find our forever families on Thursday from 6:00-8:30 at PetSmart in Montgomery Plaza (415 Carroll St, Fort Worth, TX 76107). If you're interested in me, please contact my rescue family at GNARanimalrescue@gmail to make sure they bring me to meet you!",

He is now 7 years old.  Malcolm developed anxiety and a strong personality that led us to medication.  He has been on medication since March and is a much better dog.  Meds cost less than $10 per month.  Malcolm loves his people but needs a home without small children.  He has never been with cats.  Malcolm lives in our home with one other dog but he doesn't get along with every dog he meets.  He would be best in a home with a fenced yard (invisible fence will probably work).  If you think Malcolm might be for you, please contact Best Buddy; they will get in touch with me and you can meet Malcolm to see if you are a great fit.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Malcolm, please complete our online application at bestbuddypetrescue.com.",

            "description": "Rogue 3 1/2 year old black female with natural ears. She has been spayed and gastropexied. Rogue has come back to rescue through no fault of her own, as her family is splitting up and she had nowhere to go. She has lived with other dogs, so she could be placed with another dog, but it would need to be a large dog as she has a strong prey drive. If she is placed with a home with children, they would need to be older children. Due to her prey drive, living with cats would not be recommended. She takes a bit of time to warm up to strangers and even longer to men. She is highly food motivated and will learn your routine quickly with the help of tasty treats. Once she is comfortable with you, she loves coming to you to get rubs and scratches. Rogue is crate trained and walks nicely on the leash. Rogue does guard her food from other dogs so we would need an experienced Dane owner to take this sweet girl on. When she is given time, she is does not hesitate to show you what a great dog she is. One of her favorite things to do is to play fetch so if you want an active dog to be active with, she is your girl! Rogue came to MAGDRL in December 2019.

            "description": "Skeeter was trapped as a semi-feral with a deeply embedded collar last November. He has received medical treatment and is now totally healthy and vetted. He is still learning how to act in the house, but does well with other dogs and cats. He does well on a leash, and will need to be leash walked only for the foreseeable future. While he does well outside and inside, he is afraid to come back into the house if not on a lead. Skeeter will need a crate for when his new people are not at home, and will need a family who is willing to be patient with him while he adjusts to his new situation.\nSkeeter needs to have a dog playmate in his new home. He has not been tested around children, but due to his skittish nature, would probably do better in a home without them.\n\nNo out of state adoptions.\n\nTo apply to adopt this pet please fill out a Preliminary Adoption Application at http://streetpaws.org/adoption-application/. This application does not commit you to an adoption. It is used to screen those interested to make sure the home is a good match for the pet. We verify vet history on current/previous pets to ensure pets have been spayed/neutered and vaccinated annually. Our adoption fee ranges from $250-$400 our dogs. They have been given age-appropriate vaccinations, are spayed/neutered, dewormed, received flea prevention, heartworm tested and treated if necessary, and micro-chipped.",

I'm Sammy, a fun-loving 13 year old boy who is excited to find his fur-ever home!! Our owner was sick and couldn't take care of us anymore so now we need a new forever home. My sister Jazzy is in kidney failure so even though we have been together a long time, I will need to learn to live without her- that's why it would be great to find a home since I'm loosing my sister! Foster Mom says we're some of the sweetest dogs you'll ever meet!\n\nEven though I am getting on in age, and can be lazy, I still love to be around our people, including children - in fact my job is to protect them kiddos! I love to ride in the car and to sleep with foster mom, usually under the covers. I love to lay on the sofa, close to people too. i especially love to be petted, but we don't love being held.\n\nWhile I like to walk with a harnesses, I don't always do well with other dogs. When our foster family isn't home I stay in a crate together with my sister Jazzy. When they come home they take us out, and take us out often when they're here with us. Since we are older we'll occassionally have an accident if you don't notice us telling you we need to go outside.\n\nWe love food and treats! I don't have too many teeth left but that never lets that stop me!\n\nNo cats for me, please!\n\nI think you'll see I'd be great additions to a family who wants to love and snuggle and be loved back, unconditionally. Please adopt me today!\n\n1/10/21 9:32 PM",

Jasmine came into the shelter with her brother (who has since been adopted). She wasn't doing very well in the stressful, loud shelter environment, so a wonderful foster home came along and took Jasmine home. After just a short time in her foster home, Jasmine really started to blossom. She is house-trained and learning a bunch of other really cool things in her foster home. She has done well on car rides and enjoys taking long naps on blankets. At 6 years old, this one-of-a-kind beauty is well past the spastic puppy phase. She is simply ready to be your loyal, loving sidekick. If you are interested in meeting Jasmine, contact Jenny (Foster Coordinator) at 254-754-1454 ext 7087 or JennyL@hsctx.org.",

He was badly injured, with two broken legs and a dislocated hip, but he has recovered from surgery and he's now officially adoptable. He absolutely needs a fenced in yard to run, and he would do best with a younger, playful dog. He loves all dogs, but he's a little too much for seniors or little dogs. \n \nTommy's a super sweet, happy, affectionate boy who loves to run and play.  He's very smart, food motivated, and eager to please. He also loves to cuddle.  He has never had an accident in the house. He will bark and let you know when he has to go outside. \n\nAt only a year and a half old, he's a big puppy at heart.  He is an amazing dog and he will make a someone very happy!  No cats, please. We think he'd be fine with older kids, but he might knock small children over. \n\nOur adoption fee is $150, including neuter, microchip, and vaccinations up to date as of the day he goes home. \n\nIf you're interested, you can submit an adoption application here:\nhttps://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/FUR/Dog",

I also like to play with squeaky toys and soccer balls. I came from Arkansas back in the day, where I had a rough start and I sometimes am selective of my dog friends. After a proper introduction with new dogs though, I love to play with them.\n\nNot to brag, but I am really smart, too! I have completed obedience 1 class and know a lot of verbal commands and I'm eager to learn more!! I like to make my people happy and smile, I'll smile back! I am very food motivated, so if you want to teach me even more it won't be hard! I Love my food puzzle and keeping my mind and body active. I'd be the best co-pilot in the car! I am also kennel trained and have learned how to walk with a gentle leader so I don't pull so much. And yes, I'm house trained, what do you think I am an animal?! I do not like cats and get very nervous around children so I would do best in a home without either. Looking for a mature home that has had some dog experience. I wouldn't mind being the only dog so I can get lots of love and attention, but I would also be happy with another doggy friend as long as we are a good fit. I'm eagerly waiting for someone to please!\n\nAlvin's adoption fee is $250 and includes his neuter, microchip, current vaccinations and preventatives. Last Hope requires that all animals be kept as indoor pets only, altered and current on vaccinations and preventatives. Our adoption process includes reference and background checks, a vet check and a home visit.",

            "description": "Meet sweet Georgia! She is an energetic 2 yr old mixed breed, looking for a new home. Georgia is a playful pup, and eager to please. She loves humans, and would do best with someone who will take her on adventures and keep her active! She is still puppy-like, so a caring owner who will teach her obedience and other PAWSOME tricks would be ideal. Georgia does well with other dogs as long as they can handle her energy, and she prefers a cat-free home. She is good with children, but may do best with older children due to her playful ways! Georgia is such a lovable girl, and she hopes you'll give her the chance she deserves! She is 50 lbs, house trained, spayed and up to date on vaccines. Email us at lasthoperescuefl@gmail.com if you've got Georgia on your mind! \n\n*THIS IS A COURTESY POST. This means this pet is not in our rescue. We are assisting with finding this pet a new home, in efforts to keep him/her out of the shelter! We do require an adoption application for courtesy posts, to help find the best match for the animal, in hopes that their new home will be FOREVER!*",

She had a mammary tumor that has been removed but it was malignant. She is currently healthy but the vet told us she will most likely get more tumors that are malignant. Due to her being so underweight upon her arrival she has become food aggressive with other animals but shows no signs toward people. She seems to not be a fan of cats at all but gets along with some dogs as long as food is not around. She loves everyone but we have not seen her around young kids. We would prefer her to go to a home where she is the only pet and no very small children.",

Max is an adorable, smart and sensitive, boy with a contagious smile and endearing eyes that touch the hearts of everyone he meets! At 10 years old, Max enjoys brisk walks and chasing bugs and small critters, yet he will happily spend the day with his family cuddled up in his cozy bed or on a road trip. He is respectful to other dogs on leash walks, but Max's ideal forever home should be as the sole family pet. He loves being right alongside his people and would do best with someone that works from home or has a flexible work environment (short hours and/or a dog-friendly office). You can follow Max's adventures shared by his foster on Instagram @maxs_spots. Max's wellness care while in foster is being sponsored by Classic Canines so an adopter will get full medical records at no cost to them -social media: ClassicCaninesATX",

We jump around and play tug of war, it's so much fun! I win all the time! I've been told that I'm the stoic one out of us, but that doesn't mean I don't love a good playtime or snuggle. My next favorite place is a couch. After a good play session, the couch is where you will find me just relaxing. All I really want is someone to give me as much love as they will give me. Both Betty and I are super snugglers, who love to lay in our volunteers laps as long as they allow us. Is your lap available for me to snuggle?\n\n                                                                                         With Love,\n                                                                                                 Lou",

She would do best with a very patient dog-lover who has a confident dog to show her the way. She would be best in an all-adult home. \n\nAn owner give-up from Palatine, Illinois, she doesn't appear to have had a happy puppyhood. She needs time to warm up to new people. \n\nShe has not been cat-tested.\n\nRosey is very food-motivated, so training will help to build her confidence.\n\nRosey is very healthy, spayed, up-to-date on vaccines, microchipped, heartworm and fecal-tested negative.\n\nTo meet and possibly adopt Rosey, please contact Melia at melia88@comcast.net or 708-224-1900 for an adoption application.  \n\nHer adoption fee of $200 benefits the rescued dogs of Lucky Dog Rescue. \n\nShe is being fostered in Chicago.",

She has a calm and gentle disposition and isn't shy about giving as many kisses as you can handle. Gabbana is a great walker, although, she does like to take her time. She's mellow and easy-going and is sure to make a great couch potato buddy. She's not great, however, with other dogs; females especially. We're told she doesn't do well with kids, either, and has shown food aggression. We imagine she's been through quite a lot up to this point. We hope there's someone out there willing to give this sweet girl the patience and loving home she so deserves.",

He is perfect for a young family without kids that can give him a lot of attention and help him with his high energy.\n\nHe is very strong and needs some training, specially to walk on the leash. We don't recommend to have him around any other animals. He is a big boy but I love people and I am very misunderstood. He is very good with commands and willing to please. He has been with us for a year and a half and needs to get away from Shelter life and be in a living home. Please give him a chance.\n\nClick here to watch a video of Scooby.",

If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced. It is never our intention to ignore a request about an adoptable animal in our facility.\n\nSandy Brown, Director, PAW Animal Shelter\n\n319-372-2274",

Our rescue is just trying to help Raksha find a home. \n\nRaksha is a 100lb, 4-year old Tosa Inu Mastiff originally rescued from a meat farm in South Korea. Despite having a very traumatic beginning to her life, she is a loving, playful, and goofy dog that enjoys cuddling with her humans, hiking, and playing with her toys. \n\n Raksha currently lives with another dog and two cats. She has expressed some dog aggression issues (particularly under high-anxiety situations), and due to this she would be best in a home without other animals and with sufficient outdoor space to explore. \n\nShe is great with humans, including children, but due to her size it is recommended that she not live with young children. The ideal situation for Raksha would be in a country setting with a human who enjoys long walks/hikes (which help to reduce Raksha's general anxiety) and who is a confident leader capable of devoting time and energy to continuing to train/lead Raksha to be comfortable in the world. \n\nShe is spayed, micro-chipped, and up to date on all vaccinations. I have complete medical records for her.\n\nShe is crate-trained, walks really well on a leash, and has recently been trained using a muzzle for small periods of time (on walks, when other dogs are around, etc\n\n***Please consider the following before application: not good with other dogs, must be re-homed in a home without other pets or small children.",

            "description": "Following is a list of our sanctuary dogs with brief descriptions. We try to evaluate each new rescue carefully in regard to temperament and the reality is that sometimes we get a dog that displays behaviors we can manage here at the rescue but that we are not comfortable placing with most or any adopters. These behaviors usually involve their guardian breed characteristics and a lack of proper socialization and experiences when younger but can also just be their genetic personality and temperament. Being in a more rural and controlled situation here at the rescue, rather than in a busy and /or neighborhood environment, we can insure a consistent routine and monitor everyone closely. \nWe work to insure all the sanctuary dogs have the best quality life possible. They have heated and air conditioned large inside kennels with Kuranda beds, outside runs and a 4 acre yard to play in, patrol and guard. We also integrate inside the house time into their routines as space and personalities permit but they still require their kennel space part of the time and in certain situations. The dogs are matched up in compatible play pairs or groups based on their personality so they have friends to play and patrol the yard with. All of our sanctuary rescues are fully vetted and kept up to date on any and all needed vet care as well as groomed regularly and worked with on training and manners. And very importantly, they are much loved, flaws and all. Please consider helping to sponsor the care of one of our sanctuary rescues. Contributions toward the care of the dogs at the rescue are helpful and greatly appreciated as well as tax deductible. \n\nMax .... 10+ years old, has been a resident since 2012. Max reacts aggressively toward strangers and although he has mellowed out in his senior years with some visitors to the rescue, he is unpredictable about what sets him off with others. Max has been and is being sponsored by GPRCI supporters Chris and Dana. Chris is a long time volunteer who Max knows and trusts. He enjoys very much when Chris visits. Thank you Chris and Dana.\n\nNakoma.....8 year old female Pyrenees mix has pretty severe stranger fear aggression. With repeated visits Nakoma gets comfortable with new people who are confident with her and brave enough to ignore her during intros, as our volunteers have proven, but she barks and snarls aggressively at new people when approached on her home turf quite sure they are up to no good. Nakoma is one who gets a good bit of inside time as she is a perfectly behaved couch potato most of the time but requires her kennel space when anyone she doesn't know is on or coming on property.  \n\n\nSadie.....3 year old Pyrenees Komondor mix. Sadie was not socialized well when younger.  Her lack of socialization has resulted in Sadie being untrusting and somewhat unpredictable with strangers, especially on home turf and with her strong guardian genetics. We changed Sadie's status from adoptable to sanctuary after she started exhibiting escalating territorial aggressive behavior toward strangers/visitors.  \n\nBentley...6 year old male with confinement and separation issues with us since mid 2017. Bentley requires our heaviest fortress of a kennel when he cannot be outside or supervised closely inside. Not much holds this guy in or keeps him out of things if he puts his mind to it. He is smart and very single minded. It took a long time when he arrived but he has adjusted well now, feels at home and secure, and no longer needs the heavy anti-anxiety meds he arrived with.",

He is on three medications that keep him comfortable. He will need to be on these medications for life with the likelihood of an additional medication being added as his heart disease progresses. One of the medications causes him to urinate a great deal so he must wear a diaper to keep him from having accidents in the house. We are not sure how well Amos sees or hears and he is a bit arthritic. Despite his infirmities, he is a happy boy. He enjoys sitting with his foster mom, food and treats, and hanging out with the other dogs in his foster home.",

            "description": "My name is BAKO and I'm a handsome 10 yr young  M Blue Amstaff/Pitbull Terrier. I'm 66 lbs of PURE GREEK GOD! I was surrendered by my owner due to MOVING OVERSEAS. I was sad to see my owner move and leave me behind,  but he was worried because I'm a senior that the flight would be too stressful for me as I've never been crated/contained.. but it's ok.. I'm glad to have stayed here as I'm ready to move forward to a new life adventure with new hoomans! I'm a very sweet, easy going, fun loving, happy go lucky guy. I like everyone I meet but I haven't met alot of dogs ,  so I'm a little socially ackward with other dogs. When I see them on my walks I get very excited to greet them and can be a little pushy but I've never gotten snarky or snappy.. so I could use some help in the dog socialization dept. I just need to hang out with more dogs so I can get used to them. I used to live with a cat so I'm fine with cats. I'm fine with young kids in passing but have never lived with any kids so I think older kids ages 7 yrs+ would be best. I'm in great shape/health for a senior and people can't believe my age because I'm lively, have medium energy and love to go for walks.  My back legs can be a little cranky so it's best if I don't have to walk up too many stairs and a home in the suburbs with a yard would be ideal/best... but an apt with an elevator would be fine too. I'm SUCH AN EASY GOING SPECIAL guy and a TOTAL LOVE BUG!!  I like to snuggle next to you on the couch or bed and I'm always up for a game of fetch inside or out! I'm JUST THE BEST!!! and an AMBASSADOR for MY BREED.  I'm looking for that wonderful person/couple/family who will LOVE & APPRECIATE me for the rest of my golden years!! If that's you.. pls come meet me today!\n\nFor more info/application - PLS EMAIL: INFO@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG",

He'd love a family where he is the only dog, so that he gets all of the attention and exercise he needs to develop into an amazing dog. Do you like to play? So does Luke! Take him for a ride and play all day with him. Better yet, put him in agility to help drain some of that energy. He already loves that!\n\nLuke is a true cuddle-bug. He loves his toys too, but don't invest a lot of money in certain toys because one of Luke's favorite games is to see how fast he can destroy his toys. This boy is obedient and has good manners with food. However, he needs some work on the leash. Please apply to meet Luke.\n\n**Please Note: This is a courtesy post for another rescue; different adoption fees/policy apply.\n\n>>>\n\nFor more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\nIf you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page\n\nat www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals\n\nfor more photos and details.",

            "description": "Hi!  Do you live within 4 hours of Kansas City and are you looking for a handsome pup like me? My name is Lloyd and I'm almost 3 years old. As you can see from my photos, I'm a really happy guy. I have lots of energy and like to run around my fenced yard. But I also enjoy relaxing with my foster family. I love to cuddle and to give kisses! I also like to go on short walks once I'm familiar with the neighborhood and with my people. I'm pretty shy when I meet someone new. You see, I grew up in a puppy mill and then lived on a farm for a while where I didn't get much socialization. I also have an eye issue that I was born with that makes it hard for me to see well in really bright light, but I don't let that slow me down. I have a pretty great foster home and I love playing with the other dogs here. Sometimes I even get to go to doggy day care, where I'm a good boy. I have not met any cats yet so I don't know what I'd be like with them. What I want more than anything is to have my very own forever home. I've been waiting so patiently!  Are you the right one?  I'd love to have a house with a fenced yard to play in - and maybe another nice dog or two. Older kids would be fine, if they're gentle and nice, but really little ones might be too scary for me. I'm currently being fostered in the Kansas City area. If you live in the midwest and are interested in a happy, snuggly, shy boy like me, visit www.savingshibas.com/adopt to start the process of becoming approved to adopt from SIRA.",

Annie needs an adopter who will be very patient with her, and understand that it may take awhile for her to warm up and settle into her new home. Annie had anxiety issues when she first came into foster care at Humane Tomorrow.  Her anxiety is being successfully treated with medication, so adopters need to be willing to continue her medication for the forseeable future. The cost of the meds is about $20 per month. Annie is worth the little bit of extra effort!  \nAnnie is very smart, and needs physical and mental stimulation. Once Annie settles in, she is a very happy dog.  She smiles and wiggles with delight when she is with her people.  Nothing is more important to her than pleasing her people, so she will be easy to train with positive reinforcement methods.  Annie prefers people companions to other dog companions, so she needs to be an only dog. \nAnnie is crate trained, housebroken, and so deserving of a forever home! Please submit your application to adopt Annie at www.humanetomorrow.org.",

Visit our FAQ webpage for commonly asked questions about our adoption/foster process.\nPicasso is a very sweet, loving boy that loves to cuddle With his people. He also likes to spend time outside. He does not like other dogs so he is very reactive on the leash. He needs a home with no other pets and no kids. Picasso is a shy boy when it comes to new visitors so he will need a quiet home with very little traffic. He is crate trained, up to date on shots, neutered and house trained. Picasso will not be a good fit for an apartment, townhouse or condo. If you are interested in meeting or adopting Picasso please fill out an online application. Questions to cbrookszy@yahoo.com.Last Day Dog Rescue now microchips all animals before adoption. Microchips are implanted between the animals shoulder blades and are a permanent form of identification. The microchips are registered to Last Day Dog Rescue with the adopter's info added once adopted. If the animal is ever lost and slips his/her collar/tags the microchip allows the finder to know who to contact if scanned for a microchip. Animals MUST still have a collar with tags on at all times. Per our contract, we take all our animals back if for any reason you can't keep your adopted animal.\n\nPlease understand the statements about this animal are based upon the foster home's evaluation of the animal. The animal might behave differently (negatively or positively) in your home. While the animal might be good with the current foster's dogs, cats, children, etc., it may not be with your animal(s) or children. The animal may be housebroken or litter trained in the home of the foster but may relapse in your home. The animal is represented to the public as it performs in the foster home and any statements made regarding the animal are conditional to that foster home setting. Please understand that statements made regarding this animal are simply overviews and are not guaranteed.\n\nThe Petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our animals. Visual breed identification in animals is unreliable so for most of the animals we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each animal as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our animals based on personality, not by breed label.\n\nThank you for looking through our list of animals needing forever homes and choosing rescue first. We appreciate you stopping by.",

I know it may seem like I have a lot of energy, but I am also a big cuddle bug! I love scratches behind my ears, tennis balls, stuffies, and treats of any kind! My hearing isn't what it used to be so sometimes I do get startled a little easy. If you just give me pets and talk to me, I know you are safe! I love going for walks, sniffing everything outdoors, and of course, playing(and destroying) in my ball pit! I am so loved at the barn but I would love to have a family of my own! I will reward you with tons of laughs, lots of love, and will be a sweet spunky companion for any family! I do have one request, which is to have my new family all to myself. I just want all your love and attention! I really am the best girl and just want the chance to prove it to you!",

            "description": "CHERUB is a 4 year old Terrier reported as a stray on 1/13/20, possibly dumped, running up and down the road, seemingly confused. When this guy came in, he had a growth on his left bottom eyelid, which was removed during his neuter surgery. Normally, each resident is photographed for media once, but between having his eye cared for and having a less than stellar first round of pictures, thought it'd be good to retake and what a difference it made! Cherub's first impression wasn't the best and one can tell by his photos - the one where his tail is tucked is on 1/17 and the other standing is from 2/7. At his 1/17 session, he pulled something awful on the lead, then in the open clammed up with insecurity, would not sit, was unresponsive to treats and toys and seemed oblivious to the handler and photographer. Flash forward to 2/7 and Cherub was more relaxed, walked heaps better, was more congenial and even sat for treats, albeit he could use some work on patience. Can't help but think that having his eye growth removed and having some time to decompress made a world of difference. Cherub's adoption fee is $150 and helps cover his neuter, worming, vaccinations, microchip, monthly heart worm, flea and tick preventive and care while at CCHS.",

            "description": "This sweet girl is Gladys. Gladys was found hanging out with one of our other rescue dogs when he got loose from his foster family. We soon found out that she has been a stray for several months in a neighborhood and had a litter of pups under someone's storage building. The pups had went to homes but no one could catch mom. With the help of a professional dog recovery team we were able to trap Gladys and have been teaching her about being a house dog. She is a very sweet girl and has never once shown an ounce of aggression. She has no self confidence at all and cowers when you talk to her, pet her, or try to take pictures. However, when she is outside in a secure fence playing with the other dogs her head is held high, she is wagging her tail, and she is playing playing playing. She loves other dogs and has to be in a home with another dog. She is not great on a leash but we are working on that. She is house trained and crate trained. We do require that she go to a home with a privacy fenced yard that is very secure or someone who will let us help them secure their fence. And her new home has to have another confident happy dog to play with her. She is estimated to be about 2 years old and 35 lbs. We have had her spayed, vaccinated and microchipped. \nEmail crystal@hartmanshaven.org\nPlease do not inquire unless you have a secure privacy fence and at least 1 other dog. She cannot be adopted to anyone in an apartment complex.",

He came to us from animal control very sick. He got better and within a few days escaped his foster family's fence. It took us 7 months to finally capture him and has taken a few months to get him domesticated again. Joey LOVES other dogs and would do best with at least 1 other dog in the home. We will require that he go to someone with a very secure privacy fence. He is currently in a foster home with a 6 foot fence privacy fence and electric wire that stops him from digging out and we have had no issues. He does appear to be house trained and he is crate trained. He is not great on a leash and does not seem to be adapting to liking this. He will chew a leash into pieces and get loose. He does not like to be pet or cuddled and is still very scared of people. \nPlease do not inquire unless you have a secure privacy fence (wood or vinyl, no chain link, rail, or picket) and at least 1 other dog. He cannot be adopted to anyone in an apartment complex. \nContact crystal@hartmanshaven.org",

Me either, so let's get started!\n\nOK, here's today's question:    What do we call someone who puts their dog on a 3 year regimen of PROZAC, a pharmaceutical the use of which is known to cause .... AGGRESSION ... as a treatment for \"separation anxiety\"??    \n\nwhat?  Can you repeat your answer?  \"Idiot\"?    Well yes, obviously \"idiot\" is a good 5 letter word.  Moron also works.  We could go on but .... \n\nSo, I am Malakai, a Neapolitan Mastiff, born a little more than 5 years ago (11/2014) .. and I lost my home while on PROZAC for separation anxiety.  Sadly, yes, I bit my mommy's hubby.  Twice.  Mommy worked for a vet but was unaware that behavior modification could have been a real alternative to giving me a THREE YEAR RUN ON PROZAC.\n\nSo now my little system is finally PROZAC-free.  There has been no more aggression (of course, I haven't seen mommy or hubby since that second chomp) ... but I digress.  Yep, prozac-free and I'm a very affectionate, happy guy who is social with other dogs.   I also haven't destroyed the house.  BORING.  But Lisa says that's a good thing.\n\nObviously, my new mommy Lisa says I can't go to any home with kids.  Yeh, I get it those little guys would stress out Mother Theresa.\n\nI would love an owner who is home most of the time. I am very affectionate. I get along with other dogs.  I want to go home with an experienced Neo owner.\n\nNo experience with Neos?  Talk with Lisa.  Maybe we can train you.\n",

Poor little Moxie came in scared and with some skin issues and hair loss. However she is curious and friendly and will come around quickly. Moxie has developed a disk issue & has little use of her back legs. She uses a wheelchair. She has a $150.00 adoption fee plus the cost of 6 months of heartworm prevention.  \n\nNote: ARF reserves the right to deny any application that is deemed unsuitable for the animal. Please be aware that our animal adoptions are NOT on a first come- first serve basis. Our sole purpose is to find the best possible home for the animals that fall under our care. We do not ship our animals. All adopters are expected to come to Tulsa if approved.\n\nFor details on how to adopt please visit http://www.arftulsa.org/adopt",

Cowboy is a jolly,playful boy who enjoys walks (mostly to stop and eat or roll in the grass) and loves his toys, but is also super happy chillin' on the couch watching tv. He is looking for a home without other pets, but do not worry, he has enough love to fill a whole home!\nAfter tearing his cruciate, Cowboy was in a foster home, and since that time his termperment test has changed. Instead of being hyper or pushy when corrected, he wants to please his handler. He is also able to redirect himself sometimes when meeting lower energy dogs.  Way to go, Cowboy!\nWe look forward to adopting him to someone with breed experience who can continue to train him.\nCowboy yearns for someone to love and a permanent spot to call home.",

We believe Beau is between 5 and 6 years old and weighs about 85 pounds.\n\nWe ask for a $200 donation for all of our adult dogs. All of our adult dogs are neutered/spayed, microchipped, have had their Rabies, Parvo(5-way), and Bordetella vaccines.\n\nRescue Ranch is open from 12-4 seven days a week.

She is a little timid with the other dogs but is very interested in play and will play for short periods of time before returning to the people who she favors. This girl is still young so she has some energy and is still in the jumping up phase but with training, that's an easy fix. She would be a great addition to any family.\n\nThere is a $65 fee for adopting one of our male dogs/puppies or a $75 fee for adopting one of our female dogs/puppies. The fee helps cover the Spay/Neuter vouchers and the Rabies Vaccine voucher. Please look at our home page for more information about a adopting a new friend.",

I am your gal!Did you see my adorable face?\nI am a fun loving girl, who loves to crawl up on my mom's lap and cuddle. I play hard all day with my foster siblings.\nDid someone say water? How about mud? I figured out if I get dirty, mom gives me a bath! I love water and especially love it when mom scrubs me with great smelling bubbles and then rubs me dry with a big fluffy towel. I have had as many as 3 bathes in one day! I love water! Sometimes I sit in our empty puppy pool just begging mom to fill it up!\nI am an active dog and not suitable for an apartment, nor small children. I will need another dog in the house to keep me happy.\nMy litter mates and I were orphaned at two weeks old after our mother died. I love to play with my siblings and foster moms dogs! I would love to have an older sibling in my new home to play with and teach me how to be a well mannered pup! I should be around 30-45 pounds when full grown.\nSince I am a puppy, I will need a lot of patience and guidance, but if you choose to adopt me I promise to give you tons of love and be the best furever family member! I am working hard on potty training and my adoption fee includes four rounds of shots, rabies shots, neuter and microchip (at a regular vet all of these services would cost over $500!)\n\n=========================================================\n\nPlease contact app@aarfhouston.org for more information about this dog. You can apply online by clicking on Application .\nPuppies that are under 4 months old cannot be adopted outside of our Veterinary Service area. Please call for specific locations. Children under 8 years old often are not a good match for our puppies and dogs. In order to protect both, your child and our rescued dogs/puppies from harm, we seldom if ever adopt to families with young children.\nOnce your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events. Thank you for considering a rescue! The adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you.",

She loves treat puzzles and learning new tricks, she's already learned sit, lay, and rollover! A meet and greet with any companion dogs will need to happen prior to adoption. No kitties please.\nWe require that you have a fenced in yard, not a \"kennel\" in the yard AND we do not approve underground fencing. Depending upon the dog some exceptions are made for those who live in apartments. We also require that the adoptee will be a part of the family \"living\" within the home. Our adoption process may be found on our website at www.bitofheaven.org\n\nVisits are scheduled by appointment only via emailing request to ownedbycaninesandlovit@yahoo.com",

Do you respect those \"Do Not Open Until December 25th\" gift tags? If so, you might just be the kind of person Maggie needs! This girl needs a patient human who is okay \"waiting for the present\" - which in her case, the present is endless snuggles and kisses.\n\nMaggie takes time to warm up to new people, but once she does, she is the sweetest pup. She needs a dedicated human who will use positive reinforcement training to continue teaching her \"how to dog.\" She is a 60lb, 2 1/2 year old pit mix who is muzzle trained and knows sit, down, touch, drop it, and go to your mat. She loves routine and will even put herself to bed at night. \n\nMaggies Forever Family Wish List:\n Family willing to continue training\n Adult only home \n Privacy fence (no invisible fence, no chanin link fence, at least 6ft tall)\n Family who is home frequently with few visitors\n Confident, laid back resident dog (or no other dogs if family is home more often than not)\n Single family home (no apartments)\n Dog handling experience \n\nIf this describes you & you're ready for a new best friend, apply for Maggie at RESCUEDohio.org. Maggie's adoption fee is $300.",

A bit of a lone wolf but not afraid to show you some love, this big girl will make a great companion for an active home ready to help her lead a happy life! Mallory is certainly an energetic dog. Great for walks, jogs, or even runs if the weather is right, she wants nothing more than to play the day away! Mallory can be leash reactive so playtime with other dogs won't always be right for her, but that just means she's got more energy for time with you. Even at home, Mallory can find ways to play the days away, choosing to get in contests of strength with new visitors and her rope toy. But she also knows to read the room and lower that energy down a bit when needed. And you never need to question just how much she loves you when she tries to cuddle! Even though Mallory is a big girl she wants to make sure her WHOLE body is touching you to show how much she cares. Be careful if you let her on your bed - she can be a bit of a bed hog and spread across before you know it! Mallory would like to be the only pup in your life, as she can be a bit of a loner when she wants. But this sweet girl has plenty of love to go around and gets along swimmingly with strangers that are willing to show her a little playful attention! And she's sure to be the best companion possible for you. Are you ready to enrich her life and grow a powerful new lifetime bond? Come see Mallory today!",

I know you see me every day in the morning videos and I am always so happy to see my friends, but what I really want more than anything is a family of my own. Before I came to live at the barn, life was not kind to me. I would like to be able to meet my new family a couple times and hang out so i know that you are safe and won't hurt me. I promise if you give me time and patience I will reward you with so much love! I love treats and know how to sit and shake! I am such a smart boy! I take my treats so gentle too! I am a favorite here at the barn but what I want more than anything is to lay on the couch and watch tv with my family! I do have a few limitations as I would like to have a family all to myself where I would be the only pet. Will you be my hero?",

I would do best in an adult only home where I could meet people slowly over time as I am fearful of new people, as well as a home with only male dogs in it (if any, what can I say? I'm picky). I could definitely benefit from basic obedience training, but my shelter buddy is doing a great job teaching me how to walk nicely on a leash and do common behaviors. As is the case with most terriers, I am a chewer of toys so I need the hard core, tough toys to enjoy! During the summer months, I love playing in the hose! My friends here at the shelter say I am so clever because any enrichment puzzles given to me I figure out in no time! Please come see me today!",

            "description": "Eva is a sweet shepherd/heeler mix and is approximately 2 years old.  Her mom was Priscilla who we had in our care with her last litter.  Eva is from Priscilla\u2019s last litter born on the reservation before we rescued Priscilla.  When Eva was almost a year she became pregnant and was brought into our care.  She was very scared coming into foster care and (just like her mom) escaped her foster home within the first few days.  She was on the run for 7 days and finally we were able to bring her back into our care.  She has learned to love her foster mom and hasn\u2019t tried to escape since.  She just needed time to realize how safe and loved she was.  She is still unsure of new people and has really been more protective of her home.  It will take her time to adjust to a new home and humans. She\u2019d probably do best in a home that doesn\u2019t have a lot of visitors.  When new people make her nervous and move, she might nip at them.  She\u2019ll need a VERY patient home that is willing to work on gaining her trust. She does best when you get low and let her smell you and have treats. \n\nShe loves to play with the other fosters.  She does play a lot with her mouth and mouths the others and her foster mom when she plays. She is a BIG puppy that doesn\u2019t always realize her size and strength when playing.  Car rides have been scary for her and she would benefit from more fun car rides where she goes somewhere fun.  She is NOT a fan of crates in a car, but will go in a wire crate at home if she has to (she prefers not to be in crates and will try to get out). \n\nShe began showing similar signs as her mother did with having a cancerous tumor.  She was diagnosed with a venereal tumor (same as her mom Priscilla) the end of March 2020.  She had surgery to remove the tumor and went through 4 rounds of chemo and all looks good.  She recovered well and the vet visits did help her with getting into the car but she still usually throws up on car rides. \n\nShe would really benefit from patient, consistent training and is very treat motivated. She will need a tall, secure fence as well. She seems to love to sleep under her foster\u2019s mom bed, on the couch or on a dog bed.  A harness would be best when working on leash training.  She is potty trained by way of a doggy door.  She is a happy girl and would LOVE to have a buddy to play with.  She\u2019d do best in a home without small kids since she does play a little rough and doesn\u2019t know her own size.  She also chases and stresses out the cats in her foster home so we'd recommend a home without cats.\n\nWith time, patience and love she'll become a great companion for her human.\n\nHer adoption fee is $100.00.  She is spayed and is up to date on vaccinations including rabies.  She will require a tall secure above ground fenced yard.  We require that our dogs be allowed in their family home and be allowed to sleep inside at night.  An adoption contract is completed and signed at the time of adoption.  \n\nTo inquire about adopting this dog or to find out more about her, please contact her foster Mom Stacee at ringo406@hotmail.com.",

Nitro is currently being boarded with trainers to learn some commands and behavior fit for a very handsome and lovable boy.\n\nHere is what his trainer has to say: Nitro has shown great progress, but still requires a lot of attention. He is very selective around other dogs. He like to play when he want to play, but until then he will keep his distance from other dogs. He will do great with a confident owner and would love to show his affection in return.\nHe's getting better around other dogs, but still selective on his pack. He needs a confident owner and consistent training. Do not recommend for first time husky owner or around kids.\n\n2/2/21 11:48 AM",

            "description": "Kammie is a shy 8 year old lab mix. \n\n(Kammie is not yet ready for adoption, she needs to gain her confidence in foster care) \n\nKammie was found homeless with her 3 babies. All of Kammie's other pups did not survive the conditions they were in prior to arriving at the shelter. Poor Kammie has lost so much already, it's time she gains something. A home and loving family can help start making up for that. Because she has had so much trauma, this girl is timid, but has not shown any aggression when she is approached. She even gets along well with other dogs! Kammie is an older dog, so we want her last years to be filled with happiness. She should not leave this world having only known loss.\n\nFrom her foster: She is so gentle and sweet. It definitely takes her a bit to get comfortable, but it makes the tail wags even more special when you get them! Kammie took a few days to get potty trained, but they all do as you know. She hasn't had an accident inside since the third day we had her. She has been great with the puppy and my dog, but she doesn't seem to like my cats. She growls and barks when she sees them and they're shy so they stay in our bedroom most of the time. We gave her a bath a few days after they settled in and she did really well! She's slow to walk on a leash, but she has improved so much in just one week. She takes treats very gently and doesn't make a peep when I put her in her kennel at night and when we're leaving for work. \n\nShe is such a gentle girl who just needs some TLC to know what love is- she deserves it!! She's not super active, but I've seen glimpses of her get excited with my dog and want to play a little. It breaks my heart to think of all the years of hard living she's endured and I know she will be a great addition to a family willing to show her how great life as a dog can be! \n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/onmQPEXxHAQ\n\nIf you are interested in these pups, please submit an application through our website aaanimalrescue.org. Please feel free to email with any questions allaboardanimalrescue@gmail.com.\n\n\nBreed and size disclosure: As a rescue all of our dogs come to us from high-kill shelters or other rescues, so we do not get a lot of background or information on these dogs. We occasionally receive the mother with the puppies, but in most cases both parents are unknown. Because of this we do not know the full breeding of the dogs. We are required to list the dogs based on the breeds provided to us on their records, but they are all mixed breeds as far as we know, and we cannot guarantee the actual breeds of any of these dogs. Since the full breeding of the dogs is unknown we can also only give you an educated guess on the full-grown size of the dogs. All of the current information we have on the dogs is listed in their bio above. More information may be available at our adoption event, since a lot of the fosters turn in report cards on how the dog has done in their care when they drop them off. \n\nAdoption Process: If you are interested in adopting from us, the first step of our adoption process is to fill out an application online at http://aaanimalrescue.org/adoption_app.html. It takes us 24-48 hours to process your application and get back to you, via email. Applications turned in Friday afternoon or Saturday morning will not be processed since we are preparing for or at our adoption event. We do have applications on site at our events, but are not always able to approve them at that time and many of the dogs will already have holds on them, so we suggest you fill out an application prior to attending an adoption event. We can place a hold on one dog per approved applicant after a deposit fee has been received, please do not ask to hold a dog if you have not turned in an application and been approved, for the first hour of our adoption event, so that they can get the first chance to meet and hopefully adopt that dog. After the first hour of the event all dogs are available on a first come, first serve basis. If you already have an approved application on file, there will just be more paperwork and the adoption fee at the event, but you will be able to take home the dog/puppy that day. Since we are foster based and do not have a location, our dogs are only available to meet at our events, unless otherwise noted.",

BLOO - A#39131485Bloo's Instagram: @bloos__cloosDog meets:Shey, Bloo, George and Logan: https://youtu.be/tn17LIck-w8Bloo, George and Logan: https://youtu.be/b-E1ogf3zQIBloo and Logan: https://youtu.be/7cbFeP6IwNMPersonality: Hi, I'm Bloo! I'm an 8 year old pittie mix with a bottomless supply of kisses and cuddles to share with anyone willing to love me back. I am a very good girl with a LOT of energy. I love to run and play, but I also love to curl up next to my human for naps. My foster mom says I have the cutest snores ever. My favorite activities are playing tug with rope toys (not to brag, but I'm a tug champion), running, looking at my beautiful reflection, and napping. Not to brag, but I know sit, wait, down, paw, and off, and I'm crate trained. A lot of thing outside make me anxious (other dogs, bicycles, kids, kids on bicycles.... the world is a scary place!) so my leash manners aren't the best yet. I'm currently in finishing school with my foster mom and her vet school friends though, and we are working on leash training and recall so that I can be a proper lady in my fur-ever home! I am also being muzzle trained so that I can have fear free vet visits. I REALLY want to be the goodest girl, I just need someone to teach me how. In my new foster home, I'm picking up these new skills so fast - I bet I'll be the BEST dog ever in no time! I have lived with a cat before, but otherwise I would like to be the only animal in the house. I am also not great with kids, but older teenagers are OK. You can also follow me on Instagram at @bloos__cloos! Intake Reason: Return Adoption - \"Too Much Responsibility\" 2/10Return Adoption 1/5/20 Owner surrender 7/27/18Weight: 64 poundsMedical Observations: (4/16) Per Vet Check- Patient is BAR with no URI signs at time of examBehavioral Observations:(3/26/20) Dog-on-dog Incident: Bloo was unleashed in a large, fenced yard. Another dog entered the yard on leash. Bloo did not immediately notice the other dog. When she did, she ran towards the dog and proceeded to attack the dog unprovoked. The other dog's owner attempted to intercept Bloo by stepping between her and the other dog, but she circled around and clamped on the dog's tricep, biting it to the bone. The dogs were quickly separated and the other dog was taken to emergency care. Bloo did not harm any humans while being separated. (3/1/20) Male Volunteer- She was easily leashed, went out through kennels smoothly and once in the large run was mostly not interested in the two men and one woman in the run with us. Eventually she would go say hi, and allow pets. The potential adopter then held the leash and walked around the yard with her. She took treats from me and the other men gently. No major concerns aside from some pulling as people and dogs could be seen through the fence. It was a good meet overall. She went back in just as easily and allowed me to unleash without a problem. (2/10/20) New Adoptive Owner--active, affectionate, hyperactive, playful, good with women. The dog is overall fine with the children, but has snapped about 2 times at the owner's 14 year old daughter. She did not ever make contact or try to actually bite, just hard barks. (Ages 14, 16, and 17). She is also Crate Trained and was said to be good in her crate(1/5/20) Adoptive Owner-- active, affectionate, hyperactive, playful, good with women, the dog is overall fine with the children, but has snapped about 2 times at the owner's 14 year old daughter. She did not ever make contact or try to actually bite, just hard barks. Lived with children ages 14, 16, and 17.

I have cerebellar hypoplasia (CH) that causes me to be wobbley, but that doesn\u2019t stop me from being a big goofball! My condition doesn\u2019t require medication and I am a very healthy boy! I have been looking for my forever home since I was a puppy, and really need someone to just give me a chance! I love my foster family, and I know they wish they could keep me forever but unfortunately they can\u2019t. I am potty trained and love my crate! I love going for walks, but I need to stay close to my owners to keep them safe! The world can be pretty scary, so I do my best to protect my home from strangers. I really don\u2019t care too much for strangers, and would prefer a nice quiet room when you have company. \n\nBecause dogs in a previous home weren\u2019t so kind to me, I really would prefer to be the only animal in your life.  But don\u2019t worry, I have so much love to give you won\u2019t need anyone else! \n\nI am truly one of a kind, and I know we could be the best of friends. Please give me a chance to show you. \n\n\nWeebles adoption fee has been sponsored by one of our supporters. He is neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, current on flea and heartworm prevention, and very healthy! \n\nTo adopt or learn more about me, apply today at farfetcheddogrescue.org",

He is crate-trained (hates it though), reasonably house-trained, and fairly good on leash. He will require lots of training, obedience classes, possibly a job (agility, flyball, frisbee), and stimulation, attention/activity. Would do best in a family where someone is stays at home.most, or all, of the day. \n\nThe adoption donation is $350, and includes a general vet exam, neuter surgery, heartworm testing and/or treatment (as necessary), shots, microchip, and worming. Experienced dog ownership and credible vet references are required in order to adopt from HER.\n\nInterested in Casper?

Rocket is one of AACs playgroup rockstars, and is currently paired up with another dog in his shelter space! He would love to have other dogs at home to play with. He is good at matching other dogs energy and has taught himself some really good play manners! Rocket is a smart, playful boy! He loves to play tug and fetch. He knows sit, down, shake and is always ready to learn more (as long as you keep some treats handy!). He is still learning how to share his things, and would love to keep working on it with you! Rocket is a dog who has a few specific training needs. What does that mean? Well, in addition to being adorable and fun, it also means that hes exhibited some behaviors in the shelter that require some extra training. Lucky for him, he has a whole crew of staff and volunteers dedicated to working with him to address them. Hooray! As the adopter of a dog with specific training needs (thats Rocket!), the Austin Animal Center will provide you with some extra resources just for choosing him to be a part of your family. How awesome is that?! This includes a training voucher and post-adoption support from our Behavior Team. The behavior team will be happy to answer any questions you have about your new family member and provide support when needed. Rocket would love to find an active family with no littles that he can have adventures and endless cuddles with! Are you ready to blast off with Rocket? I weigh approximately 61 lbs.

            "description": "If you are seeing this dog, she is AVAILABLE. We hide them from view once adopted. \n\nMeet Cookie! She is a gorgeous beagle that's estimated DOB is 4/10/17. Cookie is currently in one of our amazing foster homes and her foster mom can't say enough wonderful things about her. Cookie is an absolute joy that lights up a room with her sweet and loving disposition. This girl loves people and loves to be close to you. Her favorite thing in the world is a belly rub and she will never hesitate to roll over on her back and invite you to rub her belly. This sweet girl also loves to snuggle up on the couch with you. She loves to go for walks and loves to play ball. Cookie is dog and cat friendly. Oh and did we mention that she's house broken and leash trained? This girl is the whole package deal! She's just waiting for someone to choose her and give her the forever home she's always deserved. \n\nCookie has seizures that are controlled with medication. She takes her meds like a champ!\n\nThis dog is heartworm positive. We have started them on the \"slow-kill\" method of heartworm treatment, but we advise adopters to work with their vets to determine a plan of action. Their adopter will continue treatment once adopted, and arrange a treatment plan with their vet. Dogs with heartworms lead long, happy lives post-treatment! Cookie has seizures that are controlled with medication. \n\nThere is no set adoption fee for this dog. In lieu of an adoption fee we are asking for a donation to our shelter to help us care for these babies and keep them safe. We do not receive any funding so any donation is greatly appreciated.\n\nWe can offer transport for in-state adopters that cannot make the trip to the shelter.There is a flat transport fee of $50 to have this dog brought to you. (This does not apply to meet-and-greets, which must be done at the shelter by appointment only). \n\nADOPTION FEE AND HEALTH INFORMATION \nUpon adoption, she will have received: age appropriate vaccines (2 DHPP vaccine), (Bordetella vaccine), (Rabies vaccine if 12 weeks and older), up to date on flea/tick prevention and heartworm prevention, spay or neuter of pet, bi-weekly worming, microchip, fostering costs, and health certificate. \n\nYou must fill out an application to adopt! The application is below. Please copy and paste it into your browser. \n\nhttps://goo.gl/forms/YKPbHaym6keQA6772 \n\nAPPLY \nIsn't she sweet? Wondering what's next? You MUST fill out an application to adopt. Please copy and paste the Google form URL below: \n\nhttps://goo.gl/forms/YKPbHaym6keQA6772 \n\nOnce you have submitted an application, we do our best to work efficiently to process them. \n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS \nQ: Where is she located? \nA: She is currently at our shelter in Arkansas. She can only be adopted locally due to her positive heart worm status. \n\nQ: It feels scary adopting without meeting the pup first. What if he isn't the right fit for our home? \nA: We know it can feel scary and that's why we offer a FULL refund of your adoption fee within the first two weeks if for some reason it's not the right fit. We want our adopters to feel confident and we want the best situation for our pups. If in that 2 weeks you feel it is not working out, we can rehome the dog and refund your adoption fee. All we ask is that you foster the dog until we find them a new home! \n\nQ: I have more questions!! Who do I contact? \nA: Please e-mail adopt@humanesocietyofthedelta.org directly. We DO NOT answer adoption questions or inquiries on any other platform. \n\nQ: I am under 21, will you adopt to me? \nA: Unfortunately, we do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21. \n\nQ: I would like to surprise my family with a dog! Can I do this? \nA: Unfortunately, no. If there is more than one decision-maker in the home, all of them should be in agreement. \n\nThank you for your understanding and consideration and for helping the dogs and puppies in need!",

These little pups are practicing eating in this chair. Once they\u2019re done eating, they sit in the chair for 30 mins to allow the food to digest. This is new to them and they need a little training, but we\u2019re working on it!\n\nBread is full of energy, Butter is shy. They both want a family to love them! If you have any questions or would like more information, please fill out an application and you will be contacted by a TriCounty Dog Rescue Volunteer.\n\nThey are available Individually.  :)",

If you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please fill out an adoption application on our website www.helpingshepherdsofeverycolor.com You may also find us on facebook: Helping Shepherds of Every Color Rescue.\n\n2/9/2020 Taz (was Zing) is being returned to the rescue due to some personal issues with his family.\n\nTaz is very Energetic and loves to run. He loves to go to the dog park and play with other dogs but for his home life it's best if he's an only dog. He's a little food aggressive with other animals not with people at all. He's not ok with little kids. He might be good with older kids, like around 8 and up though. He is also cautious when meeting new people but once he knows them he's great. He loves sleeping on the sofa and getting belly rubs. He's not big on toys but every once in awhile he'll find one that he loves. He is also very nervous about getting his nails trimmed. Less is definitely more with him. I would not try to Restrain him, if you do then he'll need a muzzle on. He does also have a little bit of anxiety and hates to be tied up. He does love his crate though, it's like \"his\" place if that makes sense.\n\n6/29/2020: Taz is NOT good with cats or other small animals. He is settling in to his new foster home. He gets along with some dogs better than others. He needs time to warm up to new people but he is very loving when he is comfortable.\n\n2/2/21 10:16 AM",

After tragically losing her owner while she was away on vacation, her whole world got turned upside down. She will require an adopter who is willing to continue to nurture her gentle demeanor and trust in people. \n\nThis two-year-old, 55 lb. lab mix is as sweet as can be. Camille loves to cuddle, play, go for walks, and give kisses. She can\u2019t wait to show you all the commands and training tricks she knows - she's a smart cookie! She is even house and leash trained - she's a great pup and just needs someone to give her a chance! \n\nCamille would do best with an experienced, adult only family as the only dog (cats potentially ok). Apartments are not recommended and a calm home would be best. If you would like to adopt or meet this sweet girl, please send an application to dogs@daws.org.\n\nKindly sponsored by Gail Von Dwingelo  (8/25)\nKindly sponsored by Kathy Genett  (9/18)",

I love being outside running and playing ball and chasing my Pointer siblings. I really love keeping my eye to the sky looking for birds! I love birds! I am a little shy and startle easily but once I get settled I love to lay on the couch for some ear rubs but then it's back outside to play! I am perfect in my crate and walk well on a leash. I may take longer than most to get adjusted in my furever home but my foster mom says three months was magical for me. I have learned some basic hand signals so I know what foster mom wants me to do! I would love to find a family with lots of love and patience to call my own.\n\nRebel enjoys playing with bigger children. He needs a secure fence in any potential furever home. \n\nWant to learn more about one of the dogs we have up for adoption? Fill out our adoption application!!  (http://www.pointerrescue.org/adopt.html)\n\nTRANSPORT AVAILABLE TO APPROVED HOMES! (currently within 600 miles)",

            "description": "Bowie is a goofy, beautiful boy with the most interesting grayish, brownish coat. He looks one color inside and another color out in the sun! \n\nBowie was picked up as a stray by the local police department in our town and since we have no animal control officers or city shelters in our neck of the woods, he sat for weeks in a cage in a shed. He was very timid and many of the officers were afraid of him because he would growl when they approached. They called us to do a behavior assessment and upon walking in with a can of vienna sausage, we found that Bowie did not have a mean bone in his body, he was merely scared. We recommended a home with no cats and no small children and unfortunately the officers allowed a private citizen to take him in for a short time before re-homing him via a free to good home ad in the classifieds. The home that responded to the free ad had him less than 24 hours because he chewed through their bathroom door, and sadly, attacked and killed one of their cats. At that time, we intervened and Critters Inc. became Bowie's 4th home. \n\nIn the many months he has been with us, Bowie has enjoyed the company of 6 other dogs and he ADORES each and every one of them. He also co-exists with the more than 50 cats here awaiting adoption. Bowie was evaluated by a professional trainer and tested with dogs from 20 lbs and up and also with cats. This evaluation revealed that Bowie has an interrupt-able prey drive and on the occasion that he does focus on a cat, he can be redirected with a quick verbal correction. Bowie has been through A LOT in his life and we believe he is only 2-3 years old.\n\n Bowie's adopters will be thoroughly screened including a home visit, and a fenced yard is required. Bowie will do best in a home with other dogs to play with but he will not be placed into a home with cats, other small animals, or dogs under 30 lbs for any reason. We need to find a home where his needs are met and where we can be assured it will be his forever home. This guy has lots of kisses, snuggles, and play time to give and we hope everyone looks beyond the poor circumstances he was placed into in the past and helps him to find a bright future with a home of his very own.\n\nAll dogs have been dewormed, spayed/neutered, microchipped, Heartworm tested, and have age appropriate vaccinations including DA2PP and Rabies.",

I have a good off switch. For me, a great slow massage is the best way to spend the day. Owning a power breed brings special responsibilities. My staff will provide you with special adoption counseling. Consistent, positive training works well with my personality. Many in the general public fear power breeds, especially those that are not properly trained. I have the ability to become a fine ambassador for my breed. It will take teamwork to make that happen. You will need to get an all clear from your landlord as well as your homeowners or renters insurance company. You will find all the information you need in order to make a good decision when you are considering bringing me home. I have been micro-chipped.",

Chewy may be older but he is still up for an adventure. He loves going on walks or hikes and exploring his surroundings. He also enjoys napping and snuggling up with his hoomans. He does good in a crate but will need exercise! He loves going for runs and is a great car riding buddy! He is good with kids too! Chewy is food motivated and eager to please!

            "description": "Skye is a beautiful girl who came to us from a rural shelter. She was very shy, unhealthy, listless, and didn't much want to be around anyone at first. Since she has been with our rescue, Skye has been looking for that pot of gold at the end of her rainbow. She has learned to trust people again and she has been socialized by her foster mom to new situations, sights, and sounds. Skye has blossomed into a loving and playful girl that enjoys life. She lives for walks and fresh air and she is super gentle on a leash. Her new found joie de vivre has stolen the hearts of our fosters and staff; she will steal yours too. \n\nSkye is 5 years old and weighs 75 pounds. She is spayed, fully vaccinated, and being treated for heart worms.  She plays nicely with dogs that understand she's in charge. \n\nHere at NMAR, we don't just find good homes for our dogs, we find the the specific good home for each specific dog. While we work towards those matches, our dogs are safe and happy in foster homes, or in our home-like shelter, where they have the chance to learn some life skills and show us what they need to be happy and healthy.\n\nREQUIREMENTS: Skye needs a home where she's the only pet. Skye is not cat friendly. \n\nAdoption fee is $195 and includes: spay/neuter, parvo/distemper series of shots, rabies (if dog is old enough), bordatella, heartworm treatment while here, worming, and microchip.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting Sky, please visit our website and fill out an adoption application: NorthMeckAnimalRescue.org",

This little gem LOVES to be outside in the sun chasing squirrels and birds, or inside loving on her human and is GOOD WITH OTHER SMALL DOGS. She is curious and inquisitive, so a securely fenced in yard is a must, but don't blame a girl for being smart!   Her foster mom said that she sleeps in bed with them- so she is sure to be a snuggler that APPEARS TO BE HOUSE-TRAINED!\n\nShe is not a rambunctious lady, but is still playful so she would mesh well with a number of lifestyles as long as you give her just a little time to feel secure in her new surroundings. She is a LOVER!!! If interested in adopting Wakako, please fill out an application. Thank you!!\n\nest DOB:  1/15/15\ncurrent weight: 11 lbs\n\nWe answer all emails back within 48 hours. Please watch your spam folders as an application will be attached and this sometimes places it in there. \n\nHIS/HER adoption fee is $200 USD and that will pay for all his/her shots up to date, neutered/spayed, microchip and rabies.\n\nPlease e-mail MuttsAndMeows@Mail.com for an adoption application. \n\nThis dog is currently in the Houston Texas area.  Once the application is approved and adoption fee paid, transport will be arranged.\n\nBecause this adoption will be without meeting the dog first, we will need to try to be extra careful that everyone (including you) think this will be a good fit.  We will try to give you as much information about the dog as we can.  Unfortunately, many are fresh from the shelter and we don't know much about them yet. \n\nLike us on Facebook - search Mutts & Meows - and help even more pets find loving homes.",

Gabby happens to be deaf but that certainly doesn't slow her down. This spirit, feisty girl is queen of the zoomies and is all about getting up and about to explore and play. Gabby would benefit from an active but patient home that can help her learn a routine, exercise her mind and body, and continue to learn signs. She seems to be incredibly smart, and is a ready sponge for learning! Once she gets her yayas out, Gabby shows her sweet and affectionate side. And she has that spark of mischief to always keep you laughing. With her intelligence and athleticism, we think Gabby might thrive with sports or agility training. In the summer, she loves nothing more than dancing and spinning in the sprinkler! Gabby is around 1 or 2 years old. Gabby is currently living in a foster home. To set up a meet with her or find out more information, please contact her foster at david.ager@gmail.com!? 63 lbs.\nQuestions? Email: citydogs@city.cleveland.oh.us | Call: (216) 664-3476\n Visit: 9203 Detroit Avenue Cleveland, OH 44102\n\n Hours:\n 10 AM - 3 PM Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday\n 10 AM - 6 pm Tuesday & Thursday\n\nFee: $61 | Includes spay/neuter, shots, microchip, license, 30 days free pet insurance (when registered upon adoption)\n\n  The CITY DOGS mission is to increase adoptions from the City Kennel by changing the image of the pit bulls who make up the majority of the kennel population, by preparing all adoptable dogs in the kennel for lives in loving homes and by creating as many opportunities as possible for the public to meet and get to know our dogs for the terrific pets they are meant to be.  \n Our Adoption Process...\nHere's a little about how things work:\nAll of the CITY DOGS posted for adoption are available for direct adoption from the kennel, unless noted otherwise. Some dogs with special needs may require a rescue to pull. You can either stop in during our open hours to meet a dog, or set up a meet and greet with your dog, which allows us to get the dog out of his/her cage for some exercise before you arrive. To set up a meet and greet or to inquire about a dog\u2019s special needs, please email us at citydogs@city.cleveland.oh.us.\n\nAbout Our Dogs: All available dogs have gone through a behavioral and medical assessment. This assessment is a snapshot of who the dog is at that given time. We cannot make any guarantees with regard to behavior, temperament or health of any City Dog. Most of our dogs are picked up as strays, so we do not know what kind of home environment they were living in (i.e. with kids, other dogs or other cats), nor do we know if most of them are house trained. Everything we know about them is based on volunteer and staff observations. We do have some dogs in foster homes, where they will have more information about how the dog is in a home environment. It is very hard to tell with certainty whether or not a dog will be good with kids, cats or another dog. If you have kids in the home or another dog, we do require that they be present for a meet and greet with the dog you are considering for adoption.\nHeath/Vaccinations: Dogs that are adopted directly from the kennel need to go to your personal vet within two weeks of leaving the kennel. All dogs receive their DHPP, Rabies, Bordetella and Canine Influenza vaccines, thought you may be required to get follow up boosters. All dogs come microchipped and with a Cuyahoga County license. \n",

He has been wonderful on our walks together, and is so deserving of a home of his own after his long wait.\n\nRyan can go to a home with the right dog, but does need a kitty free home. He also needs a mature household with someone who will help him get comfortable with new people. He has made so much progress since his arrival at the shelter, and would be great for someone who would like to help him continue with his training. \n\nWe are partnering with the Longmont Humane Society to get the word out about this incredible guy. Please help spread the word!\n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior pets have a history of being kept up to date on vaccines, annual exams and recommended bloodwork. We also do home checks to make sure that your home environment meets the needs of the particular dog you are interested in.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adoption, please fill out our online adoption survey at http://olddogsnewdigs.com/form-adoption.html.\n",

This beautiful guy was adopted out by the Houston SPCA many years ago and lived happily with his family for most of those until he was given to friends about three years ago. That didn't turn out well and he was then picked up on the street looking much like a skeleton after some rough time as a stray. We can't speak as to what really happened to him, but we know it was completely undeserved and he is one of the best guys we have ever had in rescue. A finer fellow you'll never meet...just give him a minute to charm you! We promise you won't be disappointed.Gump's foster mom reports: As his foster mom, I can say that he is a wonderful calm dog. He gets excited over his meals, his walks and any wildlife he comes across (he caught a bird the other day; RIP)...he does not like cats...so, just a normal dachshund with no quirky traits!Mr. Gump is fully vetted and, like many older ladies or gentlemen, has certain meds he needs to enhance his senior step! Not too much to ask of this fine little man! He's ready for his FOREVER home! Could that lucky home be yours? If so, please submit an adoption application for this sweet fellow...you'll be oh so glad you did...",

            "description": "Buster is about 3 years old and about 55 pounds. He is a smart, sweet boy who loves to learn. He likes to explore, whether it's a toy, a yard, or the great outdoors. After an initial burst of energy, he is great on leash on quiet trails and parks, away from traffic. He likes to walk along, watching and sniffing everything.\n\nWe've seen Buster around a few other dogs. When another dog scares him, he tends to move away to avoid them. He's curious and interested in friendly dogs. We think Buster might do well with a laid-back, friendly, tolerant dog.\n\nBuster has had some scary experiences, but he thrives with reward-based training. He did great in training at South Austin Dog Center, and his trainers will continue to work with a foster or adopter. \n\nInterested in adopting or fostering? \n\nPlease fill out our Adoption application: https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/24333/generic\n\nOR:\n\nFoster application: https://petstablished.com/foster_form/24332/generic\n\nSomeone will reach out to you ASAP to get the approval process started.",

At 4 years old, he is just like a big goofy puppy, he is still learning his leash training manners. You can't help but smile when you see his happy excited face! He is 85 pounds of pure love, and is currently being fostered in a home with three other dogs half his size; the wiener dog tells him what to do!\n\nRescued from MDAS when he was incredibly ill, it took a little while for Rambo to overcome his pneumonia and get back on his adorable dober feet. He is now 100% healthy and he's ready for his Furever!\n\nFor more information on Rambo, or to set up a meet and greet, please call or text Ginny at 954-295-7536 between 7pm and 10pm. You can also fill out an application on our website at www.doberescue.net. \n\n*Please keep in mind that this is a volunteer run organization. Any calls/texts received before or after the designated times will be returned the following day.*",

I came from an abusive family and startle easily, so I need older, mature people who can take time to help me trust them and learn that their sudden movements and sudden loud noises aren\u2019t a threat to me. I have been in obedience classes and private behavior classes, but I don\u2019t like being around other animals, so I need to be the only dog in the house.\n\nMy hobbies include: snuggles, chasing bubbles, frogs, and grasshoppers, playing ball and tug of war, chewing on bones, and going for walks. And I LOVE to jump into the air to grab hold of a tug toy. I can be very silly, reacting cutely to animal noises on the tv or Alexa devices. I also sometimes bark a quick \u201cthank you\u201d when I\u2019m given my food at mealtimes.\n\nOverall, though, I would love to just follow you around all day and snuggle when the day is over.",

He takes his time getting to know new people and will do best in a mellow home, where he will not be meeting a lot of strangers. His fitness is second to none, which allows him to stay out on the campaign trail (and hiking trails) longer than all the rest of the candidates. He's done some 6 mile hikes and enjoys running too! \nCar rides are Lincoln's 'happy place.' The look on his face when his head is out the window, feeling the breeze in his flaps, will give you all the feels! Come visit Lincoln and see if he is the right candidate for you!",

It was sure luck that she had a litter of puppies and an amazing rescue was able to save them and trap Harriet to get her to safety. Harriet and puppies were then transferred to our shelter where she managed to escape while trying to unload her. Again, she lived off the streets for 4 weeks, eating whatever food she could. It was a miracle that we were able to catch her again and was discovered she was caught in a hog snare that was digging deep into her skin. Harriet is now healed up from that and at a healthy weight but she has unfortunately also tested positive for heart worms. She has begun her 2 month treatment but this poor girl can't seem to catch a break. \n\nHarriet is very shy right now and not trusting of staff. She has never tried to bite but avoids us as much as she can. She has a long road ahead of her, mentally and physically, but she is on the mends. \n\nIf you would like to make a donation towards Harriet's ongoing care, please click the link below: \nhttp://www.hillcountryspca.com/healing-hearts.html",

Shawn was born in late May 2019 and was rescued in Alabama. Shawn is a special, happy little boy who wants nothing more than to be loved.\n\nShawn was born with hydrocephalus, which causes him to bob his head a bit, and he has a bit of a balance issue. Shawn has conquered stairs, but sometimes slides or falls when he walks although he does fine outside. Shawn\n\nloves his stuffed toys! He likes being outside and going for walks. Shawn is on daily medication which he takes easily. Did we say he loves his stuffies?!! This adorable boy loves people and gets so excited when someone pets him or plays with him.\n\nShawn is neutered, housebroken, friendly with dogs (though he would be fine as an only dog), great with people, and in fact, Shawn loves meeting new people, but older children might be best for Shawn as he tends to be nippy with food.\n\nIf you are that special someone that can give this special boy the loving forever home he deserves, please apply online\n\nat\n\nwww.rescuedogsrocknyc.org\n\n.",

He's a ham and while sweet as they come, he is a strong guy who will need a confident and experienced handler.\n\nBuddy was sadly abandoned in the vestibule of Famous Fido, an experience that was quite traumatizing for him, and left him crying actual tears and full of anxiety. \n\nWe are still getting to know Buddy, who was a bit fearful upon arrival (understandably) but is opening up and becoming a true Staff favorite! Buddy would do best in a quiet environment because he likes to just relax. Buddy snuggles up his big soft snuggly body into his kennel blanket and makes a sweet nest with it. He 'tucks himself' in when it's time to stare at his eyelids and catch up on some ZZzzz's.  This sweet man is referred to as 'Beefy Baby' by Staff members and wants nothing more than to be touched. He gives the sweetest kisses and takes treats OH SO GENTLY! Buddy wants to curl up on the couch next to YOU! And so long as he is touching, he's the happiest camper in town.  \n\nChicago, IL\n",

My foster mom say I am a sweet boy who also loves to be close to my foster family. Before Angels Four Paws rescue me, I wonder the street everyday looking for foods. Then, I ended up with my current foster because she feed me everyday and I knew she will not harm me.\u00a0I love to play with my foster brother! If you scratch just behind my ears, that\u2019s the spot, and I'll literally fall to the ground. I used to be very skinny, and they say it is because of my poor diet before I was saved. My foster mom has been taking really good care of me, and now I\u2019m not skinny, or hungry anymore.\nMy foster mom says I'm a smart boy and have learned a lot with her help. I learned to trust human again. I'm so excited to get to meet my forever family. \u00a0I heard being adopted was a wonderful thing! I hope I get to meet you soon!!!\n\nPLEASE CONTACT CELESTINE IF YOU ARE INTERESTING IN MONTE\n832-659-2576",

            "description": "This big, mushy man is Chester, a 9 year old Boerboel mix that had a home, but when his owner no longer wanted him, they turned him in and claimed to have found him as a stray.  Chester sure didn't deserve that, but this gentle giant doesn't let anything get him down.  Chester makes friends so easily and his tail goes into overdrive with every new person he meets. He can't get enough attention and nothing makes him happier than to lean against you and have you pet him forever.  Chester is strong, but he walks well on a leash, he sits instantly when asked and is very gentle with taking treats.  He gets a kick out of toys and will even trot after an occasional ball.  Chester is selective with other dogs and will need a couple of meets to ensure another dog is a good fit.  He needs a home with no kids, as a more quiet home would best suit him.  You'll love this big boy if you give him a chance!  File#29426  10/13/19\n<p>\nIf interested please visit our Forked River Shelter. We are open Mon. - Fri. from \n12:00 P. M. - 6:00 P.

They came from a family who could no longer keep them. Another rescue took their siblings and we welcomed these two sweet girls into the rescue.\n\nThey\u2019ve been through a lot in their short life. They were picked up as strays so we don't know how they & their siblings survived but apparently life was not good in the beginning.  They came to us scared and are now the life of the party.  Once they know you and feel comfortable, they will keep you smiling and laughing with their antics!\n\nTheir negative is: We recently found out they don't like all men.  Their current foster is a man but he has other dogs so they're ok with him.  They were adopted for less than a week to a nice family and they did not like the son or the husband once they got into the home. They were great upon meeting them but 4 days in and they started becoming protective over the mom.  The trainer we sent them to was a man & he feels they would do better in an all female house or with a man who is nurturing. .\n\nPip is the life of the party and will worm her way into your heart within minutes of meeting you.\n\nAthena is shy and it takes a couple minutes for her to warm up. She has a tendency to follow her sister.\n\n*** PIP AND ATHENA MUST BE ADOPTED TOGETHER\n\nThese girls get along with all size dogs.  If you are looking for a pair of beauties who will warm your heart and make you smile, please fill out an application.\n\nhttps://www.muttsinneed.org/adoption-application.html",

            "description": "Look who is FINALLY ready for adoption!! Jordan! He has been in our rescue over a year. You all raised nearly $6,000 for Jordan to get much needed cataract surgery. He is now 8 months post-op and has been given the all-clear! \nJordan is about 5 years old and 20 lbs. He was adopted at about 18 months and returned to NHAR two years later in rough shape. He had been diagnosed with diabetes nearly a year earlier and was not being treated for it. As a result, he had the premature cataracts we ultimately removed with the wonderful Dr. McIllnay at Veterinary Eye Specialists in Omaha. \nIt has taken every ounce of this year to get him healthy. He could not have his surgery for six months because his blood sugars were so out of whack. The post-op surgery requirements were many. He was taking up to six eye drops five times a day. He has been through hell and back, and now he can finally start looking for his forever home.\nJordan is a ball of fire. He is all terrier. He is super smart. He is very active. He loves to ride in the car and go for walks. He thinks he is the star of the show and loves to show off and get attention. He is also a bit of a bully with dogs, so he pairs well with an alpha. He kennels well. He is also very stubborn. He can get nippy if you grab him or try to correct him sternly. With positive reinforcement and love, he does great. For this reason, we will not be adopting him to a home with small children. He needs to have everyone around him know how to handle him.\nJordan is going to need someone to make a lifetime commitment to his medical care. He will continue to have follow up appointments in Omaha for his eyes that must be attended; his adoption contract will require it. We can\u2019t take $6,000 in donations and not have his new owner follow through. He will have two different eye drops that he will need every day, potentially for the rest of his life. \nHe is also still diabetic. That requires specific food, two insulin shots a day, and vet visits at least twice a year to do blood work. And of course, all of the basics. He needs his regular shots, heart worm preventative, flea and tick treatment, and the occasional dental. All in all, you can expect to pay roughly $200 a month for his care for his maintenance, on top of the semi-annual vet visits.\nJordan has all the regular care the rest of our fosters have too. He\u2019s neutered, up to date on shots, microchipped, on heart worm preventative, and has had his teeth cleaned in January, 2020.\nWe want to be sure to find Jordan the perfect home. If you think you could fit the bill, please click on the link below to fill out an adoption application. His adoption fee is $135. \n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/50308432400137",

They are around 8 months old, and are a work in progress with collar, leash, and socialization. ACD experience is required for these, because they need extra guidance. Our adoption fee ($250) covers the age appropriate spay / neutering, heart worm testing, rabies, distemper combo, microchipping and any other necessary medical that a dog may need. Please consider a rescue that comes to you with all of the routine medical (and then some) already done.\n\nNeed to find the application?

Her fur is velvety soft.\n\nShe has a beautiful hopping gait when trotting. She takes her backpack carrying job seriously and is amply rewarded! Collen is an ace at keeping a steady pace on a hiking trail.\n\nShe responds well to verbal instruction. Colleen can be trusted in the house and is house trained.\n\nMostly she wants to be with her humans. Colleen is very aware of her environment and senses animals and people I can not see. She would thrive with a moderately active adoptor(s).\n\nRumor has it she has 'Springer' bicycle experience and knows how to focus. I personally think her one eye gives her superpowers! Colleen is having a blast in the snow with her foster mom.",

His owner if you can call it that don\u2019t want him, so he does not care of Dino get out and get hurt. His owner does not care for Dino because Dino is not a good fighting puppy. I assume that was the reason he got Dino to train him into a fight dog. One good thing this man was he brought Dino to my friend house and give Dino to her. But at that time my friend was not home, so he just put Dino inside the fence of some apartment nearby. And once again Dino got out but this time one of the persons who usually standing at the corner. She this time brought Dino to my friend house. So many people Dino encounter with don\u2019t give a darn about him so now when Dino being love, care for with love and kisses he does not know how to react to it. He is a little timid since he does not know the next person, he meets will be nice or will harm him.   \nDino learn to be cuddy, loving and giving kisses now. He is ready for his furever home now. Please open up your heart and home to this beautiful and sweet puppy whom his beginning of his life have not been love until now.\nIf you are interesting in Dino please contact Celestine@ 832-659-2576.\n\n \n",

This gorgeous Mastiff mix is 2 years old and weighs 120 lbs!\n\nBrady is very friendly with all people, but a home without small children would be best due to his size. Brady's ideal home is a farm or several acres, fenced, where he can run all day. He does not like to be confined. He can go to a home with or without other dogs. If he has canine siblings, he will require slow introductions and they should be large-breed and high energy, matching Brady's energy level. No small dogs or cats for Brady.\n\nThis handsome guy truly has a big heart and goofy personality. Brady loves car rides and playing with his toys! He knows basic commends (sit, down, stay, come, as well as paw). Brady is neutered and up to date on vaccines.\n\nPlease visit\nhttps://rescuedogsrocknyc.org\nto adopt Brady!",

He is about 75 pounds and will make a nice companion on walks, hikes or runs. He loves his kennel and keeps it clean. He was in a home prior to coming to us and was potty trained. \n\nJax is a special needs dog in that he must have had some rough handling in the past. He is very particular about how his collar is handled and likes you to handle it slowly.  Brisk movements around his collar from behind him surprise him and make him be defensive. Therefore he needs an experienced adult to help him learn to trust again. We think adult only / no other pet household. \n\nHe is very food motivated so all you need to do is show him a treat and he will do what you are asking. He has nice long legs and a very bushy and full coat so he would be perfect in the more northern climates. He would be great for a couple who want a companion dog make them feel safer. He is not a big barker but very inquisitive and observant. He loves being in the yard and doesn\u2019t try to climb or dig in the yards we have. He is currently in Texas waiting for his forever home. His adoption fee is 180. He is a wonderful dog and with the right family will make a nice companion.",

            "description": "\n Barney is a sweet, sensitive doofus with many layers. At his core, he has a huge heart, and is a goofy, playful, and affectionate. He has an endearing curiosity and wonder for the world, and he seems to love taking in nature and the outdoors. Wrapped around this is a big layer of insecurity, which makes him sensitive and unsure in new environments. He can take a while to be fully comfortable in a new environment and with new people. Barney would benefit from a patient home that can give him some structure and further training so he can feel confident and learn to trust. Once he does, he is an absolute delight for company. His noodly wiggle-butt and permanent frowny face only add to the charm! Currently living in a foster home, Barney has shown that he is housebroken and crate-trained. He is around 1 or 2 years old (still a youngster), and weighs around 75 lbs.  Contact david.ager@gmail.com to learn more about Barney and to set up a meet!\n  \nQuestions? Email: citydogs@city.cleveland.oh.us | Call: (216) 664-3476\n Visit: 9203 Detroit Avenue Cleveland, OH 44102\n\n Hours:\n 10 AM - 3 PM Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday\n 10 AM - 6 pm Tuesday & Thursday\n\nFee: $61 | Includes spay/neuter, shots, microchip, license, 30 days free pet insurance (when registered upon adoption)\n\n  The CITY DOGS mission is to increase adoptions from the City Kennel by changing the image of the pit bulls who make up the majority of the kennel population, by preparing all adoptable dogs in the kennel for lives in loving homes and by creating as many opportunities as possible for the public to meet and get to know our dogs for the terrific pets they are meant to be.  \n Our Adoption Process...\nHere's a little about how things work:\nAll of the CITY DOGS posted for adoption are available for direct adoption from the kennel, unless noted otherwise. Some dogs with special needs may require a rescue to pull. You can either stop in during our open hours to meet a dog, or set up a meet and greet with your dog, which allows us to get the dog out of his/her cage for some exercise before you arrive. To set up a meet and greet or to inquire about a dog\u2019s special needs, please email us at citydogs@city.cleveland.oh.us.\n\nAbout Our Dogs: All available dogs have gone through a behavioral and medical assessment. This assessment is a snapshot of who the dog is at that given time. We cannot make any guarantees with regard to behavior, temperament or health of any City Dog. Most of our dogs are picked up as strays, so we do not know what kind of home environment they were living in (i.e. with kids, other dogs or other cats), nor do we know if most of them are house trained. Everything we know about them is based on volunteer and staff observations. We do have some dogs in foster homes, where they will have more information about how the dog is in a home environment. It is very hard to tell with certainty whether or not a dog will be good with kids, cats or another dog. If you have kids in the home or another dog, we do require that they be present for a meet and greet with the dog you are considering for adoption.\nHeath/Vaccinations: Dogs that are adopted directly from the kennel need to go to your personal vet within two weeks of leaving the kennel. All dogs receive their DHPP, Rabies, Bordetella and Canine Influenza vaccines, thought you may be required to get follow up boosters. All dogs come microchipped and with a Cuyahoga County license. \n",

She is such a lover and LOVES to give kisses and get cuddles in return. She is an incredibly sweet, gentle and well mannered girl looking for a family who can help her safely navigate and live her life to the fullest as she is missing one of her senses. \n\nShe requires a home that has experience working with and training a deaf dog. She is very smart and treat motivated! She is working on her commands but will need help expanding her knowledge using signs and visual signals. \n\nBlanca can do well with other dogs with proper introductions. She does not appreciate rambunctious or dominant dogs in her space if she does not know them well. Once she knows them, she does great with other dogs, and will need another laid back dog friend her size or larger in the home, no small dogs. She currently lives with 3 other large/medium dogs. (She is not a dog park dog.)\n\nBlanca LOVES to cuddle and is a great couch or bedtime snuggler. Though she likes to lounge, she also enjoys walks and runs with her foster mom. She will need a family that is extra careful to make sure she is secure for adventures and can\u2019t get loose since she cannot hear! She walks well but can get reactive when she sees other dogs. She is working on that in her foster home.\n\nBlanca is crate and house trained. Kids above 16 due to her size and hearing disability though an adult only home is ideal. Having a properly fenced yard, deaf dog experience and another dog in the home are all required.\n\nBlanca is up to date on shots, microchipped and spayed. Her adoption fee is $400.",

They still need to be vetted, when the time is right, so they don't go backwards in the trust department. Theia, is more cautious, probably because her babies were taken away too soon. She has the green leash and is sitting in the picture. Our adoption fee ($250) covers the age appropriate spay / neutering, heart worm testing, rabies, distemper combo, microchipping and any other necessary medical that a dog may need. Please consider a rescue that comes to you with all of the routine medical (and then some) already done.\n\nNeed to find the application? Please visit our new website at www.cowdogrescue.com or http://australian-cattle.dog/?page_id=241\n If you are looking for a certain rescue, let me know, as we always have rescues waiting to come here.\n\nDontate-A-Thundershirt ProgramClick HereDonate-A-Thundershirt Program\n\nPLEASE NOTE: AuCaDo Rescue is not a public shelter. This dog is being fostered in a private home / kennel until adoption. Prospective adopters who have submitted an accepted application and completed a telephone interview are welcome to schedule an appointment to travel to meet the dog. If approved for adoption, a deposit will hold the dog until a meeting or transport is arranged. AuCaDo Rescue does welcome out of state adoptions.

He is a smaller sized neutered male with lots of heart. He has excellent eye contact and is such a pleaser boy. He loves toys and now that he has exercise options MOST of his hyperness has resolved itself. He was tagged as \"No Children\" due to food aggression. He is looking for a SPECIAL placement that can handle his special needs. \n\nPlease Note: First, we ask that you fill out the adoption application if you are interested in one of our dogs. We can only answer questions about the adoption process, before the application. Then during the phone interview (step two of the application process) we can answer more questions based on what your application has on it. If you email questions without doing an application, we will not be able to give you a good answer. There are too many variables which we look at when matching up dogs. Thank you for helping us to help you, and ultimately help the dogs looking for the right home.\n\nOur adoption fee ($250) covers the age appropriate spay / neutering, heart worm testing, rabies, distemper combo, microchipping and any other necessary medical that a dog may need. Please consider a rescue that comes to you with all of the routine medical (and then some) already done. Need to find the application? Please visit our new website at www.cowdogrescue.com or http://australian-cattle.dog/?page_id=241 Contact Monica at (989) 330-5147, Director of AuCaDo Rescue, for questions about adoption process. If you are looking for a certain rescue, let me know, as we always have rescues waiting to come here.\n\nDontate-A-Thundershirt ProgramClick HereDonate-A-Thundershirt Program\n\nPLEASE NOTE: AuCaDo Rescue is not a public shelter. This dog is being fostered in a private home / kennel until adoption. Prospective adopters who have submitted an accepted application and completed a telephone interview are welcome to schedule an appointment to travel to meet the dog. If approved for adoption, a deposit will hold the dog until a meeting or transport is arranged. AuCaDo Rescue does welcome out of state adoptions. We require an approved application, phone interview, photos and willingness to travel to meet the dog. AuCaDo Rescue is located in Remus, Michigan.",

            "description": "*******NO YOUNG CHILDREN*******\n******VERY ENERGETIC***********\nIf you are looking for an instant family you\u2019ve come to the right place. Meet Sugar and Toto; a BEYOND adorable pair of bonded terrier mixes. At just over a year old they are both active, silly, a little crazy and totally lovable. They do everything together and are not often apart. Sugar (the white one, naturally) is the big sister and she\u2019s a little more independent and curious about her environment and the people in it. Toto is like that little brother who follows his big sis everywhere and does what she does. \n\nThey love a good cuddle session at night and will happily receive belly rubs and kisses but during the day Toto and Sugar are exceptionally energetic. They love their daily power walks, no casual strolls from them!  If they aren\u2019t walking they are playing together and tearing up the back yard; a fence in yard is required.\n\nThey are still a little wary of strangers and anything new so a family that can expose them to many different situations, environs, and people would be great. Based on their size and current temperament, older children would be preferred. If you can handle double the kisses and 8 crazy-legs you\u2019ll want to meet these two.\nFor more information please email freetobemerescue@gmail.com or call 518-956-1804. Or you can go online to freetobemerescue.org to submit an application.\nPlease be advised we only process applications within an hour drive of Albany NY.  Adoption fee $550.00",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 11/08/2018\nReason for being in rescue: Lovingly surrendered by owners because he disliked one of the members in the relationship\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Griff has a bite history\nWeight: 60 lbs\nHeight: 27 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $499\n\nFence needed? Yes without exception.\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Griff needs a low traffic home and an experienced dog owner. He needs a home that will offer him both daily physical and mental exercise. He is bright and if he is bored he can be trouble. He wants an owner who will love him but will let him come to him. Patience and a calm, even personality is a must. Grif does much better with women and would be best in a home with only women. He needs to be the only dog and will not do well with children.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Griff thrives on confident, controlled people who do not show fear. If he thinks you are afraid of him, he will take advantage of you. If he knows you respect him but do not fear him he will lay his heart at your feet.\n\nGriff has been trained under a shock collar and it has created a lot of the challenges we are overcoming. He was shocked when he barked. He was shocked when there was any sort of behavior that was deemed \"unacceptable.\" It has shaped his behavior in such a way that we are now working to unshape that fear and re-establish trust.\n\nGriff is a sweet dog once he knows you. Griff is very timid and takes a while to warm up. He can be a little aggressive in the beginning. He loves to sun bathe outside and is a very calm chill dog when he's comfortable. He's very smart also, he sits and waits for his food and doesn't bark or act crazy. He can resource guard at times also. He does have some barrier aggression when another dog is walking by his run. Griff would enjoy being a couch potato and someone's best friend!!\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? You have to ignore Griff and let him come to you. Don't reach out to him, let him smell you and get comfortable with you. Once he knows you he is a wonderful, loving companion. Our ops manager can do anything with him.\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Griff's birthday is 4/8/2014.\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 2/24/2018\nReason for being in rescue: Pulled from a GA shelter. Doc was seized in neglect case and taken to the shelter.\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet, SC\nSpecial Needs? Doc is blind. He also battles skin challenges.\nWeight: 30 lbs\nHeight: unknown\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $1 - I am priceless\n\nFence needed? Yes. Doc loves to wander in a fenced yard and enjoy the feel of sunshine and grass. He is not a dog that you will walk on a leash.\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Doc is still learning what it means to be someone's pet. He needs an experienced owner that will work with him to teach him basic commands, reward him with lots of positive affirmations, and give him the time and support he needs to blossom into the dog he can be. Doc is blind. He needs a quiet home with experience to understand vision impaired dogs. Doc needs a home where someone can be with him at all times, and watched when he is outside just to make sure he's safe always since he is older and blind.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Seven dogs were seized in a neglect case and brought to Carolina Poodle Rescue. As there were seven, they were named for the seven dwarfs. This is Doc. None of the dogs had had much medical care before coming to Carolina Poodle Rescue. We think that none of them had ever been inside a house before either. All of the dogs from this situation were listed as miniature labradoodles.\n\nDoc is a sweet older guy who can still play like a puppy. He has a great temperament and personality in spite of being neglected for much of his life. In a home with a person or people to love him and provide him with stability and training, he would finally know what it's like to be part of a family. Imagine how he might blossom then! He already knows how to be clean in his crate which is a big step toward house training.\n\nDoc can be slightly dog selective but he gets a long really well with most dogs. He isn't food aggressive and knows how to politely take a treat when one is offered. We estimate Doc to be around 11 years old but don't tell him that! He doesn't know that he's an older guy. Doc enjoys sniffing and walking outside when the sun is out. He can also be a total couch potato that loves taking long naps on his sofa during the day.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Friendly\n\nOther tips and tidbits:\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

Link needs a home where there are no other dogs. He would do best with a quiet life where he stays within a fenced yard for exercise and has no canine visitors.\nWeight: 23 lbs\nHeight: Estimated 14.5 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? Yes\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Link needs a quiet home that is willing to understand him. On the plus side, because his mother was a poodle. Link is a low shedder. He is not a highly active dog and would be fine for someone who is a homebody and likes to putter around the house. He has not shown us that he needs to run and leap and jump a lot. Link was previously adopted from CPR and returned for biting. Link is not good with other dogs and is barrier aggressive when another dog walks past him. He needs to be in a home where he is the only animal.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Link arrived at the farm along with siblings due to no fault of his own. Link was previously adopted but returned due to biting. Since being back at the farm he can no longer go out with dogs because he does not get along with them. He needs an experienced home willing to learn his triggers and work through them.\n\nBasil is a sweet and caring dog. It does take him time to warm up but not very long, and once he does he will love you! He does have some quirks though. Link Basil does not like other dogs at all. He is very barrier aggressive when they are walking by his crate. He needs to be in a home where it's only him. He does have a fear of being alone, he doesn't like to be outside by his self at all. But if you are outside with him he is jumping and happy and very playful.\n\nLink has no experience with children and we believe with their higher energy, he would not do well. Link needs routine. A potty as soon as he wakes up and right after breakfast are a must if you don't want an accident. He does love human contact and will let you sit and pet him for hours if you would. Link has a nervous personality and barks at new noises and people.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Timid. Link will bark at strangers. Once he warms up he is a very caring dog.\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Link needs a very experienced owner in a home where he will be the only dog.\n\nHouse trained?

She's ready to be a family dog, or join a person or couple who likes to go on adventures. Hiking, splashing in the water, or just playing fetch in the yard--all are just peachy with this girl!\n\nInterested in adopting? \n\nPlease fill out our Adoption application: https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/24333/generic\n\nSomeone will reach out to you ASAP to get the approval process started.",

The shelter said my time was up and I was scared, but thankfully I was rescued. I still don\u2019t know exactly what that means, but I know I\u2019m a lot more happy and not scared anymore! I have some fur missing on my back but it\u2019s growing back thankfully! I\u2019m about 3 years old and only about 25-30lbs. I guess you could say I\u2019m a \u201citty bitty pocket pittie\u201d. I have never lived inside of a home so I am still learning to potty outside, but I promise I will learn! Unfortunately, I never learned how to live with other dogs so I need to be your only furbaby and hopefully in a home without small children. I currently live with a 3 year old human boy, but I just don\u2019t know how to be gentle with him. I like to play, can you blame me?! I haven\u2019t met any cats yet so I can\u2019t be sure that I would like them.. but you know what I do love?! Snuggles! If you think you\u2019d like to snuggle me furever please email my matchmakers! They are working around the clock to find me my furever match! ??Matchmakers@furevermatch.com",

She was found and rescued on the streets dragging her hind legs, apparently having been hit by a car. Luckily, she was placed in a foster home where she goes to rehab and is making great strides in her recovery. This affectionate, well-mannered girl still cannot walk on her back legs, but she's happy to scoot across the house and backyard, playing with her two dog housemates and doing excited goofy twirling. She loves chewing her stuffed toys and bath time and does well when left in a crate. And she loves being taken for neighborhood rides in her wheelchair. Then she's quite content to snooze and relax near her humans, hoping for the head and face scratches she loves. Lyla is beginning therapy that may improve her ability to walk. In a new forever home, she would need continued care for her injury rehabilitation and diapers for her incontinence. In return, she'll reward her new owners with love and loyalty. She will be forever grateful. Come see if Lyla can be your new best friend!",

Scared, extremely emaciated, Ehrlichia positive and anemic. She was skin and bones and had no hair on her body from sarcoptic and demodex mange. Her skin was cracked, bleeding and painful to even look at so we can\u2019t even imagine the level of discomfort that she was in. She was also terrified of people.\n\nWith much love and care, Georgia is transitioning into a beautiful girl. Her mange is clearing up and she is putting on weight. She is still very scared of people but is slowly starting to trust that not all people are bad \u2013 there are some who will love her. As soon as she is ready \u2013 both mentally and physically \u2013 she will be looking for her forever home.\n\nTo follow her story, follow up on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/whitekissesgdr/",

Can you tell this sweet face no?\nThis sweet girl is a lover and is looking for a dog-savvy family to love her back! Millie came to us from a home where she had been improperly trained on an electric fence and was repeatedly being shocked when she would leave the yard. She has overcome many of her issues related to this, but she will require a family with a physical fence or one committed to leash-walking.\n\nMillie would love an active family or one who will take her to doggie daycare to get her energy out. She would do fine as an only dog or with a stable, submissive dog, but no cats. She is also crate-trained.\n\nMillie does have some resource-guarding behaviors. She is currently working with a trainer (who will help transition Millie into her new home), but she will need a family committed to continual management of these behaviors. Due to this, she also needs a home without children.\n\nMillie has a waited too long for her happy forever. Can you be the family she deserves?\n\nAt this time, we are unable to process any applications that are outside of the geographic areas listed below:\nGreater Louisville, KY (including adjacent southern Indiana)\nGreater Lexington, KY\nSouthern Indiana Counties:  Clark and Floyd\nOhio Counties: Hamilton, Butler, Warren, some areas within Clermont county, Montgomery and Green\nNorthern KY Counties: Boone, Kenton and Campbell\n \nTo inquire about a specific dog, we require that you first submit an adoption application.

This guy is a lovable goofball who is really just a puppy at heart. He is an expert snuggler and will keep you laughing.  He has come a long way in his time with us and he is ready to find his forever family!\n\nThis big hunk of love was found in late November, 2019, by an Animal Control Officer in Prosser, WA. He was dragging a large chain, but it didn't stop him from jumping in the officer's car and making a new friend! Typical Asher!  Animal control contacted FDR and we agreed to help Asher find a new home. Asher is estimated to be born around December 2017 and he weighs 70 pounds. He\u2019s definitely a bully breed mix, but with his unique coloring and with slightly longer hair than a typical bully breed, we think there\u2019s something else in his mix.\n\nWe assume that Asher spent most of his time before coming to us alone on a chain so everything he has encountered since is super-duper exciting! Thankfully he is not fearful of anything new--he is all about trying to play with all the things!  As is typical for a bully breed, Asher has had to learn some impulse control but, he is eager to please his people and has made great strides in learning how to relax and be a good boy.  Asher walks well on a leash but is still working on ignoring all the distractions along the way and will need continued training on his leash manners. \n\nWhile he does have tons of energy, he's a laid back pup inside the house who will happily cuddle up on the couch and give kisses.  He loves football games and we are pretty sure he is a Seahawks fan.  He\u2019s very responsive to verbal cues and is a joy to have around with his infectious smile. While his new family will need to be committed to continuing his training, they will be rewarded tenfold with this guy's love and loyalty. Asher is surprisingly gentle with children but, he would do best living in a home with older children given his rambunctious nature and not realizing his own size. \n\nWe think Asher would likely do best as an only dog as he never learned dog language 101 and is lacking some of the social skills to engage in proper play with another dog.  He just gets too excited and doesn\u2019t pay attention to another dog\u2019s cues to back off or take a break. Also, no cats or small animals for Asher, they are just too fun to chase.  \n\nIf you are looking for a goofball dog with a huge zest for life, Asher is your pup! Asher is neutered, microchipped and up to date on appropriate vaccines, and his adoption fee is $350.   If interested in adopting, please fill out an application from our website,  www.forgottendogsrescue.com. \n",

Her family surrendered her due to her jumping on their toddler and she got into a tussle with their other dog they introduced into the home. Although she gets along with another male dog here at the rescue, we think Cleo would prefer to be the only animal in a home as she can be selective of her other dog friends. Cleo also has a tendency to guard toys. Therefore we would like her to go to a home with children over 15 years old. Cleo is such a great girl and just wants to go back into a home, whether it be a foster home or a fur-ever home.\n\nAn approved adoption application is required. The $185.00 adoption fee (payable by cash or check only) includes spay/neuter; microchip; dental teeth cleaning (if needed prior to adoption); vaccinations; heartworm testing; martingale collar & leash set; and a kennel muzzle. Our adoption application may be found by going to: www.headinhomerescue.org; then click on the link to the adoption application. Dogs for adoption may be seen by appointment only following an approved application. Proof of completion of an obedience class is required for all dogs following adoption. Please note: while we welcome out of state applications, we do not ship our animals and require adopters to come to Holland to finalize any adoption.",

They\u2019re not known for their beauty, plus they\u2019re covered in thorns.\nI, on the other hand, am known for my beauty and you won\u2019t find a single thorn on me! What you will find is a velvety soft coat topped off by the biggest, cutest pair of ears you\u2019ve ever seen. People tell me I\u2019m goofy and playful. (Flops onto her back for a belly rub at this point?) One of my favorite ways to unwind after a busy day, other than play with my toys, and ride in the car, is to snuggle up and watch movies with you.  And I won\u2019t ever hog the remote, I promise!\nNow, before you go thinking I sound absolutely perfect, first let me remind you that perfection is in the eye of the beholder. So I\u2019m looking for a beholder who can look past my one flaw. I don\u2019t really like other dogs or cats. There. I said it. It\u2019s not easy to admit, but that\u2019s the first step to recovery! And they\u2019re actually working with me on that to see if they can change my mind. But in the meantime, I just know there has got to be someone out there who wants me to be their one and only!\n\nThis pup can be adopted by going to our web site www.homesforpets.org and filling out one of our applications.",

            "description": "Audrey is a sweet and loving 9-year-old, 60 pound Lab mix who loves to play fetch.  She really loves her humans but prefers not to share her space with other pets. Audrey is best with kids over 12 because smaller kids scare her.  They scare me, too so I don't blame her. \n\nAudrey is extremely loving and has zero bad habits in the home, but because she doesn't like other dogs, a quiet walking space without other dogs would be best - or yard time with her ball would be just as good. She can be left out in your home for a full workday and she will be there to greet you when you return home.  Audrey is the perfect couch potato who would love to sit with you while you pet on her and binge watch Netflix.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/ then email Debbie@BigFluffyDogs.com.\n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

As an older gal, she was overlooked, but our friends Lindsay and Alex fell in love and Roxy got her freedom ride on January 30th, 2020. Roxy came down with a pretty serious upper respiratory infection at the shelter, she has a mammary mass, and a loud heart murmur that needs further work up and possibly treatment. We immediately got Roxy to our vet for bloodwork and x-rays. She is going to need an ultrasound as she has a grade 4 heart murmur and her liver enzymes are off. She is also anemic, but we'll be getting her everything she needs.\nABOUT ROXY (AKA DAISY)\nRoxy was shy, confused, and a little scared at the shelter, but she is settling into foster care now. She is extremely sweet, calm, and enjoys sleeping on her kuranda bed. The shelter tested her and she seems to do well with other dogs as well. She sits on command and appears to have good leash manners.\n*Please check back for updates on this sugar faced lovebug!*\nPhoto Album of Roxy: https://www.facebook.com/pg/FriendsToTheForlornPitbullRescue/photos/?tab=album&album_id=2945616495496497\nOur adoption fee is $300.

Due to this Sadie needs to be the only pet in an adult only home. She needs an experienced and committed owner willing to give her time to decompress and the training she needs (on and off leash). We love Sadie here at the shelter and we know the right person for her is out there! If interested, contact us via Email @ animalshelter@islipny.gov or by phone @ (631)224-5660 ? LIKE & SHARE Sadie to get her a home! \u2014 at Islip Animal Shelter and Adopt-a-Pet Center.\n",

They're playful, loving and affectionate with their family and friends, and self-entertaining, though they prefer to be with their people.\n\nLucky can be suspicious of new people, so he needs his family to let him know who's a friend. We have a special introduction routine we do when introducing him to someone new. It involves treats and Lucky's favorite Kong jumbler balls, and Lucky knows it means he's meeting a friend. Princess is much more accepting of new people.\n\nPrincess and Lucky's ideal home will have a big fenced property that they can roam and protect during the day, and they will be able to come inside, too, especially at night and during inclement weather. They love being outdoors, but they also want to be family pets.\n\nWe're looking for someone who understands typical German Shepherd behavior and who will care for them and love them for the rest of their lives!\n\nInterested in adopting or fostering? \n\nPlease fill out our Adoption application: https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/24333/generic\n\nOR:\n\nFoster application: https://petstablished.com/foster_form/24332/generic\n\nSomeone will reach out to you ASAP to get the approval process started.",

            "description": "Hi, I'm Luna! I am an energetic 5 yr old spayed female Husky/Cattle Dog Mix. I am fairly independent gal, but once I am comfortable with you I have proven to be quite the affectionate pup! I love me some string cheese and will do just about anything for a frozen Kong, too! My friends at the shelter say I have lots of energy and need a family prepared to take me for some long runs or hikes, and spend lots of time in the fenced-in yard playing ball. Oh, and I wanna mention that I LOVE swimming pools and hoses, so much so that my friends have dubbed me the \u201cdancing queen\u201d because I love to \u201cdance\u201d with the water when the sprinkler is going!\n\nI do enjoy having the spotlight all on me and I love being the center of attention so a home without other dogs or cats is ideal for me. But I\u2019ll do my very best to fill your heart and home with all the love I can give! As for kids? I\u2019ve lived with older kids in the past, so older kids with dog experience may be okay on a case-by-case basis, but I may be too much for younger smaller kids. \n\nOne thing you should know about me is that I love to sing and will readily practice my singing voice whenever I feel like it. But here\u2019s the thing, I plan on trying out for one of those singing competitions on TV so you really can\u2019t blame me. And I have a pretty voice too ;) \n\nDo you love going for hikes and long runs and spending hours outside? Are you willing to continue taking me to dog training classes so I can keep adding achievements to my resume? If so, I would love you meet you! Call my friends at the Saratoga County Animal Shelter to schedule a meet with me (remember, all dog meets are by appointment only). 518-885-4113. Hope to see you soon! Woof!\n",

They're playful, loving and affectionate with their family and friends, and self-entertaining, though they prefer to be with their people. Lucky can be suspicious of new people, so he needs his family to let him know who's a friend. We have a special introduction routine we do when introducing him to someone new. It involves treats and Lucky's favorite Kong jumbler balls, and Lucky knows it means he's meeting a friend. \n\nLucky and Princess's ideal home will have a big fenced property that they can roam and protect during the day, and they will be able to come inside, too, especially at night and during inclement weather. They love being outdoors, but they also want to be family pets. We're looking for someone who understands typical German Shepherd behavior and who will care for them and love them for the rest of their lives!\n\nInterested in adopting or fostering? \n\nPlease fill out our Adoption application: https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/24333/generic\n\nOR:\n\nFoster application: https://petstablished.com/foster_form/24332/generic\n\nSomeone will reach out to you ASAP to get the approval process started.",

She is playful and loves to play with toys - particularly the squeeky ones. Sunbathing is a favorite pastime. Gold loves her walks with our volunteers and going for rides in the car. She prefers affection on her own terms, but loves to be petted when she is in the mood (which is quite often). Gold came to us from Macau, China and did not have a good early life. She has some food resource guarding, but we are working with her and a behaviourist and she is a star!!! She is learning so fast!!! Gold's adoption includes four training sessions with Crawford Canine Academy. Gold would do best in a home with a fenced yard and no children (they scare her) or other animals.\nSponsored by Joon Park\nSponsored by Carla Rogers\nSponsored by Jordan Rodgers, in honor of Mary and Claude Warren\nSponsored by Elizabeth Lechner\nSponsored by Robin Reich, in honor of Albano Martins\nSponsored by sponsored by Veronica Jia, in memory of Jhin (Stormy Magic) - a friend from Macau\nIf you would like to sponsor Gold until she finds her forever home, please see this link for details on how to do just that! https://www.greyhoundpetsinc.org/support/sponsor-a-dog/\nGreyhound Pets, Inc. - www.greyhoundpetsinc.org - 877-468-7681\nWHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS TO ADOPT A GREYHOUND?\nRead Greyhound Pets, Inc.

I am currently in a foster home because the shelter was a scary and loud environment I was not doing so well in. I do have some fear based behavior issues that my foster is working with me on. Stranger danger is a very real thing to me and I will take time warming up to new people. Because of this I would do best in a home with my own space and yard, not an apartment.

            "description": "Lulu Mae is a super happy-go-lucky and playful 3 year old pit mix!\nShe loooves other dogs and toys and anything fun. She needs a variety of toys with different shapes and textures as she's obssessed with them. She has only ever chewed on something else when she didn't have multiple toys available.\nShe is SUPER smart, one of the smartest dogs her fosters have ever met- part of the reason why she's so mischievous. She can master any puzzle almost immediately. \nShe's very agile, too, even at 55 pounds. She can jump really high and likes to overcome obstacles. She'd do great in an agility class. She has an active prey drive, so she is not a good fit with cats or small animals. However she loves dogs of all sizes - anywhere from teeny tiny to massive dogs - she loves them all. \nEven with all of her energy and intelligence, she is extremely cuddly and dependent on constant affection. She has a good bit of anxiety, especially separation anxiety, but she does really well as long as she's well exercised and kept on a structured schedule without sudden changes. Other dogs help ground her a lot too, so she is a great fit for a large family pack!\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our dogs are healthy, spayed/neutered, vaccinated and on heartworm preventative. They live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. Many have basic obedience skills and all have been temperament tested. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, please visit our website to complete an application: http://www.takepawsrescue.org/adoption-form\n(please note: app cannot be done on a mobile device)\n\nIf you have any questions, please email us at adopt@takepawsrescue.org\n",

She is eager to please and loves attention and treats. Twizzler is a low energy senior dog that knows her basic good manners and can learn new routines. She is living in a foster home and is house trained and crate trained. She walks nicely on a leash but prefers to not go too far. She is spayed, micro-chipped, and vaccinated. Her diabetes is well controlled. Her adoption fee is just $50 dollars because she is sponsored by Lauren Beach. For an application to adopt, email pitcrewapplication@gmail.com. We adopt within 45 minutes of Toledo and require fully fenced yards.",

She is heartworm negative (and on Sentinel Spectrum to keep it that way), current on vaccinations, spayed, microchipped and crate trained. \n\n\nIf you think Nyah would be the perfect addition to your home, send an email to PawPrintzRescue@gmail.com and request an application. \n\nAdoption Requirements: Application, Interview, Homecheck\nAdoption Fee: $200.00\n\nThis dog is located near Fresno, California.\n\n All of our animals are up-to-date on their vaccinations spayed or neutered, micro chipped and have had a physical exam. At adoption we provide; veterinarian records, vaccine certificate, lifetime lost animal support, leash, collar, ID tag and a familiar toy or blanket to help them settle in. \n\n*Age is always a guess with rescue dogs but here at Paw Printz we believe everyone should have a birth day so when the vet guesses at their age, we work out what would be a good birthday for each dog and make it so!",

            "description": "Little Bit\nDOB: 11.18.2018*\n\nLittle Bit is such a sweet little boy. He was running the streets and afraid of people but now, he follows his foster mom everywhere. He is loving and gives the sweetest kisses. He gets along with the other dogs in his foster home but was seen chasing cats when he was one the street so a home without cats is probably best.\n\nHe is ready to find his forever home. Very playful but has no problem cuddling up to his person. During his vet visit he was checked for heartworm and found to be negative. To keep him safe from such parasites, he is on Sentinel Spectrum. He is also current on vaccinations, neutered, microchipped and crate trained. All he is in need of is a loving family to call his own.\n\nIf you think Little Bit would be the perfect addition to your home, send an email to PawPrintzRescue@gmail.com and request an application. \n\nAdoption Requirements: Application, Interview, Homecheck\nAdoption Fee: $200.00\n\nThis dog is located near Fresno, California.\n\n All of our animals are up-to-date on their vaccinations spayed or neutered, micro chipped and have had a physical exam. At adoption we provide; veterinarian records, vaccine certificate, lifetime lost animal support, leash, collar, ID tag and a familiar toy or blanket to help them settle in. \n\n*Age is always a guess with rescue dogs but here at Paw Printz we believe everyone should have a birth day so when the vet guesses at their age, we work out what would be a good birthday for each dog and make it so!",

She likes to spend her days playing in the backyard, so she likes plenty of room to run around and explore. She will play with a person but does not care for too much toys. She enjoys taking a stroll with her humans in the park as well. She has learned to ignore cats if they don\u2019t react to her presence.  \n\nGinger is spayed, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm negative, and on flea and heartworm prevention.\n\n** Ask about a special reduced adoption fee for Ginger!\n\nThis pup can be adopted by going to our web site www.homesforpets.org and filling out one of our applications.",

            "description": "Jade is a beautiful girl believed to be around 9 years young and is a Shepherd Rottweiler mix. Jade was originally a stray in the Louisville area in 2015 which is how she found her way to rescue where she has been waiting for a home to call her own every since.\n\nJade has a zealous love for people and is always happy to meet new people. She doesn't believe in 'acting your age' and can still be very over the top when meeting new people wanting to jump, crawl into your lap, etc. She believes she is the perfect size for a lap dog and is an overall love-bug wanting to always be right with you. Jade has spent a fair bit of time around children and as long as they are okay with an abundance of kisses and the attention she supplies there are no worries. Jade has been known to get a bit over-attached and can be inappropriately protective if she doesn't have clear boundaries around her behavior. Don't let her age fool you Jade is a smart, clever, and stubborn girl.\n\nJade has lived with other dogs her whole time with us and by extension has had to meet a lot of new dogs. She has a very dominant personality when meeting new dogs and can be a jealous attention hog when new dogs are brought into the mix. She understands that this isn't acceptable behavior and when verbally reprimand will stop but if the boundary isn't maintained she is happy to push it. Jade generally has no issue with other medium to large dogs and when she is with a group of dogs she knows she is general unconcerned with what they are doing. Simply put Jade is a pushy queen bee who doesn't like that challenged. Jade would not do well in a home with small dogs or cats.\n\nAlthough Jade is a 'senior' she is still very energetic and enjoys romping in the woods at her foster home. She is an athletic girl and would do really well in a home with a moderate jogger or a hiker. Jade has a lot of love to give to anyone who is willing to understand her quirks. She is great in the house, loves to ride in the car, and has been waiting a long time for a home to call her own.\n\nIf you have any questions about Jade, or would like an adoption application, please email us at tierhavenrescue@gmail.com",

            "description": "Max is a beautiful Shepherd around 2 - 3 years of age who found himself in the shelter after seriously biting someone over a tennis ball. His caregivers at the time where trying to re-home him anyways so they left him at the shelter to be euthanized.\n\nMax is a big, stubborn Shepherd who has clearly been allowed to do as he pleases and bully his way through life. He was recently neutered and as his hormones level out he is realizing that structure isn't so bad however Max requires an experienced German Shepherd handler. Max does well in his foster home and has had no issues meeting new volunteers and friends in his foster home. He is a rambunctious boy who likes a good adventure or stirring up the play group by trying to open the gate - anything for a bit of fun! Max LOVES toys and is a very high drive dog. This would make him great for sport work but also makes him terrible if you think taking toys from him is a good idea. Max does wonderful being redirected onto a new toy and is a sucker for a game of two toy fetch. Max is NOT suitable for a home with children under 13 or children who do not understand respecting the boundaries of a high drive dog.\n\nMax does well with the other Shepherds in his foster home but doesn't really understand roughhousing or playing. He is a bit more stoic during yard time preferring to keep to himself for the most part. Max will interact with the other dogs but simply doesn't care for playing or doing much with the other dogs. Max has NOT been introduced to any dogs under 40 lbs or cats.\n\nTo be clear, Max is a wonderful boy in his own regard and is a very smart and eager boy. He is benefiting tremendously from force free training and has some tell-tell habits that speak to a lifetime of negative reinforcement training. If it is your belief that the way to handle a strong willed dog is adverse training this is not the dog - or rescue group - for you. This is not a battle of wills that you will win and it is not worth further damaging such an eager and fun dog so that a handler can exert their dominance.\n\nIf you understand how to work with a dogs motivations to help them adjust and learn then Max is a wonderful guy who is going to make a great companion. If you're interested in Max please email Tierhavenrescue@gmail.com or visit tierhaven.rescuegroups.org to view our adoption process.",

            "description": "Prancer is a wonderful girl who is 12 years young and very well-traveled. Prancer was originally a stray in Paris where her owners found her as a puppy. They took Prancer in and gave her a loving home and the experience of traveling many countries with them. Unfortunately, when they were asked to relocate to Germany Prancer could not pass customs and they made the decision to surrender her. Prancer has been with us for 3 years now waiting for a new home to call her own. Prancer is loyal to the core and can be a playful and bouncy girl with those she knows but she isn't the type of dog to tolerate being handled by strangers - hence her inability to make it through customs. Prancer believes in mutual respect and earning it. When she enters a new home Prancer can be aloof not wanting to be touched or handled until she has settled in. Overall, Prancer is a no-nonesense type of gal and appreciates a stable environment where she can be a diva. Prancer is not recommended for a home with children as she greatly values her personal space and has no qualms correcting invasions of it herself. Prancer has been living with other dogs and does really well with the other dogs. Again she is a very no-nonsense dog and will tell the younger dogs to leave her alone sometimes but will also play with them at times. Prancer is generally the smallest in her foster homes but despite that she navigates unruly Shepherd foster siblings well. Don't let her age fool you Prancer loves her exercise time and is still an active girl. Prancer has been around cats in the past but not recently. She would need a new cat test and a plan of introduction before she could go to a home with cats. Prancer is above all a very loyal dog and once you have gained her trust and loyalty you couldn't ask for a better dog. Prancer is searching for a home who understands and appreciates her Malinois characteristics and will give her the love she deserves into her golden years. If you have any questions about Prancer, or would like an application, please contact us at Tierhavenrescue@gmail.com.",

            "description": "Macy is an adorable young girl just over 1 year of age who is believed to be a Shepherd Cattle dog mix. Macy came from a rural part of Kentucky where she was live-trapped after being born to a pack of Shepherds that were free-roaming on a farm. Macy had zero human contact prior to being trapped and has been very slow to warm up. She is considered semi-feral at this point and is still overcoming her fears.\n\nMacy prefers to avoid all human contact but has begrudgingly learned how to walk on a leash and tolerate being handled for daily living. Macy is a fear biter and if cornered - such as when she is in her crate and needs to come out - she will lash out in fear. If you move slowly with Macy she settles down and will allow you to handle her but she gets overwhelmed easily when rushed. Macy is going to require extensive ongoing handling, training, and socialization coupled with lots of patience as she continues to grow and bond. Macy has made great progress in her foster home and can be handled by all occupants while she is both on leash and off leash. She enjoys going on hikes around their property - she is still learning to not hate the car which would allow for hiking in new places - and romping in the creek near their yard. Macy does not do well with children which she views as small cattle to be herded - she will nip the back of their legs if left loose with children and will bark at them from her crate. She has been slowly learning to interact while on leash with an 8 year old that visits her foster frequently but would not be recommended for a home with children under 13 years of age. Macy is crate trained and relies on her crate to provide her a safe space to be when she overwhelmed or cannot be supervised. Macy does okay in the house while supervised but does like to chew - she has an expensive taste for cell phones and shoes - and cannot be left loose unattended.\n\nMacy connects with other dogs much better than she does people as a result of her early life in a pack. She does well meeting new dogs and is quick to follow their lead. She loves to romp with the other dogs in her foster home and has learned to meet new foster siblings well. Macy can play rough and uses her smaller size to her advantage taking out the bigger dogs legs while rough housing. She also enjoys chase games as she can run underneath things to hide from the bigger dogs if they get to be too much for her. Macy does live with a cat that she does okay with but she will pester the cat at times and has chased it a couple of times. Macy probably would be great with a cat that is active or likes to run around the house as she is more likely to try to chase it than she is a more sedentary cat.\n\nMacy has a sweet soul and is trying her best to overcome her fears and bond with the people around her. Macy is searching for a home that can provide her a stable environment and ongoing work as she continues to grow beyond her past. Macy will likely take between 3 - 6 months to settle into a new home and is going to require a steady commitment from her future home to her ongoing journey.\n\nIf you have a place in your heart and home for Macy please email Tierhavenrescue@gmail.com for an adoption application or visit Tierhaven.rescuegroups.org for more information.",

            "description": "Pepper is a beautiful and wise girl estimated around 9 years young. Pepper came from a rural area of Eastern Kentucky and we do not know her history prior to coming to the shelter. She is a laid back girl though and is looking forward to having a family of her own soon.\n\nPepper enjoys people but is not an overly affectionate girl. She has her routines, likes them, and appreciates the people that are part of them. She is friendly meeting new people but isn't quick to cuddle. She knows her worth and let's people win her over before getting attached to them. She is a hoot to be around as she is a very confident and sassy girl much of the time. She appreciates a good walk, hanging out in the yard, or nap time depending on the weather. Pepper has been around children 5 years and older and always done well. Pepper has lots of love to give and stories to tell for those who listen. Pepper is starting to explore toys and enjoys playing with balls by herself but hadn't yet figured out the point of fetch.\n\nPepper is tolerant of other dogs but maintains royal diva status 99% of the time. She doesn't want to play and will let the other dogs know as much. She has been around puppies who are around 18 lbs and was very gentle in delivering the 'you're a pest' message to them. She does live with other dogs but would do best with other laid back adult dogs or as a single dog. Pepper has not been around any dogs under 18 lbs or cats at this time.\n\nPepper does have multiple fatty lumps on her body that have all been biopsied and examined. The vet advised against removing them as it would be more hassle than benefit to Pepper to undergo surgery. She had a senior blood panel done as well and did not have any concerns.\n\nPepper is searching for a home that will value her for her wisdom and white muzzle. If you're the home for Pepper email tierhavenrescue@gmail.com for an adoption application or visit tierhaven.rescuegroups.org for FAQs 2/2/21 9:16 AM",

            "description": "Archie is a kind soul who is estimated around 8 years of age and has clearly not had a kind life. Archie was a stray so we do not know his story however his immense fear of leashes and having his neck touched tells a less than nice story.\n\nArchie truly likes people and is a very gentle and loyal boy. He is weary of new people but warms up quickly if you go slowly and respect his boundaries. He loves following his foster family around their house and yard and is never far away. He enjoys being part of the family in a calm, steady sort of way and will go hang out in his crate when overwhelmed. Archie is extremely fearful of leashes and panics when he sees them. It has taken a lot of patience and trust building for him to let his foster family leash him. The reality is he has likely been abused and needs a family that is comfortable taking the time to earn his trust and give him his space until then.\n\nArchie could care less what the other dogs are doing. He doesn't dislike them but doesn't care to play or engage much. He is friendly and appropriate but not playful. He prefers people overall. He seems baffled by toys. Archie has done well during cat testing and his indifference towards cats would likely extend to small dogs as well.\n\nArchie is a gentle soul that has had a rough life and is seeking a calm, patient home that will take the time to earn his trust and show him a better life.

            "description": "Clara is a beautiful female Shepherd estimated around 4 - 5 years of age. Clara was in survival mode when she arrived and has been working to transition out of that and learn to trust people. We do not know her history prior to arriving at that shelter.\n\nClara has been learning to trust new people and does wonderful meeting new people on leash. She can be timid at first but is quickly won over with a few tasty treats. Once Clara warms up to a new person she behaves like a lap dog - she love cuddle and be right next to you. Overall, she is extremely sweet when given patience and space; however, she doesn't appreciate being rushed or cornered. Clara has been around a volunteers child who is very dog savvy and gives Clara her space. Clara has warmed up to the kiddo and been fine with her every since. We think Clara would do well with older children who are dog savvy but we would not recommend her for a home with younger children or children who don't understand dog boundaries.\n\nClara does wonderful with the other large dogs in her foster home and she navigates play groups well. She meets other dogs well on leash and is generally well behaved around other medium and large dogs. Clara does have a high prey and level of fixation therefore she is NOT suitable for a home with cats or small dogs. Clara does well supervised in the house and is crated when unsupervised. Clara can be barrier reactive when she is in a new place and will bark along fence lines or in the crate when she sees new people or animals. This behavior is easily redirected and this behavior subsides once she settles into a routine.\n\nClara is a sweet girl who simply hasn't been given much guidance in life and is a little lost. She is going to need a household with lots of love, patience, and dedication to showing Clara that not only does the world not have to be scary but that she can be a well-mannered dog. Given this guidance Clara is going to make a wonderful and loyal companion. If you have a place in your heart and home for Clara please request an adoption application at Tierhavenrescue@gmail.com.",

            "description": "Ebony is a striking girl around 6 years of age who is a long stay champion with Tier Haven. Ebony came to us as a young girl after being confiscated due to neglect. Ebony was a diamond in the rough and has struggled to find a home of her own since then.\n\nEbony does great with people and is a playful, social, and energetic girl. She can be reserved with new people at times but warms up quickly and once you're her friend it is for life. Ebony has settled a bit with age but still believes rules were made to be broken and everyone wants to play tug. Ebony has lived with kids over 7 years of age and done well given proper supervision and boundaries for everyone. Ebony loves to creek walk, roll in mud puddles, and generally keep you on your toes. She is also great for grooming and enjoys a good blow dry and brush out to keep her coat nice and healthy.\n\nEbony is able to coexist with other Shepherds in her foster homes but can be a dominant girl in play groups. She is wicked smart and has a mischievous streak that whispers to her that she should stir everyone up and then get out of there so she can watch them spiral. She can be pushy when meeting new dogs - quietly pestering them when you aren't looking - and does best with a structured introduction with supervision and reinforcement of boundaries. Ebony has lived with other dogs for years and can adjust to a new home with other dogs given proper boundaries. Ebony is NOT suitable for a home with cats or small dogs.\n\nEbony is searching for a loving home that will channel her energy and intelligence into a job. Ebony is going to require patience, training, and exercise but she has lots of love and laughs to give back.\n\nFor an adoption application please email Tierhavenrescue@gmail.com or visit tierhaven.rescuegroups.org for more information on our adoption process",

            "description": "Shiloh is a handsome boy who is estimated around 3 - 4 years of age. Shiloh was completely feral when he arrived with Tier Haven from Hazard, Kentucky. He had not been handled prior to that time and we are unaware of the circumstances surrounding his first few months. Despite being in various foster homes over his years with us Shiloh remains an aloof guy who prefers life on his own terms.\n\nShiloh is still learning how to trust new people and situations. Shiloh does really well with people from a distance of about 5-7 feet and will linger on the outskirts of interactions but doesn't know what to do when the attention is turned to him. Shiloh will come up and nudge from behind seeking attention but does best when there isn't a big fuss made about it. He has a desire to be around people but doesn't know how to make new friends. Shiloh has learned how to better navigate new situations with each of his foster homes and ultimately does well meeting new people in his foster homes. He has a very fun and playful personality when he is comfortable in a home and is a very well mannered boy. He prefers having a crate as a safe zone but is well behaved loose in the house as well. Shiloh has been around children over 7 years of age semi-regularly and does okay with calmer, more mature children. He gets overwhelmed easily with younger, rambunctious children and would prefer a home with a more settled atmosphere.\n\nShiloh does great with other dogs and really relies on them for social cues. Shiloh was originally found running with another dog and has always been around other dogs in his time with us. Shiloh loves to romp and run with other dogs and has a very comedic personality in the play yard. Shiloh has been around dogs of all ages and does a great job respecting boundaries the other dogs set and navigating new personalities. Shiloh has been around dogs 15 lbs and up with no concerns. Shiloh has lived with cats off and on throughout his life and generally does well. He will try to play with the cats but is respectful when they tell him to go away. Shiloh would do well adjusting into a new home with other dogs, or cats, that can help him navigate his new environment.\n\nShiloh is looking for a home with the patience and understanding to help guide his transition into a new family and new adventures. If you have a place in your heart and home for this sweet young boy please email tierhavenrescue@gmail.com for an adoption application.",

This black with rust markings Doberman has cropped standing ears and a docked tail. He lived with children and got along with his dog sister but not his dog brother.  Both males were neutered but continued to be territorial.  Zeus needs a home free of cats, also best if he is the only male.  Male dogs make him very nervous.\n\nHe is crate trained, does not fence jumping or digging holes.  He also has manners, will not jump up on people.  He is described as \"gentle and calm\" around humans and great with kids.  He will guard children; so it is best that children visit supervised but not live in the home.\n\nZeus is up to date on vaccines, on prevention - HW Negative.\nHe is from the Lone Star state and fostered in Texas, now seeking a new family.  \n\n\nIf you're interested in providing a loving forever home for Zeus, please apply at: http://www.dobermanrescuegroup.org/adopt.htm\n\n***********NOTE: We will not answer questions about any dog until we have received a completed application.\n\nFind us on Facebook to see updates and more photos of our Dobermans.\n@DobermanRescueGroupInc.\n\nZeus is available for placement in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas and Louisiana. \n\n",

            "description": "Amy came into rescue with her littermate Meg. These two cuties are very sweet and love attention.  They were found as strays and not reclaimed by the owner.  We estimate they were born in July of 2018.    The girls are very bonded and a home together would be \"pyrfect\" for them.  We hate to split up families. \n They are fine with male dogs, selective with female dogs, and are unproven with cats.  We recommend obedience training for all newly adopted pyrs, to help you create a special bond with you and your new friend, and so you have a well behaved canine. Great Pyrenees are willing to learn, but are not as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds. They are bred to be independent thinkers. Applicants must be over 25, own their own home and all children in household must be over 6 years old. Your resident pets must be up to date on vaccines, sterilized, you must have a good history of vet care for them, and you must have used heart worm preventative year round for your dogs. \n\n\nMeg and Amy will be placed as inside pets with outside privileges. You MUST have a securely fenced yard accessible from your home. Invisible fencing does not work with this breed and they will take the shock for the freedom.  Great Pyrenees are bred to roam and will create their own territory if not secured, which can led to them being lost, hit by vehicles or shot by people who see them as a threat. The breed is not a good off leash dog, and cannot be trusted to not run away.  A Great Pyrenees off leash is a \" DisAPyr.\" \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please complete the appropriate application on our website, www.igpr.org under the Adopt tab. \n\nAll of our dogs marked as needing foster homes are also available for adoption.  If a dog is listed on this site, it is available.  No need to contact us to see if it is,  We do require you  complete the adoption application prior to meeting a dog.\n\nWe also offer a foster to adopt program. You foster the dog, and have first right of refusal on them if an approved application is submitted for them. \n\nIn fostering a dog, the dog comes to you fully vetted. and groomed. You provide good quality food, grooming, and we provide the heartworm preventative and medical care, if needed* .(*Based on approval from IGPR.)\n\nAdoption fee is $600 for the pair",

            "description": "*ADOPT ME!*\nGina - 10 years old, located in Virginia\nDog ID#: 200013-P-B-FL\nIntake Date: 01/11/2020\nAvailable Date: 03/01/2020 \n\nGina is a sweet older lady who came from a shelter in Alabama. Not much is known about her life before, but she is definitely used to being in a house. She has been reliably housebroken since the day she arrived in foster care. She gets along fine with her foster brother - she would really love him to play with her, but he doesn't play with other dogs. She pounces and play-bows to no avail, but she hasn't given up yet! We don\u2019t know that she\u2019d have the energy to play for long, but she\u2019s ready to show what she can do. She\u2019s not interested in fetch or playing with us humans. She wouldn\u2019t really be a good \"kid\u2019s dog.\" She\u2019s not much into playing with people or goofing around. She\u2019d be happy with someone to relax with and a dog pal.  She does appreciate a kong with some peanut butter though.\n\nShe likes to be with you or see where you are at all times, but not to the point of separation anxiety.  We have left the house and left her uncrated for as long as 7 hours without issue. She also likes her meals to be on time (which is whenever she decides she should have it.) Gina lets you know when she is unhappy with a situation. She moans and groans. If she were a human, it\u2019d be like she was running around saying \u201cWoe is me! Woe is me!\u201d Occasionally, she sounds like Charlie Brown\u2019s teacher. \n\nShe has been going for short walks around the block, but we haven\u2019t really been able to socialize her. She is leery meeting new people and is a bit skittish around new loud things, like trucks. She does fine at the vet's office, but beyond that we haven't had the opportunity for her to meet many other people.\n\nGina has no concept of privacy and if a door isn\u2019t closed all the way, she\u2019ll shove it open and come on in. She also knows if she puts her nose under the lip on a garbage can lid or dog food container and lifts it up, it will open!  She is sneaky too (well, she tries to be) - say you\u2019re standing in front of an open pantry trying to pick a snack. That offers the perfect opportunity for Gina to come up beside you, grab something off the shelf and wander away. (\u201cIf I can get to it, it\u2019s mine!\u201d ~ Gina)\n\nGina has some of the typical \"older-dog\" things going on - she's a bit lumpy, although the ones she has had removed were all benign. She is mostly deaf. She still manages to realize anytime you\u2019re in the kitchen without her though!\n\nShe had a bunch of bad teeth and the vet removed 19! You\u2019ll need to soak her kibble or feed her soft food. She is a treat grabber. We\u2019re trying to work on \u201cgentle.\u201d We\u2019d definitely have a few notches in our fingers if she did have teeth.  We\u2019re also not sure if she can do stairs. When she walks, her back legs are stiff. We weren\u2019t sure if she could jump, but she managed to get on the couch. She doesn\u2019t reverse very well and will often end up on her butt if she tries to walk backwards. \n\nOverall, the vet thinks she's in good shape for her age.\n\nGina loves her people (especially the lady!) and would make a great companion for someone looking for an affectionate older dog with low exercise requirements. She is spayed, up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative and microchipped.\n\nIf you think Gina might be the older companion you\u2019ve been looking for, please fill out an application.\n\nWant to learn more about one of the dogs we have up for adoption?

She needs a firm handed adopter who will continue to work on her leash skills as she pulls very strongly.  A harness is highly recommended for Victoria.  She is partially housetrained and will generally keep her inside kennel clean.  She must go to a home with absolutely no other pets.  \n\nIf you would like to schedule an appointment to meet Victoria or to schedule a meet and greet with your dog, please call Isle of Wight County Animal Services at 757-365-6318.\n",

I am a sweet,\n\n4-\n\n4.5 yrs. old, Blue Nose Staffordshire Terrier saved by Rescue Ridge from a local NJ shelter. I have learned a great deal here at Rescue Ridge in Monmouth County NJ and the folks here have me set up with a professional trainer where I am learning even more. I know a few commands, take treats and food gently, love to go for walks, car rides, and play in the play yard at the kennel. I am good with large dogs and the folks here have not tested me with small dogs or cats so we are really not sure about that. What they are sure about is that I give wonderful kisses once I get to know you. I am best in an adult home with an experienced owner. I get too excited about my toys but you can correct me to let me know to stop. That is what my trainer has taught me and I am eager to learn and please you. I walk well on a leash but sometimes I want to play with my leash so please do not let me. They really want me to go to a home that is willing to keep up with my great training. If you are willing, then that would be perfect! I keep my kennel very clean and I am housebroken. I really want to go home so please apply to adopt me at rescueridge.com No inquiries, please, without an application. I sure hope to meet you soon so we can have lots of fun together! Please apply to adopt Scarlett at rescueridge.com she is waiting in her kennel in Monmouth County NJ and she is so sad seeing so many other dogs come and go.\n\nHere is my newest video:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/LjGsN0-mvlk and here is my previous video when she first arrived https://youtu.be/Ogw1Pu-T1Z0",

I am sure that comes from the many days she went without before she came here. She does need a family that is familiar with a special needs dog. She also needs some dietary help because she is now a few pounds overweight. She has overcome many issues from her broken leg, to heart worm treatment she is a survivor.",

Don't forget to fill out our online application:  http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/webform/1774/adoption-application. The minimum adoption donation ranges from $300 to $400. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is 100%25 tax deductible. Prior to placement, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are usually microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems. Our adoption process begins with completing an application on-line. A phone screening will soon follow, and lastly a home visit will be conducted by our volunteers.",

I'm a sweet, middle aged cuddle buddy, looking for an experienced dog snuggler for a lifetime relationship. Unfortunately, in my 7.5 years, I have had my heart broken too many times. Some people don't understand my \"attitude\", but I'm not really bad! I'm just a bit more cat-like than other dogs, preferring to not be moved from any spot I deem to be mine. But once I am settled in and know that you are the boss, I'll adapt to what you need.\n\nGreatest asset: I am very chill for the most part. I just want to play for a short while, then cuddle and hang out with my human. I'm also the perfect size!\n\nBiggest flaw: I've been described as being a bit \"grumpy\" when having to move from the spot I am sleeping in. I mean, who wants to be forced to give up their spot?\n\nTheme song: True Colors, Cyndi Lauper\n\nCat person or dog person?: I am totally cool sharing you with cats, or fellow dogs, as long as those dogs aren't males larger than me. What can I say? I'm quirky.\n\nKids?: I love em!\n\nIdeal Partner: An experienced dog parent who is willing to take charge and be patient while I learn what they need from me.",

His sweetness and personality really comes out as soon as he\u2019s allowed to act like a dog. He\u2019s looking for that very special home with lots of love and patience and willingness to give him as much time that\u2019s needed to learn to trust humans again. Rufus is a beautiful brown-eyed blonde.  He\u2019s been at GSHS way too long.  Rufus would love to have a furever home.  Rufus is a 6 year old hound mix.  He still has a lot of playfulness in him.  He loves walks and the puppy playground.  He needs a home with no children or older children as he can be possessive with his toys.  He does not have to be the only dog, however, a meet and greet is a must if other dogs are in the home.  Rufus is a sweetheart who gives the best puppy hugs.  Help make his Christmas wish come true. We don\u2019t think he would be good in a home with small children.",

Though he is animal friendly, unless with an experienced adopter who is versed in slow introductions, Bugz would do best in a home with no animals, or a kitty only. Bugz is a nervous guy, so he requires proper introductions with animals and people. Bugz was neglected and likely lacked socialization prior to his rescue, therefore new things can be scary to him. However, he has improved leaps and bounds with his foster families advocating for his success since he's been in the rescue\n\nJust like many of us humans who wouldn't want to be thrown into a room full of people we don't know, then expected to be social and interact; Bugz needs that same sensitivity. Once Bugz is comfortable, he loves to cuddle, be playful, and take snoozes just like any other pup. We do not recommend a home with small children as their energy might scare him.\n\nDOB is 8/2015 - Bugz is Neutered, Vaccinated, Microchipped, HW Negative\n\nAdoption Fee has Been Sponsored\n\nVisit my Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/Bugz-Journey-Looking-for-Luvz-104164107842125\n\nFill out Application: https://form.jotform.com/bullyuprescuecrew/adoption-application",

            "description": "BOXER/BULLY MIX; Sleek white jacket, black oval patch over right eye.  About 50lbs.\nADULT FEMALE; Est DOB: October 2017.\nARRIVAL: January 18, 2020\nHISTORY: Riley arrived as a stray at a high kill shelter. When space became an issue, we spoke up for her.\nEXTRA NOTE:  Riley has already developed a fan base here.  \nNo cats or dogs for Riley.\n\nVolunteer Thought: Living the life of Riley?? Well, for Riley her idea of \"living the life of Riley AKA a charmed life\" would mean giving and receiving love and attention.  As terrific as she is in getting along with humans, one would think her new home is just a tail wag away!   A very well balanced girl, Riley nicely sits when asked and if she is feeling a little more froggy, will run and chase after balls. Since coming to CFC, Riley has made it apparent that an environment surrounded by numerous dogs and without ample one-on-one human interaction like we have here, is simply not for her. When she first arrived here, she would play with other dogs and even happily go for walks with them, but as the months have rolled by, Riley has gotten more and more reactive to other dogs and for this reason, we feel that initially, she needs to be in a home where she is the only pet and with a human who will slowly try to reintroduce her to building relationships with other dogs. A skilled leash walker but perhaps at times a little more strong, Riley seeks and gives affection and would be very much in her element caring for older kids (12+) in her new home. Riley hopes to find a family who will allow her to live the charmed life she so deserves and yearns for. Think you can give this sweet girl a new home and the life of Riley that she so deserves?\n\nStaff Thought: Riley is such a loving sweetheart.  She can be a little strong on the leash like a girl on a mission but will nicely stop when I ask for her attention.  I was successful in redirecting her with a sit, which she does know and pretty much does whenever I give her the command.   Once in the arena, she was curious and would amble around, but didn\u2019t show too much of an interest in toys.  Again, I could get her attention when I called for her.  If I sat down, she would come and check in, and climbed up on the bench so she could better access my lap.  It started raining, so I didn\u2019t keep her out too long, but spent some time loving on her in her pen.  I started giving her some butt scratches and body rubs which she loved, and she in-turn started just rubbing her body all over mine giving me a full-body snuggle, which was super  adorable.  I think that she is a calm, gentle-natured girl \u2013 up for walks and adventure, but also content to just be snuggled-up next to her human.\n\n",

Please read the entire post below on how to apply, and before calling or emailing!**\n\nPapi is a very special 12lb  6-year old Chihuahua who is our longest canine resident at the AWS shelter. He has been with us 270 days. We don\u2019t know what kind of life Papi had before he was rescued from a high-kill shelter in Texas, but it was obviously a pretty bad one. Papi did not like to even be touched when he first arrived. After much love and patience, Papi is now very sweet and loving with people he knows. He actually seeks out attention and human touch. Papi has even learned to sit and shake. He is very treat motivated. Papi DOES NOT like other dogs or cats. This has not changed while being with us. So in his forever home, he must be the only pet. His forever home should also be quiet, patient, and adult only. He would be the perfect companion for an older, single person who is still active, as Papi loves his walks! In order to adopt Papi, you will have to visit and spend time with him until he is comfortable with you. Once that happens, he will be your loyal and loving best friend.  Papi has been vet checked, dewormed, heartworm tested negative, fully vaccinated and neutered.  ADOPTION FEE $200\n\nIf this is up, Papi is still available. He is here in our facility.\nPlease fill out an application online or at the facility.\nanimalwelfaresociety.net\n\n***DUE TO COVID, WE ARE OPEN BY APPOINTMENT ONLY. NO WALK-INS WILL BE ACCEPTED!\n\nIN ORDER TO ADOPT,\nYOU MUST HAVE AN APPROVED APPLICATION PRIOR TO COMING IN TO MEET AND SPEND TIME WITH A PET. OUR ONLINE APPLICATION CAN BE FOUND ON OUR WEBSITE: WWW.ANIMALWELFARESOCIETY.NET. ONCE APPROVED, WE WILL CONTACT YOU TO SET UP AN APPT. UNFORTUNATELY, WE CANNOT CONTACT EVERY APPLICANT, AS WE SOMETIMES RECEIVE OVER 100 APPS FOR ONE PET!\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING AND COOPERATION.***",

Best guess on breed would be Chihuahua with some herding dog mixed in there and possibly some sort of rare black fox - who knows!  She is around 3.5 years old.  Rosie is a cutie and she knows it - she loves any and all of the attention she can get!  She also loves her doggie foster brother even though he's a grumpy old man who is generally indifferent towards her - she is determined that he will learn to romp and play with her!  She'd love a doggie sibling to play with, but would also be fine having her forever family all to herself.  She's a great cuddle buddy on the couch (although she might give you a new gentle nudges when she's decided she needs more pets), but is also excited to go out for walks and sniff around the neighborhood.  Rosie is crate trained and attends doggie daycare with her canine friends, but needs a quieter home without children.\n\nAnimals can be viewed by appointment only. We ask that you review our adoption information AND fill out an adoption application prior to setting an appointment so we have all your information and you understand our adoption procedures - you can do so online here.     \n\nPlease feel free to email us or call us anytime for additional information on any of our animals - info@mcprescue.org or 312-388-3928. Our typical adoption fee varies based on the age of the dog at the time of rescue: Under the age of 1 years old is $500; 1-5 years old is $400; over the age of 5 is $300. Fees include vaccinations, microchip, deworming and other vetting as needed. Our adoption process includes an application, reference check and home visit.",

Frosty came into rescue after he was found injured lying under someone\u2019s porch and went unclaimed. He had some very deep puncture wounds but he has been treated at the vets office and he is healing up nicely now. They appeared to be bite marks but thankfully he is on the mend. Frosty walks well on leash and he is a bouncy happy guy - always happy to see his human or dog pals :) He would love a great home of his own and a family to love him. Frosty may have had a rough start but he has turned out to be such a great dog. He is currently in boarding sure could use a home or foster home to go to. We just love this big happy boy and so will you. We are not sure what his life was like before he came to rescue. Not sure if he lived indoors or out but he adores people so he should do just fine with a kind family to teach him all he needs to know. Please consider making this big happy boy a part of your family!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nNGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY. View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

            "description": "Hi.  My name is Flash. I'm a friendly 5-6 yr. old dalmatian labrador retriever mix who ended up in the East Valley LA City shelter.  Luckily, Rescue saw me on a video of playing dogs and knew i would make a fantastic dog for some dog loving family. I got my new name, Flash, because I was so very fast in the video.  Now I am living in a kennel in Newport Beach.  I was a bit shy when i first came in (as you can see from my sad sack photos) but now i'm enjoying playing in the yard, going on my daily walk and playing with my friends.  The walkers here are teaching me my leash manners and how to sit for treats, but i do need an experienced dog owner with lots of patience as I've had no training and am a strong bodied girl.  I also do like all of the attention when my people are around so I would be best as an only dog.  I am spayed, vaccinated and microchipped so I am ready to go anytime you call for me.  I am so looking forward to  meeting my new family .. could it be yours?\n\nIf you are interested in meeting me, please contact Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc. by email .  To ensure I would be a good fit for you and your family, Rescue requires completion of an adoption questionnaire but once submitted and approved, arrangements can be quickly made for you and your family to come meet me at the kennel.  I love making new friends so please do contact Rescue and ask about me, Flash, as soon as you can.\n\nTo learn more about Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc., a 501c3 non-profit charity, and to see all of our available dogs, please visit our website at www.dalrescuesocal.com.  You can also visit us on facebook at www.facebook.com/spottyfriends.  We love seeing posts and photos of life with your spotty friends so please, keep them coming.  Thanks!\n\n\n",

Once she does, she\u2019d love nothing more than belly scratches and attention.

            "description": "Meet Miss Thea Queen! This beautiful girl has been with us at Wanderer's for quite some time now, and by \"quite some time we mean she just passed 400 days as being a resident here at the shelter. \nWhy? Well, that's a great question with a complex answer. \nLike MOST dogs Thea is absolutely terrified, which more then likely is presented as aggression when inside her kennel. The primary reason for this is because her kennel is HER HOME. She is a young dog whose life prior to the shelter we have no knowledge of; meaning for all we know she could have escaped an inadequate living environment, OR she could have possibly had a great home. We'll never know, but that's okay!\nWith the being said, imagine being in a foreign place, your new living quarters doesn't have windows and only one way out that's locked and requires thumbs to open (now imagine being a dog for that part). Then imagine having to use the restroom but being unable to actually use the restroom. That's what it's like in the minds of most shelter dogs, you'd be a wreck too. Even though Thea is a Queen she can be a bit dramatic when meeting new people. Initially she can become defensive, definitely scared, and she'll even cower in the back end of her kennel. Maybe she'll let out a bark or 4 that doesn't show you who she actually is, what she's saying is \"HEY! The Queen doesn't know you!!! \nOur Thea here has required a bit of work to get her to where she is right now, we couldn't be more proud of her and how far she's come! After spending lots and lots of quality time with Thea we've learned so many wonderful things about her that truly did shock us! She is STRONG, but eager with a secret submissive side. She just absolutely loves laying out in the grass, all splayed out like a frog, you can truly see the happiness in her facial expression and the bliss in her eyes, it's truly a sight to see. Another fan favorite of Theas is WATER, she could spend all day in the kiddy pools, she'll wade in the water and even lay in it for an impressive amount of time too. It usually takes place after she's had an intense tug-o-war match, or fetch! She fancy's both, but her absolute favorite toys are squeaky stuffed animals, any species she doesn't have a preference, as long as she can rip it to shreds and show them who the real Queen is she's happy. You'd think she would have slipped a disk or given herself whiplash with how intensely she shakes her head back and forth.\nTheas adopter is required to continue her current obedience training. They'll need to have a very clear understanding of what it takes to properly care for her. Consistency is key for Theas success. It's highly suggested that her new owner is a single male, Thea responds impressively well to the depth of a mans voice and seemed to start obeying commands much quicker opposed to female handlers. Although it's not impossible for a women to gain her trust. \nGetting to know Thea will also require and consist of multiple visits to the shelter to guarantee a perfect fit. Thea is full of excitement and enthusiasm for every possible adventure! Will you be joining our Queen as her King? Guess you'll have to come and meet her for yourself! By appointment only, of course, being royalty and all.",

            "description": "Serabi is a beautiful and petite little girl weighing in around 12ish pounds, This sweet and scared little mama needs a very special family to help show her that the world of being spoiled and loved is not a bad one.  Serabi is NOT aggressive at all, but she is very fearful and needs someone with patience. We are requiring the future adopter to have another dog as she would do best in a home with a doggie (or a couple doggie) companions.  Serabi tries to run and hide, and only knows living as a stray. She  had a few litters on the street and lived under the same house for years but the people that lived there never got close to her or tried to socialize her. Thankfully, we were finally able to trap Serabi so that she can now live a wonderful and safe life going forward. Serabi requires a very secure fenced yard as she is terrified of the leash and will look for the smallest hole to try and escape. Serabi would do best in a home with another dog and children over the age of 10 as she is very timid and needs to be a home where they understand her.  We are hoping with patience, time and TLC Serabi will learn to not be so afraid of her new world. \n\nTo apply to adopt Serabi, please visit www.snarrnortheast.org\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, so there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $425 for adults / Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

APPLICANTS MUST LIVE IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES IN AN ADULT-ONLY HOME (NO APARTMENTS) WITH A  PRIVATE YARD.\n\nRODEO is the definition of a Rhinestone Cowboy! Not only does he have flashy good looks but his DNA results prove that he is quite a unique gem. Like many rescue dogs, his life has been off to a bit of a sad start. He was surrendered to the East Valley Animal Shelter because his family was moving to a place that didn\u2019t allow dogs. Like the song says, \"You're ridin' the RESCUE TRAIN that's takin' the long way.\" We know this buckaroo is destined for greatness and a wonderful FURever home! \n\nAt 85 pounds and a year old Rodeo is still growing. Because of his grand stature, he would require a home with a yard (NOT AN APARTMENT), a big dog lover with strong handling experience and a structured environment. Mostly comprised of Great Pyrenees, he has the potential to be protective of his family. Australian Cattle Dog and Border Collie as secondary breeds, mean someone familiar and knowledgeable with herding breeds would be highly recommended. \n\nRodeo is neutered, vaccinated and microchipped and whoever is lucky enough to adopt this rooty tooty cowboy will get an in-home dog training lesson as part of his adoption. Now that\u2019s something to YEE-HAW about!\n\n--\nIf you are interested in adopting RODEO please go to www.TheRescueTrain.org and fill out our online adoption application on the Adopt A Dog page. Applications are required PRIOR to meeting one of our animals and are used to set up a safe and successful adoption.\n\nPlease don't be shy and answer the questions thoroughly. To learn more about our entire process please visit www.therescuetrain.org and click on the Adopt A Dog page or email us at info@therescuetrain.org.\n\n*APPLICANT MUST BE AT LEAST 21 YEARS OLD*\n*APPLICANT MUST LIVE IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES*\n\nPLEASE NOTE: WE DO NOT OWN A FACILITY. Our animals are in private foster homes. If you are interested in adopting one of our animals please fill out our online application. Or check our mobile adoption schedule on our home page.",

She has endless amounts of energy and genius level intelligence. She will need someone who can give her a LOT of physical and mental exercise. She loves attention and will need loads of it. Someone wanting to adopt Carmen will need to be able to meet all of her breed\u2019s specific demands.\n\nCarmen will need:\n-3-5 hours of exercise a day\n-Daily training for mental stimulation\n-No small children in the household\n-No other dogs unless the handler is experienced with Malinois dogs living with other dogs\n-No cats or small pets in the household\n-A strong, active handler\n-Someone who has experience with Malinois dogs\nIf you can meet these requirements for Carmen then she will be one of the sweetest, most loyal,  and loving companions you can find.\n\nIf you can give Carmen an indoor forever home, please fill out our online application on our website at http://www.savingpawsrescueaz.com/adoption-form/    We will only schedule meet and greets with an approved application. We are an all-volunteer organization.  It may take a couple of days to process an application and complete reference checks.  Thank you for your interest in saving a life!\n\n                              *****Belgian Malinois Adoption requirements*****\n\nThe dog you have selected is a Belgian Malinois.  This is a breed that has very specific needs for an adoptive home.  Because of their need for a high level of exercise, both mentally and physically and their need for ongoing training, only applicants with demonstrated owner/handler experience with this breed will be considered.  The vast majority of them are not best suited as family pets, but in homes with experienced handlers knowledgeable of their needs and breed characteristics.  We will not place in homes with small children or small dogs/cats.  Must be previous owner/handler to be considered \n\n\n\n",

            "description": "Name: Kane\nAge: 4 years\nMedical - special food diet - salmon kibble; allergies\nNo small children, other dogs or cats  \n\nVolunteer favorite big boy Kane is ready and waiting for his forever home! You may remember Kane came to us about a year ago from a high-kill shelter in California. He is approximately four years old and likely spent most of his life as an outdoor dog. He was fortunate enough to go for a little staycation with one of our volunteers recently. She reports: \u201cKane is a very good dog! This big boy loves to cuddle on the couch and cannot get enough belly rubs. He is mostly well mannered but can sometimes be a lot to handle in a puppylike way. Kane is mouthy when he gets excited but is easily redirected. Since being in a house is new for him, he\u2019s very curious and wants to be in the middle of everything. He may run off with a shoe or swipe something out of the fridge, but he is good about giving things back. He\u2019s a good boy at night, either sleeping on the bed or the floor nearby. Kane is a hungry boy, very food motivated, and needs to learn some manners around people food. Kane is not destructive in the house, though he will destroy toys when he gets excited. He was left alone in the house for several hours without issue. Overall Kane is a big sweetheart who wants to please and just needs some direction. Fun fact \u2013 he loves to eat ice cubes!\u201d \nKane will require a strong handler to help him with his leash skills. Since he is so large, he should not be in a home with small children. Additionally, he should be the only pet in the house. His skin issues are still healing and of course SPR will always be available to help any future foster or adopter until he is fully healed.\n\nKane is going to  take a dedicated adopter who wants to be a part of his journey.  Are you up for the challenge? \n\nIf you can give Kane an indoor forever home, please fill out our online application on our website at http://www.savingpawsrescueaz.com/adoption-form/  \n\n We will only schedule meet and greets with an approved application. We are an all-volunteer organization.  It may take a couple of days to process an application and complete reference checks.\n\nThank you for your interest in saving the life of a dog.",

But then I was rescued and adopted by my loving mom. Unfortunately, my mom is having some health issues and I\u2019m staying at the vet right now until I can find another home where I\u2019ll be just as loved. TFTR is helping me find just the right family!\n\nI turned 13 in November, so I\u2019d love a home where I can have lots of love, snuggle in comfy beds, and hang out with you!\n\nI have a very special walk because I had 2 broken bones in the puppy mill and no one took care of me, so my legs didn\u2019t get a chance to heal the way they were supposed to. But I still get around just fine and only need pain meds every now and then to help me feel better.\n\nI get along well with other dogs, but I am a little shy with people until I have a chance to get to know you. I had a doggie door in my last home, so I may need some help learning how to potty in the right place if you don\u2019t have one at your home!\n\nI\u2019m located in Muskogee, OK and am up to date on my shots, am heartworm negative, and spayed. Transport is possible to surrounding areas like MO, TX, AR, and KS!",

            "description": "Harley Rose is about 8 years old . She was a Truckers dog all her life and one day was abandoned behind a warehouse . I caught her and have had her for two years with no luck of finding her forever home. She is good with kids, she is house trained , toy proactive and doesn\u2019t appear to be food aggressive. She likes small male dogs only. She loved baths and car rides. She\u2019s very loving and playful and makes an excellent guard dog. She does have anxiety issues . She does not do well with other dogs her size and females. \n\nCurrently in Ontario, California \n\nCourtesy post: \nplease contact Julia at (909) 994-3764",

            "description": "Hi all! I\u2019m Toaster! My friends call me Toast for short. I\u2019m not really sure how I got my name. Although the more that I think about it, maybe it\u2019s because when you meet me, I will make your heart all warm and toasty? Yes, I think maybe that HAS to be it! Mystery solved! Although since I solve mysteries so well, maybe I should have been named Scooby Doo!\n\nAnyhow, before I get distracted, let me tell you some things about me. I\u2019m about 5 years old and they think I\u2019m a mastiff or Cane Corso mix. So I\u2019m kind of a big guy! But that doesn\u2019t mean I have a big head! I mean, PHYSICALLY I do have a big head. What I mean is I don\u2019t have a big head like a big ego. Gosh, sometimes it\u2019s difficult to communicate in human. \n\nReally, I\u2019m just a happy guy, who is extremely curious about new things. I love going on walks and checking everything out with my nose. I really love checking out storm drains and sewers. I mean, you never know what might be living in them! I seem to like to meet new people on my walks, too. I usually walk quite nicely on the leash unless I see something I really want to check out, and then I forget not to pull. It\u2019s hard to remember to walk nicely when you seek something really interesting! But I\u2019m more than happy to work on my leash manners a bit. \n\nI absolutely love riding in the car, and I am VERY well behaved riding in the car. I also love to play with toys like tennis balls and stuffies. I will admit, I sometimes think I\u2019m the size of a puppy and I often get bouncy like a puppy! And I\u2019ve been known to do zoomies when I get really excited. It seems to make everyone laugh. And I sure like making people laugh. I\u2019ve been known to give big slurpy kisses and to \u201chug\u201d people when I think they need it. So I hope you like kisses and hugs.\n\nI like when humans pet me, but I much prefer booty scratches to head scratches. (I\u2019ll let you in on a little secret; many dogs prefer that!) I think there\u2019s almost nothing as good as a good booty scratch. Except maybe car rides. \nI\u2019m pretty good at sitting when asked, and I\u2019m learning new things. I just haven\u2019t had a whole lot of training with such requests, but I am receiving some now and I love to learn! Especially when learning is accompanied by some tasty treats!\n\nI am NOT a fan of cats. Well, I mean I AM a fan of CHASING cats, but that activity seems to be frowned upon. So I need a home without cats. In fact, I'd like to be your one and only pet, if you don't mind.  \n\nIf you are interested in making your heart feel all Toasty, or want to find out more about me, please call/text The Pet Connection at 913-671-7387.\n\n\nINTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS PET?

She's sexy and she knows it!\n\nGabi is young and full of energy. She would love a home with a fenced-in yard and another dog to rough and tumble with.  She has been fine with every dog we have introduced her to - big, small, grumpy, and happy. She does best with dogs of similar size (she's about 70 lbs) and energy level. She also would be fine as an only dog as long as she gets plenty of exercise.\n\nGabi will need time to adjust to her new humans and she has a touch of stranger danger, but she's been through extensive training to help build her confidence.  Gabi is super intelligent and really wants to please her humans so she would be a great dog for someone interested in ongoing training exercises.\n\nShe would be fine with sturdy kids over the age of 12 who are respectful of the dogs they share their home with.  She walks best on a harness, she is housetrained and just wants love, pets, and treats.\n\nGabi is a no cat kind of gal. She is way too interested in them, and when they hiss or paw at her, it's game on. \n\nThis pretty gal is currently in Nashville, and can travel anywhere we place dogs and we would even consider a foster-to-adopt depending on your location. If you lead an active lifestyle, this is the gal for you. She is fun, lovely, soft and beautiful and will be the best companion you could ask for. To foster or adopt this amazing girl, please visit our website at www.bigfluffydogs.com, click on Foster or Adopt and fill out the required form found there for her. Once that's complete, please email debbie@bigfluffydogs.com for more information on this beautiful girl.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

            "description": "Attention, humans: Sweet senior lady MOLLY is seeking a furever home! Molly is a brindle baby with soft fur, soulful eyes, and a gentle spirit. Although this poor girl was surrendered by her previous owners, she hasn't lost her love for humans. Molly's love even extends to her toys! She has never met a squeaky toy she didn't like, and she has a stuffed monster sidekick that accompanies her everywhere. This sweet senior is potty trained and crate trained, and she knows basic commands like 'sit' and 'wait.' Mellow Molly is always excited for dinner, but she spends the rest of her days content to snooze in the slivers of sunshine that slide through a window or in the soft space next to her humans. If your arms are a bit empty or your home needs some love, apply to adopt MOLLY today! Give this golden girl the best in her golden years! All Dallas Pets Alive adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon adoption. The standard minimum donation for dogs over six months to seven years is $200, puppies under six months is $250, dogs eight years and over are $100 unless specified otherwise. You can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallaspetsalive.org/adopt/adoptable-dogs/ .

Once your application has been submitted, our Adoptions Team will be in contact shortly to set up a phone interview and a home visit.\nFunny, happy, expressive and comical, meet Mila! This happy weirdo is 4-5 years old, and a little imp of a thing at 35-40 lbs. She's silly and bouncy, but not wild, more like moderate energy with a tendency to popcorn when she's excited. Mila has a terrible poker face, if she's thinking it, you're going to know it immediately, she makes the best faces. Mila gets along great with non-confrontational boyfriends, but has no use for bossy or rude girls. Cats? Not a chance, she's waaaay too interested in kitty. Her funny little terrier personality has plenty of goofy quirks to keep you laughing, and she bonds super close to her human, so expect an audience for whatever you happen to be doing. Looking for a goofy, comical little sprite to brighten your days? Mila may just be the one! Apply to adopt Mila at southofthebully.comOur adoption fee is $300. This covers spay/neuter, microchip, microchip registration, all age appropriate vaccines, and any needed vet care.\n1/31/21 1:12 PM",

He does like to play with dogs, so another small dog would be great for him.  Please know large dogs pose a risk to little Meno as he can't see to get out of their way so a home without large dogs is preferred.  Meno also enjoys being in your lap and being carried around.\n\nHe needs a home where someone is home with him, or can take him to work and not be left crated all day alone.\nHe is potty trained as long as you pay attention to his cues. \n\nMeno will need  a few visits with any potential adopter before going home with someone as he needs to feel secure. This is a must!\nHe is crate and puppy pen trained. Does good on a leash. Good on car rides.\n\nA fence is required! Please research caring for a blind dog before applying.\nPlease make sure you meet the requirements before applying for this sweet boy.\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in Meno please fill out an application at fuzzballrescue.com.  We are an all volunteer organization and it can take a while to go through applications and receive a call from us.\n\nApplications are at fuzzballrescue.com under forms.",

While not all are in the immediate area, once we have processed and approved your application, we will move the dog to our adoptive area for you to meet, greet and hopefully adopt. Sometimes we will have more than one application on a dog. That does not mean it automatically goes to another family but you should be aware of the fact that until you are approved and set up for the meet/greet.. the dog could get adopted by another applicant.NOTE- MICHELLE IS LISTED AS A COURTESY FOR ANOTHER RESCUE ORGANIZATION. PLEASE SEE CONTACT INFO BELOW.Have you always dreamed of having a beautiful girl what you can dress in frilly things? Now you can impress your friends with a pitbull adorned in bows and lace! Michelle is a 6-8 year old pitbull terrier who weighs about 60 pounds. She is a quirky, smart and fun girl who knows what she likes....and doesn't! Michelle wants to be your only child, watch tv on your couch, and look out your window to see what she can see! She has plenty of energy to strut around the neighborhood making you look good and is calm enough to snuggle up for a weekend of Netflix and chill! She is crate trained and house trained and has excellent indoor manners!A reduced adoption fee of $100 does apply for Michelle, our seniors, special medical and behavioral needs dogs and other 'slow to adopt' dogs!Augusta Dog Adoptions is an all- volunteer, foster- based rescue. We take applications online and are scheduling individual adoptions in the Waynesboro, VA area during the pandemic. A $175.00 adoption fee ($300 for puppies under 6 months old) helps us take care of all the dogs we rescue. All dogs are spayed/neutered, tested for heartworm and tick borne diseases (if old enough), microchipped, and vaccinated for rabies (if old enough), distemper/parvo and bordetella. They are also treated for internal and external parasites. Many dogs also receive extensive medical care such as dental work and major surgeries. For more information and to apply to adopt, please visit www.augustadogadoptions.orgIf you google our address, you will be directed to Richmond. That is NOT our adoption event location.",

This is a high-energy, loving (gives small kisses), strong boy who will need an active owner willing to give him everything he needs - from the love, attention, good-quality human companionship to the structure, regular daily exercise and any training necessary for him to live up to his breed and his potential to be an awesome canine companion. He will want to be with you as much as possible. When Spike is thoroughly comfortable in his new Forever home, he will benefit from positive basic obedience training to help with leash training, any other obedience commands and the all important bonding process. Spike may have problems with some dogs (at present, the volunteers with Halfway to Home have not seen evidence of this but it will be wise to introduce Spike to any other dogs slowly). He is crate friendly. For more information on Spike, please call Sandy at tele # 661-824-4495 (this is a land-line phone).",

            "description": "~ THIS IS A COURTESY POST ~ DO NOT CONTACT MASSPAWS ~ \nPlease email the shelter at: adoption@popememorialcvhs.org and be sure to tell them ARK sent you!  \n\n Molly is a 4-year old, 58-pound female hound mix located in Dover, NH. She is a very sweet, active, and cuddly young lady but struggles from fear and stress caused by a life of change and uncertainty. We have more information about Molly\u2019s past that may help her find the right adopter and environment. \n\nMolly is best-suited for a rural home in a low-traffic area. She will make a nice addition to a quiet family consisting of adults only. No cats, kids, or regular visitors. Molly gets along great with most dogs, but at times prefers to be the alpha depending on the other dog\u2019s personality. Molly would enjoy having a compatible dog sibling. Her favorite pastimes are playing, cuddling and calling dibs on the coziest spot in the house. \n\nIn 2017, Molly originally came to Pope Memorial Humane Society in 2017 from a southern shelter. She was adopted out twice but returned and has been back since June 2019. The first adoption didn\u2019t work out because the adopters reported that Molly had behavioral issues and they did not trust her. There is no record of details, but there was no report of biting. The second adoption was to a couple with a dog. They had her well over a year before returning her because she did not do well with new people coming to the house, especially their grandchildren. They felt she was not safe to have around the children. \n\nFor the past year as a shelter dog, Molly has shown fear aggression and defensive behaviors towards new people. There have been several incidents with the public sticking their hands in her kennel and she has bitten them causing puncture wounds. This is due to her fear of a people reaching over her as she does not trust strangers.  \n\nFor the last several months, she has become more fearful of meeting new people so the shelter\u2019s trainer recommended muzzle training. She now meets people wearing a basket muzzle. She would need to meet an interested adopter many, many times as she tends to not get along with people on the first or second introduction. The shelter staff agree she is worth every bit of extra time and patience. Once comfortable, the playful lovable girl shines through. \n\nIn her new home, Molly would need to continue her training and work on her confidence and trust with people. This will be a lifelong commitment and may need constant management. She would not be a good candidate for large gatherings, doggie daycare, etc. She requires a quiet, calm home to be successful and feel safe. Outside of the shelter and once adjusted, behavior modification and training should be much more effective. \n\nPlease email the shelter at: adoption@popememorialcvhs.org and be sure to tell them ARK sent you! \n",

Double merle refers to a genetic condition that occurs when two blue merle dogs are bred together.  The condition sometimes causes deafness and sometimes causes blindness and sometimes causes both.  I am deaf and visually impaired-- I can see light and shadows.  Some people may be put off by my so called disabilities; but I sure don't let my disabilities stop me!  I navigate the world with my nose and sense of smell.  I LOVE people, other dogs, playing outside and chewing up stuffed toys (and my dog bed).  My foster mom says I am a wonderful dancer--when outside in the back yard  I often break out into a joyful choreography of jumps, leaps and spins! A home with a fenced yard is must for me...not only to make me happy but to keep me safe.   I am spayed, up-to-date on vaccinations,  house-broken, crate-trained and beginning to learn touch training.   If you are interested in meeting me, please contact kathie@herdingahven.org",

We do not ship our dogs and all adoptions are completed in person in the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma area.Update 7/11/19 -- I did it! I have graduated from a training program. I am leash, house, agility course and crate trained. I know my basic commands and a few tricks too. Adopt me now so we can continue to work on my manners together.\nHello, please call me Elvis. I am about four years old and weigh 69 pounds. I came to the rescue from a rural shelter. They said I didn't have a chance of being adopted because I was so afraid of life. Well, you would be too if you had walked in my shoes. Anyways the rescue is helping me trust people and find the right loving home.\nI love to throw around toys with no stuffing. It is fun to play with the other dogs about my size once I know they won't hurt me. I like to let loose sometimes and run around in the fenced yard. I feel safe in my crate when you are not at home. I don't want to be left outside in the yard, please let me be with you. I don't hunt and am terrified of noises like guns make. I am a sweet gentle spirited boy.\nI have been neutered, microchipped and vaccinated. My adoption fee is 175.00. To adopt me, Elvis, please go to dogsasfamily.org and fill out the adoption application. I need you.",

Once bonded she will follow you around and listens amazing. In the beginning she wouldnt let us touch her face now she lays in our laps, kisses us, lets us kiss her and rub her face. She has found out was love it.she loves playing fetch as well!! She will make someone a wonderful travel/ hiking companion. She can be a little timid at times so i wouldnt want her around young young children under 5 or so that might run up and jump on her. She is such a loving girl now and deserves to have a family of her own.",

            "description": "LOVES older kids but no other pets\n\nThis is beautiful Lilly Bloom with her cream and white coat. She is approximately 4 years old and weighs about 35 lb. She appears to be a small Staffordshire terrier. Lilly needs a home with a fenced yard and a pet parent who can make sure she is exercised regularly. She is a sweet strong girl, but does not get along with other animals. She is loving and is also good with children, but needs an only-pet home.Lilly is spayed, UTD on vaccines, heart worm negative and microchipped. To find out more about Lilly Bloom, call her foster mom, Sharon, at 865-255-5567. Lilly's adoption fee is $175.00 She is located in Knoxville, TN and we will help with transport to her new family. The first step is always an application found at: www.bostonterriertn.org\n\nNOTE: Submission of an application and fee does not guarantee adoption of any specific Boston, since that particular dog may have applications pending or may not be the right match for you.\n\nPlease use the foster momma or dad's contact information above for questions.\nThe process always begins with an application which can be found at The Boston Terrier Rescue of East Tennessee website\nNote that in most cases, we do not adopt to families with small children, e.g., 'under 6,' as a precaution to the child's safety and the dog's safety. In some cases with larger Boston mixes or other dogs, we do make exceptions. Please ask the foster momma.\nWe prefer to place dogs within driving distance of where they are being fostered. If someone from outside the local area is approved for adoption, they must be willing to personally drive/fly to get the dog. The East Coast division (NC/SC/VA/MD/DC) does have special transport capabilties for their kids. Ask them.\nAlso, submission of an application and fee does not guarantee adoption of any specific Boston since that particular dog may have applications pending or may not be the right match for you. 1/31/21 2:42 PM",

Max is looking for a mature, active family. He would be a great hiking partner - he has the energy and stamina for it. Max would prefer not to share a home with small animals - but a pup of similar or larger size is possible. Meet n' greets are a must. \n\nAt the present time Max's bff is a pink flamingo....he can get quite a squeak out of it....and he will play flamingo for quite awhile. \n\nMax is 4- 5 years old. He is vaccinated, microchipped, neutered and on preventatives. He's just waiting for a home to call his own. \n\nYou may apply to add Max to your family by applying at www.hillhounds.org \n",

But the best part of Bear-Bear is that once he connects with you, he will bless you with so many gifts of unconditional love. The way he looks at you with his expressive eyes. His bouncy, hoppy run when he is excited to see you or wrestle with you. The way he not-so-gracefully plops down into a sploot on the grass after his walk. His side licks that never make contact on your face as he is staring into your eyes. His piggy snorts that make you giggle, especially on a rough day. When he is sleeping, and all of sudden he starts barking and moving his legs wildly. Never waking up unless you gently rub his back for which he will look at you with one eye, and quickly fall back to sleep. Or, when you hug him, and he feels like a soft teddy bear. The longer he lives with you, the more he will open himself up to you. You will eventually ask yourself, why wasn't he in my life sooner.",

She is good with other dogs and just a true sweetheart. She is past that hyper puppy stage and pretty mellow. She just wants to kick back on the couch and cuddle with you while you binge watch your favorite show. \nBetty does have a couple issues...she is heartworm positive. She is currently on monthly heartworm prevention and we will retest her in 6 months even if adopted. She also can be an escape artist. She will climb out of the yard if she wants to be with you.  She can and will escape a wire crate if scared or anxious, which thunderstorms scare her. So, Betty truly needs a home where someone is home almost all the time. Someone retired or someone that can take Betty with them when they travel. \nBetty is a beautiful girl and a sweetheart. She is housetrained and crate trained. She is a hefty girl at 74 lbs.   Her adoption fee is $95, includes her spay, deworming, vaccinations, flea/tick control and microchip. Apply online at www.arlorescue.org\nHelp us find Betty the perfect home and share!\n",

            "description": "(Version fran\u00e7aise disponible ici: \nhttps://www.sitwithme.ca/fr/dogs/jakk/) \n\n\nJakk\nAmerican Pit Bull Terrier\n3-4 Years\nMale\n\nDogs: Possibly, with the right dog - female only\nCats: No, thank you.\nKids: 12+\nHousing Type: Detached or country homes only\nFenced Yard: Required - special consideration will be given to country homes\nSpecial: Jakk is fostered near Ottawa/Gatineau and needs at least 2 meet and greets near his foster home prior to placement.\u00a0 We are ONLY considering homes within 3 hours of Ottawa who are willing to travel here for these meet and greets.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nJakk will need a home in areas with breed neutral laws. At this time he needs to find his forever home outside of Ontario.\n\nMeet the very handsome Jakk!! This fit and trim boy is a wicked amount of fun. He absolutely adores playing in his fenced-in yard with his foster family. He loves playing with balls, sticks and anything else he can find. Jakk also loves to go on forest hikes, and he is rather easy to run with a back belt and bungee line.\n\nJakk likes to always hold a toy in his mouth and will trade his toy for cookies with ease. It is very endearing so see him carry his stuffy around. Jakk can be a bit intense and has worked very hard with his foster home to always offer a controlled behavior like \u2018sit\u2019 and waiting for a release before being let out of his crate or to go out the doors. Jakk is looking for a family that wants to continue working on impulse control, he is a very smart boy but had a tough start without a lot of learning how to be calm and wait for what he wants.\n\nJakk is crate trained but requires an indestructible crate. In this crate he is fine for a typical work day on his own. He is good more or less all the time, but he is powerful and if he wants out it does not take much for him to destroy a normal crate. He does settle down quickly and sleeps well in his crate. Jakk is also house trained.\n\nJakk has lived with another dog in the past and could likely live with another laid back, female pooch. Jakk likes to chase and sometimes \"taste\" the kitties, so no cats in his forever home please! Due to Jakk's size, energy and small quirks, a home with older children is best.\n\nJakk is very food motivated and will work very hard to earn his treats! He likes routine and structure and will do best in a home that will provide a regular structured day for him.\n\nIf you are looking for the most handsome good boi that is ready to be your one and only, apply for him at www.sitwitme.ca/dogs/jakk\n\n",

Because of Ryder's size, he will not be eligible to be placed in a home with small children, small dogs or cats. Ryder is well behaved indoors, is housetrained, but can be a food thief if you are not watching. He is housetrained. Ryder is a bit shy with new people but once he warms up he loves people especially women - and men that are patient and calm. He is in good health and submissive with adults and kids.\n\nWant to Get One Step Closer to Adopting your New Furry Family Member?\n\nVisit our website at www.akitaangels.org.

Please email outreach@kokomohumane.org for additional information.\nCATS- Our felines located at the Kokomo PetSmart store are available for adoption at the moment. Please make sure that you are serious about adopting before asking a PetSmart staff member to handle our cats. They will contact us in order to complete your adoption.\n________________________________\n\n\nI am not only available for adoption but I can participate in our Dog Day Out program! This means you can come up to the shelter, bring your license, and take me out for the day! I just have to return before 4:30. Some stipulations include no dog parks or other dog to dog interactions on our outing and approved people food only. We can go to pet stores, Lowe's, Rural King, parks or even to your home! For my Dog Day Out I have given the humans some dos and don'ts. Do: give me treats, pets, walks and maybe even some toy time. Mostly treats and pets though. Don't: touch my tail or grab my collar those things scare me!\n\nCome visit this furry friend anytime Monday through Saturday 12-5 (check our website for holiday hours). The adoption fee for adult dogs is $150 and under 6 months is $180, check our Facebook page for current adoption specials! This includes the spay/neuter, microchip, vaccines and any goodies to be sent home with the particular dog!\n",

            "description": "DaisyJane is a senior lady who came to BHRG with her sister, Petunia, from a county animal control. Petunia has since gone on to the Rainbow Bridge, so DaisyJane is learning to live life without her. DaisyJane is 16 years old and is tri-colored. She loves the warm house, plenty of food, and soft fluffy beds. She gets along fine with other dogs and with the humans she's met.\n\nShe says... \"Hello everybody, yes you who are reading all about me! I may be 16 and deaf but I love my zoomies around the house and finish up with a jump into my warm fluffy bed. I'm learning about belly rubs, ooh, they're so good! When you have my attention, you're my best buddy. I get along with my dachshund siblings and I'm told I'm sweet tempered, whatever that means. When the weather is nice, foster Mom and I go for a wandering slow walk to check out the neighborhood if it isn't much farther than a couple of driveways down the block. I have a marvelous boowoo, deep and melodious. I go outside often to check on what's happening in the backyard, must keep them chipmunks and squirrels in their places. And at other times I do what us fabulous senior dogs love to do most, nap and dream in comfort, safe and loved. Would you consider sharing your home with me? What time I have left is being well spent. I'm protected, safe, warm, I have a full tummy and love. I'm not much trouble and I'm so darned lovely. Think about it, huh?\n\nAn adoption application is required but does not commit you to adoption. For the application and information about the adoption process, please visit  www.bhrg.org.",

            "description": "Yote is one and a half years old and about 15 lbs. He looks like a chihuahua/corgi mix. Tan with white. He is OK with other dogs; terrified of people. He should calm down with love, patience, CBD oil, someone experienced with quasi-feral animals.\nHe is neutered, has his shots, and is chipped. Very shy of people - taking CBD oil. He is a special socialization healing project. Foster home would be wonderful. These guys 'n gals can and will heal - given time to trust at their own speed and appropriate care.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

Treatment for that continued upon arrival here, yet her vision left her shortly after she came in and her temperament began to shift. Miraculously, Gracie has come full circle, regaining her sight, as well as her health and her love of life!  She remains on supplements for her eyes, but is doing so great.  She enjoys people, swimming, play-time and walks and is ready for a lasting connection with someone equally special!",

He is special needs because he witnessed his mom being shot, So now, if you try to touch him he lets out a scream (like an actual short little scream) and tries to run to another part of the house. He gets over it quickly and he's happy to follow you around the house and play with dog friends, the scream is just a little nerve-racking the first time you hear it ;-)\n\nIf you have a friendly female dog who wants a buddy and you're ok with having a funny dog, he's very good-natured and sweet. \n\nHe is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, and crate-trained. He is about 1-1/2yrs old.\n\nOur process is to contact us via email DesertPawsNM@gmail.com (please do not call). We have an online application, we have a meeting at your home with your family members including current pets. (Yes we bring the pet to you!) a trial adoption and stay in touch - we love updates! \n.\nWe adopt locally to the Santa Fe, central ABQ, Rio Rancho and Los Alamos areas of New Mexico.",

We need to know about the dog so we can accurately place it in a foster home and a forever home. WE do not direct place from a surrender to an adopter.  The dogs are with us until  they can be vetted and we get to know them.\n\nStep TWO is to go meet the dog and evaluate it for rehoming.  If he wants to eat our volunteer we can not take it in.\n\nStep THREE is to contact the vet for their take on the dog and make sure we have all the medical records.  We can not take in a dog and bring it across state lines with our a current rabies shot and a negative heartworm test.\n\nStep FOUR is to line up a FOSTER home for the dog.\n\nEven if the dog is coming in from a shelter we still need to do steps ONE, TWO AND FOUR.  Luckily most shelters handle the medical paperwork and are ready to turn the dog over to us",

            "description": "\nOur loving, bonded babies Marley and Solo are looking for their forever home together. These two are incredibly friendly and loving, and they care deeply for each other, so they must stay together. They are searching for their special forever home.\n\nMarley is an 8 year-old, female, long haired Mini Dachshund, and Solo is an 8 year-old male Chihuahua Mix. Solo is more outgoing -- in fact, one of the friendliest of chihuahuas! Marley is a bit more laid-back, but just as loving when she gets to know you, plus she is gorgeous.\n\nOne of their top hobbies is snuggling together in their soft bed. But they really excel at keeping their foster Mom\u2019s lap warm! \n\nThey get along with other dogs, and also with kids. At another foster\u2019s house, they even ignored the cat. They\u2019ve both been out on a leash and Solo, in particular, really enjoys it. Marley doesn\u2019t want to be left behind, so she goes too!\n\nThey are house-trained as long as they stay on their routine, and are up to date on vaccinations, heartworm testing and have their identification chips.\n\nMarley and Solo require a home with a fenced yard, and only local adopters in the Cincinnati, Columbus or Dayton region will be considered.\n\nThese guys are too good to pass up! They are like a little combined unit of sweetness!\n\nIf you have any questions regarding Marley and Solo, please email their foster mom at alicia.heidorn@gmail.com. If you would like to be considered to adopt them, please submit an Adoption Application Form through our website; www.PuppyPalsRescue.com. Thanks!",

            "description": "Breed Guess: Carolina Dog Mix \nAge: 2 years old \nGender: Neutered Male\nChildren: NOT UNDER 10 years old\nCats: No\nDogs: Meet and Greet required\nHousebroken: Unknown\nWeight: 85 pounds\nAdoption fee: $195.00\n\nLeo is a sweet & active boy. He needs some time to warm up to people, but once he\u2019s built a connection, he will reveal his sweet and goofy side. He is especially wary of men; at no fault of his own due to past experiences. It takes longer for him to adjust to men in the home so, he would prefer one without men if possible.\n\nLeo would not do well in a home with small animals like rodents or cats as he has a high Prey drive. \n\nObedience training is a must for Leo; he is still learning the world and is still figuring out what is and is not okay. He is not for a first time dog owner - he\u2019ll need a gentle, but firm leader, due to both his breed as well as his past.  If you have interest in this boy, please do research on this breed prior as he will need an experienced owner. Leo doesn\u2019t realize his size sometimes, but listens well to positive corrections. He LOVES food and will respond well to training with treats.\n\nLeo is a gentleman on car rides, enjoys walks once he is comfortable, and is great at giving snuggles. Leo\u2019s favorite thing to do is play in his kiddie pool, he enjoys sticking his whole mouth in to try and get the most water he possibly can. Leo will need a dog friend to tag along with or plenty of playtime and walks. A fenced in yard is also required, and no apartments for this big lug.\n\nLeo will require a few meet and greets with any potential adopters due to his wariness towards people. Leo likes most other dogs; he would prefer a dog friend, but a meet and greet will be needed to make sure Leo is the perfect fit!\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project (www.animalrescueproject.org) is committed to the best possible veterinary care for the pets it rescues and it is looking for adopters who will be similarly committed.\n\nAll dogs and puppies are given a general check-up when they enter our program. They receive medication to remove any intestinal parasites (worms), fleas, and ticks they may have. Dogs greater than six months of age are checked for heartworm. If heartworm positive, the Animal Rescue Project treats the disease. Dogs and pups receive all age-appropriate vaccinations for distemper, and dogs greater than four months of age are also vaccinated for rabies, in compliance with State of Michigan laws.\n\nMost dogs and older puppies are spayed or neutered before adoption. In the case of puppies not old enough to be safely sterilized, a $50 deposit is required at the time of adoption and is refunded to the adopter with proof of sterilization.\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project requires every adopter to establish an active relationship with a veterinarian no later than 10 days after adoption. Adopters will receive a plan for routine veterinary care at the time of adoption and are expected to work with their vet to complete the plan.",

            "description": "Winter aka Winnie\n\nLocated in western NE\nChihuahua mix \n5 years old\nGood with other dogs\nGood with cats\nGood with kids with dog manners\nNO MEN\nHouse trained \nKennel trained and knows a couple commands\nLoves to cuddle \nUp to date on vaccines, will be spayed shortly\n5lbs \n\nWinnie needs a new foster or foster to adopt home without a male.\n\nThis is Winnie and she's the sweetest little gal. Her story is an epically sad one.\n\nWe acquired Winnie after an epic mess of a situation regarding 2 adult Chihuahua mixes in Sterling CO. We were contacted and asked to take 2 adults, a male and female. We said we absolutely would and tried to coordinate pick up, however before we could drive to Sterling to get them picked up the owner gave them away. About 3 weeks later we were contacted because the woman she gave them to couldnt keep them, however now there was also a newborn puppy involved. We contacted the woman named Brenda and offered to take the family, she didnt want to give up the mother and pup. We agreed to take the male but we couldnt get there the same day and so Brenda dumped him. \n\nAt this point we were very obviously concerned for the safety of the momma and pup with this Brenda woman however it was out of our hands. About a week later we got a message that Brenda had dumped the momma back with the original owner who couldnt keep her. At this point the puppy was 3 weeks old. It is 100% illegal to knowingly separate a momma and pup at this age, not to mention is inhumane and selfish. She said that the momma (Winnie) was not nursing the puppy and then began \"attacking\" the puppy which turned out to just be simply nipping at the puppy. \n\nWhen I got to Sterling to pick up the momma what I saw was beyond alarming. This dog was completely emaciated, she maybe had a body score of 1.5 and thats being generous. We scooped her up and went to speak to this Brenda woman who was refusing to give up the puppy. What she, to this day, refuses to understand is that momma had very little milk because SHE WASNT PROPERLY FED, AT ALL! We're sure she was nipping at the puppy because she was barely surviving herself. Sybil and another amazing volunteer, Jannette, went to speak with Brenda in hopes that she could be reasoned with to be a slightly decent human being, unfortunately that became clear that it wasnt possible. We did take Winnie in so she could see her pup and her desire to be with her pup was obvious and heartbreaking as the Brenda woman could have cared less. \n\nWe took Winnie and got her settled into a foster where we began to evaluate her properly. We noticed very quickly that she had issues beyond being completely emaciated. Her legs and tail were deformed, and her skin was very dry and easily breaking and her coat was brittle and thin. On top of all of this she was stressed beyond belief and scared out of her mind, not to mention grieving for the puppy that was cruelly taken from her. \n\nWe took her to the vet and honestly what we were told was pretty obvious. This dog had been neglected her entire life . She was likely born with bad luxating patellas and instead of taking her to the vet and having them corrected they just ignored the issue, at this point she has no knees and she has such significant scar tissue that she will never walk normally, and wheels may be in her future. There is no surgery at this point that can correct it because of the amount of scar tissue. Make no mistake she spent years in pain. Her tail was broken and never corrected. She has lacked proper nutrition for years. The good news is that she is safe now and has been in a fantastic foster home where she is loved beyond measure while we continue our plan of attack to get her as healthy as possible. Winnie is the product of 100% irresponsible animal ownership and neglect. We did contact law enforcement but AC couldnt do anything as the puppy wasnt in bad condition. This tiny princess didnt deserve how horrible her life has been, but she is so epically deserving of the fantastic future ahead of her. She will be available for adoption to a loving home as soon as she is healthy enough to be spayed which is close. In the mean time however we have found she doesn't like men. She does great with her foster momma and human foster sibling but not well with her foster dad. She is dog friendly but she does best with calm and passive dogs. We would love to find Winnie a new foster or foster to adopt home where she can continue to grow and recover without the company of an adult male.\n\nIf you can help this tiny lil lady let us know! \n\n $200.00 Adoption Fee \n(Which is considered a non refundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website. All of our dogs and cats are in foster homes and we have no paid staff. If you have questions concerning a specific animal, PLEASE fill out an application and the foster parent will be in touch. We will not arrange any home visits with any of our dogs and cats until your application is processed. Please understand our foster parents are precious to our 2nd Chance family; without them we cannot function, so we do our best to not burden them with multiple appointments. Our foster parents will choose their top 3 applications and arrange home visits with these applicants. The adopter will be chosen at that time. The process can take anywhere from a week to a month. We want to make sure our little furry ones are placed in their 'forever home' and never have to go through a rehoming again!My name was Robin Hood and I traveled the woods of WV with my Merry Men. One day while helping the poor and needy I got myself caught by this guy called a dog warden!! He asked for my identification well now that's just plain silly Robin Hood doesn't carry identification I mean I steal from the rich to feed the poor! He should have been able to tell that from the bone I just took from the overweight Rottweiler up the street that I was in the process of taking to the poor lab chained outside a few miles down the road sigggghhhhhhh. Anyhooo the man would not listen to reason and took me to this big noisy building filled with lots of dogs that really needed to learn to be quiet or if they were going to have choir practice needed to learn to sing! I was quietly planning my escape and hoping that my Merry Men were too when I began to feel a little under the weather I was picked up and taken to this human who poked and probed me. He was very lucky I am to much a gentleman to bite because I certainly didn't appreciate whatever it was he stuck up my butt or the piece of metal he poked me with not once but a few times!!! Finally when he was done messing with me I was taken by this really nice lady who took me out of the building that seemed to be a dog version of American Idol gone bad and to her house where I could get some sleep, get better and plan my next move. I was about to make a break for it when the lady decided to take me for a ride again BROTHER I thought if I am going back to where we were I might have to resort to acting ferocious! I found myself put in this thing with wheels and taken on a trip again with the singing choir YIKES! After what seemed like forever we arrived in a spot where I was handed off to another human who gave me smooshy kisses and seemed very glad to see me as if I was her long lost friend. She talked rather funny and seemed to think that after I took a quick restroom break we should get back in another thing on wheels and off we went again for another long trip. We then arrived at this home with a pretty young maiden with 4 paws. One look and I knew she would fall for me I mean all maidens do I'm Robin Hood for goodness sakes! Well to my surprise this maiden played hard to get and I have had to work very hard to win her over with my charms. Now I am pretty sure I am no where close to my old stomping grounds and I will have to find myself another group of Merry Men but I haven't quite given up on my old ways. With that being said I hate to tell on myself but someone is going to need a really good fence to keep me from \"straying\" so please unless you have a fence do not setup a date I just won't be able to help myself its like you humans with potatoe chips you just can't stop yourselves from eating the whole bag!!! Let's talk about snuggling, I have really learned to enjoy this thing called a couch and \"human attention\" I also am helping my human to stay fit by making sure he exercises each day with at least a 1.5 mile walk so if you are a slacker yeah its not gonna work. I am thinking that I will change my mission from stealing from the rich to feed the poor to walking my human so he eats no more!\n\nHave a great night and feel free to fill out a date application and we will see if our \"stars align\"\n\nLove Robin Hood or you can call me Robbie for short!\nPlease fill out an adoption application:\nAdoption application (Dog)\nAdoption Application (Cat)\n\nPlease understand we do not adopt out dogs to\nfamilies with children under the age of 5. We do not adopt dogs to renters. Some dogs will have fence requirements while others may not.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment. The dogs and cats in our system find themselves there, for the most part, because their humans did not have the same loyalty to them as they did to their owners. We do not take the adoption process lightly, and will do everything in our power to make sure the animal is placed correctly the first time around for your sake and theirs. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!",

I was placed in a foster home  because I was adopted and not cared for. I came back to the shelter because of neglect and I looked so bad, so skinny. A foster home was found for me where I could be fed good food, given a soft bed and lots and lots of love. You can see my foster mom in one of my pictures. I was giving her a kiss. I am back at the shelter now waiting for my new family. I sure do wish they would come soon. I like it here but after having a great home with my foster family I know just how wonderful a loving, caring family can be. You can see I am use to being inside with people and the couch can be my favorite place with you. My adoption fee is $100 and this includes my shots, worming, micro chipping and neutering. To adopt me you have to email, call, Facebook or use this site to contact the shelter. This is different because of Covid. An application will be sent to you and then you will be given a date to come to the shelter to finish the adoption process for me and I will be ready for you to take me home...... I am Red",

He claimed she lived in the basement for a year because she would walk on leash. Fast forward being in our family... Gertie LOVES walks. LOVES humans. LOVES love. LOVES car rides. LOVES adventures. LOVES everything to do with life. Humans tried to break her but instead she grew her healing powers and is one of the greatest dogs to cross our path. She\u2019s short, stout and incredibly soft and feminine. She\u2019s a warrior and we absolutely love her. Looking for someone equally as special as she... that you? Last, did we say CUDDLE MONSTER?! That\u2019s her. \n\nAnimals can be viewed by appointment only. We ask that you review our adoption information AND fill out an adoption application prior to setting an appointment so we have all your information and you understand our adoption procedures - you can do so online here.     \n\nPlease feel free to email us or call us anytime for additional information on any of our animals - info@mcprescue.org or 312-388-3928. Our typical adoption fee varies based on the age of the dog at the time of rescue: Under the age of 1 years old is $500; 1-5 years old is $400; over the age of 5 is $300. Fees include vaccinations, microchip, deworming and other vetting as needed. Our adoption process includes an application, reference check and home visit.",

He warms up quickly though. He really enjoys the company of boys age 7 to 15. They really bring him out of his shell. He loves other dogs, but does play very rough. He plays rough with people also, so small children are not recommended. He loves toys, especially a nice chew toy. He listens very well and loves to lounge around the house and follow his people around. To adopt Fitzgerald, please apply at www.hhfrescue.org. The adoption fee includes vaccinations, bordetella, deworming, rabies, spay/neuter, microchip, a lifetime registration of the microchip, and sales tax. If adopting a puppy, the rabies and spay/neuter will be done at the same time by our vet once they are 4 months old and billed to us. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.",

While not all are in the immediate area, once we have processed and approved your application, we will move the dog to our adoptive area for you to meet, greet and hopefully adopt. Sometimes we will have more than one application on a dog. That does not mean it automatically goes to another family but you should be aware of the fact that until you are approved and set up for the meet/greet.. the dog could get adopted by another applicant.Admiral is a friendly guy. He is looking to find a family to love. He doesn't like to put himself forward and has never been an 'in your face' kind of dog. He always wants to be a good boy. He likes to chase cats, so should go to a home with no cats. Admiral is dog selective and he will be fine being your only love.\nAdmiral will be a very loyal dog. He needs a privacy fenced yard where he can play and be safe as he is not good with other dogs. When you come to see him, the gentle touch of your hand will win him over in an instant.Due to his dog selective we will only place Admiral in a home with childern 14 and older. If you are interested in Admiral, please contact:\nrorrcanine@gmail.com\n*** Click here to sponsor this dog! ***",

            "description": "Rocky! This adorable big lug came into the shelter way back in January. He just spent a month with an Austin Animal Center foster family who says he was wonderful in the home. Lucky for Rocky, he was chosen to go on TV (which meant he got to eat about a dozen turkey hot dogs while being interviewed). See Rocky on CBS at this link: https://cbsaustin.com/features/we-are-austin/firehouse-animal-health-centers-wednesday-friendsday-meet-rocky While back at the shelter, this big ole goofy love bug is going to make someone very happy as Rocky will keep them endlessly entertained! Rocky absolutely loves attention from his people. He's so smart and eager to learn and takes cues from his people so well. He also LOVES toys - tennis balls, his favorite stuffed alligator squeaky toy, you name it! Rocky enjoys walks and would be a great adventure buddy. Bonus, Rocky loves to fetch in a backyard or going for a daily jog. All Rocky wants to do is please his people. We know he'll be such a loyal companion if he's given the opportunity! The Orange Dot Crew (a volunteer advocacy group at Austin Animal Center) will be there every step of the way to make sure that Rocky is set up for success in his new home! I weigh approximately 60 lbs. Click here to view my behavior notes.",

And at home, he's a happy dude who just wants to curl up with his humans and gets lots of their love and pets. This sweet, goofy diva loves cuddling with his person, then taking naps before making dance moves to get his dinner. He does love taking car rides and going for short walks, which he does well on his leash when going where he wants. He doesn't like being crated, but he is house-trained, so that's no problem. Baba just wants to be loved in a chill, quiet home. He has some health issues, so he hopes for a low-traffic area where he can sleep near his person all day. Come meet this lovable gentleman.",

Given his past, Bentley does have separation anxiety and kennel anxiety. He is dog friendly and would do best with another dog in the home. Bentley can jump a 5ft fence, so he will need a minimum of 6ft fence or a home committed to leash walking only to ensure his safety.

Although she is very sweet to humans, due to her past she needs controlled formal introductions to other dogs and would prefer to be the only dog in the household! She's very well trained and knows sit, stay, lay down, leave it come and no. Cher is very smart and quick to pick up on new tricks. She is potty trained and great left home alone in no crate. Some of her favorite activities include fetch, tug of war, neighborhood walks and car rides. She loves any toy you give her! Cher is one with the outdoors and loves to hike, she is very good off-leash while camping. Cher is also a great running partner although she gets pretty pooped out at around 4 miles. Overall Cher looking for a nice home where she can snuggle up to someone who loves her.\"\n\n \n\nTexas bio, \"I AM NOT A DIVA! But I love to sing along with the radio!...\n\nHi - my name is Cher and I am happy to have arrived in Colorful Colorado and am looking to find my FOREVER family!\n\nI am a beautiful 7-8 year old Boxer/Hound Mix. I weigh approximately 45lbs, am spayed, up-to-date on vaccinations, microchipped and recently completed my heartworm treatment, so I am now in tip-top shape to find a family that I can love (and so that I can be loved back).\n\nI have had the unfortunate circumstance of having been found as a stray TWICE in Houston, Texas. Before my second incarceration, I had been \"adopted\" by a family. I was so excited to be there and loved the human child in my home. However, as the lives of the adults in the home became busier and more stressful, my home life became unstable. I was placed in a position of having to defend myself (and the child in my home). As my presence there became increasingly unappreciated, the adults decided to \"give\" me away to someone else...and the next thing I knew, I was back in doggie jail.\n\nI am a sweet and spunky companion. I would love to go on walks with you or watch a movie on the couch. My intial introductions to other dogs have been uneventful, but my interest in felines might not make me the best match for a home with cats. Do to my energy level, a home with children over the age of 5-6 would probably be best. I have SO MUCH LOVE to give - won't you give me the chance to show you?\"\n\nBefore you apply to adopt me, please note that home ownership is required. I have completed a formal breed evaluation to reside in the City/County of Denver without restriction, but may be subject to BSL restrictions in other areas (due to some of my physical characteristics).\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration",

I didn't come in the best shape though, I was kind of hungry and had really long nails. I have since gained some weight, and had a pedicure (but we're still working on making my nails pretty again). I came from a home with little children, and my family told the shelter that I really liked them. I am calm, but a ball or a treat can get me excited and ready to play! Come meet me and throw a ball and give me a treat, or 5! I'm guaranteed to like you, and win over your heart with my big beautiful eyes! My shelter family reminds me daily how sweet I am. I don't get to excited about other animals around me, but I would like to meet your current dogs before you adopt me just to make sure we like each other! \n\nCould you be my new forever family? I'd really like to find a family to love me as much as I can love them! Make an appointment to meet me, you wont regret it!",

            "description": "Ada is a beautiful German Shepherd, who loves playing with toys and in the water  She is extremely smart and is learning many new things. She is very friendly and has many human friends at Mackenzie's. Currently she is learning how to walk nicely on a lead and socializing with other dogs (going on walks & being introduced in play yards).  Cats & small dogs are not her thing, so she will need to have a home without them.  She did well on a few dog intros, but is dog selective.  She would do best in a laid back home, possibly as an only child.  She has also been introduced to kids, a 9 & 11 year old. She did good but since she doesn't realize her size we are suggesting kids over that age.\nAda came to Mackenzies from being picked up as a stray.  She had several medical things happening at that time.  Right now the main concern with Ada is she suffered in the past with bladder stones.  She is on a special diet, and has done very well since the inception of this diet.  She would need to have follow up veterinary checks, to make sure that all is consistently well with her.  She is a loving girl, and just needs the right home for her to thrive.  Please do not apply if you could not keep her UTD with annual veterinary checks, and a specific diet.   \n\nI do require a special diet due to pancreatitis flareups.  \n\nBirthday: 01/22/15\n\nMeet-Your-Match Canine-ality color is: Orange- Goofball\nFor safety's sake, we are looking for homes with physical fenced in areas.\nPlease fill out our online adoption survey at www.mackenzies.info",

The suggestion is for her to see a specialist and have an endoscopic exam of her esophagus, including a deeper inspection of her mouth. This specialized test is expensive and the results may or may not tell us what the issue is. Further, if there are results from the test, she may not be a candidate for surgery, especially considering her age. She has lived with this cough for many years and it is possible that it's best to just let it be, but we are still considering all options. Claire continues to have skin allergy issues that we are managing.\n\n6-4-20: Claire returned to the vet for hospitalization today, as her surgery leg had become infected. After a night's stay with some intense treatment, she has returned home to continue her recovery.\n\n6-1-20: Today, Claire underwent surgery to remove a tumor on her rear leg. The tumor, which was walnut-sized, will be sent out to a pathologist for analysis. Further, an extended dental exam and cleaning was performed, due to Claire's ongoing issue with coughing after drinking water. It is believed she has an opening near one of her canine teeth, but today's thorough exam and cleaning did not reveal the cause. We will be monitoring her when she returns home tonight.\n\nClaire has now been to our vet and we have taken care of her current medical needs, such as flea dermatitis, ear infection, skin infection, intestinal parasites, vomiting, and diarrhea. This cutie pie was just groomed and her coat is growing back in where there was hair loss due to flea dermatitis. She has started her monthly flea and heartworm prevention, which should be continued throughout her life.\n\nClaire LOVES attention and to be near her humans. She will happily sit in your lap during TV time and will give a gentle nudge if she isn't receiving all of the attention she craves! Claire is 11yo and quite the charmer.\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nThis beautiful little girl has just arrived at our rescue and will be visiting our vet for all of her medical needs. Once we receive test results, we will update her bio. Claire is 11yo, and adorable!\n\nPlease consider donating to the high cost of medical care for Claire and for all of our senior dogs.\n\nPayPal to Donate@scottiekingdom.com\n\nThank you!\n\nAll dogs adopted by Scottie Kingdom Rescue, Inc. have had a full medical exam by one of our licensed Veterinarians, which includes testing (and treatment, if necessary) for Heartworm disease, Lyme disease, Ehrlichia and Anaplasmosis, all necessary vaccinations, spay/neuter surgery, dental cleaning as necessary, microchipping, registration of the microchip, and any other medical needs each particular dog may need. Copies of all available medical records are transferred to you when the adoption is finalized.\n\nWe prefer to adopt to families with past Scottie, Westie, Terrier experience, but realize this isn't always possible. We do NOT ship our pets. If you have that special place in your heart, and in your home, for a Scottie (or any of our other available rescue dogs), please visit us in Dallas for an in person meet & greet session with our available dogs. If you have existing dogs, they should travel to Dallas with you, so we can be assured that they will be compatible with the new addition to your family.\n\nPlease contact us at\nRescue@scottiekingdom.com\nto receive an Adoption Application or for more information on our Adoption process. Also, please take the time to visit our website\nwww.scottiekingdom.com\nfor additional information.\n\nWe sometimes receive several applications on the same dog. Our goal is to place the dog in the best home possible, based on his/her needs, personality and past history. Please note: Adoptions are not done on a first come, first served basis. Submitting an application does not guarantee the adoption of any dog. We are looking for the best available home for each of our rescue dogs.\n\nThank you for your understanding, and for considering adoption!\n\nWe are\nnot\nsupported by your tax dollars or public grants, rather, we rely on donations to help us continue our rescue work for animals that are in need.\n\nDonations may be made via PayPal to email address:\n\nDonate@scottiekingdom.com\n\nor via USPS, to PO Box 551265 ~ Dallas, TX\n\n75355",

Baker is approximately 2-3 years old and weighs 68 lbs.; he is gentle, loving and playful. Baker has severe hip dysplasia that will continue to worsen as he ages. While he gets around well now, it is likely that he will need to be put on a pain-management regimen later in life. Because of this condition, Baker is considered \"special needs\". Right now, Baker does just fine without the pain management medication; he is able to get up and down, run around with his favorite pal and lead a normal life. \n\nThe fee to adopt Baker is $200.00; this includes neuter, deworming, vaccinations and a microchip. If you think Baker would make a good addition to your family, please visit our website, www.arfhouse.org and fill out an adoption application. \n**If adopted, Baker's adoptive family would take full financial responsibility of Baker's medical bills. \n\n**Please Note: Baker is currently located at our facility in Sherman, TX.

He doesn't really like cats, but would get along with a tolerant dog. Ringo is high energy and very playful. He is scared of strangers and is very protective of his home, so he can come across as scary to guests. He needs a home with a good yard to play in. Preferably someone that doesn't have any small children and doesn't have a lot of guests over. If you want a loyal dog who never gets tired of cuddles and kisses, Ringo is your boy.",

Tiger LOVES to hunt lizards outside for as long as you'll allow him. When he's done he enjoys relaxing on the couch and with his favorite toy. Tiger is also great with children! \n\nTiger would do well with a back yard to play in but an apartment is not out of the question as long as he is getting long walks.",

            "description": "BellaRose is a playful, affectionate Cairn terrier mix who is 3 years old and weighs 39 lbs. She was picked up as a stray, but we believe she may have been someone's pet because she has beautiful house manners and is friendly & obedient. She is good with adults (no young children please), knows basic commands, and responds well to corrections.  She is a typical scrappy little terrier, but she gets anxious when she sees other dogs and she has scars on her back that suggest she may have been attacked by another dog in the past.  She has a high prey drive so she's looking for an only dog home with no cats or possibly a home with larger, well balanced dogs that she could coexist with after slow introductions.  She is nervous & reactive on walks and has received professional training to address this behavior, but she needs a strong leader who will continue working with her to build trust so she feels safe.  She would enjoy a fully fenced yard with privacy fencing (preferred height of 6 ft) because this little dynamo will clear a 5 ft chain link fence in no time flat and cannot be trusted to stay behind the fence if other dogs are walking past her yard!  Bella is housebroken, crate trained, spayed, fully vaccinated and microchipped.\n\nFor more information about BellaRose, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org. If you would like to adopt sweet BellaRose, please submit an adoption application for her at http://www.barkvilledogrescue.org/adoption-application",

In fact, we thought he may be with us forever. Then a cool thing happened \u2013 he was adopted! We learned from that experience that he loves going to the dog park and bonds tightly with his person. The problem was he bonded so tightly that he decided he didn\u2019t want to share with the other dog in the family. Most dogs come back a bit shut down. Not our Jed! He couldn\u2019t wait to tell everyone about his adventures and he just knows he has another forever out there!\n\nJed is house broken and LOVES going on long walks with his person. He's a shy boy who takes time to get to know but once he opens up there is no love greater!",

            "description": "Say hello to gorgeous Gambit! He joined us last year from a state police cruelty case but is not letting that get him down. Instead, he\u2019s looking forward to a bright future and someone special to share it with. Gambit has spent several months learning how to just be a dog and has blossomed into a wonderful, and sometimes quirky, middle-age boy (past the naughty puppy stage!). He\u2019s estimated to be about 7 years old, but you would never know it! He has lots of great energy and would love someone active to explore the world with. Some of his favorite things are long walks, a soft place to nap, smelly treats, his crate, trying to break the world record of ripping stuffing out of a toy, and his foster mom. Actually, Gambit loves women in general. Okay, we\u2019ll be honest, he\u2019s a full fledged \u201cladies man\u201d. The good news is, he\u2019s a stayer, not a player! As for men, he can be nervous around them. This is something he is working on and any men in his life will need to be patient and understanding. Of course, he\u2019d be totally cool with having a new lady all to himself too! \n\nGambit\u2019s forever home would be kid and kitty free. He does love to play with his canine foster brother and would welcome a doggie sibling but will need a family committed to taking things slow. This hunk didn\u2019t get the right kind of socialization when he was younger, so this is all new to him! He would also be perfectly content to be your one and only. Most importantly, he needs structure, a good leader, and a family committed to helping him live his very best life. \n\nIf you\u2019re fun-loving, active, and looking for a hunky blond to join you on life\u2019s adventures, Gambit just might be the one for you!\n\nTo meet Gambit, please visit our website, www.pittieslovepeace.com, to submit an adoption application. Gambit is neutered, microchipped and vaccinated. His adoption fee is $250.00 and includes doggie kisses and a lifetime of LOVE.\n\nThe Petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing a predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

He\u2019s happiest while being active with his human and furry friends. Zeus was very loved the first year of his life but is looking for a home better suited for getting his puppy energy out. He needs a large, fenced yard to run around and play. A tired Zeus is a good Zeus :) Like most Pyrs, Zeus can have selective hearing and can exhibit some resource guarding tendencies. He has work to do on his manners when greeting new humans and other dogs on a leash, but Zeus is highly food motivated and a delicious treat seems to help him remember his obedience commands very quickly. He is house broken, crate-trained and walks well on a leash (unless other dogs are nearby). Zeus plays well with canine pals after proper introductions and would benefit from a doggy sibling to play with in his yard! He is a very good boy - handsome, smart and a quick learner! If you\u2019re the active family Zeus is looking for, apply today!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

Lily is looking for an experienced dog owner to provide structure and snuggles! She'd do best in a home without kitty-cats as she likes to give chase and play! Lily does well with most dogs, when given a proper and slow introduction. She is a little weary of newcomers, but blossoms quickly when allowed patience to adjust on her terms. Lily has been spotted in her kennel with a loving volunteer, bestowing sloppy doggie kisses upon her and just enjoying human company. Lily would excel in a home with a fenced yard so can chase after toys to her heart's content. If you're a seasoned dog owner with patience and love to spare, please stop down to our Adoption Center and meet our beautiful Lily. We know this adora-bull girl is adopta-bull!",

It does take a while to earn her trust, but she has made some great progress in her foster home! \n\nStryker is a very reserved and easily startled greyhound that would do best in a home without children. She will need a special home with a patient person. She does better with a structured routine and needs time to adjust to any changes. She will also need interaction with other dogs and greyhounds(play dates).\n\nShe is very food motivated when it comes to training but she is unsure walking on a leash and will require a house with a fenced yard for her to play in. She requires a harness anytime you leave the house because she will try to back out of a collar and if that happens, she's so fast that you'll never be able to catch her.\n\nOnce you have earned her trust, she is a very playful, funny girl who loves squeaky toys, naps and treats. She gets along beautifully with the cats in her foster home and loves playing with her Greyhound foster siblings.",

            "description": "Josie is an energetic one year old blackmouth cur mix. She is a loyal girl who had a rough start in life. Josie sustained some kind of injury to her spine as a puppy and could not use her back legs. She was rescued from a high kill shelter in Houston and put into foster for some physical rehab and lots of love.\nJosie has been with us for a while and can now use her legs most of the time to hop around the yard with other dogs. She loves to run and she is fast! Josie needs a nice big backyard to run to her hearts content in and expend all her energy. When she is tired she does drag a bit, but when she catches her second wind she pops back up. She does best on a harness rather than a neck collar but she will tolerate a gentle slip lead.\nDue to nerve damage Josie is incontinent. With frequent potty breaks outside, spending time on non-carpeted flooring, and a good mop this can be managed. A vet tech or someone with a background in animal care would be an amazing match for her.\nJosie is still a big puppy, so she likes to chew. Very hefty chew toys are best for her. She can be mouthy when excited and could possibly knock over small children, so adults or older children are best for her new family. Josie would be happy being by your side all day however she is used to being in a crate for nap time and quiet moments. Fuzzy blankets rather than stuffing filled dog beds are best in her crate, though with supervision she loves relaxing in a nice big dog bed outside the crate during family time.\nShe is used to being around dogs and cats with no issues other than liking to be up in their business. She loves friends.",

Her favorite activity is playing with her faerie friends (shadows in the back yard.) If left to her own devices on a sunny day she would be happy running around chasing them for as long as she possibly could and want's nothing to do with her humans, as hard as we try! But when in the house she is a true cuddle pup. She is happiest when she can keep an eye, and paw, on her humans throughout the day. She loves to play tug, and rope toys are her absolute favorite. She is quite high energy and goes on multiple walks a day to burn off some steam. Camila is as intelligent as she is pretty and needs lots of attention and training to keep her on her toes. We think she'll thrive in a home with a large backyard with someone that wants to put in the time and effort to train her and help put her brilliant mind to use!",

Because she has so much energy and is so smart, she needs a very special owner who is able to meet and challenge her mental and physical needs. She is a sweet dog who takes time to warm up to people, especially men. Once she gets comfortable with people, she will snuggle, shower them with kisses, and give them lots of attention. She can be nervous in large social settings and prefers to be with her chosen people and animals. She loves to go on hikes, watch Netflix and cuddle with her people. Her perfect home will be with a very patient owner who will help Lacie excel in life. Her perfect home will be with a very patient owner who will provide daily activities that will meet Lacie's physical and mental needs so that she will excel in life. \n\nLacie would do well as an only pet or a home with a younger playful dog, as she loves to play. Cats would not be a good idea as she thinks they are fun to chase. \n\nDue to Lacie being a fearful/reactive dog she will not be adopted to a home located in an apartment, a home that does not have a fence, a home with kids of any age, or a home with cats. \nLacie needs a calm home with one or two people, preferably that understand herding dogs, and understand and/or have experience with dogs who have fear/reactive issues. These requirements are to ensure Lacie and her new family have the best and long-term life together.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Lacie is $400 We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nAll adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet.\n\nThe adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

Martin will do best as an only dog and no kitties please! Martin has quirks and will need a dedicated person to not just love and exercise him, but to keep him engaged and continue his training. Martin is a sweet guy and loves him some people, but food is his ultimate favorite thing so no little humans with sticky jelly hands for him. If you are looking for a running buddy, an adventurer who loves car rides, and a furry friend to be your one and only, then Martin is your man.\n\n*no apartments or condos\n\n*no cats\n\n*no children\n\n*no dogs\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Martin Short Stack, please fill out an application today!\n\n2/1/21 9:03 PM",

            "description": "On November 11, 2018, Simon and Travis came into our world. Two precious little boys that were part of a 22 dog, court ordered seizure. Three rescues were involved, and vets were on standby, waiting for the dogs to be captured and delivered. When we arrived at the location , there were 22 numbered collars on a table , cadaver bags available. As the dogs are caught, they are crated in the closest vehicle. Once the vehicle is full it heads to the clinic. The dogs were in serious condition. Purebreds, mixes, pregnant, you name it. Whatever dog(s) end up in your vehicle, you take. After being released from the vet,the boys arrived at Lucies and were put in major quarantine for a month. We noticed that they seemed to have a fondness for each other. Carrying on little conversations through the fence. They were overjoyed when we put them into a yard together. We also noticed that they were similar in a number of ways. They insist on eating and sleeping together, although they curse each other in their very own language while they do it. We have no doubt that they are brothers. In all the chaos that day, Simon and Travis were loaded into Lucies vehicles. Luck??? Please pardon the length of this post, we can\u2019t split them up. Last month they received a clean bill of health and are ready for adoption. Please share their story, there has to be someone that needs some laughter and love in their lives.\nSimon and Travis are crate and leash trained. They will follow off lead. Kid and K9 friendly. Approximately 6 years old and weighing about 35-40 pounds. Thanks y\u2019all ??!\n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home. Phone interviews are required for all adoptions****",

            "description": "On November 11, 2018, Simon and Travis came into our world. Two precious little boys that were part of a 22 dog, court ordered seizure. Three rescues were involved, and vets were on standby, waiting for the dogs to be captured and delivered. When we arrived at the location , there were 22 numbered collars on a table , cadaver bags available. As the dogs are caught, they are crated in the closest vehicle. Once the vehicle is full it heads to the clinic. The dogs were in serious condition. Purebreds, mixes, pregnant, you name it. Whatever dog(s) end up in your vehicle, you take. After being released from the vet,the boys arrived at Lucies and were put in major quarantine for a month. We noticed that they seemed to have a fondness for each other. Carrying on little conversations through the fence. They were overjoyed when we put them into a yard together. We also noticed that they were similar in a number of ways. They insist on eating and sleeping together, although they curse each other in their very own language while they do it. We have no doubt that they are brothers. In all the chaos that day, Simon and Travis were loaded into Lucies vehicles. Luck??? Please pardon the length of this post, we can\u2019t split them up. Last month they received a clean bill of health and are ready for adoption. Please share their story, there has to be someone that needs some laughter and love in their lives.\nSimon and Travis are crate and leash trained. They will follow off lead. Kid and K9 friendly. Approximately 6 years old and weighing about 35-40 pounds. Thanks y\u2019all ??!\n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home. Phone interviews are required for all adoptions****",

She will chase cats, if they run or are outside.\n\nSady is very strong and does excitedly jump. But she takes redirection well. She is very smart. Sady is crate trained and very affectionate and loves kids. She loves riding in the car.\nShe is looking for an active family because she LOVES to run and play.\n\nCourtesy post for Christine \nP.A.W.S.

She is approximately two years old and appears to be an American Staffordshire terrier mixed with something small...likely chihuahua or another small terrier.\n\nShe is crate-trained and housebroken and responds well to firm and consistent verbal commands. She knows how to sit, stay, and lay down, and walks well on a leash once she gets over her initial excitement.  Maude even high-fives and rolls over for dinner (See the video here on her profile)!  Maude would be a great jogging companion for an active person, and will even cuddle after a workout. Maude loves playing fetch but is not aware of how strong she is. She would do best in a home with no small children and she is the only dog.  She is fine with cats (totally ignores them and covers her face if they approach her -- literally).  She put in a request for sleeping in the bed! \n\nMaude is current on vaccinations, soayed, and microchipped. She is heartworm negative and is current on monthly heartworm preventative.\n\nIf you are interested, please fill out a Dog Adoption Application at www.petadoptionservices.org/forms\n\nOur adoptions include a foster period of 4-6 weeks so that you can be sure that this pet is a good fit without any pressure, and we are available to answer any behavior or training questions during that time (and beyond, if you wish).",

We came as puppies and are growing up here. I am about 11 months old. I sometimes wonder what it would be like to have my own warm soft bed and then maybe sleep by the warm fireplace on a rug. Getting a warm hug would be nice too I think. My adoption fee is $100  and this includes my spaying, worming, shots, and micro chipping. I need a home and that home will need some very understanding, patient person to show me what it is like to be out of an animal shelter. I have seen pictures of some of our dogs here that have found homes and it looks like they are smiling... Maybe  one day  that smile could be on my face... my new home.... my new family......

He is low on the energy scale and likes to sleep on soft comfortable things. \n\nHe has not had the best care all these years but has a great capacity for forgiveness. He is happy to have another day of this great life. Bernie recently finished heartworm treatment. \n\nBernie barks at people who approach his yard but he is very easy going when meeting new people, He is an enthusiastic eater. In general, he likes to check out what is happening and then go back to bed. He enjoys yard time, and seeing who is outside, but a little bit of a good thing is just fine. He prefers to be with people and watching things from the dog bed. He is a little scared in storms and it's extra nice to be with his person when the sky is making noise.\n\nBernie was neutered prior to his arrival and is microchipped and up to date on all his shots. He is an inside dog who needs a fenced yard. \n\nHe is likely 10-11 years old and weighs about 52 pounds, He had a dog friend that he came here with who recently passed away (internal bleeding, likely cancer) and we have not introduced Bernie to anyone new.  Anyone adopting Bernie does so with the understanding that he may have several good years ahead but he will have age-related issues and expenses. We are looking for a compassionate soul who has experience with senior dogs and wants nothing more than to enjoy slow life with Bernie. We have had him in the cat building and he did not notice the cats.",

He does not like to be locked inside a house and has anxiety being confined in spaces. He has indoor/outdoor access at our house and this works well for Bernie. \n\nHe has access to a secure yard and this seems to calm him. He won't come outside if there are lots of people outside or unfamiliar people. He will watch from the doorway. \n\nBernie lived most of his life with his brother Bruce, who died recently of cancer. We think this makes Bernie more dependent on the people he knows and that he doesn't like to be alone. Bernie and his brother came into rescue after a life of neglect and abuse. Bernie deserves a home where he can be himself and be around people who love him.\n\nIt will take a very special and patient home to accommodate Bernie's needs. Adopter must have the means and experience in dealing with an older dog who is not a \"dog park\" dog. Bernie's experience with other dogs here has been limited, he seems to be selective. We have not found him a friend to live with yet b/c of the variety of recent transitions for him. \n\nIf you are interested in Bernie, please fill out a pre-adoption application that can be found on our website or on the page that accompanies this description. This is the best way to start the conversation about adopting Bernie.",

Our shelter is closed to the general public to help reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus.\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN AN ANIMAL, please submit an application form: https://www.newwestcity.ca/services/animal-services/animal-shelter\n\nWe need your help finding Ben G's perfect home! He has been at the shelter for a year now.\n\nBen G is an energetic 8 year old Rottweiler who came to our shelter with another dog, Boston. The boys were living in a van in sub-zero temperatures, so our Animal Services Officers removed them. The owner had fallen on hard times and was not able to claim them.\n\nBen G is a silly, playful boy. He loves to play with toys and run around the yard. He enjoys his walks out in the neighbourhood, and loves a good sniff around. We are looking for a pet-free home for Ben G. He is not an off-leash dog park candidate, so we want to see him in a home where he has a fully fenced yard to play in. Condos and townhouses are not suitable.\n\nLike many Rottweilers, some strangers make Ben G nervous. He is great at communicating if he is not comfortable, and will try to avoid if possible. For this reason, we are looking for an adult-only home without a lot of comings-and-goings. But once you're friends, get ready for endless bum-scratch-requests! He'll back his booty right up to you.\n\nBen G is very food-motivated which makes training easy. He can be grabby and pushy when treats are present but we have not seen any food/resource-guarding behaviour.\n\nIn September, we noticed that Ben G was a bit sore after walks and had some weakness in his hindquarters. We had full x-rays done of his knees, hips, and spine. He appears to have an old injury to one of his knees, but unfortunately, his lower spine has some spots that have fused together. This means he will need to be on anti-inflammatory and pain relief medication for the rest of his life.  He is on a daily medication, Galliprant, to help with his mobility, and it has done wonders! He is much more comfortable now.\n\nIf you think Ben G is a perfect fit for you, please submit an adoption application, found at https://www.newwestcity.ca/.../animal.../animal-shelter",

As of now she is not good with cats at all and is selective with dogs. She knows how to sit, wait and almost has the leave it command mastered. Her issue with other dogs are being worked with through positive reinformcent with her foster family and a volunter in the New Year!\nAdopt Iris and you will be laughing at her and her silly side!",
