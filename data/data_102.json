            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 4/28/2020\nReason for being in rescue: Patches and Maguire were put in CPR's fence overnight.\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs?\nWeight: 58 lb\nHeight: 23 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? Yes\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Patches needs a home with owners that know how to shape a young dog into a lovable house pet! Patches is dog selective- he gets along with some dogs but not others. Patches prefers to be the only apple of someone's eye. We have not tested Patches with kids. Patches loves to be outside and run in the field. He needs a home that will provide him with a safe space to explore outside. Patches is looking for a home as an only dog with no cats.\n\nWhat is my personality like? We do not know much about Patches' past, but we do know he was loved. Patches and his brother Maguire were dropped off inside our gate overnight and left with a note asking us to please take care of them. We believe they were well loved, but not able to be cared for financially.\n\nPatches is a young dog with lots of potential, he just needs a patient owner willing to work with him. He is strong willed and will need a strong leader to teach him some manners. Patches is high energy and needs an outlet for that. He will need daily exercise. Patches is highly intelligent and needs a \"job\" to do, whether it's playing or working alongside his owner on a farm.\n\nPatches no absolutely no manners, but don't let this scare you away! What Patches lacks in household manners, he makes up for with a willing mind and open heart ready to learn.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Patches loves all people, but can be wary of other dogs. He is also terrified of the vacuum cleaner!\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Patches' estimated birthday is 5/23/18.\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

            "description": "11/11/2020\nGiorgio is originally from a hoarding situation.  He does not currently allow human touch.. He is really a sweet boy. you don\u2019t know he\u2019s in the house because he doesn\u2019t wanna come near anybody. He is quiet and housebroken. If it was up to him he\u2019d be outside 24/7 despite cold weather. If he can learn to cuddle and let people pet him he will be a perfect dog. I think it\u2019s just gonna take a long time. Needs to be adopted into a home with another dog to an individual or couple that wants to help him learn to trust and is patient.\n\n7/22/20\n\nHi, My name is Giorgio - I am thought to be a 3 year old neutered chihuahua mix.  I have been in foster care for over a month now,  I am house trained, get along with other dogs and kids.  Cats are unknown, but if I was a betting man, I'd say I'd be fine with them.   I am slowly starting to be a dog, after a rough start in my foster home where I didn't want anyone to touch me or be near me, I am starting to come around now.   I sleep in bed with my foster dad and his three dogs.  I feel like I am one of the pack (I know it's temporary) - But I would love, in fact, I probably need another dog or dogs to help me out in life.   I feel most at ease with another dog or dogs with me in a house. I love to chase balls in the backyard and can hang with the resident dogs that are all over 40 lbs each.  I also love to do rolly pollies in the grass on hot days in the sun.  I also love to crawl up and cuddle one of my dog friends while my foster dad watches TV at night.  My heartworm treatment is going well, I am done with the 30 days of antibiotics and half way through my first month of heartworm preventative. Next month, I start injections and crate rest to get better and get rid of the worms in my heart. I still really don't like to be touched that much, but I tolerate it and while I'm cuddling on the couch or in the bed, I allow touches without any fuss.   I've done a complete 180 from my first days here and know humans aren't all that bad now - I continue to make progress and some day hope to trust all humans.  I have a lot of love to give in a tiny package - Won't you give me a chance and let me be your forever dog???\n\n\n6/23/2020\nHi - my name is Giorgio - I used to be held up in a house with 50 other chichuahuas and that life was rough,  I made my way to Pennsylvania a few weeks ago and life is looking up.   I am a spunky little Chihuahua mix with lots of personality once I let you see it.   I am very timid at first and do not like to be touched excessively.  I will tolerate a pet here and there but i prefer to be seen and heard, but not touched for now.   I am sure once I get to know you - I will want lots of love and affection.   I been in my foster families house in PA for 2 weeks now and I am making small, but steady improvements.   To top it all off - I am Heartworm positive - but thats not a death sentence and many make a full recovery.   I am about 15 days into my antibiotic treatment, then will need injections to kill the worms in my heart, then lots of crate rest for a few months.  I have a lot of love to give - Are you willing to take a chance on me and help me out with a forever home and a place to recuperate from my heart worms??  Wags will even pay for the procedure at a vet of their choosing, or give you a credit towards choosing your own vet.\n5/23/2020\nMeet Giorgio T Dalton!!!  This incredibly sweet and shy boy is looking for his forever family. I am a handsome boy with a adorable tan and white coat. He is thought to be a 3 year old, neutered chi mix. \n\n\n\n  To begin the adoption process please, fill out our online application.

She was a feral doggo who was very pregnant (7 puppies!) when she was rescued. All of her babies are finished nursing and are up for adoption. Shes ready to find her furever family too! Sugar is such a loving girl once she gets to know you. Correction, shes a TOTAL love bug once she gets to know you! She can be very shy at first because shes still learning that humans arent all terrifying! After a little time with you, shell be your girl! We are currently working on leash training and are teaching her not to jump when excited. Sugar can share a home with cats and bunnies as she doesnt pay them much attention at all! Shes house trained. Shes good with children that she knows, dogs and cats. Overall, Sugar is a wonderful girl who just needs to find the right family who will be patient with her as she learns to trust you. Shes a laid back lady but will play. She would rather be beside you, interested in whatever it is youre up to! She does require a fenced yard and a family that doesn't want to bring her out in public often. Does this sweetheart sound like a good match for your family? If so, please submit an adoption application so we can schedule a meet n greet!\n\nThe adoption fee for this pretty girl is $225. She has been spayed, microchipped and is up to date on vaccines!",

If he had been born human, he would have been a star Wimbledon ball boy because fetching is his game, and theres no one better at it. Hell do it ALL DAY LONG, and will even fit up to 3 balls in his mouth at one time. And if your arm gets tired, dont worry. Hell play with the ball on his own until youve caught your breath. He gets it; not everyone has the stamina he does. On top of that he has the cutest, wonkiest ears that have a mind of their own. And his face is just as expressive. And if that werent enough, hes house-trained and he looooves people. Let him show you how much! Cole would best fit in a home where hes the only pet and can live with older children.

He starts his day off with a cute crawl towards his foster mom to give morning kisses - he is such a cuddle bug!  As a 2-year old pup, Little John is a bit of a wild child with high energy and curiosity.  He would do best in a home that can keep up with that energy, which includes one long walk a day (or more) and some entertainment along the way.\n\nIn true terrier fashion, he has a lot to say and he says it often so apartment living would not be the best home for him.  He is protective of his food and toys so we would recommend children 16+ who will respect his wishes/boundaries.  He is fearful of strangers and can occasionally become nippy if pushed,  so slow introductions done at his pace will be necessary. Little John hasn\u2019t learned to accept other dogs so we are asking that he be the only pet in the home.\n\nIf you are interested in applying to adopt Little John, please fill out an application at www.maggiesmissionrescue.org.",

He is a typical husky, full of energy, very playful, loves to go on hikes and other outdoor activities, but not a big fan of crowded busy places with lots of traffic; otherwise, he is quite calm and chill. Axel walks beautifully on a leash, would do better as the only dog, or paired with an easy calm dog of his size, for he likes to mount others to show his dominance. No small dogs and cats please. \nAxel needs a strong owner, who is familiar with and understands this breed to set rules and boundaries, provide him with a wonderful active life with structure. Axel is a sweet boy who is very smart and can be stubborn. Being a typical husky, he\u2019ll test your limits, try to have his own way, so he needs someone who can show him who's boss.  \n\nAxel has been neutered, microchipped, and current on vaccines! He is looking for his sweet home he can love and to be loved! Are you ready for this stunning white fluff?",

She loves to meet new people and friends! She is playful, friendly, and listens very well to commands. She's got a great personality! At times she can get very anxious especially when left home alone, because of how companion-oriented she is. POPB treated her Heartworm disease and her skin is on the mend from infection. Now that her makeover is complete, Foxy is ready for her forever home!\n\nAs a POPB adoptable, Foxy is eligible for 5 free obedience classes with her new family! We have adoption events every Saturday from 10 am to 1 pm at Petco in Gainesville, at 6869 W. Newberry Rd. (near the mall) and at the Millhopper Petsmart, 4119 NW 16th Ave. We also have special events regularly. Please visit our Facebook page (facebook.com/plentyofpitbulls) for information about upcoming events. For more information about our adoption process and a link to our application, please see popb.org/adopt",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Paloma is 5 years old at the time of intake in May 2020. Paloma is good with people of all ages and other dogs. You can see the heartbreak in Paloma's eyes which tell the story of a loveless life of neglect and abuse at the end of a short, heavy logging chain. But when we convinced Paloma's owner to surrender her to us, we saw a sparkle in Paloma's eye that was never there before. Paloma's story becomes even sadder as once we rescued Paloma, we discovered this senior girl was pregnant. Again. None of Paloma's puppies survived as a result of her poor physical condition. And that closes the sad chapters in Paloma's life. From now on, Paloma's life will be filled with love, happiness, soft beds, toys, treats and a forever family who will cherish her. Paloma is a laid back, low maintenance, quiet lady who is happy with a few walks a day. She would be happy as a solo doggy, or with a doggy sibling her size or larger. Paloma\nmostly likes to cuddle on the couch and nap. You will not regret making this sweet girl a part of your family!\nIf you can love Paloma so fiercely that it will make her forget the first 5 years of her life, then perhaps you are the family Paloma deserves. Please apply online to adopt Paloma at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

She didnt have the best start in life--she was scared and shut down when she entered our program. But dogs have a way of moving forward and not looking back. She is now safe and our organization will ensure that she will have a positive future.\n\nSophia is relaxed and comfy in her foster home and loves human attention. She has a good appetite and has gained weight! She was a nurturing mother to her puppy that has since been adopted. She is just a bit older than a puppy herself.\n\nShe is hesitant about walking on a leash, but is improving every day.\n\nSofia needs a quiet adult home with an adopter who can build her confidence. Sophia is a little hesitant around men so were looking for the perfect match in an environment that will lead to a successful transition, and not have great potential for setbacks. Do you have another dog? Sophia loves other dogs, and we have seen a companion dog bring her out of her shell! \n\nAlthough Sofia is very well behaved, an adopter should provide her with the basic obedience training (based upon positive reinforcement) that any young dog requires. It will be necessary for an adopter to have recent experience in raising a shy GSD or other large breed working dog. \n\nShes waiting just for you!",

Bam Bams a certified lizard hunter. Also, he loves toys. Bones and stuffed toys have been his favorite at the shelter so far. He also likes to play fetch, and is great with returning the ball and dropping it! In the AAC play yards, he plays with toys, splashes around in the pools, and actively solicits affection. (His favorites are ear and booty scratches.) He knows tricks, too- sit, paw, and down. Given how food motivated he is, he is ready to learn more tricks, too! Given his size and energy level, Bam Bam would likely do best in a home with a yard, or regular exercise with his people. As much as his shelter friends love him and will miss him, what they want most is for Bam Bam to find his furever home. Could you be Bam Bams new best friend? I weigh approximately 80 lbs.

Just about 3 years old and 65 lbs, this is a perfect melon head. Ziggy gets along with all the people and dogs he meets. Ziggy is housebroken and active. He would love to be in an active home that will continue his training and activity. He is ready to show off his summer bod and keep it in pristine shape with ball playing, hikes, playtime, and zoomies.\n\nZiggy\u2019s former human placed him in a kennel/shelter when he went to prison. It was supposed to be temporary, but there is no end in sight. Last year, the shelter shut down and was moved to another shelter/kennel. This poor baby has waited to go home for 2 years. Please give him a chance! \n\nIf interested in fostering or adopting, email us at twentypawsrescue@gmail.com or info@twentypawsrescue.com.

Little Bit DOB: 11.18.2018* Little Bit, the Chihuahua, is such a sweet little boy. He was running the streets and afraid of people, but now he follows his foster mom everywhere. He is loving and gives the sweetest kisses. He gets along with the other dogs in his foster home but was seen chasing cats when he was on the street, so a home without cats is probably best. He is ready to find his forever home. Very playful, but has no problem cuddling up to his person. During his vet visit he was checked for heartworm and found to be negative. To keep him safe from such parasites, he is on Sentinel Spectrum. He is also current on vaccinations, neutered, microchipped and crate trained. All he is in need of is a loving family to call his own. If you think Little Bit would be the perfect addition to your home, send an email to PawPrintzRescue@gmail.com and request an application. Adoption Requirements: Application, Interview, Homecheck Adoption Fee: $200.00 This dog is located near Fresno, California. All of our animals are up-to-date on their vaccinations spayed or neutered, micro chipped and have had a physical exam. At adoption we provide; veterinarian records, vaccine certificate, lifetime lost animal support, leash, collar, ID tag and a familiar toy or blanket to help them settle in. *Age is always a guess with rescue dogs but here at Paw Printz we believe everyone should have a birth day so when the vet guesses at their age, we work out what would be a good birthday for each dog and make it so!",

While he loves his people, he can be protective with people he does not trust and would prefer a quiet, adult only home without a lot of new people coming and going. Wayne does like to play with some dogs and may be a good fit with an easy going social dog. If you need a lovable goof in your life, apply for Wayne today.",

I love to get belly rubs, and play with basketballs! I could play in the yard all day if you let me, which is a good thing cause I'm a lil bit chunky. I may not do well with other dogs so it's best to be the only one. I may hurt cats so no for me. I will do better with older children 12 and up. My adoption fee is $100.\nTo adopt one of our animals, please visit our shelter, open Tuesday-Friday from Noon-6pm and Saturday from Noon-4pm. You may also submit an application online from our website at http://www.HelpTheAnimalsINC.com/adopt.",

            "description": "At the end of her second year with us, Fluffy was adopted into a home.  Unfortunately, she wasn't happy and they decided to bring her back.  Fluffy is a 4 year old female Lab mix that has not had a good chance at a real life yet.  Prior to coming to us, she was housed in an outdoor kennel until her owner decided to move and leave her behind with several other dogs.  Fluffy went the Dog Warden's office, and then came to us for adoption.  She needs a fenced yard and someone the will give her the time to decompress.  She does not care for men, so if she lives with a man, they will need to understand that they should just ignore her until she comes around on her own terms.  And the whole process might take months.  Fluffy loves to sit in the yard and relax and watch the world go by, and if that's what she wants, that's what she should be allowed to do.  Someone just needs to give her a chance.\n\nIf you would like an application go to our website and download one and email it back as a Word or PDF document.\n\nThis dog's adoption fee is $190. That fee includes spaying/ neutering, microchipping, deworming and vaccinations. If you would like an adoption application, please send an email message to adoptprebleco@yahoo.com",

This \"Italian\" hunk has the calm, relaxed personality of a senior dog, but when he sees his favorite people, he surprises them with the energy of a big puppy, bouncing up and down to let you know how happy he is to be with you. Enzo is great with kids. If you sit with him, he'll lay his big, snuggly head in your lap. He is a very curious dog who loves to investigate his surroundings. He enjoys neighborhood walks, being brushed, watching TV, and he has a BIG heart, obvious with his appreciation for your affections. Enzo would do best in a home without many stairs and easy access to the outside for potty breaks. He needs to be the only pet in the home and have all your love to himself. Enzo can't wait to meet you!If you are interested in meeting Enzo, go to la.bestfriends.org/adopt and fill out our Dog Adoption Survey and our team will reach out to you!",

            "description": "This little guy is quite a character. Peppe is 2 years old and weighs about 12 lbs. He was pulled from Fulton county animal control where he was surrendered in August of 2016 because of financial reasons. Then he got adopted 2 months later and returned 2 weeks later because he snapped at his new owner protecting his food. They were warned about his food aggression. The same happened again after his second adoption where he was returned after only 4 days. He was scheduled to be euthanized that day when he got returned again but not on our watch. We just happened to be there and took him to give him another chance of life. \nHe is a sweet little cuddle bug and loves attention and is very playful He is very easy going and and most of the time sweet as he can be, but he does have his little episodes where he will snap. A few times it happened when he was sleeping next to a person on the couch and then out of a sudden woke up and snapped to the person next to him, so we were told. We think he just need an alpha person when it comes to him protecting his food or toys.  Peppe loves to ride in the car and go places. He is also off leash obedient. He does prefer to be the only dog in the home even though in his foster home are others as well. But he will be nasty or bossy with them from time to time. \n\nHis adoption fee is $ 250 which covers all his vaccines, heartworm test, neuter and micro chip. \n\nIf you would like to meet our cute little boy Peppe, please send us an e mail in order to receive an application. We are only able to meet with pre approved applicants by appointment since our organization operates on foster homes only.",

            "description": "Baby has been going through Hell back and forth. She was abandoned, living all by herself in an empty house for 3 months.\nThe neighbor finally found out once they saw her walking through the yard nothing but skin and bones. Police and Animal Control was contacted, but nobody was willing to help.\nSo they neighbor started feeding her and put a bucket of food and water every day over the fence.\nFinally somebody reached out to us and we took on this task. 1 person went over there multiple times a day and just sat in the yard without saying a word. Just building trust with presence. She started to come closer and ate out of the hand but didn't want to get touched. Eventually we put out a humane trap and after a few days we were able to trap her in it. The morning we finally captured her, she greeted us with a wagging tail and did a 180 personality change. She let us put her on a leash and jumped right in the car and was like a different dog.  She doe snot like cats but She is great with other dogs and loves kids all age. She does better in a low traffic home as she is very protective of her family. She will bark at strangers and can sound quite intimidating. Someone who lives alone or a family who doesn't a have many many visitor would be best. She is a doll and these pictures doesn't even show her real beauty. She  deserves a great home. She is housebroken, non destructive, has the softest coat ever and once she trust you just a cuddle bug. For some reason Baby has been terribly over looked and has been with us for 3 years. She barely get applications which is unbelievable because she is not only stunning but also the sweetest girl you have ever met.\nShe has some food allergies and can only have poultry and grain fee foods but otherwise she is happy and healthy.\n\nShe is great with other dogs but would also be ok as the only dog since she is not a big player at all. If she can pick over dog companionship or humans, she will pick her human every time. All she wants is to please and be with you .\nShe just needs a chance to show that for the past years someone was missing out on the perfect dog.. \nShe is about 5 years old and weighs between 45 and 50 lbs,\n\nUPDATE 7/25/20 Baby just recently developed a food allergy to grains and poultry. She can only have foods and treats without those ingredients.\n\nIf you would like to meet Baby please send us a message in order to receive an application. We are only able to meet with are approved applicants since we do not have a shelter available to the public.\n\nBaby's adoption fee is $ 250 which includes all vaccines, heartworm test, spay and micro chip.",

            "description": "April is a stunning and active young adult.\nShe was originally impounded as a stray in a kill shelter and after we pulled her we realized that she was pregnant.\n4 weeks later she gave birth to 7 wonderful puppies which all found homes very quick, but no interest in MOM yet.\nShe is very energetic 5 year old and loves to play with other dogs her size. She weighs about 45 lbs.\nWe would  like to see her in a home with an active person who might take her on hikes, long walks or runs.\nNo small children because of her quick movements and energy, older children are fine.\nShe does need some leash training as she likes to to jump on by passing people or bikes. She does not like cats and gets along best with dogs her size or bigger. \nShe rides very well in the car and is a big snuggler. She listens well and is crate and house trained.\nShe does need an experienced dog owner who can establish him or her as the alpha as she likes to take over as the boss lady.\n\nIf you would like to meet our beautiful girl, please send us a message in order to receive an application. \nWe are only able to meet with pre approved adopters since we do not have a shelter available to the public.\n\nApril's adoption fee is $ 250 which includes all vaccines, heartworm test, spay and micro chip",

She is a 3 year old pitbull/cane corso mix and still has lots of puppy energy. She would do best in a household that is physically active and can get her out for daily exercise, not just letting her out in a yard although she would also love a yard and is great at fetch. She will need someone willing to work with her and her anxiety around dogs outside of her home, she is strong and will pull. We recommend any adopter plan on hiring a trainer (we have some we can recommend!) for a few sessions to make sure you start out on the right foot. Maise does likes other dogs she just needs a slow introduction, a nice leash walk first has worked well prior to introducing them in the house. She loves her doggie foster siblings. She will also need a yard with a 6ft fence. Maise loves kids and has been real good while meeting them. Maise is smart and eager to please so with a little love and patience she will be a wonderful companion. She loves to cuddle and thinks she is a lap dog. She will drench you in kisses and beg for snuggles any time of the day.\n\nBecause of Maise's breeds she can not be adopted to anyone living in a city with breed restrictions and you must own your home.",

Bosco is neutered, up to date on his vaccinations, on heartworm preventative as well as house and crate trained. Bosco cannot wait to be part of a loving family who will cherish and spoil him for the rest of his life.\n\nAll dogs we rescue stay with us until they find their forever homes. We do not do same day adoptions. A home visit is required to ensure our dog is going to a safe environment and our dog gets along with your dog(s) and/or cat(s). We require all our dogs over the age of 1 year attend 1 obedience class (6 week session) outside the home. You must live within 1 hour of Birmingham, MI to adopt one of our dogs.

She has found joy in life again! Taylor loves to take in all the loving she can get now. She\u2019ll do nothing but put a smile on your face every moment of every day! She continues to emerge with personality! You can\u2019t help to chuckle at the way she bounces around the yard like a puppy. She\u2019s good with other dogs and people. She is exceptionally quiet. Great in a crate and in a vehicle. She loves to walk. She will really be a joy to a great home. Specific requirements for Taylor\u2018s new home is as follows: no chain link fencing, secure gate and fence, no dirt yard area (she\u2019s a dirt diver) so preferably all or mix of concrete, artificial turf and possibly well-established grass. She could also be a good apartment dog with a work from home situation or with a contracted dog walker. \nTay Tay is a great size at approx 47lbs. Located in Los Angeles, CA.",

Neighbors were feeding him daily for about seven weeks before we stepped in. \n\nBuddy4 is a 10 year old Boxer/Pit Bull Terrier Mix weighing 75 lbs. He is currently getting a daily walk to work on his boyish figure. Buddy4 would like to meet any new doggie friends before committing to living together and would really prefer to live the bachelor life. He is a loyal boy who loves affection and belly rubs and might even give a few kisses. Buddy has a few favorite stuffed toys and will pass the time chewing on a good bully stick. He is a fantastic walking partner and also a lounge on the dog bed kind of guy. Buddy4 doesn\u2019t require much but a soft bed to lay on, food, walks and some neck scratches.\n\nDo you have room in your heart and home for Buddy4?\n\nHead to our website and fill out an adoption application: https://www.foreverlovedpets.org/adopt/dog-adoption-application\nOr email adopt@foreverlovedpets.org\n",

Cane Haven Rescue took him into rescue to give him another chance at life. Bear is approximately 3 years old, up to date on vaccinations, neutered & microchipped. \n\n Bear absolutely loves people and children. He has had a tough life before arriving to Colorado and was locked in a shed for approximately 3 months without any interaction. He needs a place/home that understands he needs to be able to go outside and stretch his legs, while also coming in and loving on his humans! \n\nBear is house trained, kennel trained & knows his basic commands/manners. actually is. He absolutely loves sun bathing & relaxing in his foster home. \n\nInterested adopters can fill out an application at canehavenrescue.com. \nAny possible questions about Bear, please email canehavenrescue@gmail.com \n\nCane Haven Rescue will transport any of their adoptable dogs to the right home. We do require adoption fees that are based on the age & health status of the adoptable dog. The adoption fee covers every single dog in CHR with vaccinations, heartworm test, deworming, microchip, spay/neuter & medications. All CHR adoptable dogs are current on their monthly  heartworm and flea medication. A CHR representative will do a home check to ensure the pets are placed in a secure and loving home. \n\nwww.canehavenrescue.com",

            "description": "Location: New Orleans, Louisiana \n\nEmma was found as a stray at a busy intercestion in Baton Rouge. The shelter picked her up and diagnosed her with a spinal injury resulting in paralysis. Cane Haven Rescue pulled her from the shelter to give him another chance at life because she was next on the euthanasia list. Emma is approximately 1 years old, up to date on vaccinations, & microchipped. \n\nEmma is going to take a very special person who understands what she needs on a daily basis. She has a very long road ahead of her but we are determined to give her the best possible life. She is currently paralyzed and needs help to do daily functions - walking, using the bathroom, etc. \n\nEmma is going to have multiple doctor visits, therapy sessions and much more. We are going to be very particular where she ends up because we need to be confident she will be properly cared for.\n\nInterested adopters can fill out an application at canehavenrescue.com. \nAny possible questions about Emma, please email canehavenrescue@gmail.com \n\nCane Haven Rescue will transport any of their adoptable dogs to the right home. We do require adoption fees that are based on the age & health status of the adoptable dog. The adoption fee covers every single dog in CHR with vaccinations, heartworm test, deworming, microchip, spay/neuter & medications. All CHR adoptable dogs are current on their monthly  heartworm and flea medication. A CHR representative will do a home check to ensure the pets are placed in a secure and loving home. \n\nwww.canehavenrescue.com",

I know, I know \u2013 I\u2019m incredibly handsome. :)\n\nMy brothers (Beck and Gordon) and I have lived outside all our lives and have not had any contact with people (or other dogs). I am the most fearful and untrusting of the 3 of us \u2013 but I\u2019m getting better every day. Baby steps! Can you love me and help me learn to trust?\n\nI\u2019ve just joined the wonderful Brittanys at BRIT and am looking for a foster home so BRIT can report back with my great personality traits. I came from a nice place but had absolutely NO socialization. I\u2019m inexperienced in life and very cautious. I need a home with another Brittany who can show me how to be a Brittany \u2013 I honestly don\u2019t have a clue.\n\nPlease check back for updates on me at www.brittanyrescueintexas.org\n\n\nCyrus is up to date on shots, neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative and on preventative. He\u2019s looking for a foster or even better a forever home. He needs a family that is very patient, supportive and consistent to help him gain the confidence he needs to be the best Brittany he can be.",

They are sweet older gals who need a low key home. Both have hip dysplasia. They are good with other dogs. We are trying to keep them together. They are definitely bonded. No small children. Both are good with cats. They are both heartworm negative. Please call their adoption coordinator Alexandra 330-261-3934 if you can rescue them. Their adoption donation is $150 for both and includes UTD vaccines and microchips. They are not spayed and are too old to put them through that.",

He is exuberant, smart,  enthusiastic, and as silly as a goose! \nJerry Brown is seeking a young family with a fenced yard who will love him and can handle his boundless energy and toy fetish.  Speaking of toys, he will carry them all around the house until someone agrees to play tug-a-war with him.  \nJerry Brown is the best car rider!  He loves to go bye bye and explore new places.   \nJB is leash trained, house trained, neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped \nJerry is quite a large dog and would not be a good fit for small children or elderly owners.  Sometimes his prey drive will kick in and  it takes a strong hand to hold him if he sees a ground hog, opossum, or a squirrel!   \n\nIf you think this handsome man may be your soulmate please copy and paste the link for an application\n\nhttps://forms.gle/i6vCT6447Eew8NCg9",

Taser is SUPER friendly, sweet, and playful.  He is ok with most dogs but can be a bully so would do best in a home with female dogs or with dogs that aren't afraid of him!  He is very exuberant so would do best in a home with kids over 10 years.  Taser is crate trained, seems to be house trained and is working on his manners.  He would benefit from a training class to work on his manners.  Taser needs a fair amount of physical exercise to stay happy so couch potatoes please don't apply!  Taser is a happy guy!\n\nBirthday: 5/18\nAdoption fee: $300\nWeight: 90 lbs.",

The two boys came to us with the female named Jenga going to Muttley Crue. Zane arrived at his Illinois foster home yesterday after going straight to the vet in Dayton from the shelter. He is completely vetted, including having the cyst removed from his head, having a bad tooth removed, neutered and microchipped. He is good with other dogs. Zane was fear reactive in the kennel at the shelter, mostly to one of the male wardens. He was reactive in the crate on transport out of the shelter but on all transport after that he rode tethered and was amazing. He will crate right up, he just seems to be afraid of what might happen when crated. His foster dad will update us on how that is going. He is a big boy and is definitely a ladies man...he took right to his foster dad but may have some fear issues when meeting new men, we will work on and update on that, as well. 9/5: Zane's foster dad is continuing to work with him on his fear issues. He will not be available for adoption until at least 11/1/20. Please check back in on him soon!",

The two boys came to us with the female named Jenga going to Muttley Crue. Evan is estimated at 12 years old. He had some vaccinations at intake at the shelter and will be seeing the vet in a couple of days to get some more needed routine vetting and to get all checked over. He is wonderful with other dogs and is amazingly sweet and loving. He absolutely adores snuggling with his foster dad. Evan walks well on a leash, is housebroken and will kennel up, although he did figure out how to open the kennel :) He may also have limited hearing, definitely not unusual at his age. 6/5 UPDATE: Evan was neutered and had a bump checked out this past Monday. His surgery went great!!12/1/20: Evan moved to his Wisconsin foster home and has already shown his foster mom & dad his precious Boxer lean-in for pets and rubs :)",

I do tend to guard my food so I would do best as an only dog but I get along with confident medium to large female dogs as playmates. I would do best in a home without children or cats. I am a loyal loving boy. If you give me a chance I won't let you down. \n\nI am available for adoption or foster. I will need an owner who has experience with herding breeds.

When he sees the leash, Chucky will perk up and wag his tail with joy at the prospect of exploring the neighborhood. Have a toy? Chucky loves balls and squeaky toys! Ready to roll around in the grass or toss them in the air. \n\nAll in all, Chucky is an easygoing dog. He is people friendly, affectionate, a lover of kisses, and playful. Furthermore, Chucky is dog friendly (cats unknown), house trained, crate trained, and trustworthy when home alone.\n\nChucky isn't usually bothered if his food or treats are touched or taken away. However, he will gently grab the person's hand with his mouth and move it away so that his food isn't taken away.\n\nPlease note that Chucky is reported to be fearful of children so he needs to be in an adult only home. \n\nIf you're looking for a medium-energy dog who is equally happy sitting next to you on the couch as going for a pleasant stroll, Chucky could be the one for you!\n\nIf interested in adopting or fostering, email us at twentypawsrescue@gmail.com or info@twentypawsrescue.com.

He's currently on a diet in a foster home with five other dogs ranging from 12-50lbs and many cats.  If picked up the \"wrong way\" (a way that bothers his stump), he can be nippy so small children are not recommended.  Since losing weight, his mobility has improved immensely, and he is incredibly fast.  He is crate-trained.  He does like to run, so a fenced-in backyard is ideal.  He does like to bark at noises outside so apartments are not a good idea.  He loves hunting for duck eggs in his foster's backyard and loves car rides.  He is wary of strangers but very loving and sweet to his owner.  If you are interested in this little butterball, please fill out an adoption application for him at animalalliancenj.org.  He is currently being fostered in Warren County.",

            "description": "Princess Buttercup is waiting for her forever home!She cannot stay in the kennel as being around other dogs stresses her out. In her foster home she's made so much progress and has proven herself to be an amazing companion! She's a total sweetheart with a fun and quirky personality. She's never met a person she doesn't like and does well with everyone - but also keeps a respectful distance from those who don't want to be her friend. If she had her way, you'd start working from home so she'll never have to be without you - she can be anxious when left alone in a new environment, but settles in once she feels safe and secure. Mornings are peak snuggle-time for Princess Buttercup; if you're not a morning person already, you will be once you make her part of your family. Don't worry though, she'll never run out of cuddles or affection for the people around her. She's generally a well-behaved girl with just enough of a naughty streak to keep you on your toes (i.e be careful about leaving food around, even if you think it's beyond her reach). She's fully house trained and continues to work on her crate skills. Grooming is generally hassle-free is you ask her nicely and make sure there's a treat in it for her. She does well in public, and while she's definitely not a dog-person, she is pretty easy on walks and doesn't bark at anyone. If you think you're ready to add additional cuddles, laughter, and love to your life, Princess Buttercup is the right dog for you. If you are interested in meeting Princess Buttercup, go to la.bestfriends.org/adopt and fill out our Dog Adoption Survey and our team will reach out to you!",

She loves that her glam squad at Best Friends Los Angeles acquiesces to her requests for photo shoots, complete with wings of her own a la Victoria's Secret Angel. Blind and diabetic, the shelter environment is no place for this 5-year-old to thrive. Cherish has spent time in a foster home and settled in quickly. Despite her visual impairment, she acclimates quickly to her surroundings and is a calm, sweet, and curious girl. Cherish is house trained (with easy, regular access to the outdoors) and very easy-going. Cherish loves people and is curious about other dogs. She needs a slow introduction, supervision, and management around other canines. She is a bit pushy and nervous, but desperately wants to be friends - meaning that other dogs need to be understanding and patient with her. Cherish would do best in a home with no cats.When you adopt Cherish you will also receive a gift from 1-800-PetMeds to welcome her home. If you are interested in meeting Cherish, go to la.bestfriends.org/adopt and fill out our Dog Adoption Survey and our team will reach out to you!",

Sadly she has been in shelters since mid-2019 and came to us from a municipal shelter in West Virginia. When she was young, she was hit by a car, causing permanent damage to her left eye but it causes her no pain and does not require any current treatment or medication. You would never know she is practically blind in her left eye because it doesn't slow her down one bit. In fact, she's super aware of her surroundings and has a strong prey instinct so she can't go to a home with farm animals, cats, birds or any similar species.\n\nLeela absolutely loves to play fetch and is amazing at it. If fetch was a competitive sport, you would want her on your team! She is so smart and just wants to be around people all of the time. Do you want a dog to go with you on a hike during the day then return home to just Netflix and chill with you on the couch for the evening? Then Leela's your girl! She will be by your side in so many fun activities from playing in the water to hiking up a mountain; she is the sporty sidekick you've been looking for. Need some cuddle time? She will snuggle up right beside you.\n\nLeela just wants to be your best friend and aims to please the people in her life. Her reaction to seeing you when you walk through the door will make you feel like the most loved person in the world. \n\nIs Leela the one you've been waiting for?",

Ive been here a while, and living in a kennel is no life for a young dog like me! Im more comfortable when I can explore a yard and smell all the smells. I love my toys and I really love treats. If I see youve got a treat ready for me, Ill sit down politely, no questions asked. Since I love treats so much, my human friends say I have a great potential for training! Id love to learn some tricks! If thats not your thing, no worries. Another one of my favorite things is having a nice, soft dog bed to chillax on! Either way, Im pretty sure Im a Very Good Boy- my human friends tell me so all the time. I weigh approximately 63 lbs. Click here to view my paperwork.",

He was also tested with dogs (male and female), He did great with females but only ok with some males so he may need a home without males. He does need a home without cats! Jedi is neutered and does have his rabies vaccination.\n\nJedi is located at the Manci Prison Program for training, he is not at our shelter. If you would like to set up a time to meet him you will need to send an email to: Christina.thomas@odrc.state.oh.us\n\nUPDATE FROM PRISON PROGRAM:\nJedi has become like any normal dog, his progress was extremely fast, he came to us fully trained in his basic commands. He's just about ready for adoption. The only problems he has are with people that he's not familiar with reaching for his muzzle, due to his teeth being damaged. He has no toy-food or dog aggression. But he has to be introduced in the right way to certain dogs.\n\nFor an adoption application you can request one via richlandcountypets@yahoo.com",

A perfect example of how a dog acts when they are abandoned by their owner. \n\nMeet Millie, a 1 year old lab and pit mix. Millie knows how to sit, shake, stay and lay. Millie specifically loves squeaker toys, she knows where her toy box is and is not shy to entertain herself with toys provided. Although she hasn\u2019t mastered picking up after herself! ? Millie also loves a good bone, and is kind enough to allow you to take it from her whenever you wish. Millie is both potty trained and crate trained. She knows the \u201ckennel up\u201d command, making the crating process an ease. She has proven to be well-behaved at nighttime, and is allowed to sleep outside of the crate. Millie loves people and wants to be close to her \u201cperson\u201d. She loves to snuggle but will be respectful of boundaries that are set. \n\nMillie is smart, quick to learn and wants to please; she just needs someone who will set the standards. She needs to be an only dog. Millie is not good with cats. Millie will need a home with a fenced in yard. Mille would do great in a home no apartments. Millie does amazing with respectful children. \n\nMille is vaccinated for rabies, distemper, and bordatella. She is spayed and microchipped. Millie\u2019s adoption fee is $400 plus WI state tax!\n\nFill out an application at www.luckypawsmidwest.org once your application is approved we will set up a meet and greet. \n\nLucky Paws Midwest is licensed and inspected by the State of Wisconsin: 402655-DS",

            "description": "Age: 7 yrs\nWeight: 70 lbs\nReported good with kids 12+\n\nJordan is a calm quiet lady who is happiest just relaxing with the family. She is looking for a peaceful life where she can settle back and take walks with plenty of time to stop and smell nature. Jordan loves to use her nose whether it is pushing a toy, looking for treats, or just investigating during her daily walk. \n\nJordan is a wonderful work-from-home partner if you dont mind a little snoring. She quickly adapts to a routine and doesnt ask for much during the day. Jordan is house and crate trained and loves to ride in the car. She does not pull on the leash but will stop and let you know which way she wants to walk.\n\nJordan is cautious and she can become easily startled which causes her to retreat to her bed. She could use help building confidence and her foster family is working with her, but she will need consistency and patience from her adopter to continue their efforts.\n\nShe is a laid-back girl looking for a calm household. If you give Jordan time to warm up, she provides nonstop love. Do you have a warm spot in your heart and home for this beautiful and serene lass?\n\nYou can apply to adopt Jordan at https://www.mostlymuttz.org/adoption-application/.",

Date: Peanut aka Blackie is Back Home!\n\nOur sweet lil Peanut is back with his foster...sadly, his rear leg was in such bad shape the best option for him was amputation. Peanut's leg was horribly infected (we ran a culture to make sure we have him on the right antibiotics) and his bone was compromised from it. He is home resting, already ate a good dinner and in a couple of weeks will be out running and playing. Tonight it is all about resting and getting his strength back after all he has been through. Thank you to everyone who donated towards his surgery and care. Peanut is a sweet baby and we are grateful we are able to help him with your support!!\n\nIn the Beginning:\n\nPuppy Blackie aka Peanut Needs US!!!\n\nWhen we saw the picture of a baby laying on the side of a rode with a huge gash on his leg our hearts sank. We had no idea where he was, but offered to help...he was in Tijuana! We normally can't help the dogs of TJ because we don't have any volunteers or resources there. When a local rescuer offered to help and go pick him up we agreed to rescue him. A Good Samaritan saw it happen, a truck who could have avoided him, decided not too...we feared there was a break and oh boy is there. Peanut was stabilized in TJ and made his way to us this weekend. He is in a foster home awaiting surgery with an orthopedic surgeon to repair that break! Peanut is the sweetest little man, he is about 5 months old and maybe 15 pounds. We need your help to help Peanut! We know Covid is taking its toll, but we couldn't leave him to die on the side of a road in Tijuana!\n\nWays to Donate:\nFacebook: via the button on the post\nVenmo: @labradorsandfriends\nPayPal: labradorsandfriends@yahoo.com\nWebsite: www.labradorsandfriends.org\nCheck/Cash in the mail: Labradors and Friends - 2307 Fenton Parkway #107-160, San Diego, CA 92108\nTax ID#32-0195297",

She is 3 years old and fully grown at about 60 lbs. She is heartworm positive, but treatment is not complicated or expensive, so please don't let that deter you from meeting this awesome girl. Adoption fee includes vaccinations, spay, and microchip. Due to her heartworm status, we are unable to transport her, so any potential adopters would need to be able to come to the shelter.

She is super sweet and we wish we could keep her but we are being kicked out of our house because of it and are having a hard time finding a new rental.\n\nCheck the words that best describe your dog: PROTECTIVE, ACTIVE, PLAYFUL, NERVOUS, SMART, AFFECTIONATE\n\nIs the dog currently on vaccinations?: Yes\n\nIs your dog housebroken?: Yes\n\nAre there any behavior problems?: Yes\n\nIf yes, please describe in as much detail as possible: Reaction to bikes and offleash dogs that spook her. \n\nDoes the dog get along with:: Dog-Friendly. Ella does best when she lives with another dog. She has a lot of dog friends. She isn't good at first impressions so she doesn't go to the dog park. She is leash reactive only if an off leash dog approaches her without the \"proper\" introduction.\n\nDoes your dog have handling sensitivities? How is your dog meeting strangers?: She can be timid when you approach her from behind. She doesn't like to be picked up. She is timid at first but overall fine.\n\nDoes the dog like children?: Yes\n\nAre there children in the home?: No\n\nAny specific feeding instructions you would care to share with your dogs new owner?: None. She is not food aggressive. She does wait for her \"okay\" to start eating.\n\nWhere does the dog sleep?: In the bed, on the floor next to the bed, or in her crate.\n\nIs the dog allowed on your furniture?: Yes\n\nIs the dog crate trained?: Yes\n\nWhere do you keep your dog: When we aren't home we keep her in the crate: She is free to go wherever she wants, she mostly hangs out on the couch with us, in her crate, or in our bed.\n\nHow does the dog react to being left alone?: She is fine with it.\n\nPlease list any particular fears your dog has.: Bikes, motorcycles, off leash strange dogs.\n\nDesrcibe any training the dog has, tricks it knows, and any experience with a trainer.: She had private trainings with Sandy Matthieson and also group trainings with her.

Also, any time you reach down to pet her and she is comfortable around you, she will just immediately lay down for belly rubs.\n\nAre there any things you think a new owner needs to know?: You have to introduce her to dogs in the right way! We have told many dog sitters this and they don't believe us. Then the dog introduction goes poorly. \n\nPlease describe a typical day for your dog during the workweek (what time wake up, when eat, how many walks a day, where to -- dog parks, trails, neighborhoods, runs, etc), how long left home alone, what time to bed?: 6 am - wake up hang out with dad\n7 am - go back to bed to cuddle with mom\n9 am - get out of bed, go outside, and eat breakfast\n10 am - 30 min walk\n11 am - home along in crate\n12 pm - go outside then home alone again\n5 pm - 30 min walk\n6 pm - dinner then cuddles, usually refuses to go outside again for the rest of the night\n\nShe only reacts to bikes when they sneak up on her (if she seems them coming, she is fine), motorcycles and off leash dogs who approach her. She has to meet other dogs by walking on leash with them parallel for approximately 5 min and then she is ready to be best friends. (Puppies don't require any warming up.) She is crate trained and loves it. She also knows sit, stay, lay down, come, look, touch, drop it, leave it. She is super smart and picks up new commands quickly.\n\nAPPLY at heartsforpawsrescue.com/adopt\nfacebook.com/heartsforpawsrescue",

She is a very sweet pup but is fearful. She needs a home that will have patience with her. Someone who will give her room and time to warm up at her own pace. She will NEED another dog in the house and a fenced in yard.  Tabitha is house trained, and crate trained. Her behavior is outstanding at her foster home, she has never damaged or chewed anything and gets along great with her foster siblings.  She knows the following commands: Crate Up, Go Lay down, Wait, Let's go out to Potty, Time to eat, Time for a treat.  Tabitha loves her crate; she will require a crate in her new home to adjust She will be a great dog if given lots of love and patience to give her time to be the great dog she can be. We also feel that children older than 10 would be best for her.\nTabitha is spayed, microchipped and up to date on her vaccines. \n\nIf you are interested in Tabitha, please fill out our application which can be found on our web site www.itavar.com. Once we get your application, we will call you to set up a meet n greet.\n\nYou can also see more pictures on our Facebook page, https://www.facebook.com/ITAVAR/\n",

She is heart worm positive and our rescue will treat.\n\nAll our pets are spayed or neutered, vaccinated including rabies, given de-wormer, heartworm negative or being treated with the slow kill method approved by our veterinarian, on prevention, on flea/tick prevention, most are house trained. The majority but not all of our pets require a fence. Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered. We adopt within 300 miles of New Orleans/Baton Rouge, La and we do not ship or transport--Adoption fee $200. Email us at creolepoodlerescue@yahoo.com to get an adoption application. Complete an adoption form and email it back to us (we do not have a FAX) if interested in adopting and providing a loving home for this pet.  If you can't email it to us, you can mail it to P.O. Box 2333, Gonzales, La 70707, but this will slow the process down.\n\nWhen you request an adoption application, we will also send you our guidelines to read - many questions you may have are answered there.  All of our pets are in private foster homes. We require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meeting for any of our pets. Everything we know at this time about this pet is posted.IF YOU SEE THIS PET POSTED ON OUR ADOPTABLE PETS PAGE, THIS PET IS AVAILABLE. WE UPDATE OUR ADOPTABLE PETS SEVERAL TIMES DAILY.  IF THE WORD PENDING IS NEXT TO THE NAME, THE PET HAS AN APPROVED ADOPTER COMING TO MEET AND PROBABLY ADOPT HIM OR HER.  We reserve the right to refuse adoption for any reason.\n\nWe are all VOLUNTEERS and have full time jobs, families, pets of our own to care for - we do the best that we can to get back to you in a timely manner.  Please realize that turning in an application today will not mean that you adopt a poodle tomorrow.  We believe in taking the time to go through our thorough process to try to match the dog with the family.",

            "description": "Sweet Shadow is a favorite at AAC! She came to us as a stray in mid-May, and quickly wiggled her way into the hearts of every staffer and volunteer she met. Shadow has tons of energy and she loves to swim! At the shelter she can often be found dunking herself underwater in the play yard pools, so she would probably LOVE a trip to the lake or your backyard oasis! Shadow has strong opinions about other dogs, so well insist she meet any resident dogs before being adopted to make sure shell be happiest in her new home. At just 55 pounds, Shadow is the perfect size for any home. She appears to be housetrained, but may need a few reminders and patience in a new space. Unfortunately we dont know her experience with kids, cats, or small animals. I weigh approximately 55 lbs. Click here to view my behavior notes from staff and volunteers.",

He is shy at first but warms up to his family .  He \"talks\" to his foster mom and tells her all sorts of stories!  He loves to watch television and snuggle up close to her!

She is about 4 years old and weighs about 13 lbs. She is sweet and friendly with people and other dogs. She was accepted into the rescue w her friend Sawyer (male doxie mix). She has been vaccinated and dewormed and is heartworm positive. She will be heartworm treated and spayed prior to her trip to PA. Sarah is scheduled for transport from GA to PA on Feb 7th. Applications can be found at www.wagsrescue.com\n\nOur Adoption Area - WAGS RESCUE is based in BUCKS COUNTY. Therefore, a majority of our volunteers live in the Bucks County area. WAGS will consider adoption applications for people living in the BUCKS and MONTGOMERY areas. On a case by case basis (depending on distance and availability of our volunteers to do a home visit), we may consider applications in the PHILADELPHIA area as well as parts of CHESTER county.\n\nDue to a higher than normal volume of applications, we will not be doing any adoptions outside a 50-mile radius from Horsham Veterinary Hospital.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\nPlease call Colleen @ 267-238-7892 or Susan @ 267-312-3372. To begin the adoption process please, please fill out our online application. Go to wagsrescue.com and click on adoption form. After you complete the application, you will be taken to PayPal so you can submit the $25.00 application fee. Thank you!",

            "description": "Please contact us directly at Deethenetworker@gmail.com for more information \n\nLos Angeles - CA  5 year old black Great Dane male. Goblin was brought down from the Pacific Northwest from a difficult family situation where he was in the middle of somewhere short of domestic violence, but certainly verbal arguments. Something a protective Great Dane would have trouble navigating through. He was sent back to his first home but unable to live with his brother as both boys were now adults and dominant. There were terrible dog fights and Goblin has since become extremely dog reactive.  Goblin has grown up with children and farm animals. It is heartbreaking that he is now reactive to both male and female dogs. Could it be fixed? Maybe with proper training. But the risk of hurting another dog is great. I would not nor do I expect anyone else to take on that risk. We are looking for a one dog home with a secure yard and lifestyle that keeps Goblin safely at home. Trips to veterinary clinic must include a proper muzzle. I will provide a correctly sized Baskerville to adopter. Goblin is not for every home, but I believe the right family is out there. I will consider out of area adoption with the proper references including a verifiable veterinary history and home check by local animal rescue or professionals. Inside of home can be done via video considering the current COVID-19 circumstances we live in today.  This is an absolutely wonderful, loving, friendly dog to all humans.  Plays nicely with his toys, takes treats gently.  He has a good 'sit'.  But will pull on the leash when he sees other dogs.  Some behavioral modification and training is a must.\n\nContact us directly at Deethehetworker@gmail.com",

He is a big boy so a house without small children would be best, but he has done well with my 14 year old niece. He is dog friendly and even maintained his calm when two other stray dogs rushed us on a walk. He is currently HW+ but is undergoing treatment. He chases cats so no cats!

            "description": "This special old guy is Spark, and he has been waiting for a very long time for a forever home of his own. \n\nSpark is about 11 years old, and is an extremely handsome old guy. He\u2019s part Blue Heeler and part German Shepherd, and he definitely got the good looks and brains from both breeds. He takes a while to warm up to new people, but once he trusts you he will show you all of the training he has under his belt! For the people he has formed a bond with he will wait at gates/doors and does not  pass through until you say 'okay'. He will sit for treats and he will be super easy to walk. He will be calm around traffic and will ride nicely in the car. He is really a great guy in so many ways.\n\nSpark will need to be with someone who will introduce him to new people thoughtfully and carefully. He will also need to be with someone who is understanding of his old dog crotchety nature at times. He would love to live on a farm with someone who appreciates him for who he is and doesn\u2019t push him into uncomfortable situations. \n\nSpark has lived with dogs before, but not children. We feel as if he\u2019d do best in a mature household with someone who has previous dog experience. \n\nSpark is a gem, and needs someone who can pull the best out of him and give him a comfortable loving home for his golden years. We are partnering with the Stray Hearts Animal Shelter in Taos New Mexico to find Spark a forever home. Please help us spread the word for this amazing old guy!!!\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior pets have a history of being kept up to date on vaccines, annual exams and recommended bloodwork. We also do home checks to make sure that your home environment meets the needs of the particular dog you are interested in.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adoption, please fill out our online adoption survey at http://olddogsnewdigs.com/form-adoption.html.\n",

Shepherd Mix\nPERMANENT FOSTER NEEDED!!!\n\nBelow we have indicated what was told to us upon intake. Once we assess the dog we will update the following:\n\nBackground: Humane court case.\nPersonality: Prefers slow intros. True shepherd will bond with handlers. Fearful at first introductions. No bite history.\nCats: No\nDogs: No\nKids: No adult only home\nEnergy Level: High\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate Trained: Yes\nPrey Drive For Wildlife (no invisible fence if high): High\nFence Required: No\nBest Home For This Pet: Shepard experience with fearful dogs.Low traffic home away from major roads.\n\nWe do our best to get to know each and every dog at our camp. Their personalities emerge after being with us for a bit and sometimes change. The personality and other information included in the above description is based on what we know currently in the shelter environment. All dogs are up to date on vaccines (Distemper, Rabies, Bordetella), microchipped, spayed/neutered and receive worming, flea & tick medication before they are adopted out. Please note there are some exceptions depending on the condition of the dog. If you are interested in this dog please fill out an online application at https://www.camppapillon.org/dog-application.\n\nOnce your dog is in your home, they will adjust and relax and could become more playful or show more personality traits as they begin to open up. Once adopted, please allow your dog time to decompress and relax in a stable home environment",

Dogs 1 year and older are $60.\nGustavo is a sweet and friendly boy weighing about 55 pounds. He spent most of his time outdoors at his prior house but that doesn't mean he wouldn't love to spend more time indoors and really become part of a family. He's young and active and would love a family that will spend time playing with him and doing outdoor activities. He loves to run and play but he sits nicely when asked. He also enjoys petting and attention. This friendly guy is looking forward to become your new family member!\nTo make an appointment to meet Gustavo please submit an online application at THHS.org\nADOPTION INCLUDES: Spay or Neuter, Deworming, Vaccinations (excluding rabies), Microchip, Free Vet visit at Participating Offices, 30 Days of Health Insurance provided by PetHealth (some restrictions apply).

She is good with other dogs similar to her size, however, she would be excellent as the only dog too as she prefers the company of people. She tends to resource guards with other dogs, easy to manage though. We feed everyone separately in crates and chews and toys are reserved for crate time. NO CATS or other small animals please, she is way too interested. Ella is good with considerate people in general, however, we prefer to place her in a adult only home or a home with teenagers due to her size, strength  & energy. She is house/crate trained. Needs a little leash work, but responds well to positive methods of training. This gal would thrive best in a active home with plenty of outdoor adventures! She thinks car rides are the best things ever! Ella is independent, not a velcro dog, just the right balance of affectionate/does her own thing and has a fun personality. Someone is going to adopt a fantastic girl!\n\nFB video: https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2778889782381612&extid=BjkwM3kRNx3dvnAb\n\n*Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable. For the large majority of our dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

            "description": "Kiera is a stunning, 4 year old German Shepherd. She found herself in our care after her owner passed away & the extended family could not care for her. \n\nKiera is a wonderful dog, but due to poor socialization in her former home she is very fearful in new situations. Kiera needs a home that can allow her the space to decompress and adjust, as well as additional training to continue her rehab. \n\nKiera would thrive in an adult only home, outside of the city. She lived in a private home with a yard, and is finding the city too stimulating and unpredictable for her liking. \n\nShe has been exposed to cats, and has done well around them. We think she could potentially live with other small dogs. Her behavior around larger dogs is unknown at this time.\n\nKiera is housebroken, and knows a few commands. She is not affectionate with strangers until she feels safe, so it does take her time to warm up. Once she does, she bonds fiercely to her people and can get protective. We are trying to work through this but she will need an experienced handler to continue. \n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, Please Read Below.\n\nWe do not have a public shelter, all of our dogs are in private foster homes. Applications are processed in the order in which they are received. You can email adopt.truenorthrescue@gmail.com for more information.\n\nThink this dog is the one for you? Apply today at www.truenorthrescue.org.\n\nYou may read more about our adoption policies and procedures at www.truenorthrescue.org. Please submit a complete application on our website - meet and greets are only scheduled with approved applicants. Please be sure to answer every question as thoughtfully as you can, this will help your chances. Incomplete applications will not be reviewed, and we unfortunately can not contact all applicants to inquire about missing information.\n\nDo not email through Petfinder because we won't be able to answer. Please email adopt.truenorthrescue@gmail.com to check on the status of your application. All applications can take anywhere from 24-72 hours to be processed and only approved applicants will be contacted.\n\nIf a dog is listed here on Petfinder, they are still available. Please don't email just to ask if they're available - they are! With the high volume of emails we receive daily, it is not guaranteed that we can reply to every inquiry. As a fully volunteer run rescue, we make every effort to reply in a timely fashion, but please allow 24-48 hours for a response.\n\nWe strive to have accurate and up to date bios, and regularly check in with our fosters to ensure we are providing the most relevant information. If there is no mention of a health or behavioral concern, then it means we have not been informed of one!",

No worries, with a dog like me you can expect all kinds of extras--extra cuddles, extra snuggles, and extra love! I\u2019m one year old, weigh 6.5 pounds, and am spayed, fully vetted, vaccinated, and on heartworm preventative. That means I\u2019m ready for my forever home, maybe with you!\n\nI\u2019m just a young pup, which means I\u2019m Tireless! I love to run and play in the yard with my foster siblings and chase the cats if they let me. Toys are so much fun, but I share very well with other dogs and get along with dogs of all sizes. I'll definitely need some dog siblings in my new home, as well as a fenced yard we can all play in together! I\u2019m also Tender-hearted! I love to cuddle with my foster moms in a cozy blanket.\n\nDespite my small size and young age, I\u2019m Tough and Tenacious! I have a special medical condition called megaesophagus. That means my esophagus, the tube that carries food and water from my mouth to my stomach, gets larger and loses its ability to do its job. Left on its own, food and water slosh around in my esophagus and can\u2019t make it to my stomach, which means I could choke. Don\u2019t worry though! I have my own special highchair to keep me upright while I\u2019m eating, allowing gravity to help move my food to the right location (if you adopt me, my chair comes along too!). My foster moms would be happy to teach you how to feed me and keep me safe. \n\nBecause of my condition, I need a mom or dad who has experience with dogs--even better if they have experience with special needs dogs like me! I would love a home with another dog to play with, but I can\u2019t be with younger children who don\u2019t understand how dangerous it is to give me extra food or treats. I\u2019ll need to stay in my crate, which I love, while you\u2019re away to be sure I don\u2019t get into any mischief. \n\nI don\u2019t let my medical condition define me, and I hope you won\u2019t either. I will be your Trusted and True companion if you will give me the care I need. I promise we will be even more Tremendous Together!\n\nIf you would like to learn more about megaesophagus, please visit https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/megaesophagus.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting TT, please DO NOT SEND A MESSAGE TO OUR RESCUE GROUP.  We are too busy placing dogs in great homes to answer messages and inquiries through the listing site.  \n\nPLEASE GO TO THE LINK BELOW TO COMPLETE AN ADOPTION APPLICATION.\n \nwww.chihuahua-rescue.com/adoption-application\n \nCRT requires an approved adoption application and a home visit for all adoption applicants.  CRT transports to OH, KY, IL, MI, MN, WI. \n",

I am about 85lbs, my birthday is February 9th, and I have the most loving personality! I'm so willing to please and know a lot of tricks, from sit, stay, and paw to just walking properly on the leash. I do however have some special requests...\n\nI have severe separation anxiety. Please don't leave me out all alone or I might eat some furniture legs or gnaw on some shoes because I get so upset about you leaving! I am crate trained. My crate is my safe place. I need a home where someone is home all day, or with a couple that works alternate shifts.  I also need to be the only animal in the home because I love to chase cats and don't always pick up on doggy social cues. (Some would call me overly friendly.) I am used to going to doggy daycare and I do play well with other dogs when I'm supervised, but my bigger size and super long tail sometimes cause problems. I love kids and I would love some kids to play with me in a huge backyard (kids have to be over 9 years of age per Animal Alliance policy). It doesn't need to be fenced in, as my recall is very good! I love to go hiking, that's my favorite activity! It's even better if there's water involved because I love swimming and playing fetch!\n\nHere's where my issues lay:\n\nI do have an eating disorder where I don't always like to eat my food. I have been on over 50 kibbles and raw feed, and I stop eating every time. I often go days refusing to eat, so I need a financially stable home that can afford to either put me back on a true and proper raw feed diet or someone that will cook meals for me .(I can not go to a home that will provide me  kibble, I just hate kibble so much!) I can not stress this enough, this is the diet I need to be on! Please do not apply if you can't meet my dietary needs. My mom is willing to give you the feeding guidelines to get us started. The average cost of my raw feed is 90$ a week. The vet has cleared me, this isn't from anything medically wrong with me aside from possible allergies, which is why this diet is so important. I do have to also take a Tums every morning and night as I also suffer from doggy acid reflux. My mom is a groomer and bathes me every 2 weeks with a medicated shampoo to soothe my skin. I am wonderful for baths and nail trims. (My mom will even still offer to groom me for free.) I need a secure home that can help me through my issues. Between my eating problems, fear of loud noises like fireworks, and separation anxiety, I could really used a skilled and patient hand to hold while we figure these things out.  Please don't let these issues scare you off. My mom loves me very much but sadly works long and hard hours Monday- Friday and can not financially afford my special diet. She truly wants what's best for me.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIf you would like to meet, foster or adopt this pet, please fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser. EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

Ha, just kidding,  Anyway, I was dumped on the side of the road with my mom, aunt and 4 siblings by some meanie instead finding if someone else could take us.  Luckily, the great volunteers at Lucies scooped us up and took us in.\n\nI'm learning to trust people and follow their leads.  I really like playing with my siblings.  The Texas heat doesn't bother me.  Well, that is as long as there is water around for me to play in!\n\nSo, it was discovered that I seem to like the taste of chicken.  Honestly, I was just trying to play with them, and lo and behold one or two MAY have found themselves in my mouth magically.  With that being said, I should really not be in a chicken environment since we don't play well together ;)\n\nI'd love it if you would take me home and play me with.  We could have so much fun!!\n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home. Phone interviews are required for all adoptions****",

She enjoys days spent outside in the yard where she can swim in the grass and get some sunshine on her belly. She gives you space while you are cooking and eating. Nala never begs for food!!! She is very playful, she loves chewing on her toys and a good game of tug-o-war. She is a great car companion too! She doesn't really like sharing her toys and can sometimes be possessive when another dog gets close to a toy she wants or is playing with. We have supervised toy time, where they can all be monitored while playing.",

While not all are in the immediate area, once we have processed and approved your application, we will move the dog to our adoptive area for you to meet, greet and hopefully adopt. Sometimes we will have more than one application on a dog. That does not mean it automatically goes to another family but you should be aware of the fact that until you are approved and set up for the meet/greet.. the dog could get adopted by another applicant.\n\nNOTE- FIESTA IS LISTED AS A COURTESY FOR ANOTHER RESCUE ORGANIZATION.

She was found running loose and no one came to claim her. Our guess is that Fiesta was a hunting dog who got away from or was turned out by her owner. Fiesta is very fearful of new situations and it doesn't seem like she has ever lived in a house. Poor girl! She has learned to walk in and out of the house in her foster home and is sleeping in her crate at night. She can walk on a leash now but will jerk and try to run if she gets startled. Fiesta will need an experienced adopter who is patient and will love her for what she can become with training and time to adjust. A securely fenced in yard is a must, as she would be almost impossible to catch if she got loose. She absolutely adores other dogs and lives to run and play and romp around in the back yard! So another dog in the home would be best. Fiesta is charming and engaged once she gets to know you. She would most likely be scared of loud, fast moving children. A quiet home with at least one other playful dog is what will make her happiest! We believe that all dogs deserve a safe loving home who wants them. It's clear that Fiesta wasn't valued or well cared for. She is looking for a new family who knows what great companions hounds can be!

            "description": "Noel was found laying in a field with a prolapsed colon. The poor girl was riddled with worms and had eaten a number of things that weren't actually food. After two major surgeries she's just like any normal dog, even if her colon is a little bit shorter now. She loves to explore and find new things to sniff (and try to eat). She loves other dogs, especially active dogs who like to wrestle. She's short in stature, but can regularly pin my own dog who is nearly twice her size. She's a chewer so it's a good idea to keep plenty of nyla bones, antlers, or other things that are safe to chew around the house. She cannot have rawhide or cloth toys of any kind as they are difficult to digest. She's a sucker for peanut butter and loves her Kong toys when filled with something she likes. Bananas are an acceptable substitute. \nShe's friendly towards cats as all, but may try to play with them when she gets excited and most cats don't like to play the same way dogs too. She also gets overly excited when she sees a cat she hasn't met, particularly any strays or outdoor cats who may live in the area.\nShe's a really sweet and loving girl who needs to find her forever people. She's really shy at first, but warms up once she knows she can trust you.",

Puppies left to wonder alone, no food or water available and no one to care about them except the individuals who stumble upon them and cannot turn their backs. This our rescue story every day in Middle Tennessee. These little babies here in this picture were born under a shed and are not used to humans touching them and loving them until today when the shelter workers were able to crawl under the shed and pull them out. We have them now living in the light of day at the shelter and they are shy, scared and need some human love and touch. Critter Cavalry Rescue wants to help if only we had some foster families. We supply everything and all we need are the foster homes . Can you help!? They weigh less than 5 pounds and we want them to be kept together in groups of two or three puppies so they have the comfort of each other . How rewarding this will be for some family who wants to make a difference. Email us at ccrtennessee@gmail.comADOPTION FEE REQUIRED. Contact ccrtennessee@gmail.com.",

My favorite thing to do is wander outside in my grassy backyard. My foster Mom insists that I really must have my own grassy backyard. All my doctors say I'm at least 12 years or older. I am a very mellow guy, that needs a calm, consistent home. I love long naps and then going out for some fresh air. I came to BROC as a surrender, my past family was unable to take care of me any longer. I have some arthritis in my rear legs, so walks are not my thing. I am vision impaired and I do need eye drops twice a day. I'm a sweet pup just looking for a forever loving home.\n\nI have had a thorough health examination and dental cleaning. I'm microchipped and neutered. If you have room in your heart and home for a \"special needs\" guy like me, please complete an adoption application.\n\nhttps://bichonrescueoc.org/adoption-application\n\nIn the struggle to cope with COVID-19 and its effects on our daily life, it has become necessary to suspend our customary adoption approval process. Scheduling your \"Home Safety Evaluation\" and a \"Meet and Greet\" presents a significant challenge. If you express an interest in adopting this Special Needs pup, we will make every effort to make that possible. You will be contacted to schedule a telephone interview and details of the current approval process will be explained.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Meet Cooper! He is absolutely beautiful and huge! He weighs in at 150 lbs. but with very long legs he carries his weight well. He is not fat at all. He was born around October 2017. He is the biggest lap dog you will ever love!\n\nCoop is sweet, happy, and full of love. He will steal your heart. He is so silly and always has a smile! He is a love bug who loves to give and receive hugs.\n\nHis favorite spot to be is laying at your feet as you enjoy your morning coffee. He loves sleeping on the floor or on his dog bed next to you at night, and lounging on a couch during the day. He has been an excellent co-worker while working at home through Covid, although he does snore a bit!\n\nCooper was born with luxating patellas (knees that sometimes move out of proper position) and weak hocks (ankles that have poor ligament support). SPIN worked with some of the best orthopedic vets in the metroplex and the decision was made that the best course of action for Cooper is to continue strengthening his leg muscles through exercise.\n\nCooper loves to walk, how far and how fast depends on how his legs are feeling. You will need to watch him, and you will be able to tell when he is getting tired.\n\nHe has recovered so thoroughly during his stay with us, you'd never know that he has a bad backend. His legs have gotten stronger from playing with the other dogs in his foster home.\n\nCooper will need to stay on carprofen/Rimadyl, glucosamine/Cosequin to support his continued improvement. He loves his pills when they're wrapped in Velveeta cheese! He loves anything wrapped in Velveeta!\n\nCoopie loves playing with doggy friends. He would do well in a home with other dogs. He would also do well as an only dog with occasional play dates or doggy day care. Having his human at home a lot would be his preference. In fact, Cooper will welcome you home with exuberance any time you leave even if it's just a short trip to the grocery store. You will feel like a celebrity every time you come home!\n\nCooper is very smart and learns quickly. He is wonderful on leash. He is house trained and pet door trained. He is a Pyrfect gentleman while being bathed. If he must be contained for some reason, he will tolerate being in a large exercise pen. But it's really not necessary to contain him.\n\nCooper is not a fan of cats, even when they're only on tv!\n\nHe is a wonderful travel companion. On the way to his adventure, he is smiley and active in the car, watching everything go past. He sleeps quietly the whole way home.\n\nHis new family needs to be diligent about keeping him active and keeping his hind muscles strong so he can continue to adequately support his imperfect legs.\n\nCooper is the absolute most loving dog who will bring so much happiness to his forever family. But this needs to be a family of super heroes ready to care for him, flaws and all! We know how loving Cooper is. Are you ready to step up and be this sweet guy's super hero family?\n\nSPIN Pyrs are all in foster homes in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Potential adopters are asked to make travel arrangements if they live elsewhere. All SPIN dogs are spayed or neutered, current on vaccinations and on heartworm prevention. Please go to our website www.SpinRescue.org and fill out an application for this great Great Pyrenees! 2/2/21 4:51 PM",

I\u2019m a Mama of 11 (maybe more, but this was the last litter of mine), and I want nothing else but to have a family of my own where I can crash forever.  I have a lot of love to give and was a very attentive and patient mom to my pups. I\u2019m still young and playful, though, and can\u2019t wait to live a fun filled life. I like to go on leisurely walks and do well on a leash. No pulling. I have lived with other dogs of various sizes in my foster home and get along well with them. But I would also enjoy being an only dog with my human doting on me.   While I enjoy walks, I also enjoy just to veg out and not doing much of anything. Come meet me! \n\n**We do require you to own your home to adopt this dog due to her size and breed resemblance (this will be checked before application is approved).\n\n**If interested in adopting, please submit the adoption application on our website pp2crescue.com. We will be accepting applications, and will mark as pending adoption when no longer available.  Please do not submit an inquiry unless you have a specific question about the dog. We do not have the time or manpower to answer multiple emails asking if the dog is still available, your best chance at adopting is submitting the application. **\n\n",

He is reactive when someone tries to hold him by the neck, including to put on a collar or leash, but once on, he is fine. He would benefit from positive treatment and training, and someone willing to let him live his life out in a comfortable and happy setting. \n\nThough we know Oso gets along with other dogs, he would really thrive as an only dog. He needs a home with no children. Can you give this senior gentleman the love and patience he deserves? Click here for our adoption application: http://www.chesapeakecatsanddogs.org/",

For fitness he loves walks and tug and rope toys. He has a good grasp of vocabulary to go with that friendly face, he knows basic commands and can be guided into his crate without any protest at all. He'll let you know when it's time for a potty break too. We don't know if Drew has lived with children or pets previously, there are none in his foster home. Drew shows nice neighborly manners in sharing perimeters with the neighbor dogs and he will often hear children playing next door and doesn't bark or react at the fence. Good boy Drew! Drew's wellness care while in foster is being sponsored by Classic Canines. His records come to an adopter at no cost - social media: ClassicCaninesATX Are you ready to meet Drew? Contact his foster mom to arrange a meet up lizellegetsmail@gmail.com",

Her ideal home is one where she can be the 'only child. Haiti was rescued from the euthanize list from Harris county. She was picking up as a stray and was severe neglect. Haiti is a little ball of fire. She love to play but she is dog selective who she like and dislike, so she would benefit from more behavioral training. Haiti is such a sweet, caring girl who wants nothing more than to be close to her person and cuddle. Spending time with her human is her daily goal. She has proved herself to be quite the love bug, and sometime her face expressions would makes you laugh so hard. She has the biggest smile and the most expressive precious face. Haiti needs someone who can love her, and be patient with her. She is such a great girl. She just needs extra care and love. All her vaccinations up to date, she is spayed and microchip.\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN HAITI PLEASE CONTACT CELESTINE 832-659-2576.",

            "description": "Lily's smile is contagious! She approx 4-5 yo and is a big sweetheart and goofball who needs some help building her confidence (and not that false bravado she puts on when she\u2019s scared). Although we only know part of this sweet girl\u2019s story, it\u2019s enough to know she\u2019s been through a lot. Lily was found abandoned after her last family moved away and when she arrived at the shelter, she had patches of missing hair, scrapes, a nail in her paw, sores on her paw, and a fist-sized ulcerated mass. She was put on a shortened rescue timeline for her medical issues. Her euthanasia date came and went as the shelter dragged it out as long as possible to try to get her rescued. South County Tail Waggers generously stepped in to save her, but her journey was only starting.\n\nLily is a lazy, sweet girl who loves to give kisses, loves belly rubs, and is perfectly happy to just sleep all day. She also LOVES her daily walks and looks forward to them. She is a smart girl who catches on to routines and expectations quickly. She is very responsive to verbal correction and does a good job of respecting boundaries once they're established. She needs a home with someone who can see through her bluffs, but who will also not let her run the household (because she will, if you let her haha). She is working on her socialization and it takes a while for her to warm up to men in particular (though it took a few days, she adores her foster dad!). \n\nShe is interested in other dogs and even play bows and cries if she sees them playing, but is shy once they approach and will let it be known if she's not comfortable. While she can be a couch potato, she also loves going on long walks and hikes, etc.\n\nLily believes the best defense is a good offense and can act out aggressively when afraid (though she prefers to just avoid the scary thing). She is learning how to relax and not be so guarded. When we come home, she will smile as she excitedly brings you whatever is nearby as a present to let you know how much she missed you (sometimes that's her favorite toy...sometimes it's your favorite shoe, but she is very gentle with both).\n\nShe is a silly, goofy girl who will steal your heart. We love her and think you will too!\n\n*** Since this bio has been written, Lily has gone through an intensive 4 week board and train program (worth over $2K) and she did an AMAZING job while she was there! Once she graduated she came out almost like a different dog. She is an absolute love, and we honestly have zero idea on why she hasn't been adopted yet!!?? Her adoption will also come with 5 in-home private training lessons with her trainer Franck. Whomever is lucky enough to get to adopt Lily will be the better ones for it for SURE.\n\nWe think Lily will be able to be around children that are older and more dog savvy. She would not be OK with a young child poking or prodding her, etc. \n\n*** Lily has had several meet and greets and everyone has passed on her thus far because she wasn't immediately and overly affectionate, however she has done her absolute best and has even rolled on her back to allow some belly rubs. After each time someone passes on her we just shake our heads in disappointment because these people have no idea the gem they are passing on! She just needs a little time, and we clearly haven't found the person/family worthy of her yet. But we know there are out there!!! \n\nCould it be you??\n\nThe latest video we posted of Lily is her TRUE self -- this is how she acts when she trusts the humans around her. Here she is being picked up by her foster Dad after being at daycare . . . \n\n\nPlease complete an adoption application on our website at www.sctailwaggers.org/adopt. Please also take this opportunity to read more about SCTW and about our adoption process, etc.",

This young hearted boy is ready for his furever home! Could that be YOU? Some of Spike's favorite things include; trail walks, trips to Home Depot, car rides, laying on top of laundry piles (especially when they\u2019re clean and warm), and cuddles with his humans. He is a puppy at heart and loves his toys, the squeakier the better! He is quite the runway model, who entertains his human-foster siblings playing dress up with him. Spike is UTD on vaccinations, microchipped housebroken, crate trained, good with dogs (big and little) and children (unsure about cats, but this sweet love has no prey drive). Spike is ready and waiting for that special family to spend his golden years with. To fill out an application for Spike, please head over to www.onedaneatatime.org If you have never opened your heart and home to a senior, boy, are you missing out! They are the BEST! \n\nSpike is located in SAN DIEGO, CA\nHe is available for adoption through the nonprofit rescue organization One Dane At A Time, Inc. For more information or to be considered for adoption you MUST FILL OUT AN ADOPTION APPLICATION. INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION WILL GO UNANSWERED.

Charlie is a gorgeous boy who is looking for his forever family.\n\nCharlie is adorable and affectionate, is crate trained and obedient, and walks beautifully on leash. However, he does have special behavioral needs and needs an experienced dog parent!\n\nCharlie has triggers that will lead him to snap or bite; his foster mom is still working with him to discover these triggers, but so far, leaning over him or getting too close into his space can trigger him.\n\nFor these reasons, only homes with the following will be considered for Charlie:\n\n-No small children (living permanently or who visit regularly);\n\n-No small pets (dogs or cats)\n\n-Must have a fenced yard for safe play and training\n\nDue to his triggers, Charlie should not be taken to dog parks.\n\nTo find his ideal home, multiple meet and greets will be held to ensure a great match for all involved; therefore, no out of state applications can be considered.\n\nSomewhere in his past life, people failed this precious boy. He's just waiting for the right people to find him who can work with him and show him how good people can be!\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal.

She is still shy, and a bit anxious, and takes time to warm up to new people, so she needs a home willing to work with her quirks. We know there is a perfect home for this sensitive (and smart!)  girl. \n\nIf you are looking for a sweet and sensitive adult dog ready to move right in, then our sweet Stella may be the dog for you.\n\nAll of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heartworm tested, and treated if necessary. Vet references are required and prior to adoption, a home inspection will be conducted.   \n\nTransport options available. An adoption fee applies. \nIf interested go to www.pmarinc.org for an application.",

            "description": "Shep arrived at Horse Creek Wildlife Sanctuary on March 19, 2020.  \n\nHe is extremely friendly and acts just like a puppy!  He prefers human companionship and tries desperately to please.  Shep plays well with other dogs and enjoys spending time running and romping in our exercise areas.\n\nHe is still growing, and we believe he could be a Lab mix. \n\nShep will make a great addition to a loving and caring family. Are you that special someone who can give him the home he dreams of?\n\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered and are current on all vaccinations. They are on monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention. All of their medical needs are taken care of before they are available for adoption. Our adoption fee is only $100.00. Please complete an application, if you have found a dog you are interested in adopting. You can find our application at www.horsecreekwildlife.org/applic.html. Once completed, you can forward it to adoptions@horsecreekwildlife.org or fax it to 731-926-3000. Kim Austin, our adoption facilitator, will be in contact with you as soon as she has an opportunity to review your application. Understand that she has other duties and she will not ignore any interest shown in adopting one of our dogs. An application will need to be approved before a scheduled time to visit our dogs will be set up.  It may take up to 48 hours before she returns your call or responds to your email, due to work schedules, holidays and adoption events. We do the very best we can for the dogs we have rescued and do not take the adoption process lightly. Please be patient and understand that we will place our rescued dogs in the very best homes possible and reserve the right to refuse applications.",

            "description": "Orella arrived at Horse Creek Wildlife Sanctuary on March 19, 2020.  \n\nShe is a very friendly girl!  She enjoys playing with her toys and spending time with other dogs in our fenced exercise areas.  She loves going for long leash walks with our volunteers along our walking trails.\n\nOrella is a full-grown Labrador Retriever/Bassett mix and she weighs 36 pounds. \n\nShe is patiently waiting for her forever family to come adopt her!  You will not be disappointed, if you give sweet Orella a chance to show you all the love she has to offer.  \n\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered and are current on all vaccinations. They are on monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention. All of their medical needs are taken care of before they are available for adoption. Our adoption fee is only $100.00. Please complete an application, if you have found a dog you are interested in adopting. You can find our application at www.horsecreekwildlife.org/applic.html. Once completed, you can forward it to adoptions@horsecreekwildlife.org or fax it to 731-926-3000. Kim Austin, our adoption facilitator, will be in contact with you as soon as she has an opportunity to review your application. Understand that she has other duties and she will not ignore any interest shown in adopting one of our dogs. An application will need to be approved before a scheduled time to visit our dogs will be set up.  It may take up to 48 hours before she returns your call or responds to your email, due to work schedules, holidays and adoption events. We do the very best we can for the dogs we have rescued and do not take the adoption process lightly. Please be patient and understand that we will place our rescued dogs in the very best homes possible and reserve the right to refuse applications.",

I enjoy walks, runs, playing fetch but then i also love my cuddling, chillin, and long naps time. Once you feed me, ill need a belly rub and ill go roll around in the green lawn. I love my humans. All I want is a home and a family to keep me safe. Young children are not my favorite because they make sudden screams and movements. I prefer a home with kids that have at least 13 years of life experience. Im incredibly sweet and loyal and love an active well-balanced-with-snuggles lifestyle. I am told i have the the best smile ever - seems to get me lots of hugs and treats. I know to go potty outside, i walk nicely on a leash, and now sit, shake, and high five on command. My dog trainer said wow, she is very trainable so i cant wait to keep learning what i need to do. My foster family has 2 small dogs - ive decided they are fine now, but in the beginning i was like who are these dudes? With a slow intro, now we all hang out and we play fetch, chase, and take walks and naps together.\n\nNow heres a word from my fosters 13 year old daughter that i follow around obsessively and love with all my heart, Quinta is really sweet and all cuddles and just hangs out with me. She sleeps on my bed at nights, but she is fine sleeping in a crate too but i like her cuddles. She just wants to be with me wherever i go. She relaxes on the couch with me to watch a movie, on the bed, next to my desk, takes naps with me and if i go on a walk, she is the happiest. We even go on runs together. Her smiles makes my worries melt away and she will fill the hearts of her new furrever home family.\n\n*Homeownership required!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration",

They are Shepherd mixes.   \nThey were rescued last minute by LBWF before Apple Valley shelter closed.\nThey are so sweet and great in the house. We have taught them to walk in tandem and they are perfect. \n We know they were originally adopted from the Hesperia shelter, but ended up at the Apple Valley shelter, right before they shut down as Covid closure came down. We agreed to take them so they wouldn't be euthanized since the owners never showed up.\nThey are a very bonded pair and have come along very nicely at LBWF.\nThey are loving and playful.\nWalking tandem great on leash, great in foster home that had them for about 2 weeks.\nThey are very playful, happy and loving and funny. They are really enjoying life at LBWF  \n They are both up-to-date on shots, spayed and neutered and microchipped. If you are interested in meeting or adopting them, please fill out an application today at www.LindaBlairWorldheart.org & you can also view all of our dogs available for adoption.\nFollow us on social media!\nFacebook/LindaBlairWorldheartFoundaton\nInstagram & Twitter @LindaBlairWF\n\n",

            "description": "Do you like smart dogs who love to play games with their brains in the house? Vin Diesel is a super smart boy who needs to exercise his brain just as much if not more than his body. He loves to do scent work, practice his commands, and play tug-o-war. All these get his brain working! Vin D. will happily settle near your feet after some much-deserved playtime. Due to tendon issues with his front feet, Vin Diesel has an unusual strut and prefers short walks with a muzzle that keeps him from reacting to other dogs. Then he gets to spend more time cuddling with his people. Do you like to sleep? So does Vin! The boy loves to sleep with his belly up right next to his human. When it's time to rise and shine, he is happy to have you wake him with sweet whispers. He is house-trained, and when you're not home, he happily goes in his crate and sleeps like a baby with blankets and a soft bed, waiting patiently for his people to come back home. This handsome boy is looking for a patient, adult-only family that will play with him in a yard, take him on short walks, and let him snooze on his doggie bed. He can get overly excited about new human friends and dog friends and is on medication to help calm him. So, a low-traffic neighborhood and home with a quiet yard and where he's the only fur kid is ideal. He could go home with a well-matched dog companion after slow introductions. In return, Diesel will be the best little boy he can be and repay you in endless kisses! Vin Diesel is upping his skills game to impress his new parents. He is perfecting his 'sit,' 'down,' and 'place' through APA!'s Total Obedience Program (TOP). To learn more about his training, check out a video on APA's CGC program, on which the TOP is based: https://vimeo.com/89434193. Come meet Vin Diesel, he'd love to show you his belly!",

She will require quite a bit of supervision, so it may be best for her to be the only dog in any event. Mandy appears to be a combination of Doberman, black Lab, and Greyhound, as she's built like a Greyhound but with the coloring of a Lab, and she had a sibling that looked mostly Dobie. She's about 3 years old and is housebroken, is affectionate and loves to play. She can be stubborn about following commands, and she was destructive when she was younger, needing a lot of stimulation and entertainment. Unfortunately, Mandy can also jump an 8-foot fence, so she would need to be kenneled in a very secure kennel when it is necessary to leave her home alone. A person or couple who work from home would probably be the most ideal home for Mandy, but again, with close supervision; she has been known to \"counter surf\" and could potentially even decide to depart over a fence even with people present at home.  Her ex-owner said she requires EVERY family member to be home.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Sawyer Brown was wandering the streets in a small town in South Texas. Some folks tossed their leftovers out to feed him, and others mostly ignored him. Then one day, one person threatened to shoot him, so a local rescuer was called to save the day. She picked him up and took him to the vet to be scanned for a microchip. He didn't have one/ During his stray hold, she posted photos, and a variety of people said they remembered seeing him hang around town, but no one claimed him. So once his stray hold was up, Sawyer Brown headed north to Windsong Ranch.\n\nSawyer shows great guardian instincts, so we have been testing him with our livestock. He hasn't been consistently reliable with our goats, so we think he should go to a home where the only thing he is asked to guard is his home and human family. We also think he would do best in a home where he is the only dog, as he can be very picky about which dogs he gets along with. He hasn't gotten along with any of the male dogs we have introduced him to, and he seems to just tolerate female dogs. If you have a female dog whose personality is not alpha, we would be glad to do a meet & greet to see whether she and Sawyer might be friends.\n\nIf Sawyer sounds like exactly the right guardian for you and your home, please complete the application on our website.",

            "description": "Sweet, Empathetic Brody Needs a Home to Call His Own!\n\nBesides being super adorable and cuddly (and having the softest and warmest floppy ears), Brody is also uber sweet and sensitive.\n\nThis young boy's story has not always been happy. He was found as a stray, abandoned by his adoptive family 90 miles from home. Thankfully he has retained his optimism, and continues to hope and trust that one day he will find his very own humans again to love him, be kind to him and make him the center of their world.\n\nBrody - or Bro Bro as he prefers to be endearingly addressed - is THE best hiking companion. He is energetic and thoroughly enjoys daily walks around the neighborhood. But he especially LOVES hiking adventures in the woods. Nothing makes him happier than car rides.\n\nBro Bro is also a big homebody and enjoys chillin' in front of a good Netflix too. He loves piano music - his favorite spots in his foster family's home are under the baby grand when it's being played and on the couch snuggling on a quiet rainy day.\n\nWe believe that Bro Bro's not-so-happy first part of his life has given him the special gift of empathy. He is ultra sensitive and attuned to the emotions of his humans.\n\nWhen he senses that people are sad, he has been known to promptly walk over and place his warm comforting head firmly on their lap as his way of saying, \"Please feel better. Bro Bro is here for you forever and is your friend. I will snuggle with you now if you like.\"\n\nHe has a ridiculously adorable spazzy side too. And he most often exhibits that when his humans come home. That's when he does The Dance - a combination of extreme butt wiggles and whirling dervish spinning while holding his favorite toy in his mouth.\n\nBro Bro will thrive in a home where he can shine as the only pet, and will be happiest with calm, kind and gentle adults who are experienced adopters and can continue to train him using the gentlest ways - we strongly recommend Jan Fennell's Amichien Bonding method, rather than Cesar Milan's physical domination approach.\n\nWhen Bro Bro knows in his heart that he is forever loved and is safe and will never be scolded, he will blossom and make you so proud by being your best and most loyal furry forever friend! \n\n...If you live with an hour of Washington, D.C. and have a fenced yard, please apply to adopt this sweet soul! His adoption fee is $125, he is neutered, is current on rabies, dhpp, bordatella and has been on monthly preventatives for fleas/ticks and heartworms. He's been getting the best nutrition possible too I might add. Best with no children in the home, adults ideal. This 7 year old boy needs you and you will be rewarded with his love in return! Please share this post also if you would!\n\nCan you be his family?! Committed fosters or foster to adopt, please contact us also! Transport is available in VA or D.C area to an approved home.",

You won't need to file her teeth and good-mannered Luna is much less likely to chew your electrical cords (tho she can hop a fence).  She is much easier to take on walks, tho she thinks cardio is over-rated. This low-key girl much prefers your lap. Thoughtful to a fault, she knows there is no room in that lap for other critters, so asks to be your only snuggle bunny.\n\n~  Est DOB: Mar 2018\n~  Intake weight:  49#  \n~  Luna comes with free training.

Raven, a 9 month old Dane, was found along the interstate and taken to a local shelter where she served her stray time. It was clear to the shelter workers that Raven has never spent any time indoors nor had she been socialized with much of anything to include humans. She was just trembling and would cower in her kennel, couldn't walk with a leash on and would just pancake on the floor and not move. They knew that this sweet girl needed one on one time with a foster to help her learn about the world around her. She needed to learn to trust humans, to learn about other dogs and animals and how to live inside a home so they reached out to BDHP to help her and we are honored to be able to give Raven all that she needs to include a wonderful forever home that will love and care for her always. She may take a little time to blossom but we know that her foster family will give her all the tools to help her grow and learn and we cannot wait to see the beautiful butterfly she will turn into; welcome to the family Raven.\n\nGiant Breed Experienced Homes Only.\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

Cersei is approximately 2 years old, up to date on vaccinations, spayed & microchipped. \n\nShe would do best in a home where she can play, run and also snuggle. Cersei is the total package. She loves other pets, loves people & loves entertaining. \n\nCersei is house trained, kennel trained & knows her basic commands/manners. \n\nInterested adopters can fill out an application at canehavenrescue.com. \nAny possible questions about Cersei, please email canehavenrescue@gmail.com \n\nCane Haven Rescue will transport any of their adoptable dogs to the right home. We do require adoption fees that are based on the age & health status of the adoptable dog. The adoption fee covers every single dog in CHR with vaccinations, heartworm test, deworming, microchip, spay/neuter & medications. All CHR adoptable dogs are current on their monthly  heartworm and flea medication. A CHR representative will do a home check to ensure the pets are placed in a secure and loving home. \n\nwww.canehavenrescue.com",

I weigh less than six pounds. But my big personality more than makes up for my small size. I've been living with my foster family for more than two years. They really love me and I love them back. My mom says I'm like a little wind-up toy because I run in little circles right after my walks and then hop into my bed for a nice long nap. I love to follow my family around, but I cuddle with them only when I want to. I'm independent that way. I sleep soundly in my crate all night long. My mom says it's safer for a little girl like me to be in a crate at night, and that's fine by me. I love my crate. My family cares about me so much that they're spending lots of time treating all my medical conditions. They put medicine in my eyes twice a day and they feed me the right foods so I don't get an allergic reaction, I have a tendency to get yeast infections. To avoid that, my mom gives me a bath with antiseptic shampoo twice a week. She uses Q-tips with Witch Hazel to clean my ears and the spaces between my toes. It's uncomfortable but I let her do it. I know it's for my own good. My family works so hard to make sure I'm as healthy and comfortable as I can possibly be. My eyesight is limited, but I still look up at my family and wag my tail happily when they're around. It makes me so happy to be near them. Because I can't hear anything anymore, my mom wakes me up by gently shaking my crate so she doesn't scare me. My mom is very considerate of my special needs.\n\nAs you can imagine, my medical care costs a lot of money. Would you consider sponsoring me so my foster family can keep taking care of me? Anything you can afford would be so appreciated. If you want, my mom can send you pictures of me so you see how I'm doing and how your donations are helping me.\n\nIf you would like to sponsor me, please copy and paste this link: https://bichonrescueoc.org/sponsorship",

She has been in foster care a long time, healing physically and emotionally from a troubled past. When she first came to TDR, she was so skittish she didn't want to be touched by humans, but she has warmed up considerably. Tia is about five years old, house trained and gets along well with other dogs. Tia would be an excellent companion for an individual, a pair of empty nesters or retirees.\nA quiet home with a fenced-in yard to help Tia feel secure is ideal. She has allergies and needs to have shots a few times each year to prevent her skin from breaking out. She's also on a special diet. She is spayed, up to date on all of her vaccinations, microchipped and heart worm negative. More than anything, Tia needs patient and loving people who will gently help her come out of her shell and continue healing. She is sponsored by a TDR Angel, so her new owners don't have to pay an adoption fee. Available at Tired Dog Rescue in Gulfport, MS.

He was adopted and surrendered by someone who stated their \"living situation had changed\" so he was given up along with a cat. We have not exposed him to cats and we don't know how much integration they had in their home. Jetpack was distrusting of strangers and bouncing off the walls in the shelter kennels so they requested a rescue get involved. He has been good with people during his stay with us and he has shared a kennel with a large female. We suspect he will bond tightly with his people but may not be the biggest fan of lots of visitors so a quiet home where he can have a safe place to retreat when needed would be ideal. Jetpack was adopted briefly and loved by his adult owners but he was not good with kids. He will need an adult home and definitely one where he can get enough exercise.",

As rescuers we know it is very rare that a dog is really aggressive so I took my chance and took him out of there ... and I\u2019m very happy I did .\n\nYes and our vet he was not a happy trooper either but the poor thing had a horrible ear infection. Yes, you read that right . He would have been killed over an ear infection that the owner did not want to treat . Don\u2019t you love people ?\n\nArmando arrived after being fully medical treated but I thought he was still too skinny so he stayed a while at our vet in Huntington . He looks good now. A few pounds extra I would not mind but we are always careful with German Shepherds and weight on their hips .\n\nA wagging tail , big eyes and happy smile when I opened his kennel for the first time to walk him in the woods . This Godzilla of a dog is nothing more then a sweet shepherd who loves to hike . There was totally not an issue with him . Still he is a German shepherd and we only adopt him out to shepherd experienced owners .\n\nHis previous owner clearly did not care about him so he receives all the love he can get from us .\n\nArmando is 5 years old . Does not like cats or dogs and has to be pet only .\n\nWe would love to see him with a wonderful person who sees the same great boy in him as I see .\n\nSomebody who will love him forever and gives him everything he needs .\n\nArmando is located in Middle Island .\n\nTo become an approved adopter you have to fill in the adoption application to find on our website www.a-teameliterescuedogs.com or email us and we send you one",

            "description": "* SPECIAL NEEDS - PROTECTIVE, STRANGER DANGER *\nHey there I'm Mickey! I'm an 8 year old boy. Some of my best friends could tell you just how loyal and loveable I truly am. I'm so loyal that when around my favorite people, I want to protect them. I would love someone who will keep me as active as my age would allow, as I do love to go for walks and even love to swim! Stranger danger is a term that my friends might use to describe me but it's really because when I love you, I want to protect you and my space from other people! I would want to protect you even from your friends, so keep in mind I would likely need my own room of a big comfy crate to hang out in if you have company over. I could potentially live with another submissive dog, but we would have to meet and form a friendship first. I would be best in a home with no kids. My favorite activities include exploring new places (where they're aren't many people), swimming in safe places (even a kiddie pool) and going on car rides! I also love to get pet and receive love from my best friends. I would want to meet you a few times before I would be comfortable with you, but if you give me treats, throw my toys for me, and come on a few walks, I'm sure we would become great friends. I really hope you'll come meet me, and don't mind that I require a little patience. Hope to meet you soon! Love, Mickey\n*Mickey has extreme protective tendencies and would need to be in a home where no one comes in and out of the home without a careful introduction. It will take several visits to the shelter for Mickey to feel comfortable with you.",

Consider one of our Well Seasoned Seniors who are truly wonderful and have so much to offer. Need help finding the best fit? We'll help with that too. Please fill out an application and let's get you all matched up with a loving new \"furever' companion and friend. You'll find the application on the \"Available Dogs\" page.\n\nNOTE:\n\nAdoptions to Central/South Texas residents only\n\nStandard Adoption Fee Adult Dog: $250 ea. Puppy Adoption Fee: $300 ea. Reduced rates for Seniors dogs (10 and up). Reduced rates for pairs (when adopted together). All adoption fees are subject to sales tax per the State of Texas. DDRTX only adopts in Central/South Texas.\n\nEmail: ddrtxinfo@gmail.com Primary Website: www.DDRTX.org\n\nHi! I am Dexter! Sometimes I am called Dex, sometimes I only answer to Mr. Handsome. I am a cuddly, fun guy who has recovered from paralysis. I had a back injury, likely due to genetics, and I had the surgery to fix it. Due to my back, I should not do stairs. After I rehabbed, I can walk again although I am wobbly and have some bathroom accidents when I don't make it to the doggie door in time. I love to rip apart my stuffed toys and hang with the other foster dogs. I am quiet and easy going. My favorite place to hang out is in the kitchen because that is where the snacks live. Meeting new people is no problem for me because I am friendly and charming. Having someone home with me all the time would be a dream come true, but I can certainly nap while you go to work if that means more snacks and toys, but I will need attention and love when you come home. I enjoy the company of other dogs and pretty much ignore the cat.\n\nI have a secret superpower! Go look at my video and you can see that I know how to arrange my own covers and tuck myself in to bed. It took my foster mom a while but she finally got it on video. I know, pretty cool if I say so myself.\n\nLove dachshunds and not ready to adopt or circumstances won't permit having a dog? How about being a sponsor or making a donation. Every one of our dachshunds receives excellent medical care along with day to day food, love and housing. Being non-profit, we rely on generous individuals like yourselves to help save these fur babies. You can do this specifically for one dog with the sponsor button on their webpage or a general donation on our \"How To Help\" page. Easy and quick through Pay Pal or your debit/credit card. You generosity is sincerely appreciated by all and is tax deductable. Need other ideas? You'll find tons of them on the How to Help tab. All contributions are tax deductable.\n\nDiamond Dachshund Rescue of Texas is a non-profit 501(c)(3) volunteer organization with focus on rescue and adoption of pure breed Dachshunds. All dogs are fully vetted and housed on private property. Meetings are scheduled upon adoption approval. Thank you for your continued support to the rescue and shelter communities!\nOpt to Adopt!\n\n2/2/21 5:51 PM",

            "description": "Bentley is a friendly Pit Bull Terrier mix, born May, 2017. He is so social! Loves to be around people. Loves to play with toys with people.He is potty trained- never had an accident coming to his new foster home. He loves walks but needs to be on a leash. He is a little rambunctious because he likes to chase birds, rabbits,etc. but is already learning new commands like leave it. He learns quickly and never wants to disappoint his family. Bentley is not a fan of being alone and after being kenneled( he does well) he will stay by your side for awhile.Bentley is good around all people but needs to be in a one dog family, a fenced yard and a house full of tough toys.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Bentley is $300. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

STRAY in fat letters and the clock started to tick for him\n\nIn a high kill shelter with a daily intake of more then hundred dogs there was no chance to stay alive . One dead body after the other is what the reality is .\n\nOnly rescue was his only chance so we took him safe under our wings . Skin in over bones, ready eyes . He was a mess so we rushed him to our vet and today ... well today he s a very handsome fellow .\n\nHe has that special tip on his ear and when he is making a head tilt with it he is just plain adorable .\n\nHe loved walking in the woods and his tail was going up and down .\n\nALEKI is around 3 years old . He is good with other dogs but not with cats \n\nHe is a very good boy and a happy fellow . Not to difficult on the leash but likes to smell everything.\n\nALEKI is located in Middle island.\n\nWe would love to see him coming him to a great family who will just love him and gives him the quality time he needs .\n\nIf you would like to give him his forever home then please apply today by filling in the  adoption  link to find on our website or email us and we send you one .",

He is sweet but had a rough beginning so will need a rescue experienced home that will help him build trust, learn basic obedience and gain confidence. \n\nHe will bond to his people and loves attention and affection. He loves treats and is glad to work for them! He has not had a lot of training so will need support with continued basic obedience. \n\nHe is looking for a home that is adult only or with kids over the age of 16. He will thrive in a home where he can be active, he loves to run around, go for walks, and would make an excellent outdoor activity partner.\n\nCody can do well with other dogs but it is always best to do proper introductions to make sure it is a good match and that all parties 'mesh'. Cody would do best in a home with a large fenced yard where he can run, roam and play. \n\nCody is UTD on shots, has had a dental, is microchipped and neutered. His adoption fee is $400.",

At just 3 years of age, he lost his home due to the pandemic and to top that off, he has severe skin issues that are needing to be evaluated at our vet.\n\n9-2-20: While we have been aggressively treating Mac's skin allergies, it is apparent that he will need ongoing care, such as monthly Cytopoint injections and weekly medicated baths. We hope to find Mac a Scottie experienced home in the DFW area.\n\n5-29-20 Mac was taken back to the vet today for an infections in both ears. After testing and cleaning, treatment was begun with a long-term (30-day) medication.\n\n5-20-20 Mac has received all of his vaccinations, blood tests and an injection to help calm his irritated skin. He will be on oral medications for 2-3 weeks, then re-evaluated to determine when he will be available for adoption.\n\n5-18-20 Mac will be seen by our vet today, to evaluate his skin problems, as well as a full physical exam, blood tests and vaccinations that are overdue.\n\nPlease help Mac by donating to his care. We have taken in several Scotties in need over the past few months, all of which needed extensive medical care. PayPal to Donate@scottiekingdom.com or you may send a check to Scottie Kingdom Rescue, Inc - PO Box 551265 - Dallas, TX 75355. All donations are acknowledged.\n\nAll dogs adopted by Scottie Kingdom Rescue, Inc. have had a full medical exam by one of our licensed Veterinarians, which includes testing (and treatment, if necessary) for Heartworm disease, Lyme disease, Ehrlichia and Anaplasmosis, all necessary vaccinations, spay/neuter surgery, dental cleaning as necessary, microchipping, registration of the microchip, and any other medical needs each particular dog may need. Copies of all available medical records are transferred to you when the adoption is finalized.\n\nWe prefer to adopt to families with past Scottie, Westie, Terrier experience, but realize this isn't always possible. We do NOT ship our pets. If you have that special place in your heart, and in your home, for a Scottie (or any of our other available rescue dogs), please visit us in Dallas for an in person meet & greet session with our available dogs. If you have existing dogs, they should travel to Dallas with you, so we can be assured that they will be compatible with the new addition to your family.\n\nPlease contact us at\nRescue@scottiekingdom.com\nto receive an Adoption Application or for more information on our Adoption process. Also, please take the time to visit our website\nwww.scottiekingdom.com\nfor additional information.\n\nWe sometimes receive several applications on the same dog. Our goal is to place the dog in the best home possible, based on his/her needs, personality and past history. Please note: Adoptions are not done on a first come, first served basis. Submitting an application does not guarantee the adoption of any dog. We are looking for the best available home for each of our rescue dogs.\n\nThank you for your understanding, and for considering adoption!\n\nWe are\nnot\nsupported by your tax dollars or public grants, rather, we rely on donations to help us continue our rescue work for animals that are in need.\n\nDonations may be made via PayPal to email address:\n\nDonate@scottiekingdom.com\n\nor via USPS, to PO Box 551265 ~ Dallas, TX\n\n75355",

            "description": "Meg came into rescue with her littermate Amy. These two cuties are very sweet and love attention.  They were found as strays and not reclaimed by the owner.  We estimate they were born in July of 2018.    They both enjoy belly rubs and Meg likes to squint her eyes up at you when she's happy. The girls are very bonded and a home together would be \"pyrfect\" for them.  We hate to split up families. They are smaller pyrs, about 60 lbs. and are very gentle and friendly. \n They are fine with male dogs,selective with other female dogs, and are unproven with cats.  We recommend obedience training for all newly adopted pyrs, to help you create a special bond with you and your new friend, and so you have a well behaved canine. Great Pyrenees are willing to learn, but are not as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds. They are bred to be independent thinkers. Applicants must be over 25, own their own home and all children in household must be over 6 years old. Your resident pets must be up to date on vaccines, sterilized, you must have a good history of vet care for them, and you must have used heart worm preventative year round for your dogs.

Great Pyrenees are willing to learn, but are not as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds. They are bred to be independent thinkers. Applicants must be over 25, own their own home and all children in household must be over 5 years old. Your resident pets must be up to date on vaccines, sterilized, you must have a good history of vet care for them, and you must have used heartworm preventative year round for your dogs. \n\n\nwill be placed as an inside pet with outside privileges. You MUST have a securely fenced yard accessible from your home. Invisible fencing does not work with this breed and they will take the shock for the freedom.  Great Pyrenees are bred to roam and will create their own territory if not secured, which can led to them being lost, hit by vehicles or shot by people who see them as a threat. The breed is not a good off leash dog, and cannot be trusted to not run away.  A Great Pyrenees off leash is a \" DisAPyr.\" \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please complete the appropriate application on our website, www.igpr.org under the Adopt tab. \n\nAll of our dogs marked as needing foster homes are also available for adoption.  If a dog is listed on this site, it is available.  No need to contact us to see if it is,  We do require you  complete the adoption application prior to meeting a dog.\n\nWe also offer a foster to adopt program. You foster the dog, and have first right of refusal on them if an approved application is submitted for them. \n\nIn fostering a dog, the dog comes to you fully vetted. and groomed. You provide good quality food, grooming, and we provide the heartworm preventative and medical care, if needed* .(*Based on approval from IGPR.)\n\nAdoption fee is $300",

MANY OF OUR DOGS HAVE STRICT REQUIREMENTS FOR THEIR ADOPTION.\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS FOR NEWT:\n\nKIDS 12 AND OVER ONLY.\nFULLY FENCED YARD.\nDAILY MEDS FOR ALLERGIES.\nPATIENCE SINCE HE IS SHY WITH STRANGERS.\n\n\nNewt is formally Skye, a chihuahua/terrier mix, about 12 pounds. He was born to Smidget Sonya at the rescue in 2017 and adopted out as a 4 month old puppy. Now three years old, he was surrendered after becoming too protective of their newborn. He is SMART and food motivated, which means he will be easy to train and would probably love some type of agility work or activity that gets him busy. He is definitely out of sorts and nervous, wondering when they are going to come back and pick him up. We are learning more about him each day. Right now, we know that he LOVES to play with other dogs and also loves his chin rubbed. He appears devoted to his humans and wants to be near you when he's comfortable. He will need someone who is willing to work with him, as he appears to be under-socialized with strangers. He wants to protect you and his turf and will demonstrate reactivity on leash and in the yard to those not in his family. We recommend no kids under 10. He has some allergies that are currently being treated with Apoquel. We were told he is afraid of thunderstorms. Overall he is a fun, energetic and loyal fellow! \n\nAdoption contract and fee applies.  All adoptable dogs can be met at adoption events hosted every weekend. For a list of scheduled events go to: https://www.facebook.com/SmidgetRescue/events .  Smidget Rescue is not a shelter, and dogs cannot be seen at the Rescue location. All dogs are fostered throughout the Puget Sound area and are brought to the events where they can be met by prospective adopters. Additional pictures of adoptable dogs can be seen at: https://www.facebook.com/SmidgetRescue/photos_stream?tab=photos_albums.   All adoptable dogs are spayed or neutered at 6 months of age or older, and always before being placed in their new homes.  APPLICATIONS CAN BE OBTAINED BY EMAIL ONLY. Adoption process includes application, meet & greet, home visit and reference check. Email Jamie at smidgetrescue@hotmail.com or click on the CONTACT link on this page.   Notice:  We do not ship dogs out of state.  If you live within a five-hour radius of Seattle, WA, (such as Portland, Vancouver B.C., etc.), we can arrange for a home visit.  If your home seems like a great fit for the dog you would like to adopt, you must then drive to meet the dog at one of our weekend events or at the fosters home.\n\n",

Thankfully we had a potential adopter waiting close to Jake's previous home.  Fostering him for us he was a handful in apartment living and returned to us here at Daphneyland.  This beautiful 4 yr old boy is looking for a female only home (Jake is fearful and reactive to men) as an only dog.  Yard a MUST!  If you think Jake or any of the 50+ hounds here at Daphneyland might be a good fit for you submit an adoption application at www.daphneyland.com",

He is friendly with people, but unfortunately, he is reactive to a leash or collar, which makes it a real challenge to take him to the vet. Nip's original owner bought him as a puppy, brought him home, and put him with goats. He loved his dog, but apparently never saw the need to put a collar or leash on him, and never took him to the vet. We are working to de-sensitize Nip, to show him that we can put a light slip lead around his neck and it won't harm him. We are currently using a lightweight plastic goat chain, which you can see in some of his photos. It breaks easily, so we replace it regularly, but he still gets nervous when we slip it over his head. For this reason, we think it would be best if Nip could be adopted by someone who has a vet who makes farm/ranch calls, to minimize the stress of trying to get him the care he needs.",

Only 3 of her pups survived and you could see the sadness within her. \n\nThis beautiful red head has learned what true love is and how great life can be when she let's people love her. I will warn you though, she is about 50lbs and definately thinks she is a lap dog. :)\nSkylar is good on leash and enjoys walking, sniffing and being by your side. \n\nSkylar had a very ruff start in life. In her previous life, she was shown early on to keep mom safe, which to this day makes her uneasy with men. She came from a life of yelling and fighting.\n\nSky would excel in a quiet home, sharing her life with a mom. She loves to hike, go for rides and she loves to make ya laugh! \n\nStop by, meet Sky! Spend some quality time with her over a period of time. The slow pace approach is what will win her over!\n\n\nPlease visit Friends of the Attleboro Animal Shelters website www.FAASpets.org and fill out an adoption application.  We are open on Wednesdays 6pm - 8pm as well as Saturdays and Sundays 11a - 3p, so stop by and fall in love!\n\nGive us a \"Like\" on Facebook and stay in touch with all that's happening! www.facebook.com/FAASAttleboroPets/",

He is one of our Lyme Positive pups. He\u2019s a Coonhound mix with a ton of exuberance. Clyde has good energy to share and can use a human friend that will match it. He also can carry a tune and howls the blues for us sometimes. Clyde can be a bit selective when it comes to dog friends so it\u2019s possible he can live with one, but only if he chooses too. He\u2019s a handsome boy and has been working on his doggie manners to become the perfect charmer but would do better in a home with older children only please. Clyde has the motivation, he\u2019s looking for someone that has the time and patience. Clyde will be neutered, up to date on vaccinations and microchipped before he goes home!",

He's perfect for someone who wants a travel companion ( loves car rides), a buddy to share the couch with, or go hiking or jogging.  He also enjoys stretching his legs on daily walks, playing fetch and happily \"sits\" upon request. Winston has lived with dogs, is friendly with them while on walks and in public, but will be best in an adult home where he can shine as your only pet.   DOB is July 3, 2016, 50 lbs.,  crate and house trained, vaccinated, neutered, and microchipped.  Adoption fee $250.00\n\n Please submit an adoption application, https://twobytworescue.com/adopting/",

She\u2019s a sweetie who loves to cuddle, but is also pretty athletic and enjoys hikes, walks, climbing, and is trained on a treadmill.  She is great in the car, and tolerates grooming and nail trimming.  Daisy has a high prey drive, so is not good with small animals, but she\u2019s fine around larger animals.  She\u2019s unpredictable with other dogs, and needs some tracing in that area.  Daisy is looking for a home with space to roam, and a gentle hand to give her boundaries confidence, and the love she deserves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Checkers is a 70-80 pound Great Dane/Irish Wolfhound (hence the gray) mix and is ready to find his forever home!\n\nCheckers is a very happy go lucky kind guy, and is ready for whatever adventure you want to go on. He loves walks, playing and also getting love, pets and attention. He will benefit from a family that can work on some basic training with him but is very teachable and treat motivated. \n\nCheckers is picky with other dogs and can be reactive when on a leash. He will require a family that knows how to handle his strength and will invest in professional training with him. He may do okay with a laid back female dog in the home after some training, but we think he would do best as an only dog at this time. He is not a dog park dog. \n\nCheckers will need a fully fenced yard with room for him to play. no apartments as he is very large, strong and has lots of energy. We are looking for a family that is experienced with either Irish Wolfhounds or Great Danes\n\nWe think Checkers would be fine with kids but we recommend older kids since he could easily knock over small children. No toddlers or cats for him!\n\nCheckers is UTD on shots, microchipped and neutered. His adoption fee is $400.",

He walks well on a leash when he is accompanied by another dog, for comfort. We are now walking him on his own to improve his confidence. He does kennel guard, to feel more secure, and barks at people he doesn't know. But the first time he gently puts his front paws on your chest and looks you in the eye, your heart will melt. He does fine with the workers at the Rescue, but does bond more easily with women.\n\nAll our dogs are spayed/neutered, de-wormed, vaccinated appropriate for their age, vaccinated for kennel cough, and micro-chipped. Puppies (under 6 months) are $225.00; puppies (6 months to 2 years) are $175.00, dogs (over 2 years) are $150 and senior dogs (7 years or older) are $60.00.",

            "description": "Meet the happy jumping Jack! Jack is a 1.5 year old Pitbull/Hound mix. Jack and his housemate Rose were surrendered by their previous owner to a local veterinary hospital and came to RR in disturbing shape. Jack weighed 20# upon intake and Rose weighed 18#; both were severely malnourished and had pressure sores from staying crated for extended periods of time. They have been in RR care for 6 weeks as of 5/13/20; and now Jack weighs 38# while Rose weighs 37#. Both of them have a long journey ahead of them, but are already thriving with their regular diet and some attention. While we thought Jack and Rose were a bonded pair and needed to stay together; Jack has become very aggressive with Rose over food, toys, treats, and attention. Now that both are receiving regular love and affection; Jack gets easily jealous of Rose.  He will need to be the only animal in the home (no other dogs or cats) as he has a high prey drive and toy drive. Jack is learning how to play, though he often shreds stuffed toys. He does best with heavy duty toys (like Kong balls and tug toys) that can stand up to his vigorous playtime! Jack is also learning how to leash walk (he pulls pretty intensely), and is learning some basic commands. He has mastered sit, and will often sit for a treat without being told to. Jack is also learning how to take treats more gently, he is very enthusiastic about food/treats and can be a little grabby when fed. Jack has some major crate and separation anxiety; he is working through this but will take a lot of patience and time to recover from the neglect he and Rose endured. Jack has made so much improvement over the past 6 weeks and would excel in a loving home with someone that would be willing to help him overcome his anxiety issues and show him what a real loving home has to offer! No animal should be treated the way Jack and Rose were cared for.\n\n7/8/20 UPDATE: Jack now weighs 52 lbs and is at an appropriate weight! He is starting Fluoxetine today, a medication to help with his anxiety. Hopefully he will do well on the medication and become a less anxious boy.\n\n8/24/20 UPDATE: We decided to hold off on Jack's anti-anxiety medication due to Rose's adoption earlier this month and he is much more calm without interacting with Rose. He is starting to pay attention to us more and patiently waits for meal times or treats. We hope that by removing the anxious element (Rose being adopted) that he will continue to relax and we can move forward with some training!\n\n11/15/20 UPDATE: We had another photo shoot today (since Jack's most recent pictures were taken in May when he was only weighing about 38 lbs). We haven't done a weigh in for a bit and estimate Jack is now about 65 lbs. Jack has started a walking regimen to help ensure he doesn't get too heavy, and he loves his walks! Jack walks best with a pinch collar as he is a big boy and can pull pretty hard when he sees something he wants to investigate! He loves going for walks with AJ (the resident 3 year old) and is learning not to get so excitable around him. Jack is continuing to thrive and is still searching for his forever home!",

            "description": "This is Martin, a one year old, 54 pound blue pit bull terrier.  Martin is a nerd. This dog is super happy, very bouncy and he needs a home that wants a dog who wants to go for a run. He has energy to burn and he needs a home that can do that, whether it's a 2 mile run or chucking a ball for him to chase for 20 minutes. Without adequate energy burned, Martin gets excited and then he gets mouthy and people do not enjoy being treated like a live squeaky toy. Martin can get along with other dogs, but his energy level is high and a lot of dogs will not appreciate that. Given the variables in the world, I think it is best that he be in an only dog home but know that with work and careful introductions with a dog with boundless energy and no snark, Martin is fine. I would not put this dog in a home with cats under any circumstances. Small woodland creatures, either, so if you run a sanctuary for harmless fluffy bunnies, this is not your dog.\n\nMartin is incredibly sweet and very affectionate. He adores everyone and does not know a stranger. He is very well mannered in the home and he knows commands. He waits patiently to be fed and gives you mournful looks while you are filling his bowl. He loves his toys and he loves to snuggle on the couch. I think a home with kids over 12 (bounce factor weighs in on the age of kids he is appropriate for) and a securely fenced wooden fence are best.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/ and then email kim.tompkins@bigfluffydogs.com. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

            "description": "This handsome 2 year old German Shepherd is SPORT!  Sport belonged to an Amish gentleman as a \u201cshop\u201d dog however he retired and sold the shop. He spent most of his life in a 10x10 kennel, overstimulated, stressed and frustrated that he couldn\u2019t interact with things on the other side of the fence. He remains friendly with most people that he meets out and about however he has been protective and given warning bites when he feels he needs to protect his family inside his home/yard. All of these bites have occurred during our initial two week shelter shut down and, to Sport's benefit, the shut down was not carried out properly in any of the circumstances. However we now know this is a problem and need his new family to be completely serious with following our instructions on how to best integrate Sport. He is currently in a foster home and doing well. Sport is extremely reactive to other dogs during his walks on leash. He needs to work on de-escalating and we recommend working with a trainer. We do require that his new home have a fenced yard and preferably a privacy fence and not in a development setting. His ideal home would be in a country setting without a lot of visitors and a family that can work on the bad habits that he picked up while guarding the shop. His new family must have similar dog experience. Not just \u201cI grew up with German Shepherds\u201d but actual experience in dealing with a reactive dog. A fenced yard is a must but we do want him to have exercise outside of a fenced yard - hikes in a park, obedience class, anything to exercise his brain as German shepherds need a job to make them feel fulfilled. The old adage \u201ca tired puppy is a good puppy\u201c definitely applies to Sport! He does ride well in a car!  Sport does need an adult only home with no other pets at this time.  Sport has been neutered, vaccinated, tested negative for heartworms and microchipped. Adoption $250. Please fill out an application at www.companimals.org and tell us what you can offer Sport!",

The folks here at Rescue Ridge in Monmouth County NJ say that I am an incredibly handsome, 8 yrs.old Bulldog just waiting for the right person or family to come along. I have been waiting for quite a while now for the right home. The volunteers at Rescue Ridge understand me. You see, I have this thing called arthritis and sometimes I just don't f\neel like moving much or I get grumpy sometimes. They have me on some medicine and that really helps me to get around much better. In fact, I feel even better when I go on easy-going walks and I am really good on a leash. I am housebroken, too. I LOVE car rides so let me be your co-pilot. My friends at Rescue Ridge even got me some professional training and I have done really well...graduating with high honors or something like that:) I am best in an adult home and am dog selective. I prefer mellow dogs or ones who are polite to an older guy like me. I would love an experienced owner who understands that I have had to endure a lot in my lifetime and will be your absolute most loyal and loving, affectionate companion once I know you. You see, I really am a good guy so please apply to adopt me at Rescueridge.com No inquiries, please, without an application. Kennel life is hard for an older guy like me. Won't you please adopt me soon? Here I am in my video debut. Pull up a chair and take a look\n\nhttps://youtu.be/TEYXF5LOEA0",

He is good with other dogs.\nIf the animal is under the age of 3 years old or has health issues, a vet reference is required which means you must own a pet or have owned a pet in your name.\n\nAdoption fee of $250 covers all vetting including spay/neuter surgery, vaccines, microchip heartworm test and treatment if needed and any other medical that may be required while in rescue. \n\nWe only do adoptions on Saturday and not all animals are able to attend so if you would like to see a specific animal please let us know so that we can make arrangements for it to be present at the event. Event locations do vary so please check the homepage to find out where we will be this week. Please do not ask us to reduce adoption fees since all fees help us to cover medical expenses for all of our animals, some of which can be very expensive.  Saving lives is not cheap so thank you for your understanding and helping us save as many as possible.\n\nPlease email lowcountryanimalrescue@ymail.com for an application.",

He was found running wild in a rural area and had obviously never had any human contact. He is still very shy and anxious, but with lots of loving interaction with both humans and confident dogs, he is making great progress!\n\nPetey will need a home with a young, playful dog to help him learn the ropes and build his confidence. He will do best with an owner who has experience with timid pups and has the patience and time to spend with him. We don't know how he would react to cats or other pets in the home. He does need a home with no children under the age of 12 please.\n\nMost of our dogs require a fully fenced yard, this does depend on the individual dogs needs and safety requirements.  \n\nOur dogs are fed a nutrient rich dog food named NutriSource.  Our experience is a high quality dog food keeps vet bills down and well-being high.\n\nIf you have any questions please email: claudiaatwag@gmail.com\n\nVisit our website to fill out an Adoption Application  http://www.wagsequimwa.com\n\nAdoption donation fee $350  (Please understand this adoption donation goes towards helping all the dogs we rescue)",

Ever wonder what it's like to have someone look deep into your soul with eyes overflowing with love? Adopt Prince and you'll never feel lonely again! Prince is a medium sized, 67 pounds (but should be closer to 50) 7 year old lab/pittie mix that will conquer your heart! He has the shiniest black coat, beautiful dark amber eyes, and a tail that never stops wagging! Prince's favorite things are cookies, pets, balls, gentle kisses, and chew toys in that order and he thinks the best throne is your lap. He can be a tad shy at first, but the way to even a royal man's heart is through his stomach and after a treat and a chin scratch, he'll be yours forever! Prince has excellent house manners, as long as no food is left in his reach. He takes treats gently and isn't a jumper, though he will try to climb into your lap on occasion. He's great in his crate and is crated overnight and when the foster leaves. He's not destructive around the house and really only barks when he wants to play or if he sees/hears another dog outside. He is housebroken and has not had a single accident or tried to mark in his foster's home. Outside, Prince loves to zoomie in the snow, play ball, and sniff all of the sniffs. Typical of labs and pits alike, he is a goofy doof and doesn't always watch where he is zooming, so we recommend older kids that he won't risk knocking over. He is working on his leash skills, especially around other animals, but he loves to go for short walks and then back in where it's warm. Prince's ideal home would be with him as the only pet so that he can have all of your love and be the true king of his castle, but can live with other dogs. You see, Prince wasn't treated very well by other dogs in his past. He showed up at the shelter with evidence of a pretty bad dog attack and he was bullied by other dogs for quite a long time. Because of this, he is uncomfortable with having strange dogs in his space, especially if they rush in. With slow introductions, Prince can get along with another respectful and socially savvy dog and would probably enjoy a buddy with the right personality match to play with. Prince can't tell the difference between a cat and a squirrel so his home should have no small animal pets besides fish that he loves to watch swimming around. He would love a moderately active family that will help him shed those extra pounds, explore the world, and then come home for snuggles.\n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is sponsored.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

He is also on a restricted diet, he is allergic to most meat proteins and is eating a rabbit based food.  He is not good with children but seems to be good with other dogs.\n\nAll our pets are spayed or neutered, vaccinated including rabies, given de-wormer, heartworm negative or being treated with the slow kill method approved by our veterinarian, on prevention, on flea/tick prevention, most are house trained. The majority but not all of our pets require a fence. Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered. We adopt within 300 miles of New Orleans/Baton Rouge, La and we do not ship or transport--Adoption fee $200. Email us at creolepoodlerescue@yahoo.com to get an adoption application. Complete an adoption form and email it back to us (we do not have a FAX) if interested in adopting and providing a loving home for this pet.  If you can't email it to us, you can mail it to P.O. Box 2333, Gonzales, La 70707, but this will slow the process down.\n\nWhen you request an adoption application, we will also send you our guidelines to read - many questions you may have are answered there.  All of our pets are in private foster homes. We require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meeting for any of our pets. Everything we know at this time about this pet is posted.IF YOU SEE THIS PET POSTED ON OUR ADOPTABLE PETS PAGE, THIS PET IS AVAILABLE. WE UPDATE OUR ADOPTABLE PETS SEVERAL TIMES DAILY.  IF THE WORD PENDING IS NEXT TO THE NAME, THE PET HAS AN APPROVED ADOPTER COMING TO MEET AND PROBABLY ADOPT HIM OR HER.  We reserve the right to refuse adoption for any reason.\n\nWe are all VOLUNTEERS and have full time jobs, families, pets of our own to care for - we do the best that we can to get back to you in a timely manner.  Please realize that turning in an application today will not mean that you adopt a poodle tomorrow.  We believe in taking the time to go through our thorough process to try to match the dog with the family.",

Lola was emaciated and full of milk but sadly the other babies were no where to be found. Unfortunately as is the case with many dogs like her, Lola is heartworm positive and not dog friendly. She loves people very much & is the sweetest girl you'll ever meet but she will need to be the only dog in the home. She's doing great in her foster home & has gained the weight she needs! Lola has started her heartworm treatment & will be heartworm free before we know it! If you're looking for a sweet girl to join your family, look no further than beautiful Lola!

Highly charged, Hera is like a molecule binging and pinging here, there and everywhere. She's loaded with zip, has springs for legs and could probably jump over the moon! In case you haven't gotten the hint, Hera's very energetic and would make an excellent running companion, especially once she has some manners under her belt. At first, getting her to sit was a struggle, but after she had some time to unwind, heat up and work off some energy, she laid down. Not long after that, Hera had worn down enough that she was much more compliant in taking direction. She's a lover of people, but can be picky with other dogs and may fare better as an only dog. Hera's adoption fee is $150 and helps cover her spay, worming, vaccinations, microchip, monthly heart worm, flea and tick preventive and care while at CCHS. If all you wanna do is run, jump and have fun, then Hera's the girl for you!",

This angel was rescued off the streets of San Bernardino emaciated, in heat, and had a prolapsed uterus. This sweet angel is still recovering from her surgery and she would recover quicker if she had a home to relax in. She is otherwise healthy and vaccinated.\n\nThis sweet girl loves everyone she meets. She's housebroken, loves sleeping on a comfy dog bed and is very well behaved in the home. She's learning how to walk better on a leash and is perfect in the car. For now, with everything Tulip has been through, we think being the only dog is best. We believe she had to protect herself in the tough streets of San Bernardino and had to be defensive toward other dogs in order to survive.\n\nIf you think this absolute gem would be a great fit in your family, please submit a completed adoption application found at www.doggiebonez.com so that we can schedule a meet and greet. He is also on all of our social media pages IG: @Doggie_Bonez_Inc_ and Facebook: Doggie Bonez.\n\nIf adoption isn't an option, please consider fostering one of our pups. We are a volunteer run non-profit dog rescue and always welcome new short and/or long term doggie foster families. We greatly appreciate the help and time of our fosters. You provide all the love, comfort and safety of a home and we supply you with everything else you may need, dog food, dog bed, toys, medical attention (if needed) etc. If you are interested please visit www.doggiebonez.com to see all of our available dogs who need a foster family while waiting for their fur-ever home and complete the foster application.",

He is settling nicely into his foster home and is slowly getting to know his foster brother. Blake could live with another large female who can tolerate his rough and tumble play style. For now, we recommend only large children as he will knock over young ones, he does not know how big he is. He is finishing up his treatment for his heartworm and will have to have surgery to correct his entropion in one eye. He is a very good pup who is looking for a family that can help him become his best self.**During his heartowm treatment Blake did develop diabetes. it is currently managed with insulin and he is a very happy boy. Diabetes in dogs is a manageble condition but may last his entire life. Please be aware of this when choosing to apply**",

            "description": "Swain is a friendly & playful JRT/Australian Shepherd mix who is 7 years old and weighs 50 lbs.  He was picked up as an emaciated stray in Cherokee County and his future looked bleak until BarkVille was able to step in and place him in a wonderful foster home where he was able to put on weight and regain his strength.  His foster mom says Swain is an inquisitive, quiet, snuggler who is good on a leash, knows basic commands, and likes to maneuver his blankets with his paws & teeth to make himself a pillow!  He is a medium energy boy who likes playing fetch and destroying balls & toys in the yard (kongs recommended).  He can be quite possessive of his toys so a home with no children is required.  Swain is housebroken, crate trained, neutered, fully vaccinated and microchipped.\n\nFor more information about Swain, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org. If you would like to adopt sweet Swain, please submit an adoption application for him at https://www.barkvilledogrescue.org/applications",

            "description": "Hello there, I'm Wiggles! Here are some of my fabulous qualities: I am gorgeous so when we go for walks, the people in the neighborhood will ooh and ahh over your new best friend's handsome good looks. I have flopsy-mopsy ears and a stub of a tail. When I see you, I get really excited and I will shake my butt to show you how happy you make me. \n\nI'm not super-great yet at knowing how to react when I meet new people that I think might be strangers. I'm still young and I come on strong sometimes. Because I have a territorial instinct, if you like to have a lot of company over to your house, I will need support and training from you so I can warm up to our house guests. With training, I could make a good watch dog and loving companion.\n\nBecause of these reasons, the good folks here at Desert Haven think it's best for me to have \"an experienced adopter\", whatever that means. I think it just means that I'm a really good boy and I need a really good person who can help me learn some really good manners.\n\nI like yummy treats so I am considered \"treat motivated\". This means I will learn what you teach me but you will probably need to keep a pocketful of biscuits handy. I already know \"sit\", am learning \"down\" and after we spend some time bonding I will come to you when you whistle or call for me. I do pull some on the leash so I think it would be good to learn proper leash skills from you.\n\nHere are some of my interests:  I am playful and enjoy toys. I like to carry them around and I will play like tug-o-war with you too. I love going for hikes and walks and being active with you in the out-of-doors.  I like to hunt and search for lizards. I am often on the lookout for something to chase. I am interested in people and being petted and told that I'm a good, good boy. I have extra energy in my body so I need exercise to be happy. I really love your affection but I am sort of awkward about it. I would LOVE to have a patient family that helps me learn to cuddle.\n\nI've told you about me and some of my favorite things. Do you think that I could be one of your favorite things? Come meet me soon! Love you, Wiggles\n\n(Wiggles is about 50 pounds and his date of birth is November of 2018)\n\n",

Once animals are posted, we immediately begin receiving adoption applications. With one volunteer available to review all applications, we appreciate your patience as you wait for an email response. Adoption appointments are scheduled in the order that approved applications are received. You can find our adoption procedures and online application at warmhearts.org/adopt.\n\nWinnie came to us as a stray, so we don't have any background. Winnie is a fun loving girl with a great personality and smile. She is calm with people but she chooses to be the only dog in her family. Winnie's estimated DOB is 6/1/2018; she weighs approx. 60 pounds. Winnie is an adult dog and will not continue to grow in size.\n\nHSPC's adoption fee is seventy-five-dollars through December 31, 2020, unless stated otherwise within the pet's description. At times, our adoption fees are lowered during special events that are posted to our website or Facebook page. Every pet that is available for adoption has been spayed/neutered, microchipped, and is up-to-date on vaccinations including heartworm preventative (canines). Adopters are required to schedule a wellness exam with their veterinarian at their cost within 7 days of adoption.\n\nPlease only submit one application. Once you are contacted by email, you will have an opportunity to provide us with any additional animal(s) under consideration.",

I\u2019m working on my manners, but whenever I meet new people, I just have to kiss their face. I\u2019m convinced that everyone loves me and wants to pet me while I shower them with kisses. \nI especially love to play \u2013 fetch and chase are my favorites. I have not met a toy I didn\u2019t like \u2013 bonus points if it squeaks or bounces! I know several commands and do well in a kennel (though I prefer human beds). I\u2019m very quick to learn new tricks, but sometimes will be stubborn about listening.\n \nWhen one-on-one, I\u2019m super chill and prefer to nap at their feet, on the bed, in their lap\u2026really as close as you\u2019ll let me. \nI love humans of all sizes, but sometimes forget not to jump on the littlest ones (they fall down easily). I\u2019d do well in a home with friends and space to run and release some of this energy, although I will need to be introduced to any doggy siblings slowly. I refuse to like cats \u2013 it\u2019s an ancient rivalry and I refuse to let it go \u2013 so please don\u2019t invite them into our home.\n \nMy love for ice cubes (favorite treat) can only be eclipsed by my love of car rides. I don\u2019t care where we are going (or if I\u2019m invited); all open car doors are an invitation for adventure! Can I take a ride with you?! \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our dogs are healthy, spayed/neutered, vaccinated and on heartworm preventative. They live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. Many have basic obedience skills and all have been temperament tested. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, please visit our website to complete an application: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt\n(please note: app cannot be done on a mobile device)\n\nFor additional information see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

She is crate trained, and walks perfectly on a leash. Delilah takes a bit to warm up to people, but once you have her trust, her true beauty shoes. She will thrive in a home with another confident dog(s) to show her the ropes. It is a requirement. As far as dogs go, Delilah is one of the easiest. She is not dependent upon a human, and thrives when she has rules. She is not going to seek out affection from a human, but is one of the easiest dogs her foster has ever had.",

Because of the trauma I've been through, I am very shy and it takes me a bit to warm up to new people. But OMG when I get to know you, I promise you'll see my personality shine! Staff members say I am the happiest, goofiest, funniest girl here (don't tell the others). I make them laugh daily! My new family would need to make sure they can contain me properly because of my history as a runner. It is also very important I meet all humans and dogs in the home to make sure we are all a good fit for each other. I will need slow introductions with other dogs and would prefer calmer dogs.\n Staff here thinks I deserve to have a happy ever after...do you?\n\nCheck out this video which tells you all about Pipers long awaited capture and gives you a bit of an insight on what she has been through...\nhttps://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1327393390798891&id=919643184907249\n\nFor more information on this dog or any of our adoptable pets, please call the shelter at 636-583-4300 or stop by! \n\n Hours:  Mon.11 -6:00 ,Wed,Thurs., Fri. and Sat.  11:00am - 4:00 pm    Closed on Sun. and Tues. \n\n We take in 2000 to 3000 animals each year, so there is always someone new looking for a forever home!!\n\nIf you can't adopt right now, please help by walking dogs or making a donation to help us to continue helping the animals.",

This poor dog was not only rooting in the dirt for food but had mud inside of his mouth!! He was clearly starving!!\nThis Good Samaritan, Jerry, knew he had to save this dog then and there or he would starve. He brought him home and named him Rilee. \nAlmost immediately after Rilee was home with Jerry and his wife Betty, he completely started to BLOSSOM into the happiest boy, as you can see!! He knew he was SAFE\n\nRilee is a total \u201clap dog\u201d! He absolutely adores humans, will never hesitate to cuddle up and loves planting big kisses on his humans. Rilee\u2019s fosters, Jerry and Betty, have come to nicknaming Rilee \u201cMr. Prancy Pants\u201d because he loves to prance around, follow his humans, and show off his silly personality! \nUnfortunately, the resident cats and Rilee are not getting along so, Rilee\u2019s bedroom has been the garage and they know he deserves way better! So, we are looking for a FUREVER HOME for this sweet boy! \n\nRilee is around 70 lbs, estimated to be 3-4 yrs old. Unfortunately, he is not good with cats or other dogs but is fully house trained, follows commands and is a very LOVING and silly boy. He will be the perfect companion!\n\n*Please note that a fenced yard is required for Rilee\n\nApply to adopt Rilee at www.twotailzrescue.org!\n",

I have a ton of energy, can easily climb and jump so I will need a lot of exercise and I do need basic training. I will need a very structured schedule and should be the only dog in the house. They say I have Cattle Dog, Malamute, and Shepherd with a tiny percentage of Gray Wolf. In any event I am pretty unique with mesmerizing eyes.

She is lovely and obedient with people but has little tolerance for other canines, so she will need to be the only dog in the home with a \"shepherd savvy\" adopter.  She is super affectionate and loving, but very strong, so she will need a strong and competent handler and we think a home without small kids would be ideal.  Isabella is very trainable with tricks and in agility - she is a joy to work with!  She will make an excellent pet for the right owner.  If you think that could be you...please apply!\n\nIsabella is spayed, microchipped, vaccinated and up to date on heartworm and flea/tick preventative.  Our $300 adoption fee helps cover these expenses.\n\nCOMPLETED APPLICATIONS MUST BE SUBMITTED PRIOR TO MEETING OUR DOGS. APPLICATIONS ARE CONSIDERED IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY ARE RECEIVED. http://www.redbarnrescue.com/adoption-application.html",

He is reactive to UPS trucks, and he was barking at one while the owner kicked him in the butt.  He swung around and nipped the guy in the ankle for the kick.  Boom, no more home. Chico would make a great one or two-person dog in a quiet home.  Or even a home with just adults.\n\nHe is very protective of his home and has to be in a crate when guests arrive.\n\nHe needs meet n greets with new people on leash.\n\nOther than that, he is a great Only Dog for a family of two.\n\nWe recommend further training with him in his new home, in addition to a handler who understands working dogs.\n\nChico is extremely loving, beautiful, and blows coat twice a year with a vengeance.\n\nSomething has happened to this dog that involved a UPS driver because he is off the wall when he encounters one of those trucks.  We strongly feel that Chico was probably maced or bear sprayed at some time or other by a UPS driver.\n\nChico loves outings, but we will provide a muzzle to keep him out of trouble with people who won't listen to you.\n\nGive this guy a chance, he is really a wonderful dog who has developed some stupid habits that training will correct.\n\nChico is currently in our detection dog training program.\n\n\n",

She is working on house training. Ginger is mostly blind, she sees light and dark only, but gets along just fine once she learns her way around. She would do best with another dog to romp and play with. Please visit our main site for more information or to apply to adopt.",

Her owners says she is a Rottweiler American Staffordshire Pitbull Terrier, but we think she is just so gorgeous that we sent off her DNA to see exactly what she is.  So keep a look out for any updates.  The results are in.....Sophie is an American Staffordshire Terrier/Rottweiler!\nShe did go to a home for a short period of time, but she would escape out the front door and got into a fight with a neighbor dog.  This lovely lady is going to need a secure fence, where she will be the only animal. \nIf you are interested in meeting her please call the shelter (520) 458-4151 to schedule an appointment.\n",

Elena takes some time to warm up to people. She doesn't trust many people in this world so she is a flight risk. She had no interest in dog friends when she first arrived but after many months she has finally bonded with another dog, her very patient and respectful office mate (a young male mix breed). When they are outside together, she is a completely different dog. She is playful and silly with the other dog. We are hopeful that one day she can transfer that happiness to people. If you have experience with shy/fearful dogs and would like to meet Elena, please fill out an application on mymanatee.org/pets.",

Her eyes say it all . \n\nIt is hard to put an age on her because abused and neglected dogs look older so my guess is between 5-7 but she has the spunk of a 3 year old one . \n\nWhen i started to walk her , I knew that I was dealing with a TRUE German shepherd . \n\nThese are the precious gems that stick with you and are fiercely loyal . \n\nAmelia is not good with cats and dogs and would fit in a calm , loving family without kids . \n\nWe hope to find her soon a forever home because this girl is gold . \n\nAmelia is located in Middle Island NY \n\nTo become her new family please apply today by filling in the adoption application to find on our website www.a-teameliterescuedogs.com or email us and we send you one .",

This girl is the perfect medium size at about 25-30lbs. She was adopted from a shelter just over 3 years ago and is looking for a new home due to no fault of her own. She will need a home with no other animals and no young children. She loves pets and butt scratches. She is very loyal and protective and is full of energy. She needs lots of exercise and playtime but will also lay and snuggle with you for hours. She is a bit of an escape artist so she needs to be on a leash or in a fenced yard when outside. She is super sweet and affectionate and will give you tons of love and kisses.\n\nFor more information, please contact Jana at Janabaina@gmail.com\n",

When she isn't distracted by strangers, Santana's a good walker. Very aware of her surroundings, she'll occasionally bark, rather howl like a hound, at whatever catches her fancy. While sit isn't in Santana's vocabulary, treats definitely are!     Highly caffeinated, she likes to run, jump and play and would make a great buddy for one who's equally physically active. Santana's adoption fee is $150 and helps cover her spay, worming, vaccinations, monthly heart worm, flea and tick preventive and care while at CCHS.",

            "description": "Miles was found as a stray when he crawled into a barn to die.  He was so starving and emaciated that one could see every bone in his body.  \n\nFlash forward a few months and Miles has done a full transformation. He is doing great!  He has gained weight and energy and his personality has blossomed!  He has fantastic house manners; he\u2019s such an easy keeper.  He loves to hang out with us in the house and yard, go for car rides and walks.  We love how sweet and waggly he is when we speak to him!  Miles is a quiet dog at home, but will alert if someone comes onto the property \u2013 he\u2019s got a big voice!   Miles loves his things, he will bring you his toys and he keeps them close and will pile them in his crate.    Miles has spent time in supervised doggy play groups and has been social.  We are continuing with training and dog socialization but he needs to go slow!  \n\nMiles is pretty darn close to perfect.  Miles has: amazing house manners, is sugary-sweet and has the pittie wiggles, is an undemanding cuddler and all around easy keeper!   If you\u2019d like to meet Miles give us a call or text 707-972-9359 or 530-570-4538 and fill out an application at https://www.mendoshelterpets.org/",

It turned out to be a torn ACL, which is difficult to mend in a shelter environment, so FOMAS brought him into rescue and had it surgically repaired.  He has been in foster/boarding and continues to recover. He has finished his doctor visits.  Now he needs a home of his own where he will enjoy walks and play, preferably in a fenced yard or with regular supervised activity in a dog park.\n\nHe happily plays with other dogs and loves people.  He does well in his kennel, but is happiest just laying by (or in) the doorway watching the world.  He is not particularly interested in cats and gets along with dogs, though does not play very energetically.\n\nBrett is about 4 years old, current on vaccinations, neutered and microchipped.  He is heartworm positive, but has been given an initial treatment and a 6 month preventative, and is expected to become negative over time if he remains on preventative.  Please message our page to arrange to meet him.\n",

            "description": "Meet Sawyer! He is a Beagle mix, and his estimated date of birth is April 2020. He is 34lb as of 1/16/20. The perfect size!\n\nSawyer was adopted by a loving family over the summer but due to some unforeseen circumstances, he unfortunately needs to be re-homed due to no fault of his own. He is a sweet sweet, high energy boy, who would do great in a home with another active dog who can be his buddy. This boy is not a couch potato! This boy also LOVES apples, so anyone willing to share an apple with him is high on his list.\n\nHe is great with other dogs, and just full of love. He goes to doggy daycare twice a week and does amazing, so a home where he gets an outlet like that would be ideal. He needs to work on his obedience since he is a still puppy, but all love. A home with small kids may not be great for him since he is an exuberant greeter (he may knock little ones over by mistake!).\n\nHe is currently located in Wethersfield CT.\n*please note, his video is from when he was 4 months old! The pictures are recent!*\n\nHis adoption fee is $290\n\n**Please note: Due to state-specific import laws, we are not able to adopt to residents of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, or Maine.\n\nYou can find his application here.\nwww.humanesocietyofthedelta.org/adopt\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                             ADOPTION FEE AND HEALTH INFORMATION\n\nHis adoption fee and transport combined is $490: This covers age appropriate vaccines (2 DHPP vaccine), (Bordetella vaccine), (Rabies vaccine if 12 weeks and older), up to date on flea/tick prevention and heartworm prevention, bi-weekly worming, microchip, fostering costs, health certificate and transportation fees.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                       FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nQ: Where is he located?\nA: He is currently in a foster home but is originally from our shelter in Arkansas.\n\nQ: It feels scary adopting without meeting the pup first. What if he isn't the right fit for our home?\nA: We know it can feel scary and that's why we offer a FULL refund of your adoption fee within the first two weeks if for some reason it's not the right fit. We want our adopters to feel confident and we want the best situation for our pups.  If in that 2 weeks you feel it is not working out, we can rehome the dog and refund your adoption fee.  All we ask is that you foster the dog until we find them a new home! \n\nQ: I have more questions!! Who do I contact?\nA:  Please e-mail adopt@humanesocietyofthedelta.org directly.  We DO NOT answer adoption questions or inquiries on any other platform.\n\nQ: I am under 21, will you adopt to me?\nA: Unfortunately, we do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.\n\nQ: I would like to surprise my family with a puppy!  Can I do this?\nA:  Unfortunately, no.  If there is more than one decision-maker in the home, all of them should be in agreement. \n\n\nThank you for your understanding and consideration and for helping the dogs and puppies in need!",

            "description": "Boss is maybe about 8 years old,- He weighs 12 lbs and is muscular, not a fragile little flower! His owner was older and could no longer take proper care of him and as a result, he is more than likely best fit with a single woman owner.  Boss is the Boss of the house. Hw would not be a good choice for apartment living or living where you see new people a lot. He is a Chihuahua! He is very vocal when meeting new people-especially men. Men are not Boss's thing. Once he knows people, he settles down and is ok. He does not like joggers and he doesn't like people on bikes. I think in his mind they are running away from him so he must try to chase them.\nBoss  gets along fine with the other pups in the house. He  resource guards his toys and chew bones, so when he is with other dogs, those items must be supervised. He gets along fine with other dogs , so meeting dogs on walks  is fine, he just is the boss of his territory and his toys. He likes to cuddle up and keep you company while napping. He likes playing with stuffed toys and will drag them around the house. and try to take them on walks. He will fetch them if you throw them. He walks well on leash, and rides well in a car. His butt wiggles a million miles an hour when he is excited or happy and he listens well if you tell him to come or stop. He will jump up next to you and throw himself backwards to get a belly rub. His belly is soft and smooth and I love giving him belly rubs!  I have cats and Boss is ok with them-he chases my one cat every once in awhile, I think when he is bored;-) but stops if I tell him to. He has a lot of personality! I feel that Boss will do best in a quiet home and one Mom. Apartments would be dicey because of the constant flow of meeting people. And a busy area would also be dicey since he likes to chase moving cars, bikes and joggers. \nBoss is a wonderful guy and needs a mama that understands chichi's and their behaviors. If you have the patience to give him a little time to get to know you you will have a fun and entertaining buddy for life! \n\n\nIf you would like to be considered as a potential adopter for one of our great dogs, please go to our website-?www.luckymuttsrescue.org?and submit an application. Our application process includes landlord approval and vet checks. Please make sure all of your information is current and accurate, including a valid email address and phone numbers.

We receive several applications for each dog. \nOur adopters are picked based on the needs of the dog, and the home we feel with best fit based on your responses to our application, vet information and landlord requirements.  \n Approved applicants not chosen for the dog you applied for, will\nbe in active status for a period of six months. \n We encourage you to watch Petfinder, Facebook and our website for upcoming dogs.  \nShould you see a dog that interests you,please send us a Facebook message or an email with your approval number.

I am especially fond of burying my food in my bedding and licking everything when I'm excited and happy. I feel safe in my kennel and it's usually my favorite place to be, even if you leave it open.\n\nBecky is a rather skittish girl. She is slow to trust, but when she's comfortable she can be very adorable and affectionate. She will need a family that is calm and patient, especially at first when she's figuring out the pattern of her new home.

I don't mean to brag but I am pretty heckin smart and have already learned a bunch of human words like sit, shake, down and come. I also do great in a crate (ope that rhymed!) and if you put my favorite soft bed in there and give me one of those kong things with the peanut butter, that is pure joy for me! I like the belly rubs and I give kisses to say thank you! I love to play with balls! Haha bamboozled! I mean the ones you kick around outside. Don't be obscene, fren! Oh and one thing about me is I need a 6 ft fence cause I do not like to be contained by lame boundaries! I am 5 years old and weigh 45 pounds, do not judge me, punk! My official breed is a doggo but some humans call me an American Staffordshire Terrier. Alrighty, that about wraps it up! Feel free to slide into my DMs to find out more or you can apply to adopt me at www.pawpatroldayton.com/adoptable-dogs. My adoption fee is $200 and I am vaccinated, neutered, microchipped, and heartworm negative. All of our animals are vaccinated, micro-chipped and spayed/neutered before being adopted.",

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN FOSTERING OR ADOPTING BENNY, PLEASE GO TO THE MAKE A DIFFERENCE RESCUE FACEBOOK PAGE AND SEND A PRIVATE MESSAGE THAT INCLUDES YOUR PHONE NUMBER AND EMAIL ADDRESS.\n\nBenny is a very handsome 2 year old Terrier mix. He is so sweet and loves to give kisses. He loves to go for walks as well as hang out and do whatever you are doing. MUST BE ONLY DOG!! He needs another dog in his forever home to play with. Unfortunately, we do not know how he is with cats. He would do best with children 10 years old or older. Benny's forever home must have a fenced yard where he can safely run, play and hang out with his people. He is neutered, up to date on his vaccinations, on heart worm preventative as well as house and crate trained. Benny is looking forward to becoming a very loved member of a forever family.\n\nAll dogs we rescue stay with us until they find their forever homes. We do not do same day adoptions. A home visit is required to ensure our dog is going to a safe environment and our dog gets along with your dog(s) and/or cat(s). We require all our dogs over the age of 1 year attend 1 obedience class (6 week session) outside the home. You must live within 1 hour of Birmingham, MI to adopt one of our dogs. No out of state or outside the U.S. adoptions or fosters. Benny's adoption fee is $275.",

He will sit and wait for you to toss the ball into the air where most of the time he will catch it. Armani works well with playful dogs like puppies but still knows how to mind his manners around a dog that may not be at his play speed. His Energetic play may scare young children and knock them down unintentionally. Visits with Armani are by appointment only.

Due to this injury and my scrappy street-smart history, I need to be THE ONLY ANIMAL IN THE HOME. Luckily I was saved and taken to MDAS where PAWS4You stepped in and took me under their wing and have been working on building my confidence. I have now fully recovered and I'm on a journey to find a happy family with no young children. I am very athletic and enjoy going on adventures, exercising and need humans with dog experience who can keep an eye on me due to my 'escape artist' tendencies. I'm looking for a patient home where I will be cared and loved for. If you have a big bed and in need of some company, I'm your dog!\n\nTo adopt, fill out an application at\n\nwww.paws4you.org/application\n\nTo get our newsletter, text\nPAWS4YOU\nto\n22828\n\nConnect with us:\n\nwww.instagram.com/paws4you\n\nwww.twitter.com/paws4you\n\nwww.facebook.com/paws4you",

No- not really a lottery, but you will feel like you have hit the jackpot if I choose you to be my forever home. So let's talk about me and see if we could be a family.\n\nMy name is Toi. I am a Min Pin/Chihuahua mix who is 10 1/2 years old. Don't let that age thing bother you,, I am a medium energy dog who loves walks, zoomies in the backyard with my foster sister and brother and car rides. My favorite word is Treats!!!\n\nI am a little bit choosey about who I do and don't like. Foster mom says I need some more \"socialization:\"- whatever that means. Hey- do you instantly like everyone you meet? I bet you don't. I choose to think of myself as discerning about who I let into my inner circle!! But just think how special you will feel when I decide that you are deserving of my trust, snuggles and love. I didn't get to meet a lot of people when I was growing up and it takes me a while to let my guard down with new humans. I do best when I am on a leash when new two-leggers come into the house. I can be growly, but if they leave me alone, I leave them alone. I listen to Mom when she tells me \"Toi, settle down, don't be growly, you're fine\".\n\nMy foster home has two other dogs in it, so I have a foster brother and sister who are my best friends. We love to run around the backyard together, wait for our treats, mealtime and jump into the big bed every morning.. My favorite place to sleep at night is on a chair covered in my blankets in the big bedroom. I need lots of blankets so I can burrow down inside of them!!\n\nChildren aren't really my thing, so foster mom says we are looking for a home with adults only. And my new family needs to be very experienced with dogs who need a little extra attention, time and patience. Do you know the saying, \"good things come to those who wait\" or \"patience is a virtue\"? Or how about- just love me for who I am, just like I will love you for who you are and together we will grow and become the best we can be.\n\nAm I a lap dog? No. Am I going to instantly trust you? No. Am I worth the work you will put into building a relationship with me? You bet!! And on top of that- I am very handsome. So maybe it's okay that I play a little \"hard to get\"!\n\nThis is what I need from my new family:\n\nA big fenced in backyard so I can run and run and run. At least one other dog to be my bestie and to show me how to be a dog. Someone who can understand that while I love to lay right next to my human, I am not one of those silly lap dogs\n\nwho wants to be held like a baby. Maybe some day, but not right now. Someone who loves me unconditionally and will take the time to earn my love and trust.\n\nAdults who are experienced with dogs who have fear and socialization issues.\n\nAnd don't forget about toys- I need lots of toys!! Toys to carry around, toys to throw up in the air, toys to chase- you can never have too many toys!! But mostly time, love and patience.\n\nSo let's get those applications rolling in and I can pick out my new home!!! I'm posting some new pics that foster mom took of me and I know they make me look irresistible!!!\n\nToi's adoption donation is $250.00\n1/3/21 9:34 AM",

If they get too close, she will growl but doesn\u2019t seem to interact with them otherwise.She is spayed, UTD on shots and on HW preventative.\n\nShe is a little special but is a wonderful, loving little girl that is looking for a family of her own.Her adoption fee is $250.00\n\n.If you are interested in the above dog, please do not email us and tell us that you are interested, but submit an adoption application.

            "description": "Duke is in a foster home where we've learned how he excels. His foster dad says Duke is the most laid back and relaxing dog out there! He will follow you around the house and lay by your side until it is time for a walk or play time. He loves belly rubs and treats and will accomodate you in return with big doggy smiles. Of course he's very housetrained, one of the many benefits of a mature dog but that love of food is a little tougher,,if you leave food unattended he might expect you're sharing for two. Duke hasn't been with children or cats in his current foster home. He is staying with another dog. He also lived with dogs previously in his lifetime. Over the years it seems Duke might have a little less patience for dog friends since it takes longer for him to acclimate and a little extra work to make sure he knows he's not the boss. A meet and greet with a home dog can be accomodated through the shelter. To learn more about Duke write his foster dad at jonathan.vicencio03@gmail.com Click here to view my behavior notes.",

I do kind of tire out quickly and love to lie down on my belly. I love to roll over and get a good belly rub. I\u2019m a bit a goofy boy with a strong wiggly tail, so they say I would be better with older children. I must be the only pet in the home. My foster mama said I am so good in the house.

Yes\nGood on Leash? Yes\nGood with other nice dogs?   yes\nGood with Adults & Children?  yes\n\nHello, I am Fergus!\nFergus the friendly. Fierce de-stuffer of fluffy toys and lovingly referred to by foster momma as \u201cBig Sexy\u201d. \nPeople, let it be known that I\u2019m a dog with swagger! \n\nFergus joined YLDR after spending an abysmal amount of time in a shelter - but his spirit remained jolly, and they didn\u2019t give up on him finding a way out. After some decompression time in his foster home, Fergus\u2019s personality began to shine through, and oh what a personality he has. Fergus has the kind of calm, relaxed, debonair self confidence you read about in romance novels. He can also be a complete goofball, prancing from person to person like a debonair show stallion. \nAgain... swagger. \n\nFergus loves to be with his people. That can be inside cuddling on the couch bingeing on the latest shows. Fergus is oddly fascinated by dolphins on television & loves nature programs. Fergus loves to roll around outside in the yard, or sit with you in the front yard and people watch as the neighborhood goes about their daily life. As long as he\u2019s chillin\u2019 with his humans, he\u2019s delighted.\n\nFergus is crate trained, house trained, walks politely on a leash & is wonderful with children taking treats gently from even the smallest of hands. Fergus likes to play fetch\u2026 but will play tug until your arms get tired and is always game for a walk or a ride in the car. He\u2019s also content should you need to be away, and showers you with affection & kisses when you reappear. \n\nFergus would do well in a household with older children, or dog savvy smaller ones. He\u2019s currently in a household with twin 6yr old boys. He can be a 60lb zooming mass of excitement, not always particularly graceful in where he\u2019s going, so smaller children need extra eyes when he\u2019s on the zoom path. Fergus enjoys playing with a few dog friends in the neighborhood, so he may enjoy having a K9 brother or sister. \nCats are not recommended. \n.\n\n\nFERGUS  has an estimated DOB of 4/09/18 and is believed to be a \nLab Retriever/Pitt Bull Terrier mix.  Fergus  weighed 67 pounds.  \n\nIf you live in the Greater Metro ATL, GA area and are interested in  adopting FERGUS, please email us at info@youluckydogrescue.org and visit our website to submit an online ADOPTION APPLICATION. - \n\nADOPTION APPLICATION:  YOULUCKYDOGRESCUE.ORG\n\nQUESTIONS - yep, we know you got 'em!  Email us at info@youluckydogrescue.org\n\nOur adoption fee is $300 and includes all age appropriate vaccines, spay  or neuter and microchipping.   The breed and age included in this listing is based upon the opinion of a vet that has examined the dog.  We cannot confirm the age of the dog unless the dog was born in the care of the rescue.  We are located in the metro Atlanta area.   We currently do not allow out of state adoptions as a home check is required as part of the adoption process.",

Please call the clinic to schedule a meeting with Julie, Braxton, Meghan or Lucas.\n\nLola has been working with a trainer and her new family should continue her training. She knows sit, stay, heel and come. Lola is currently using a prong collar and also a bark collar as her training tools. Once adopted, Julie will meet with Lola's new owners to teach them how to work with Lola. This sweetie is a true diamond in the rough and is waiting for an equally special someone to help her shine!\n\nLola is perfect for an active single person or couple with no children. She is a sweet and sensitive soul who will just need a little time to open up and adjust to a new environment. Lola is dog aggressive and doesn't do well with other pets, and would need to be the only pet in your home. The perfect environment for Lola would be living with an active single person or couple with no children or pets.\n\nLola is up to date on her vet services, has a negative heartworm test and is spayed and microchipped.  She has so much love to give, and in the right hands will be a great lifetime companion!\n\nLola can be shy at first around new people and strangers, but as you spend some time getting to know her, you will have a friend for life. She is truly a sweet and special girl ~~ a true diamond in the rough. She just needs someone to take the time to work with her and gain her trust.\n\nLola has a lot of energy and would love someone who enjoys daily activity -- hiking, walking, running, extended backyard time playing with toys, perhaps even an obstacle course. Lola's super power is climbing. She can be an escape artist and is able to climb fences, so a yard with a tall privacy fence is definitely a necessity for this super dog!! \n\nLola enjoys giving hugs, being pet and fussed over, and would love to be the center of your world. She is looking for someone who will love her as much as she loves them, a nice comfy bed to lie on, daily exercise, and a fenced yard with plenty of treats and toys. If this sounds like you, come and meet sweet Lola. Lola's $130 adoption fee includes 6 months of heartworm preventative and 6 months of flea and tick preventative.\n\nCrabapple Knoll Vet Clinic, Alpharetta, GA.  770.475.8272. Monday-Friday 630AM to 9PM, Saturday & Sunday 8AM to 5PM.\n\n\n",

Hard to believe someone could treat me poorly but I was literally dumped in the country with all of my stuff-food bowls, food, crate, leash, etc... Some humans left me to fend for myself and while trying to get water from a creek, I fell in and couldn\u2019t get out. Finally, a hero came along- a human willing to wade into ice cold water and rescue me. A Good Samaritan came to my aid and held me while FPO worked on getting me into my new start at life. I am only around 2 years old and around 60lbs or so. They say I am a Rottweiler mix, which if you are a Rottie lover, you know that means I have a huge loving heart for my people. As typical with my breed, I tend to pick favorites in the home and I forget how big I am when I come to give my kisses and cuddles so I\u2019d be best suited in a home with breed experience. I love car rides, McDonald\u2019s cheese burgers, and gentle ear scratches. I like exploring the backyard so a secure fence is preferred to ensure my safety. Foster mom says I am this thing called \u201chousebroken and crate trained\u201d which is a silly way to say I know where to sleep, pee, and poop and keep a clean house. I am a little jealous with other pets right now so I am really looking for a home where I get to be center of attention. I try to be a tough girl but I\u2019m really just your typical Rottie Softie.\n\nOur adoption fee is $260 for dogs over 5 months of age and includes all vaccinations, spay/neuter, micro chip implantation and registration/transfer, heartworm test and much more. Puppies up to 5 months of age are $275 and this includes all sets of puppy vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip implantation and registration and more. To adopt, go to www.fosterpetoutreach.org to complete an application.\nPlease note: Foster Pet Outreach tries to limit our adoptions to an area within approximately 60 miles of Peoria, Illinois.",

Our phone number is 618-665-3005. The shelter is open to the public 1-3 Monday-Saturday. Sundays we are open 1-4 to the public. If those times don't work, please call to set up a time to visit.\n\nThe typical adoption fee for dogs is $150. It includes vaccination, deworming , spay/neuter, heartworm testing on dogs of age and microchipping, which is now mandatory by state law. Some dogs we discount to as little as $50 due to sponsorship. Some dogs we ask a higher adoption fee, which helps us recoup expenses on heartworm treatment on other dogs.\n\nAll cats are spayed/neutered/vaccinated/flea treated/dewormed and microchipped prior to adoption. Cat adoption fees range from $60-$100. We spay/neuter/microchip/vaccinate and deworm all kittens and cats, prior to adoption. Our shyer/less adoptable cats are classed as \"barn cats\" and are free with a completed/approved barn cat application, which can be found on our website.\n\nFor updates on adoption events and more pics of pets available, go to our website, www.claycountyshelter.com or look for us on Facebook.",

She gets very excited when she sees other dogs while on leash. Trainer Sue Riggiri is working with her on her reactivity, and Brownie is the recipient of a Handsome Dan's Rescue training grant meaning she goes home with FREE private training.\n\nInterested in Brownie? \nApply at handsomedansrescue.org\n\nThank you for choosing rescue!",

Of course we first stopped by McDonald's and got our breakfast, then we went down by the keeper of the plains. After a little sightseeing down there, we thought we would go visit the Veterans Memorial. Found us a nice little grassy spot to sit and eat our breakfast. Aurora is a sweet little thing, she rides in the car great she walks great, even walking by other dogs and bicyclist she was just happy to be out. A total sweetheart. Thanks for the morning Aurora\n\nAdoption Fee: $200 - Includes Spay/Neuter, Microchip, and UTD on all vaccines.",

If you would like to contribute to her care, please go to our website, www.helporphanpuppies.org.\n\nMeet Mae! Mae came to us with extensive medical needs. We treated Mae for heartworms (now officially negative). Mae also came to us with multiple masses and we had 12 of them removed. Finally, Mae has bullet fragments in her right front leg that we have decided not to remove per the recommendation of our vet.\n\nWe don't think many dogs are sweeter than our Mae!\n\nGiven Mae's advancing age, she needs a home that can allow her to go out every 3-4 hours. Also, Mae is a hound and as such she can be a typical vocal hound.\n\nMae is in a foster home with multiple other dogs and gets along with everyone, she even ignores the cat!\n\nMae is crate trained, housebroken, up to date on vaccines and spayed.\n\nWe believe Mae to be 10-12 years old.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Mae, please complete an application at our website, www.helporphanpuppies.org. Please note our adoption requirements and feel free to contact us with any questions.\n\nHelp Orphan Puppies is registered with the New York State Department of Agriculture and our registration number is RR047.",

We believe we can watch the freckles develop on his beautiful face.\n\nCharlie is an extremely shy boy, almost feral, who will need a home that has the time to dedicate to him.

Given this, Charlie will do best in a quieter home that has the time to dedicate to his continued exposure and training. In turn, you will be rewarded with the sweetest most loving puppy. Charlie would do best with no children or older children.\n\nCharlie is housebroken, crate trained, neutered and up to date on vaccines.\n\nCharlie's date of birth is 8/24/19.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Charlie, the first step is to complete an application at our website, www.helporphanpuppies.org.

She is fearful of new people at first but with love and patience she quickly bonds to her people\n\nCaity is in a foster home with several other dogs and gets along with everyone. Caity will quickly chase cats and therefore we would prefer to place her in a home without cats given her prey drive.\n\nCaity will need a loving and patient forever home. With a little kindness and patience, Caity will reward you with a loving and sweet companion. Given Caity's fear of humans, she will need a quieter home without children or older children over the age of 12. Caity would prefer to go to a home with another dog as she learns to trust humans by watching the other dogs in the home.\n\nCaity is house broken, spayed and up to date on vaccines.\n\nCaity's date of birth is 08.01.2013.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Caity, please complete an application at our website, www.helporphanpuppies.org. Please note our adoption requirements and feel free to contact us with any questions.\n\nHelp Orphan Puppies is registered with the New York State Department of Agriculture and our registration number is RR047.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Aren't I just gorgeous? I am not a good match for active small children - they make me nervous. I am a sweet boy, a bit shy at first. I need the companionship of another dog to bring out my best adorable personality. I love to play with my foster siblings. My favorite game is chasing the water hose. I love water so much, I may end up in the bath tub with you! I am up to date with vaccinations, neutered and microchipped so you can't loose me.\n\nKane was abandoned by his owner in the backyard when the family moved away. He was abandoned 2 times by the time he was 8 weeks old. He has bit of separation anxiety. he will need TLC but will be the best dog ever once he has gained confidence in your home. Small children are not appropriate for Kane.\nHe is looking for his forever family. Is that you?\n=========================================================\nPlease contact app@aarfhouston.org for more information about this dog. You can apply online by clicking on Application .\nPuppies that are under 4 months old cannot be adopted outside of our Veterinary Service area. Please call for specific locations. Children under 8 years old often are not a good match for our puppies and dogs. In order to protect both, your child and our rescued dogs/puppies from harm, we seldom if ever adopt to families with young children.\nOnce your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events. Thank you for considering a rescue! The adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you.",

He gets really excited and sometimes knocks tiny humans over, but hes a good, spunky boy. \nHe keeps his foster family entertained with his big goofy personaltiy. Chico is house trained, but he is working on his manners and could benefit from a basic obedience class. He is good with dogs and kids, but would be best suited to a home with older children that aren't easily knocked over. Could you be the perfect home for this silly boy?\n\nAdoption Fees is $300 for Adults This includes Spay/Neuter, lifetime Microchip, vaccinations up to date, Heartworm and Flea/tick prevention up to date.\n\nIf interested in meeting the rescue please fill out our application at https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/17336/generic",

He can fight over food or treats sometimes so we are looking for a home with no other dogs, cats, or animals. He could play all day long if you are open to it. He loves to zoomy around the backyard, so a secure fenced in yard will be a must in his new home. He can also jump a fence shorter than 6ft. He likes to play fetch and swim. \n\nGrinch now known as Luke entered a board and train in July 2020 for aggressive leash reactivity and high prey drive. He is eager to please and smart, so the right training investment will be worth it! The adopter will be responsible to continue training after adoption. \n\nGrinch/Luke will need a home who understand his needs. He will need an adopter that is aware that Grinch/Luke is a dog that will need patience and understanding. He will have to wear a muzzle on walks to protect the adopter as well as other people and pets. \n\nWe understand this is a very had bio to fit. We know that there is someone out there somewhere that Grinch/Luke can make happy and vice-versa. We just have to find them. Please help by sharing his story,",

            "description": "Friends to the Forlorn\nAdopt-a-BullBreed: Pit Bull Terrier Gender: Male Estimated Date of Birth: April 25, 2015 Size: 75 lbs Location: Powder Springs, GA\nRESCUING RUFUS\nRufus, formerly known as Ronald, found himself at Animal Control in a county where they don't adopt pit bulls out to the public - if they are not pulled by a licensed rescue organization, they are euthanized. Rufus has some large calluses on his joints and all his teeth were severely worn down to nubs. He contracted kennel cough and it quickly turned into pneumonia. Lucky for Rufus, a foster stepped up and he got his freedom ride on April 23, 2020. He was very sick and we started treating his kennel cough and pneumonia immediately with antibiotics and nebulizer treatments. Surprisingly enough, Rufus was heartworm negative! It took him a very long time to finally kick his upper respiratory infection, but after being on several antibiotics for several weeks, he's feeling much better.\nABOUT RUFUS\nRufus is a big, amazing guy. He is a laid back kind of guy that would rather be laying around taking a nap instead of chasing a ball. Rufus just wants to hang out with his people and lay on a big, comfy bed. He is gentle and walks well on a leash. Rufus has proved to be great with children and is not suited for a home with cats. This big lug is actually a bit scared of fireworks and thunderstorms too. With a proper introduction, we think he may do well with other dogs too. He seems to be okay, he just needs some extra time to decompress. He is now neutered, down to 1 pill a day and can stroll the neighborhood with the best of them! Rufus is just a massive love buy, a Class-A Cuddler and cannot get enough! Not in an annoying way, but in a syrupy sweet way. He's down for a nap anytime you're ready and snacks are always welcome!\n*Please check back for updates on this big, handsome boy!*\nPhoto Album of Rufus: https://www.facebook.com/pg/FriendsToTheForlornPitbullRescue/photos/?tab=album&album_id=3070213679703444\nOur adoption fee is $300. All dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, on heartworm prevention, and are fed top of the line grain-free food.www.savingpitbulls.org",

I love relaxing on a soft bed too and getting belly rubs! I'm great at finding ways to entertain myself with toys, creativity is my specialty. I think you would be quite impressed with the things I come up with. I had knee surgery on both my knees in the past but I'm fully recovered now. Everything works exactly as it should and it's a good thing too because I'm a natural athlete. I love to run and often run laps around the yard.\n\nI can get along with smaller female dogs but might be best as an only dog because I can be pretty selective about who I think is a friend. We can do introductions and see if we are a match.

I was born without the piece of my brain that helps me balance (*cerebellar hypoplasia), so I wiggle all over the place. Basically I just love to dance funky all the time! I'm probably gonna be famous soon, so you should adopt me before the pup-parazzi finds me and the whole world wants in on this cuteness. And don't worry, I'm not going to get any worse--I just need you to love me as I am: crazy dancer but always happy to see you. Bonus? I'm already crate trained. Just because I'm goofy doesn't mean I don't know how to behave! Contact Mayday if you'd like to meet me and I promise to show you all my moves!\n\nAli might be good with older children and would do best in a hone without other dogs.\n\n*Cerebellar hypoplasia is a permanent neurological condition that causes permanent balance and coordination issues. Cerebellar hypoplasia causes jerky movements, tremors and generally uncoordinated motion. The animal often falls down and has trouble walking. To manage this condition for your pet, it is vital that you understand your pet's physical limitations. As your pet may have difficulty controlling movement, you may need to assist your pet when eating and drinking. Providing your pet with a safe environment is essential. Due to the imbalance and wide stance, stairs and uneven ground may cause a hazard. A non-slip, flat surface, such as carpeting, is an ideal environment for your pet.*\n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please visit our site at www.maydaypitbullrescue.org or send us an email at info@maydaypitbullrescue.org",

            "description": "Ahoy mates, I'm Captain Wigglesworth! But as my future family, you can call me CW or Wigs or Wiggy for short. I'm pretty rad so I gotta have more than one cool nickname, right?! I have some tremors and I walk a little sloppy but don't you worry, the doc said I'm all good! I was born with cerebellar hypoplasia, which means I'm missing the part of my brain that would help me balance--thus the goofy walk. But it won't get worse and I won't need meds, so how's that for a win?!\n\nMy bestie Janey and I go everywhere together, she keeps me balanced. I'm a little shy meeting new people, but Janey helps me feel comfortable. And once I open up, I'm a happy, playful pup! Ready to take us home yet? Talk to Mayday and tell them you want to meet the cutest fella on the block! I get along with other dogs but Janey decides which ones, so also tell my Mayday peeps if we might have siblings at home. We're going to have so much fun together!\n\nJigs? Waney? Dude N' Tude? No matter what we title this dynamic duo, the key is that Janey and Wigs love being together and we can't bear to separate them. Janey's outgoing personality helps Wigs bridge the gap his shy demeanor can create with humans. And Wigs gives Janey the unfaltering love and companionship she craves, despite her bossy 'tude. They're both a little different and they embrace that, which is something we'd love to see more of in this world.\n\nCheck out my buddy Janey's profile to learn more about her!\n\nCaptain Wigglesworth has *cerebellar hypoplasia. **Cerebellar hypoplasia is a permanent neurological condition that causes permanent balance and coordination issues. Cerebellar hypoplasia causes jerky movements, tremors and generally uncoordinated motion. The animal often falls down and has trouble walking. To manage this condition for your pet, it is vital that you understand your pet's physical limitations. As your pet may have difficulty controlling movement, you may need to assist your pet when eating and drinking. Providing your pet with a safe environment is essential. Due to the imbalance and wide stance, stairs and uneven ground may cause a hazard. A non-slip, flat surface, such as carpeting, is an ideal environment for your pet.*\n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please check out our site at www.maydaypitbullrescue.org or email us at info@maydaypitbullrescue.org",

I'm mostly mellow, except when I get brief spurts of energy, and then I just want to run around doing zoomies. I may be an older gal, but that doesn't mean I've lost my spunk! My ears and tongue are always doing their own thing. They flop in so many different directions that my facial expressions will always make you laugh and smile. I may take a minute getting to trust you, as humans were not very kind to me previously, but once you have earned my trust, I become an affectionate goofball extraordinaire! I have a solid foundation of obedience which includes; sit, down, down stay, recall, place command, excellent leash manners, and I ride really well in a car. My adopters will receive included follow up training as well as a lifelong best friend. I can be dog selective so I need to be your one and only pup. I would also do best in a home with no young children as their movements can startle me. Being my owner will have some challenges, but they will be well worth the effort of gaining my love and trust! I'm deserving of a loving forever home. Will you be mine? Contact Mayday today to meet me so I can show you how loving I can be!\n\nIf you, or someone you know, are interested in adopting or fostering, please visit our site at www.maydaypitbullrescue.org or send us an email at info@maydaypitbullrescue.org",

Even my ears are spunky! Morning zoomie spins are my specialty! I twirl and swirl like a dainty ballerina, after she's had a cup of coffee! I love to have fun and will have you giggling more than you thought possible. I'm also really great at snuggly naps. Have some fluffy blankets? Count me in! And I won't chew on those blankets, I save it for my chew toys. I love cozying up close to my favorite people! I have bowed legs but do not require any surgery or medications. I would do best in a home without other animals as I want to be your one and only. Looking for an easy girl who is happy to hang out around home? It's me!! Contact Mayday today to find out more about me!\n\nIf you, or someone you know, are interested in adopting or fostering, please visit our site at www.maydaypitbullrescue.org or send us an email at info@maydaypitbullrescue.org",

I was born with deformed front legs so I walk more on my wrists, but it certainly doesn't stop me from climbing into your lap and into your heart or playing tug of war with toys. I'm curious, smart, friendly, happy, goofy, and like to lie on your feet. Kiddie-sized pools are my favorite way to cool off! I would love a home where I can lounge about chewing a toy and be the queen of the castle along with my best doggie pal, Captain Wigglesworth. We're an inseparable odd couple. Where I go, he goes. Even though I can be a little bossy with him and I get sassy with toys, he doesn't mind. He just does his own thing. I'm not potty trained yet, but I can learn.\n\nDog introductions are required because I can be selective on who I choose as a friend, which is why my bond with Wigs is so special. Contact Mayday today to meet me and my bestie and see how great we are together!\n\nJigs? Waney? Dude N' Tude? No matter what we title this dynamic duo, the key is that Janey and Wigs love being together and we can't bear to separate them. Janey's outgoing personality helps Wigs bridge the gap his shy demeanor can create with humans. And Wigs gives Janey the unfaltering love and companionship she craves, despite her bossy 'tude. They're both a little different and they embrace that, which is something we'd love to see more of in this world.\n\nCheck out my buddy's profile, Captain Wigglesworth, to find out more about him!\n\nIf you, or someone you know, are interested in adopting or fostering, please visit our site at www.maydaypitbullrescue.org or send us an email at info@maydaypitbullrescue.org",

I was born to sunbathe and play in the dirt. I have my own special way of walking since I have two legs. I can outrun you if i wanted to but I'd much rather have you love on me. Majestic, grace, resilience, affectionate, calm, happy, loving, survivor, and feisty are just some of my descriptors. I am paralyzed from the waist down so I have no control over my bladder or bowels and I dribble a bit when I walk. It's been a while since I tried a diaper, since I love being outside so much, it hasn't been necessary. I was rescued from Saudi Arabia where doctors believed I was hit by a car which left me paralyzed. I was left in the streets to fend for myself while dragging my legs until some kind people took me in and helped me heal. I am now ready to find my forever home where people will love me for how affectionate I am and not judge me based on how I look. I had a rough go of it but my resilience and will to live shine brighter than any diamond or star in the sky. Would you like to be greeted by my warm smile and affectionate gaze everyday when you come home? Email Mayday today!\n\n*As someone who knows Tinkerbell and has witnessed her love in person, I get goosebumps just thinking about how amazing this girl is. Nothing would bring me more happiness than seeing her in a home of her own. She has traveled from across the globe, been through hell and back, and it still amazes me every day how sweet she is. No other creature on this planet gives love like that of a rescued dog.*\n\nIf you, or someone you know, are interested in adopting or fostering, please visit our site at www.maydaypitbullrescue.org or send us an email at info@maydaypitbullrescue.org",

If living with another dog, a female would be best for Big D rather than another male dog. He is very affectionate and loves being petted. He still has some puppy behaviors like using his mouth in play, so any kids in his new home should be older. He is good on leash and keeps his kennel clean. He would enjoy an active life with his new family. No cats, please. \n\nHis adoption fee of $175 includes neuter, current vaccines, microchip, free vet visit, offer of 30 days of pet health insurance, and engraved ID tag.",

One of the things he would like most of all, though, is to have a new home to share with adults-only who are okay with his sure-footed confidence and support his somewhat quirky ways.\n\nThis super senior likes to take care of his things and appreciates it when his people are supportive of his need to safeguard his stuff. At the same time, Rudy will be happy to take care of you too! He'll join you on lovely walks and fun drives in the car, and, afterwards, kick back and relax with a cozy snuggle in your favorite chair.\n\nRudy is always up for a treat too!

Beware of her belly flops in the middle of the walk, sometimes she just needs a little break in the shade to muster up the energy to keep going! \n\nShe is a little weary when trusting men, but ladies, who isnt, am I right!? After warming up to you, she will be your loyal friend. She gets a long with other dogs and cats. She may be a little too much for children, so would prefer she go to an adult only home as she grows up a little more. \n\nOur sweet bundle of energy is ready for her forever home, can you take a chance on her? Apply for her today at www.allpawssafehaven.com",

She would be perfectly happy just getting pet all day long and just being by your side. She loves going on walks and saying \"Hi\" to all the neighbors. \n\nShe prefers to be the only pet in the house but makes up for it with all the kisses you can think of. She is a lazy bones who is perfectly content to lay around and watch your favorite soaps. However, take her out in the backyard and she will do a couple zoomies before lounging in the sun to work on her tan. This girl really is easy to please. \n\nGiGi lives in a foster home so the best way to get more information about her is to submit an application on our website, www.allpawssafehaven.com and her foster will be in touch!",

I can't wait to make a connection with you and be your best friend. Because I can get a little attached, I would appreciate a home where my people will be home often; I get nervous when I'm home alone. I really like to be outside and enjoy going for walks- as long as I'm with you! I can be selective with other dogs and cannot live with children. Because I am a special girl with some special needs, I'm still searching for my forever family. I know they are out there somewhere. Please call the Humane Society of North Iowa at 641-423-6241 for more information.\n\nAdoption fee covers the following veterinarian\u00a0services: spay/neuter surgery, age appropriate\u00a0vaccinations, flea and dewormer treatment, feline leukemia/FIV test in cats, and heartworm test for dogs.",

            "description": "Do you remember Buddy? We rescued him in 2016 after he was found laying in a ditch on the side of the road. A throw away dog from a dog fighting area. His ears were cut to base, he was emaciated and scared.\n\nWell, Buddy was adopted by his foster parents who love him dearly, but his issues with other animals and their young son has made it clear that he needs another home. Buddy needs a calm household with adults who realize that he has had a horrifying life and cannot handle a lot.\n\nBuddy is about 5 years old, he is healthy now and fully vetted. He is a laid back dog who loves to hang out on the couch with his humans. He is an awesome snuggle bug and loves leisurely walks and laying in the sun. He is a loyal dog whose bright blue eyes will capture your heart.\n\nBuddy needs a low energy home with no other animals and no kids. He has been so abused that he is has sensitivities some places on his body and this is something hard for kids to understand, so they have just never had him with kids for that reason.\n\nPlease help us share this sweet boy, after everything he has been through. He deserves his forever home.\n\nAdoption Application: https://rescuinganimalsinneed.org/dog-puppy-adoption-form/",

Some of my favorite hobbies include hanging out with people, getting petted by people, sharing snacks with people, taking a nap with people, playing with people...I think you get the point; I LOVE PEOPLE! While I'm a social butterfly with people, I can be a bit more selective with my dog friends and like to have a first date to make sure we'll get along. The great thing is I love little humans as much as big humans so a home with children would be great. One day, maybe next week, I'm gonna meet ya.

My name is Oakley and I am a 5 year old, 100lb. of handsome, Shepherd/hound mix fella.  I am a super smartie and know things like sit, shake, hug, and no.  I am also house trained.  Currently, I am working on figuring out this crate training stuff.  I need to be your only dog friend because I do not want to share you with any other doggo!  I also do not want to live in any apartments.  I am pretty good on a leash so we could have so much fun on some good walks or hikes.  For the most part, I am a chill, laid back kinda guy.  I have spurts of super fun playful energy as well which is perfect for playing some fun games together!  Last, but not least, I am a graduate of the Pups for Parole training program where I was a star student.  I would love if my new family could help continue my training so I can continue to be the best companion.  If you have fallen for me, like I have for you, it is time for you to fill out my adoption application!\n\n\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

Potential adopters must be able to come meet him!*\n\nPorter is a male blue pit mix who was pulled out of the overcrowded animal shelter in Roswell, NM in the nick of time. We just love him! He can be a bit shy around new people, but he warms up quickly and once he does, he is just the most loving dog! He is very gentle and loves to give kisses. Porter also does great with other dogs. He has even become the doggy uncle to several litters of pups that the rescue has taken in!\nPorter knows basic commands and completed a 2-week training program. He is a really nice dog who will make a great companion. Porter is currently in foster care and would love to find his forever home!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Porter, please email us at infodewpaws@gmail.com",

Don't let her age fool you, she's got sass and spunk in spades! Her manners are a work in progress, as she doesn't seem to have had much structure in her previous home. Whether her deafness played a role in lack of training, we can only speculate, but she's improving every day. While she lives with several dogs her size, she may prefer to be the queen of her castle. If you're looking for an active senior pup, Lily is your girl!\n\nPlease visit thankdogrescue.org/adopt to read about our adoption process and apply online.\n\nWe rarely adopt out of state and will consider NY, NJ, MA, RI only for our harder to place pups (those who have been in rescue for a while with zero or no interest).\n\nCheck out our Facebook page for news and updates!\nfacebook.com/thankdogrescue",

She needs someone that won\u2019t make her adjust to their lifestyle and someone that will be patient and gentle and loving and sweet and see her for who she is. A quiet home with experienced dog owners is what she's looking for. She would probably do best as an only dog in home and could have play dates with only sweet social males. Squirt will need some time to warm up to people but once she trusts you she'll promise to love you forever. \n\nTo adopt contact Lisa: 914-469-6605",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Dumpling is a 60-pound male Bulldog mix rescued in South Carolina, estimated to be two years old at the time of intake in May 2020. Poor Dumpling was excited for a camping trip with his family - he never expected they would go home and leave him behind. That was likely Dumpling's best day, however, because now he will go on to live a fantastic life in his real forever home this time. He will do best in a home in a semi-rural area with a fenced yard and an experienced owner who can continue to build on his training. Dumpling is potty trained, crate trained, leash trained and knows basic commands. He gets along well with other dogs, with proper introductions, and he is very receptive to training. No cats for Dumpling, thank you! Dumpling is still learning his size, so children with big dog experience would be best. He is a lover -- his kisses are quite sloppy--and he wants nothing more than all your attention & affection in return. If Dumpling is the pup you've been looking for, please apply online to adopt at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

I am a  young jack russell terrier chihuahua mix female about 1 yr old who was rescued with several other females from a hoarding situation in Riverside County.  I am the \"leader\" of the pack, so to speak in that i am the most courageous of the bunch but I am still very very shy and easily spooked.  I am small, @ 17 lbs, spayed and vaccinated.  Because I am so very shy and scared, I MUST go to a home with another low key dog or two I can pal around with and learn my manners.  I must also have a very secure yard and experienced dog owners, preferably with some experience with shy and nervous pups.  I am young and with some socialization, training and love could be just the most fabulous pup around.  Couldn't you make room in your home and your heart for a pretty little girl like me?\n\nIf you are interested in meeting me, please contact Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc. by email to dalrescue@sbcglobal.net.  Rescue asks that you complete and submit an adoption questionnaire, to make sure I would be a good fit for you and your home but once submitted and approved, arrangements can be made for you and your family and other dog(s) to come meet me.   I  will be scared, at first, i know but once I get to know you, I know we can be the best of friends.  So please do contact Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc. and ask about me, Sunny.\n\nTo learn more about Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc., a 501c3 non-profit charity, and to see all of our available dogs, please visit our website at www.dalrescuesocal.com.  You can also visit us on facebook at www.facebook.com\\spottyfriends.  We love seeing your posts about life with your spotty friends so please, keep them coming.  Thanks!",

I am still adjusting, but I have made some very good gains in just a little over a week. I have become adjusted to my crate and am doing a good job of coming out of it nicely. I am doing a much better job of getting in and out of the car and riding in it. I've got the stairs and the different floor surfaces in the house--no problems there. I love the outdoors and likely have little experience with indoors, but I am learning, and learning fast! The shelter reported no issues between me and other dogs, and I did well with the meet and greet with the resident male in my foster home. I am heart worm positive. The next step for me would be a foster-to-adopt (FTA) home with a nice, completely fenced in, 6-foot fenced back yard. I am a very good boy in the back yard. I do not dig or try to jump the fence, but  I really do like it outdoors. I am a fairly quiet dog. I may bark some at first, but I settle down quickly. My foster mom's neighbors have even commented about what a nice dog I am. I will be starting HW treatment the end of May, 2020. The ideal FTA home will work cooperatively with my current foster  mom to assure that I am transitioned at an appropriate point in my treatment.   \n\nABOUT PEACE 4 PITS RESCUE:\nPlease note that we do not have a facility or shelter where you can view adoptables. We are a foster-based rescue in Chicago-land, which means that each dog is placed with a family in the area. This allows us to better understand each dog's individual personalities. \n\nYou must complete an application before you can schedule a meet and greet with each animal. The application can be found here: http://peaceforpits.org/adoptionfoster-application/ or if you prefer a Word version, download it here: https://goo.gl/bKo84P and email it to p4papplications@gmail.com. Our adoption fee is typically $350 for an adult dog, and $400 for a dog under one year. It includes all vetting and spay/neuter.",

They have the same mothers but different fathers ;) Together they're 25-28 lbs of PURE SILLY SWEETNESS. Bo is very shy and skittish and scared of his own shadow so Ripley plays his big supportive brother. They need an ADULT ONLY home with someone that can work with Bo on being more confident. They are both good with other dogs and cats and are housebroken.. but they are NOT USED to walking on a leash so a FENCED IN YARD is a PRIORITY. They are darling buds and BFF's so double the trouble but double the fun and double the four legged love!!! **Because of Covid-19... we are only considering folks that are 20 miles away from Staten Island, NY\n\nFor an application - pls email: INFO@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"",

            "description": "Sassy Sasha is a special girl that over a year ago had some beautiful puppies that all got adopted. Sasha is estimated to be a 3-4 year old girl and currently weighs 60 pounds. We know she needs to shed a few pounds in time for swimsuit season and we are hoping that her new family will take her for the all important daily long walks to help trim her up (and the humans too). She came to us last almost a year ago through another rescue effort and they said she had given birth to her puppies underneath a house. She was a great mother and of course all the puppies got adopted easily leaving poor Sasha behind to wait anxiously for her own home. Critter Cavalry Rescue has stepped forward to help this rescued girl find a home. Now we are posting her plight far and wide. When you talk about personality we have to sayshe is so sweet but yet has some sassiness to her. She loves to get out and run and play with toys. She is used to the crate but would love to just have a cozy bed inside or be beside you. She loves to get in your lap or lay by you. She loves to play with younger dogs but is intimidated by dogs bigger than her. While we think she would be ok with another dog, we always say that the introduction made slowly and carefully is the best approach for her breed. We have videos of her playing with other dogs but if she feels threatened she will let the other dog know to back off. Her foster family adores this girl who has a big heart and a big desire to have her own home soon! Could that be yours? Please contact us at ccrtennessee@gmail.com if you would like to talk further about Sassy Sasha!",

He would love a home with a fenced in yard so he can cut loose and maintain his boyish figure. He's a big, strapping fellow, so we wouldn't place him in a home with pre-adolescent children that he might bump into. He loves to go for runs, loves the water and also loves to chill out in the yard or next to his people. He is house-trained and not destructive. We are requiring a home where someone is not gone 'all' day, as he spent most of his life as an 'outdoor' dog. His fosters adore him and quite frankly we're all a little stumped why he hasn't been scooped up...We do know that black dogs are often overlooked, and suspect that may be the case here...So take a closer look and maybe consider this sweet boy...Ryder is neutered, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped. Adoption donation is $250.If you would like to meet Ryder (or any of our dogs), please fill out an adoption application on www.maxxandme.org\nMaxx & Me is an all volunteer, all foster home rescue and do not have a shelter. Please allow at least 48 hours for applications to be processed (missing information may slow the process, so please take your time and be thoughtful in your answers). All dogs posted are available (so no need to ask). We place dogs based on best home for each dog and not order of applications received. Email us at maxxandmerescue@gmail.com for updates and questions. Thank you for choosing rescue.",

Luckily we were in time and could take him out of that hell . We rushed him to our vet where he received all the medical care . \n\nEVen now he only weighs 60 pounds . He has to be at least 90 pounds .We can not rush it . We have to prevent bloat but we are known for our extreme make overs . \n\nAyune is a 4 year old black shepherd who has a mix in him of dutch shepherd pr malinois . \n\nHe is extreme abused and is very timid . The first moment I saw him , he was just hiding in my arms with a look in his eyes please don't hurt me. It was heartbreaking . He did not leave my side so it was hard to take pictures . \n\nHe is very calm and we are looking for very SERIOUS adopters who wants to give this black pearl a forever home . Who understand what abuse and neglect means and who help him slowly gain his weight . \n\nAyune is scared of other dogs and does not like cats. \n\nHe is located in Middle Island . \n\nHe will be a wonderful dog to the right owner who shows him all the love of the world . \n\nTo become an approved adopter you have to fill in the adoption application to find on our website www.a-teameliterescuedogs.com or email us and we send you one .",

She\u2019s had urine burns at one point, dog fights at another, close to being euthanized at the shelter and she\u2019s just been all around let down. She is one of the best girls ever, for most people. She does occasionally leash bite but with a constant reminder and harnesses, she has the potential to do really well. She is fairly calm on her own, she doesn\u2019t approve of being in a crate but can be left out unattended if needed. We prefer to house her in a heavy duty crate.\n\nShe does have potential to be with another dog with very slow, steady intros but due to multiple attack\u2019s in the past.. she\u2019s slow to trust other dogs. She is really good with cats and absolutely adores children. She can go for walks without reacting to other dogs but enjoys her person overall. She is house trained and a complete cuddle expert.....she will never let you down with company for a night in. She\u2019s been let down so many times in the past and it shocks me how when she\u2019s truly a good girl. She knows multiple commands and is eager to learn more. She\u2019s very treat motivated as well.\n\nShe is really just looking for her forever place to crash, with someone who won\u2019t give up on her.\u00a0 If interested in more information please contact\u00a0Guardians for the Animals of Ohio Rescue or fill out an adoption application to meet Sahara.",

She was surrendered back to us on 1/8/21 because she wasn't a good fit for the family. When she originally entered the facility, the underside of her neck was treated for an abrasion caused by a choke chain that was too tight. Like all dogs, Fancy desires to be part of a pack. Sometimes slow to warm up, once she does, she forms a loyal bond. Fancy is a good walker and sits on command - but her willingness to follow commands and her demeanor are best among people she's used to. She'll fare best in a calm environment that provides her with a loving sense of security. Fancy's adoption fee is $150 and helps cover her spay, worming, vaccinations, microchip, monhtly heart worm, flea and tick preventive and care while at CCHS.",

Scout is very energetic, outgoing, and friendly. He loves to run and a large, fenced backyard would be best for him. He does fine with other dogs if introduced properly and likes to play rough and is dominant, so a non-dominant, playful dog who likes to go all-in on play would be an ideal fit if there is another dog in the home. Scout is very strong and pulls a lot on leash, so will need leash training. He can get rough during play, jumping up and getting mouthy but he is also a super smart dog who would do well with consistent, firm training. He is super sweet with people and will make someone a great dog.\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

            "description": "Tustin T. is an adorable large male German Shepherd Dog (GSD) that was surrendered to a shelter because the owner needed to move out of state and could not bring Tustin. Tustin lived with this same owner in the company of another GSD for most of his life. Tustin's owner attempted to find him a home before surrendering him to the shelter but the home he found had a cat. After a week Tustin was sent back to his owner because he could not ignore the cat. \n\nTustin is currently being fostered by a TSGSR volunteer who reports that he is sheer pleasure to live with. Tustin is very gentle, loves to be around people and is housetrained. He loves car rides, sticking his head out the window at slow speeds, and he likes taking short walks. Tustin is on medication for arthritis, so he's not your running companion but he will play a little tug-of-war with encouragement. He's not a picky eater, gently accepts treats, and doesn't beg at the dinner table. Tustin understands, \"sit,\" and \"here.\" If you want a stunningly gorgeous, gentle, well-mannered GSD to snuggle with and keep you company, Tustin is the boy for you. \n\nTustin T. Summary:\n- Tustin is a Male, 11 yrs old, weighs 90 lbs, shots current, house-trained\n- Good with Adults, children, most dogs and travel in the car\n- Not well suited to households with Cats & Small Dogs \n\nWhen Thulani Senior German Shepherd Rescue (TSGSR) arrived at the shelter to evaluate Tustin he was waiting for us near the shelter play yard. Tustin is an impressive and distinguished-looking dog. We also found him to be very attentive and respectful with us as we began our evaluation tests. While evaluating Tustin we focused on key behavior tests that have been found to be consistent with dogs that are safe in a family home. These tests include a check to see if the dog will guard or protect food or toys from people and a check to see if he will tolerate a full-body feel test that ends up touching most areas of his body (ears, snout, check of his teeth, lifting paws, gently pulling his tail, and much more...). Lastly, we always check to see if the dog can get along with other well-behaved dogs. This check is important since many Thulani Dog adopters already have an existing dog in their home.\n\nAt the shelter (and partly shown in the included video), Tustin got along with another large dog. Both dogs were initially excited, as expected, but quickly settled down as they walked along together. Although Tustin did bark a few times both dogs remained relaxed and never showed any signs of aggressive behavior during the meeting. During the full-body feel test, Tustin also did well allowing us to feel most areas of his body without incident...including his mouth and paws. When we were nearing the end of this test he seemed to think that we may have missed a spot and so he flipped over on his back so that we could finish the test by giving him a \"belly rub\". Good Boy Tustin! His final behavior test checks to assure that he does not guard or protect his food from people. Tustin was offered a high-value bowl of food and as he was eating he consistently let us remove the food before he had finished it without any over-reactions.\n\nTustin PASSED all the Thulani behavior tests and he has now become a Thulani Dog. \n\nThe shelter did suggest that since Tustin is an extra-large dog that he not be placed in a home with cats, small dogs, or small children to prevent the potential for unintended mishaps.\n\nWhat's Next for Tustin T.:\nThulani Senior German Shepherd Rescue (TSGSR) will continue to see that Tustin is well cared for and receives all medical care needed for his well being. In addition, TSGSR is beginning a search for an adoptive home that will care for him for the rest of his life. Tustin will come to his new home with a supply of food, a cushy pad if wanted, and other goodies such as toys. \n\nTustins medical expenses will be covered for the rest of his life by Thulani Senior German Shepherd Rescue (TSGSR)!\n\nIf you want to learn more about Tustin, or are possibly interested in providing an adoptive or foster home, please send us a message by clicking on the \"Ask About Me\" button. We will often get feedback or \"updates\" from a dog's foster home and as any updates become available they will be included here.\n\nIf you are reading about Tustin on Petfinder.com sometimes an available YouTube video is not listed.

            "description": "Shiba is a sweet Husky mix, born 10/09/2017. She is a vocal dog who loves to talk. Shiba gets along well with all people and other dogs, but she chases cats. She is playfull and especially enjoys stuffed animals. She is very good about notifying when she needs to go outside. Shiba needs a new home only because she was diagnosed with Addisons, and her former owner was unable to provide needed care. She requires a monthly shot and occasional medication for the rest of her life. Shiba needs an experienced dog owner, preferably one with prior Addisons experience.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Shiba is $250. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

Did we mention she likes to be RIGHT by your side? This makes walking Miss Nola an absolute dream! Nola loves to chase and catch a ball. She will bring it back to you over and over. In fact, she'll run after any toy you're willing to throw for her! She is crate trained and will wait patiently for you while you're away. This girl is eager to please! Nola is dog friendly and requires a home with a fenced in yard. She is up to date on vaccines, spayed and heartworm negative.

He may have had mange but was treated at the shelter and here and the vet found no trace of it from his last skin scrape which was at least two months ago. He definitely had yeast and does not do well with  food with chicken in it.  After medication and many medicated baths he actually looks like a dog now and has fur. He had quite an aroma when he first arrived and now just smells like a normal dog. With good nutrition and TLC he has come a long way. Other than terrorizing Sasha and stealing whatever toys she has, his other favorite pastime is eating.  He is very food and treat motivated and cannot contain his excitement. Rinni has a very sweet nature and disposition but because of his exuberance, appetite and size might not be good with small children. We have started the slow kill for his heart worms and will provide all medicine and instructions to the adopter.  If they prefer to do the quicker method we can discuss that with the adopters. If you would like to open up your heart and home to Rinni please fill out an application. \n\nLink to Application:\nhttp://www.gsdrescuectx.com/adoption-application.html\n",

            "description": "Fiesta is an English Coonhound who is approx. 3 years old and weighs about 50 pounds. She was found as a stray and no one came to claim her. Our guess is that she was a hunting dog who got away from or was turned out by her owner. Right now Fiesta is fearful of new situations and it doesn't seem like she has every lived in a house. Poor girl! She has learned to walk in and out of the house in her foster home and is sleeping in her crate at night. She can walk on a leash now but will jerk and try to run if she gets startled. \n\nFiesta will need an adopter who is patient and will love her for what she can become with training and time to adjust. A securely fenced in yard is a must, as she would be almost impossible to catch if she got loose. She absolutely adores other dogs and lives to run and play and romp around in the back yard! Fiesta is charming and engaged once she gets to know you. She would most likely be scared of loud, fast moving children. A quiet home with at least one other playful dog is what will make her happiest! \n\nWe believe that all dogs deserve a safe loving home who wants them. It's clear that Fiesta wasn't valued or well cared for. She is looking for a new family who knows what great companions  hounds can be!\n\n\nAdoption fee $150.00.  \nIncluded in Adoption: All dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated - Da2pp, Bordetella and Rabies, tested for HW/Lyme,  Dewormed and started on HW/Wormer monthly prevention (Interceptor Plus), and treated for flea/tick control (Advantix). Dogs are also micro-chipped and adoption includes lifetime registration. Also included in the adoption is 30 days of Pet First Pet Insurance, and Petco's Free Welcome to the Family Program. This program supports All New Pet Parents and offers Free resources, more than $650 in savings and 24/7 support.\n\nApply online:\nhttps://www.highlandcountyhumanesociety.org/available-animals/ \n\nTo contact us, please send an email or FB message to:\nEmail: info@highlandcountyhumanesociety.org\nWebsite: www.highlandcountyhumanesociety.org\nFaceBook: www.facebook.com/HighlandHumane\n\nHCHS is 100% foster and volunteer based (no staff, no employees). All animals for adoption are in foster homes and can be seen by appointment suitable to your schedule. Our volunteers may be able to help with local transportation.\nSave a life!  ~ADOPT~ \n",

She is incredibly sweet and playful; she just needs some time to settle down and learn more manners. She will be a great companion. Roxy is very playful. She enjoys her toys and likes running in the yard. She also likes to go for drives. She can be protective and predatory of her things though. All she needs is a little training, assurance, and lots of love. Roxy has plenty to give back.\n\nShe is crate-trained. She is fully vetted, spayed, tested heartworm negative and microchipped.\n\nPlease visit Regard4Life Animal Rescue at Petsmart in Longview on Saturdays for more information.

Seems to have had a very rough start in life,but she's a sweetheart.Very sweet. Loves people and other dogs. Her favorite thing is food!She is very inquisitive and energetic. Definitely follows her nose looking for food.She needs a patient,loving family to give her the comfortable retirement she deserves.\n\nIf the animal is under the age of 3 years old or has health issues, a vet reference is required which means you must own a pet or have owned a pet in your name.\n\nAdoption fee of $250 covers all vetting including spay/neuter surgery, vaccines, microchip heartworm test and treatment if needed and any other medical that may be required while in rescue. \n\nWe only do adoptions on Saturday and not all animals are able to attend so if you would like to see a specific animal please let us know so that we can make arrangements for it to be present at the event. Event locations do vary so please check the homepage to find out where we will be this week. Please do not ask us to reduce adoption fees since all fees help us to cover medical expenses for all of our animals, some of which can be very expensive.  Saving lives is not cheap so thank you for your understanding and helping us save as many as possible.\n\nPlease email lowcountryanimalrescue@ymail.com for an application.",

He needs an experienced person who will work on his obedience training as he will test his boundries. He would do well in an active home where he can exert his energy which in turn makes him a happy boy. He is good with other dogs but would do best as the only male dog in the home. He should go to a home with no small children. \n\nDogos are a wonderful breed but we urge anyone interested to dig in and do a lot of research before deciding if they are a good fit for your home. They require a lot of attention and training with them never ends!  Boundaries must be enforced and they often need reminders as they push past boundaires you set! Dogos are loving, kind and gentle but don't mistake that for weakness because they are equally powerful and intense as well! Everyone in the home must be on board with having a dogo and play a major role in their daily routines and training. Yes it is work, but the rewards are ten-fold! Lazy homes don't work for dogos as they need stimulation, exercise, and lots of attention too during their younger years.  Our goal in rescue is to be as transparent as we can about each and every dog plus make sure new families really understand the needs of a dogo!\n\nDash says you can check out the rest of his profile here::\nhttps://v3.petstablished.com/pets/public/663229?awo=DC+Dogos%2C+Inc&widget=false\n",

It can be a bone, a toy, a dog house and even a room in a house.\nHe was adopted to a home with children and another dog.  The dad wanted a jogging partner and Dewey was happy to go jogging with him.  Dewey got along with the family's other dog.  Dewey loved the kids.  Then Dewey decided that the boy's bedroom was his and he began barking and growling when they tried to enter the room.  The mother was the only one able to remove him from the bedroom.  Once out of the room, Dewey went back to being the dog that got along with every one.\nWith the right person willing to work with his issues, Dewey would make a great pet.\nHis adoption fee is $100.00.",

One of my favorites are meatballs ! \nI\u2019m about 50-55 lbs and about 4 years old. \nI rarely bark and have excellent kennel manners. \nI like to meet new people slowly and get to know you a little. \nNo young kids for me because I have never known any so teens and up would be best. \nI\u2019m so glad I am getting to meet everyone and I look forward to leaving the shelter and starting my new life soon. ! \nLesliem147@gmail.com\n201-981-3215",

Mr. Jenkins is kennel trained, walks well on a leash, and loves cuddles. Mr. Jenkins was running loose for quite some time before making his way to Tri City Animal Control where we pulled him from. Because of his days as a free spirit, it is very important to us that Mr. Jenkins\u2019s forever home have a securely fenced yard. Despite living on his own for some time, Mr. Jenkins is super cuddly and sweet and enjoys his time with people. Applications for this sweet man can be accessed at www.mikeyschance.com.\n\n\nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter. Applications can take up to 3 weeks to process. Application submission DO NOT guarantee approval for adoption.",

            "description": "Please meet Diamond! She is 2 \u00bd years old, and even though she has already had one litter, she\u2019s been spayed, is current on her vaccines, and is crate trained. We think her mix is Boxer and Staffy, but we aren\u2019t certain about that. What we are certain of is that she\u2019s pretty darn awesome!\n\nIn her foster home, Diamond has gotten along great with the animals who live there, including a male dog and a cat. She is incredibly gentle with them. Diamond has been around kids of all ages but prefers older ones (over the age of 10) who know how to be gentle. Ideally, she prefers a quiet household with not much activity, as her favorite activity is curling up on the couch and having her belly scratched!\n\nDiamond isn\u2019t all that big into playing fetch, but with some time she\u2019d probably learn to love it. She does, however, love to play with other dogs! We believe Diamond\u2019s ideal forever home would be one with another dog (preferably male) who she can learn from and who can help her build up her confidence. She would also thrive as the princess of her own palace as well. Having a buddy in her foster home has taken a lot of pressure off her, and she\u2019s proven to be very observant and picks up on things quickly. Diamond has been extremely respectful of the resident dog\u2019s space when he\u2019s not interested in spending time with her; she knows to back off and give him space or find her own space to just chill.\n\nDiamond prefers to nap and chill out on a couch or comfy chair, and loves to cuddle with her humans, but loves to sleep at night in a crate or kennel. It is her safe, protected space. Diamond has proven herself to be well-behaved in the home and doesn\u2019t chew on or scratch any furniture or household items. She will bark though when she\u2019s fearful of someone new coming into or near the home. She\u2019ll need a strong leader in her forever home who can show her that she doesn\u2019t need to be afraid of visitors or even the mailman. With time, patience, and consistency she will trust her caregivers and her new surroundings.\n\nDiamond knows some basic obedience skills, such as sit, stay, and come. Because she\u2019s food motivated and a quick learner, she\u2019ll be fully capable of learning many more skills. She is great at mealtimes (no begging at the table) and sits and waits for her food to be prepared and served, only eating when she\u2019s told it\u2019s \u201cokay\u201d!\n\nDiamond loves walks and seeing the outside world. She is great on-leash and is a very pleasant walking buddy. On hikes in particular, she does very well off-leash, staying close to her companion.\n\nDiamond is a huge cuddle bug once she gets to know and trust her people. If there is a soft space (or even not a soft spot) she will wiggle her way into your lap or perfectly within belly-scratching reach. \n\nWhile she is only about 40 pounds, Diamond has a huge heart and the personality of a big dog. Her long tail results in her entire body wiggling whenever she is excited to see you or anyone she loves; it truly is heartwarming to see. \n\nThis young lady is quite the catch and will make a wonderful addition to a couple or a small family who can provide her the patience and time she\u2019ll need to fall in love with you. Don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t take long! If you think Diamond is the girl you\u2019ve been waiting for, please let us know by submitting an adoption application \u2013 https://www.mustluvboxersrescue.com/adopt.",

No men.*\n\nThese two are going to need a very special home, and we hope to keep them together. This is what we shared about them a few days after they arrived with a few edits.\n\nAt first, they were terrified. Honeybee didn\u2019t move from her bed for 2 days.  Slowly, but surely, they came out of their shell, and now they are the sweetest lapdogs you\u2019ll ever meet. They still have some timid moments and quirks, but if you\u2019re patient, they will be the best companions ever. We will provide very specific instructions for transitioning them and letting them decompress. PLEASE do not expect a perfect experience on the front end.\n\nHoneybee has a more outgoing personality. She is a busybody and will go around the house to collect your shoes and socks. She will smother you with hugs and kisses if you let her, and likes to burrow in your chest and armpit. ??????\n\nLadybug is more submissive. She loves being loved, but she usually stands back and observes. She doesn\u2019t meddle and listens well. She loves a good belly rub.\n\nNeither of them have ever had on collars or leashes. We have tried to take them out on leashes several times and they won\u2019t budge. Honeybee has pogo sticks for legs and can clear just about any pen or fence. For this reason, we are requiring their adopters have a fence and NEVER leave them unsupervised. Neither of them like men, but rightfully so, as they were mistreated by a male neighbor. Unfortunately, they cannot go to a home with a full-time male resident. No small children, please. They\u2019re alert dogs, so you can expect barking at strangers. \n\nWe were told they\u2019re a year old. Ladybug looks like a Schnauzer mix and Honeybee looks like a Yorkie mix. They are spayed, vaccinated, current on flea/tick/heartworm prevention and microchipped. They are both heartworm negative. They sleep quietly in a crate together at night and have been using potty pads.\n\nInbox us to request an application. We are happy to answer any questions you may have as well.",

            "description": "GOOD with dogs, GOOD with kids 10+, NO cats\n\nADOPTION FEE $400   www.unbreakabull.com/adopt\n\nHey there world!! My name is Frenchie, and I am 2 years old. I came into the shelter after I was removed from a situation where our living conditions were not very good or safe. I came in with my two girls pups, and they have already been adopted and are doing great, so I am waiting for my turn. I am as sweet as can be, love to go on walks, and I am a champion snuggler. I let you know when I have to go out and go potty, am learning to play, and am learning to just be a dog. I have a lot of energy as I am learning that being a free dog is the most amazing thing in the world, so if you are someone that has an active lifestyle, I am the gal for you!! While I love sitting on the couch and hanging out, I would much rather have some true outdoor exercise time. I do good with kids, but I need them to be older kids because little kids make me nervous. I see them as unpredictable, and so that makes me nervous and I bark at them. I am working at not jumping on people when I greet them. I know that I can get a handle on this, but I\u2019m a work in progress on this. When it comes to cats, I like to chase them. I love to try and catch squirrels and rabbits as well, but I am never successful in catching any of these animals. They are really fast, but because I like to chase them, I was told that my house couldn\u2019t have any cats. Most of all, I am looking forward to just forever being someone\u2019s best friend. If you think that you could be that person that shows me the good life for the rest of my life, head on over and fill out my application to come and meet me!! Until I hear from you, I\u2019m just going to be soaking up the comfy couch for a bit and then asking for a good walk.  See you soon!!! Love, Frenchie (UPDATED 12/09/20) \n\n",

She has set Turbo in his place a few times, which he needed, and he respects her now.  They get along great now.\n\nPlease call 719-587-9663 for a telephone interview to set up an appointment to visit with Chloe.",

She has been seen by many individuals and many have tried to help her but she wouldn't let anyone close to her. Ruby has been a mother many times and some of her puppies have been rescued. Recently her litter of pups died and our rescue efforts turned to traping her. After several days, she was caught and the process of vetting and building trust began. Although she didn't trust us, she never showed her teeth or growled. She is fully vetted and ready for a forever home. Check out her video on her webpage to see her personality. She does enjoy playing now, something that took several months.Looking for a super special home for this girl. With a one on one situation, we believe that she will build the trust she needs to be a companion. She does well with other dogs, so a home with another dog might help her adjust as well. Cats are not her friends. She will need a secure fenced yard as she is still considered a flight risk. Micro-chippedAdoption Fee: $150",

She experienced one of her very lucky days recently when one of our volunteers rescued her from a local shelter. She is so happy to have been 'saved'. She is now looking forward to the next lucky day in her journey when she is adopted by her new forever family. ABBIE is best suited for someone who can be with her throughout most of the day. She would benefit greatly from someone who can provide her with lots of love and attention, while also providing firm guidance. The Adoption Fee for ABBIE is $225 and includes spay, up-to-date vaccines, teeth cleaning, and microchip with registration. If you would like to fulfill ABBIE'S ultimate dream of a new life in a wonderful forever home, please fill out an application. We are located in the High Desert, Phelan, next to Victorville and Hesperia. I will do best with no small children.",

            "description": "Hi, it is me... Travis!\n\nYes, I am adorable\u2026it is true! But I am also difficult.  Are you in interested in adopting me? Please make sure you read the entire dating profile below before inquiring or applying for me.  These humans want what is best for me so they are not going to compromise on finding me my perfect furever home.  \n\nYou have probably seen me around here. I have been in boarding school where they worked with me to desensitize me from some previous trauma. I graduated and am ready for a family of my very own.\n\nThe humans in my family need to have schedules and routines (believe me\u2026 I know what time it is so d not try to lie to me) and yet be kind and patient (Did I tell you, I had a rough start to life?)  I have lots of energy and need walks or runs (I walk or run my foster mom 6-9 miles every day!  After that I have to take her home because she gets tired but I STILL have energy to play) and playtime in a fenced yard (but only if you are out there with me) or in the house every day. I like to push boundaries (no means yes, right?) so I need people who have good discipline and are not afraid to tell me no. I need people who will take the time to get to know me and my specific needs until I trust you.\n\nThe furry friends in my family should like to play and above all else will tell me no if I get out of hand.\n\nMy furever family:\n\n\u2022will be an all-adult household with no contact with children (living in the house or visiting).\n\u2022will not have a cat or any other small creature to stalk and catch.\n\u2022will be a Westie (or similar) experienced household.\n\u2022will have experience with \u201cdifficult\u201d personalities and will follow the guidance of the trainer and rescue.\n\u2022will not put me in situations with humans I does not know and trust, such as dog parks or public patios.\n\u2022will live within 4 hours of Houston, TX to minimize stress during travel and transition.\n\n* Please note: Travis is safe with us and will stay that way until the right forever home is found. We absolutely will not consider a home in which he will come in contact with children nor one without the required experience.\n\nTravis is 2 years old and has been fully vaccinated, neutered, and microchipped. His adoption donation is $450 which includes 6 months heartworm preventative meds, free microchip registration, and a safety harness.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Travis, please review the adoption process and fill out the application on our website: www.wsrh.com. *** Please describe your experience with dogs with behavioral issues.\n\nAll dogs are available until \u201cAdoption Pending\u201d is noted next to their names. WSRH DOES NOT HAVE A PUBLIC SHELTER. ALL OF OUR DOGS ARE FOSTERED IN PRIVATE HOMES. Approved adopters only will be invited to meet the dogs.",

He needs a home with no children or other animals at this time (other large dogs may be good companions for him with slow and proper introduction). Free training and support will be provided for the remainder of Doss\u2019 life. This is a wonderful opportunity for any experienced handler looking to adopt a loyal companion. \n\nDoss would thrive with a calm, steady person preferably with breed experience and someone who does not expect to take him \"out and about\" all the time because he is cautious about and sometimes reactive to the world around him. He is a big, strong dog and needs a handler that can physically control him if necessary.\n\nDoss is attending a Board & Train program where it\u2019s been confirmed that he is an \"energy sponge\", meaning whatever vibes are happening he is soaking in. He is also hyper aware of distant noises and sights. He needs someone who is willing to work with him and help him relax and keep his mind calm. His new adopters will be expected to implement what he has learned and continue this daily routine in his new home environment. \n\nThe things we continue to work on are: 1. reactivity on leash, mostly towards dogs, occasional humans 2. reactivity in the home to strangers and the energy of other dogs and people and 3. Nervous energy toward new people, places, and things.\n\nDoss is an extremely loyal and loving dog but you must be committed to earning his trust and respect. He pushes boundaries until he knows that he can\u2019t get away with it anymore. If you are a disciplined and committed person, then you might be the right human for Doss. \n\nIf you\u2019d like to meet Doss or if you have any questions about this boy, then please email the.underdogs.tail@gmail.com and fill out an application through www.apollosarc.org",

Rodeo is completely deaf and relies on facial and hand gestures from his people to know what is going on. Rodeo does well with other dogs and can be a bit over the top with his play when he hasn't had any outside time for the day. Rodeo loves to jump on and play with agility equipment. Rodeo is about 60lbs and 2 years old. Rodeo requires at least one visit before adoption. Because he is deaf, he requires a level 2 handler.\n\nVideos of Rodeo:\n\nVideo 1\n\nVideo 2\n\nWe ask for a $200 donation for all of our adult dogs.

Well if you do, you may want to check out our girl... whoops I meant lady.\nLady is a older gal who came to us from Miami-Dade Animal Services (MDAS) on October 1st, 2019. She didn\u2019t stand much of a chance there due to her age, the marks if an embedded collar, and the fact that she was heartworm positive. It\u2019s been a long 7 months of keeping this strong energetic lady as calm as possible during her heartworm treatment. She will be taking a visit to the vet hopefully soon and paws crossed that her heartworm test comes out negative. If all goes well, she\u2019ll be needing a home of her own! It may seem easy but this approx. 10 year old girl needs a strong handler, an outlet for her energy, and to be the only pet in the household as she doesn\u2019t do well with others. Hopefully, we can find the right family for her unless that may be you?\nIf you or anyone has any questions, feel free to ask or if you\u2019re interested in adopting Lady, you can fill out our adoption application in the link below!\nhttps://form.jotform.us/81468545084161\n\n*Transportation is provided to approved adopters anywhere in the state of Florida!",

Please EMAIL apassionforpaws@gmail.com and wait for confirmation of your appointment before coming to visit the Akita Ranch. We also request that visitors wear masks. Happy Husky mix! Needs breed experienced home\n\nRico is a fun loving boy who is learning what life has to offer. For the first year or so of his life, he lived in an apartment in Las Vegas. Not exactly the best environment for a snow dog that loves to run. He didn't get much training and went through a teenage phase where he was jumpy, mouthy but we have seen him change so much while he has been in a stable environment! We are working with him to determine where he would fit in best, but we definitely know that his new home needs to provide him with ample exercise. He is also learning that he doesn't have to guard his food because his new home will make sure that he always has plenty to eat. He loves to play with toys and sometimes tries to hide them under the dirt in the yard but doesn't get upset if you unearth his treasures. He LOVES the water and splashing in his pool while playing fence chase with another dog!! He would do well in an active single adult or couple home with breed experience and the ability to work with him to continue his training. He is a big gushy sweetheart who will now have the chance for a wonderful life!!\nEmail:apassionforpaws@gmail.com for adoption information\n\nVisit Akita Ranch 28930 Ellis Ave, Romoland, CA, Open 10-5 daily BY APPOINTMENT ONLY.

            "description": "Hi guys I am back on the market, so to speak.  I am Kronos, I just turned 2 years old on May the 5th, 2020.  I am a Shepherd-hound mix but look like a gorgeous hound dog.  And in typical hound fashion, I sound like one too.  \n\nI had a rough childhood having had 3 hernia repairs before I was 6 months old, but that just means my humans are my best friends.  I have a fat pocket on my belly that my mom calls my bump.  If I am the dog for you, and let\u2019s face it I sure can be, my care includes checking my bump daily for any change in size or to see if it becomes hard.  I also need to be seen by a vet 2 times a year for a check on it along with ultrasounds as needed.  Mother Nature played a trick on me and didn\u2019t give me all the stomach muscles I needed.  My hips are weak, I have moderate bilateral hip dysplasia and this will need to be monitored closely and will need pain meds on and off so routine vet visits are a must. But it's no big deal  (just means while I can jump on the couch, I can\u2019t jump on the bed with you.  But a ramp or steps work great for that.  )  You don\u2019t want to sleep with me? That\u2019s fine I will gladly sleep on the couch.  \n\nI am crated trained but I can be trusted to stay out of it, as I am not super crazy about being in one.  I am house broken and also pad trained.  \n\nI am a proud graduate of the New Leash on Life program and I know sit, lay down, high five, stay, and come.  Put me on your left side on a leash and I will heel so well a child can walk me.  I don\u2019t like cats at all and need to have a submissive doggie sibling that isn\u2019t bigger than I am please.  \n\nOne last thing, I weigh 78 lbs, and look overweight but it\u2019s just the lack of muscles.  \n\nI adore children I need a respectful child that understands my needs.  I can be kinda clumsy and might knock a toddler over by accident .   \n\nI'm so ready to find out who is going to be my forever family.  Could that be you??\n\nAdoption Fee $150\n\nPost for Lori M",

Khalid came to us from the streets of Homestead on October 13th, 2019 carrying a bag of garbage he had found. He was very emaciated to the point his skin was tight against his skull and rib cage, all you could see was skin and bones. It took some time to get him filled in and healthy. We believe he\u2019s 2-4 years old. Not sure how he is with kids as he never interacted with them while in our care. He\u2019s dog selective and if another dog is around his food he becomes food aggressive which is not his fault since he had to probably fight other strays over food to survive. Other than that he is crate trained and a bit of a shy boy but he\u2019ll warm up over time. If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask or if you\u2019re interested in adopting Khalid, you can fill out our adoption application in the link below!\nhttps://form.jotform.us/81468545084161\n\n*Transportation is provided to approved adopters anywhere in the state of Florida!",

            "description": "BEAUTIFUL HONEY BUN IS LOOKING FOR A HEART TO STEAL AND A FUREVER HOME OF HER OWN!!!\nHoney is an 8 old female mixed breed that lives up to her name! She loves all people and is as sweet as honey! She is a petite little girl at 46lbs. Judging by her condition when she entered the shelter Honey wasn't well cared for and was a puppy making machine!  She entered the shelter on 3/16/19 and was found as a stray wandering the streets of New Port Richey forced to fend for herself. I suspect, once Honey's owners were done with her and she couldn't provide them with any more puppies, she was left to survive on her own. This girl was super sick with pneumonia when we pulled her from the shelter. Her condition made you want to cry for her! She just looked completely miserable. But Honey is a fighter and she is fully recovered! The one thing that never changed through all of this is her love of people and her sweet and gentle disposition! Honey is spayed, microchipped and current on all her vaccines. She walks very well on a leash, and is a very easy going, lower energy girl. I suspect she had lived in a home before she was found, as she knows the comforts of a home, she knows come, sit and gently gives you both paws. She is also a big fan of treats! Her absolute favorite activity is being a velcro dog. She just wants a lap to lay in and to soak up all your love! Because I suspect Honey may have been forced to breed, she is not a fan of other dogs and would do best as the only pet in a home. She does well in her crate and is completely housebroken. If you are interested in adopting Honey Bun please contact me asap to schedule a meet and greet! I guarantee she will steal your heart like she does everyone she meets! You can call or text Danielle Nielson at 727.946.6428.",

Popeye has proved to be a delightful house guest and he is a smart cookie who knows Sit, Leave It, Off, Stay, Down, and Shake. He is completely housetrained and gets along wonderfully with humans of all ages. Popeye is a handsome, goofy, young, friendly, happy and playful guy with a lot of love to give. Popeye is a romantic guy, ready for long walks on the beach followed by a quiet snuggle session. Popeye is great on a leash and has an easy-going demeanor. He is also an athletic boy and would make a great hiking and running partner. He currently hikes regularly with our volunteers and is great at keeping pace! Popeye is ready for someone to take him home and love him forever. In the meantime, this 70-pound lover will continue to charm his way into our staff members' hearts!\n\nIf you'd like to meet Popeye, please copy & paste the following URL into your browser: http://www.thebarkinglotrescue.com/adoption-application.

            "description": "This handsome boy is Meritt. And yes, he is just as sweet as he is handsome. Meritt was found as a stray in December of 2015 and brought to the shelter. He's about 3 years old, a perfect #LoveMebreed, and beyond ready to find his family. Our sweet boy is a big 'ol boy, with a heart bigger than he is. He still enjoys toys as much as he did when he came to us, and he is very entertained with toys. But his favorite activity is romping and playing outside on a beautiful day. He is still very puppy-like when he's outside in his play yard, running and playing with everything he has in him. Meritt is pure joy to be around and we can only imagine how awesome he would be if given the chance to live in a normal home with a loving family. Please consider coming to meet this special baby, chances are he is exactly what you are looking for.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet, please visit www.carams.org for information on our Adoption Process and to fill out an online adoption application.\n\nBreed identification by visual means is unreliable for most dogs. We are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. Each dog at CARA is an individual and we do our best to describe each animal based on personality, not by breed label.",

He needs some help with social skills and trust, but is slowly warming up. He prefers to keep a regular schedule to avoid accidents in the house and food aggression issues. He likes to sleep under the blankets in true dachshund fashion and is starting to show interest in toys. \n\nThis little boy has lots of love to give as long as you're patient enough to wait for him to feel comfortable. He was owner surrendered to the shelter for biting his owners, but we suspect he may have been abused there. \n\n* Friendly with all dogs, big or small! \n* Hasn\u2019t had much exposure to cats but was indifferent when one was in a carrier next to him. \n* Not good with children\n* Mix between both energetic and calm\n* Cuddly and loves to snuggle\n* Cautious of strangers, can take a while to warm up but once he does, he's loving\n* Loves to go for car rides\n* Likes to be held once he warms up to you\n* Sleeps under the covers in his foster mom's bed \n* Likes to play with squeaky toys and stuffed animals, will play tug of war and chew on dog bones and toys but not your personal belongings!\n* Has occasional accidents but does well if taken out on a schedule\n* Knows how to Sit\n* Although we cannot safely take away toys or food from Winnie, when presented with another option he will happily trade. So if he is caught chewing on/playing with something he shouldn\u2019t be and we offer him a dog toy instead, he will take that with no fuss. \n\nWinston is neutered, up to date on vaccinations, and heartworm negative. He is current on heartworm/flea prevention. \n\nApply to adopt at:\nhttps://form.jotform.com/92846379021159",

The shelter thought she was pregnant and she had limited time til they were going to spay/abort her puppies. We took her the same day to our veterinarian and it turned out she was not pregnant but she has been bred in the past. Sally is 3 years old, very sweet & loving. She gets along great with people, but NOT kids, other dogs & cats. She is mostly on the calm side but occasionally has her little bursts of energy. She enjoys cuddles, belly rubs, short walks and car rides. Sally will need help getting in and out of the car due to her short legs so we don't recommend a house with stairs as she'll hurt herself. She is leash trained and she barely pulls on the leash.\nIf anyone has any questions, feel free to ask or if you're interested in adopting Sally, you can fill out our adoption application in the link below!\nhttps://form.jotform.us/81468545084161\n\n*Transportation is provided to approved adopters anywhere in the state of Florida!",

Our local volunteer found her tight on a tree with a heavy chain . \n\nThe owner who left her whole her life in snow , rain , hot sun outside did not care and was happy to get rid of her . \n\nAmelina was so relieved when the heavy chain came from her neck but she was also very afraid . What did those strangers wanted from her ? \n\nWe brought her to our vet in San Antonio where she received for the first time in her life medical care . \n\nWhen she was ready we brought her to NY where she is now located in Middle Island . \n\nShe is around 2.5 years old . Is a little bit smaller then it looks like on the picture . is afraid of other dogs and does not like cats . \n\nWe are looking for a nice family who has the patience to give her some time and understand that she is severe neglected. She will warm up to you but is afraid . \n\nWould you like to open your home for her and make her your new family member then please apply by going to our website www.a-teameliterescuedogs.com and fill in the adoption application or email us and we send you one",

            "description": "Note: Dogs are pack animals and do not do well away from other members of their pack. The adopter is the alpha member of the pack, and the dog or puppy needs as much one-on-one contact with the alpha as possible. For this reason, all Route 66 Rescue Inc. dogs are adopted to inside homes only. They must be on leash, or inside a secure fence when outside, and not left outside alone when no one is home. Invisible fencing does not qualify as protection since other animals and strangers have access to the dog. The dogs must be returned to Route 66 Rescue, Inc. if ever given up by the adopter. Thank you for understanding we want only the best for the dogs you give a forever home.\n\nThis is one of the sweetest girls you will ever meet.  She is a large, brindle, mixed breed girl.  I see a little Dane in her, but others don't see it.  She is quiet and respectful and loves people.  She would be better as an only dog although she does tolerate others.  We are looking for an adult home for Rosie.   She was born on 5/07/2017, and on 5/06/2020, she weighed 66.1 pounds.  Her adoption fee is $200.\n \nPlease complete and return the adoption application to meet Rosie, or any of our adoptable dogs.\nhttp://www.route66rescueinc.com/adoption-application.html Thank you for visiting our site. Please come back often.",

His left ear always flops to the right, which adds more character to his already endearing and expressive face!\n Hugo Lionheart loves love! \nHe has such a fantastic personality: very friendly and affectionate, curious, playful, and extremely intelligent. Hugo is wonderfully eager to please, especially after a good play session and with some good treats.\nThis boy is friendly to everyone he meets, dogs and kids included, although has not been around cats.\nHugo needs walks and exercise like any big boy, but does love to settle in with a good chew toy wherever you are. A sturdy fenced yard would be a plus, but he is used to getting most of his exercise on a leash and does a lot of his playtime with toys in the house. He's a 'play hard, rest hard' kind of boy; by no means an endurance athlete. He will sploot flat on his belly wherever his is when he needs a break \nRegular walks and play will be key to his success as a good house companion. He does well with routine and structure and needs a home that will provide regular quiet time in his kennel, where he is calm and content. Leash manners are mostly good, and he is highly motivated by treats.\nHugo is a very strong chewer and needs toys designed for his kind of play . He loves his food and toys, but is gentle and willing to give them up to his person without complaint. However, his ultra expressive eyebrows will certainly convince you to give his toys right back!\nHe doesn't seem to understand why his size might be an obstacle to being a lapdog, and enjoys a good full body hug. As Hugo could easily knock someone over, we only allow laps and hugs on invite :). \nHugo prefers to be with his people, but does very well in his crate without anxiety for 4-5 hours at a time. He rarely barks, but sometimes kind of talks to get your attention.\n Hugo Lionheart came from a local shelter.\n Read more about Hugo Lionheart on the Independent Animal Rescue website at https://animalrescue.net/dogs/d-20-051/.",

She was on the euthanasia list and just seemed to accept her fate, she was broken.. until we stepped in. She's been with a wonderful foster who is helping her to trust again, but it's taken awhile. She loves to nap and go for walks. She's good on leash, as long as she wants to go. She is best in a home with no other dogs, cats or children under 13yrs old. She needs a patient person with a big heart to help her believe again that people can be good.\n\nThis pretty girl deserves to live out the rest of her years in a loving forever home.\n\nPlease contact nypeticare@al.com",

            "description": "Hello! My name is Hershey! I am a potty trained cur mix born in February 2020, I weigh about 30lbs right now. \nMe and my brother were found as strays and were super timid when I first met my foster mom. It didn\u2019t take long for me to come out of my shell though. I love to run around outside and play with my brother. I get along well with my fur foster brother, he is only 8lbs though so I sometimes forget I am bigger and stronger than him. I just want to give him kisses all the time. Same with kids - love to kiss and snuggle them too! I\u2019m not sure what a cat is, but it sounds like I would want to play with one! \nI like to sleep in my kennel, but my foster mom has let me have sleepovers in her bed and I curl up next to her all night. I and doing so well with house training, soooo very close to 100%\n I love to stand by my foster mom\u2019s feet when she cooks, I keep hoping she will drop something! I love to run around and play outside, but I also love to curl up next to her with a toy on the couch. My foster mom is teaching me how to \u201csit\u201d and tells me I am such a good boy! She smothers me with kisses all the time and she tells me I am as sweet as a hershey bar! I am utd on my vaccines and will be neutered in October. I would love to show you what a good boy I am!\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures.

He has been neutered and he had a tick disease when he came to us, but is over that with no problems! Ruger does go to the bathroom if left unattended for too long, but you know he really tries to hold it. He would be great for someone who likes to take walks and give endless amounts of love! He has never met a stranger, human or animal alike.\n\nIf interested, please apply at www.pawfirst.com \nAdoption few is $75 to help cover some costs of vetting.\n",

            "description": "Cesar is a 4.5 year old male mixed breed. He weighs 52 pounds. He is an active, busy boy. From having Cesar in the office we have learned that Cesar is a resource guarder. This means that he can be possessive of both treats and toys with humans. He gives plenty of appropriate warnings to let you know that he isn't fond of sharing. Cesar was transferred from a county facility so we do not have information about his previous household. Cesar has had some positive dog interactions at the shelter and some negative dog interactions at the shelter. We do not know if the resource guarding issue with treats and toys extends to his dog friends as we have not introduced toys during any dog interactions. We would definitely recommend a meet and greet with any resident dogs. At the shelter Cesar met a kitten, somewhat accidentally, and he was extremely rude. At this time we don't believe Cesar would do well living with cats. We have no information on how Cesar behaves around children. However, due to Cesar's resource guarding we would recommend him only with older children that are able to read and respect Cesar's communication about sharing (or rather not sharing) his toys and treats. We always recommend a meet and greet with any children in the household or children that visit often, such as grandkids. From Cesar's time in the office we have also learned that he can easily clear a baby gate in one hop. Please call for more information or to make an appointment to meet Cesar. (Updated 1/30/21).",

I also was heartworm positive and had to be treated for this.  I was in a wonderful foster home for almost a year when I got into a scuffle with one of my foster siblings over food and when the foster mom tried to break it up, I bit onto her arm. I do well with other dogs except for the food issue based on my previous life. I am begging for someone to give me a chance! \nFrom my rescuers: We are devastated for Jack as he is such a loving dog. Please give him a chance!\n I AM ALSO HOUSEBROKEN AND CRATE TRAINED. \n\nI ALSO DO WELL ON CAR RIDES BUT WILL NEED SOME TRAINING FOR WALKING WELL ON A LEASH AS I AM A STRONG AND BIG BOY. A FENCED IN YARD IS REQUIRED..\n\nI HAVE ALL OF MY VET WORK DONE, INCLUDING NEUTERING, MICROCHIPPED, HEARTWORM TESTED AND ON MONTHLY PREVENTION,AND ALL SHOTS UP TO DATE. \n\nPLEASE FILL OUT AN APPLICATION IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ME AND I HOPE TO MEET YOU SOON!\nHERE IS SOME MORE YOU NEED TO KNOW IF INTERESTED IN ADOPTING ME! \nClick here to complete our adoption application and please email to Kim at lovemelovemydogs2004@indy.rr.com: GRACIE'S HEART OF GOLD ADOPTION APPLICATION GRACIE'S HEART OF GOLD REQUIRES ONGOING PROPER VETERINARY CARE FOR ALL ANIMALS ADOPTED TO INCLUDE HEARTWORM MEDICATIONS, FLEA MEDICATIONS, AND YEARLY VACCINATIONS. GRACIES HEART OF GOLD DOES NOT SHIP OUR DOGS - WE REQUIRE A FACE TO FACE MEETING. WE ALSO DO NOT ADOPT OUR DOGS AS GIFTS UNLESS THE RECIPIENT MEETS WITH THE DOG PRIOR TO ADOPTION. MY ADOPTION FEE IS: $150. THESE FEES HELP KEEP THE RESCUE GOING. PLEASE READ MORE! Adoption fees average $150-$400. This fee varies per animal based on additional vet care required to save them. Due to the rising costs of veterinary care, premium holistic dog food, gasoline prices, and boarding fees, which are paid for out of our own pockets, we recently were forced to raise our fees. We are not funded by anyone - adoption fees help to offset only a part of our cost of getting the dog ready for adoption. All dogs > 6 months are vetted, up to date on vaccinations, spayed/neutered, microchipped, heartworm tested, wormed and have a goody starter bag. Puppies",

IF YOU MEET OUR CRITERIA FOR ADOPTION OF THIS DOG, PLEASE FOLLOW THE LINK TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE PROFILE TO COMPLETE OUR ONLINE APPLICATION. THANK YOU!\n\nNegrita was living as a street dog in Mexico. She was hit by a car that fractured her spine when she was about one year old. At that time, she was completely paralyzed and dragging herself around on the streets (see pic). Luckily, a kind person rescued her from a life on the streets. She was extremely thin and fearful. The woman knew there was very little chance of finding her a home in Mexico so she searched for a rescue in the US to take her. That\u2019s where we stepped in. \n\nNegrita was extremely underweight when she arrived in Oregon. Her hind legs were very atrophied. We started physical therapy and within the first month, she gained weight and was able to get up on her rear legs and walk. She can\u2019t feel her feet, and she walks with them rolled over, but she can walk, and she wants to walk, even though it\u2019s not normal walking. She was eventually even able to run in the grass. So awesome!! \n\nNegrita doesn\u2019t have complete bladder or bowel control, but we don\u2019t put her in a diaper. She needs to be expressed 3-4 times a day to go potty. She needs someone who is committed to this routine. If she is routinely expressed she does not have any \u201caccidents\u201d.\n\nNegrita does fine with other dogs as long as they don\u2019t jump on her. She is understandably worried about that when she meets a new dog. She loves having a calm dog companion. \n\nNegrita is sweet and loving with all people. She loves attention and greets her humans with an adorable \u201cwoo woo woo\u201d. She is now approximately two years old. \n\nNegrita can manage one or two stairs off a porch or deck but should live in a single-story home such as ranch style. She would not be able to manage a two story home.\n\n\nAdoption Process: We are not first come first served. Indigo Rescue focuses on finding good matches between dogs and families to ensure life long adoptions. We deliver all dogs to their new homes. All of our dogs are in foster homes. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in meeting one of our dogs, please use the following link and complete our Adoption Application. You can either scan your completed application and email it to us at: info@indigorescue.org, or you can fax it to us at: 888-502-7660.\nThe link is not live, so you will need to copy and paste it into your browser: https://storage.googleapis.com/gator-users/user-680788/documents/d1742bff02e44c2ea25649cb45df5103/Pet%20Application%20Form%20December%202020.pdf\nIf the dog you're interested in seems compatible with your lifestyle we'll set up a time for you to meet the dog privately.\nPLEASE NOTE: Indigo Rescue only adopts to homes within 30 miles of Beaverton because our volunteers deliver all of our dogs to their adoptive homes. We work very hard to create a family of our Indigo Rescue adopters because we want to be close enough to help in case there are any problems. We want everyone to be happy and successful!\n\n**ALL of our dogs, puppies, cats, kittens and rabbits come vaccined to their age, spayed/neutered and microchipped.\n\nThank you for your interest in adopting and saving a life.",

I have been in and out of foster homes and will soon go to boarding because my current foster mom won't be able to keep me much longer.\n\nIt has been quite a journey that has affected me a lot. I don't want to be alone anymore. I am a good boy! I don't get along well with other dogs so I should be in an only dog home. I love going on walks, playing with my toys, and giving puppy hugs and kisses. Due to my size, I would do best with older children.\nI am looking for someone who understands that my world was turned upside down and that I need some time to feel safe and secure.

            "description": "INKY loves people. At his foster home he is crate trained, uses a doggie door and walks using a face halter. Affectionate, great family dog. \n\nRevised adoption policy:\nDue to Covid -19 pandemic and social distancing requirements, we've temporarily revised our adoption policy. First, please email (desertpawsnm@gmail.com) to inquire before you fill out the online application. We are unable to do meetgreets or adoption events at this time or bring multiple animals to your house to choose from, so please only inquire if you're serious about adopting this particular animal. If you're just shopping around with several shelters and rescues please let us know. If you're application is approved (which could take up to one week to process because we are working with many other animals on a daily basis) then we will email/text/call to discuss and set up a day/time to bring the pet to you. We may ask you to send us pics /video since we can't come into the home for the meet/greet. Dog meetings are preferred in neutral territory (walk on the street), progressing to backyard (no toys, no food to possess over), then to inside the house (making sure no one accidentally gets boxed into a corner). Because of Covid, you will most likely have to do these activities while you FaceTime/Duo, etc us from the vehicle. At the meeting/adoption at your house (outside) please wear a mask (as will we) and use hand sanitizer.\n\nWe adopt to the Santa Fe, Abq, Los Alamos, Rio Rancho areas. If you are outside of these areas, please don't apply.\n",

ADOPTION IS $150.00.\n\n\nThis handsome guy is Grape! He was adopted from a shelter and then approx. two weeks later was found hit by a car. His adopter was contacted and chose not to reclaim him. So we went in and got him. He had a fracture to his elbow then was discovered upon xrays. He was then crate confined to allow healing, which it did! \n\nWe estimate his date of birth to be around November 15, 2019. This sweet boy is fully vaccinated, microchipped, tested negative for heartworms and is current on heartworm and flea prevention. He is great with other dogs, due to his age would need another dog in the home,  loves people and is crate trained. He has the sweetest disposition and would make any family a wonderful furry addition! Especially of they have children! Our best guess for breed is a Black Lab mix, which as most people know are great family dogs. \nGrape is located in a Memphis area foster home.",

            "description": "My name is Brody and I am estimated to be just over a year old now. Life started out for me living in a cage. I had to stand in my own filth day after day, sometimes I didn't get fed, but one day I was liberated. I have come a long way since then!\n\nI love spending time with my foster family. I have a lot of energy so my foster mom takes me out running and that is wonderful! After a nice long run we come home and snuggle on the sofa and then I get to do something I absolutely love: I get to watch tv! I am fascinated by it. True crime shows are a favorite of mine. I'd love to be a dog detective!\n\nI would be just fine as a single dog but if there are other dogs in the home I would do best with a female who will put me in my place. I would not do well with another male dog.\n\nI am loving and sweet and very much want to please my people. That's very important to me. I do get car sick. I love to go for walks or running.\n\nMy forever family must have prior current Doberman experience so they know and understand what goes into training and working with a young Doberman. They must also agree to take me to obedience training classes. Please review the adoption rules. If you qualify and are interested in adopting Brody, please place an application by : CLICKING HERE\n\nPlease help me to find my forever home!\n\nAll of our dogs are current with all shots, are on heart worm preventative monthly and are neutered/spayed. All dogs are tail docked. All of the above Dobes are pure breed Dobermans unless otherwise noted.We hope you can find a place in your heart and your home for one of our rescue Dobes.Please Note:In most cases we require a fenced yard.We do not place our rescue dogs in homes with very young children (under the age of 8 years). We set these limitations, not because of aggression issues with our dogs, but because Dobermans are generally large, active dogs and can easily knock down, run over or easily trip a small child, causing a serious fall. Also, we reserve the right to refuse adoption for any reason.Our adoption area encompasses Nebraska, Iowa and South Dakota.Copyright 2007 - Omaha Doberman RescueFor more information or to fill out an adoption request please visithttp://www.doberescue-ne.org/ 1/25/21 9:23 AM",

She has lived with other dogs but we would like to place her in a home without other pets since she does have guarding tendencies. She would do best in a home without children since she can be protective. Winter has had professional training and is very treat-motivated. \n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Winter, please email us at adarrahbullbullyrescue@gmail.com\n",

After surgery and some TLC from his foster mom he is feeling better and ready for a home of his own. He's a calm, older gentlemen who loves to nap and snuggle.\nVisual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label. Each dog in our rescue is in a loving foster home, where they can grow, play, and recover from their time spent on the streets or in a shelter. If you'd like to meet an adoptable dog, please fill out an application on our website, www.edcr.org. Because we are a foster home based rescue a completed adoption application is required to meet our adoptable dogs.\n\n2/1/21 1:42 PM",

            "description": "Tink Tink loves people and attention but gets so excited she forgets her manners and will jump up asking for more love and affection. She is very food motivated and would be easily trained. This sweet girl just wants somebody to rub her belly, take her for walks, and cuddle. Tink Tink is special in that she really loves men, but don't worry ladies, she still wants all the affection you have to offer. She is crate trained and has not had any accidents in the house. We estimate she was born in early 2016 and is med/large at 45-50 lbs. TInk TInk is a strong girl that doesn't know her size, so someone who can handle and direct her wiggly energy would be ideal. This big ol' lovebug has been waiting a long time to be part of a family. She has spent most of her life in a 20 by 20 kennel. Tink Tink would love a foster or forever home.

Her best friend in her foster home was a big playful shepherd boy, but he has since been adopted. Lucy Loo would love a family with plenty of playtime or a playmate for her. Before she came to DRDR her best friend was a tiny kitten who shared her porch, but she is not around cats in her foster home. Lucy is approximately 50lbs. and has done great with crate & house training. She is beautiful, mostly white, and has some stand out spots and patches of brindle. Lucy is spayed, microchipped, up to date on vaccinations and ready to meet her forever family. Meet Lucy Loo today: https://petlover.petstablished.com/pets/public/660466",

My foster mom laughs because when I get excited, I run around with my butt tucked up under me, doing zoomies around the yard. I don't really care for girl dogs but I will admit I have a little crush on my foster mom's big red boy. There are cats in my foster home but when they come into my space, I try my best to get them. Foster mom says cats are pets, not food. I don't get it, though. I also refuse to share anything with anybody else. I've lived in a place where I had to fight to survive, so nope. Not happening. My bowl, my treat, my food. I do dream of having my very own human who will accept me for who I am. Somebody to cuddle with & rub my belly; tell me what a good girl I am; love me unconditionally. I'm really kinda adorable. Like a tiny rottie with a blue coat. And, a face that's always searching your eyes, for a reason to make you smile.",

It's so funny to watch her chase her tail and zoom in circles around her foster family's yard. She absolutely beams with pride when she's having a great time. Maddie is short, compact, and strong at about 30lbs. We think she is a Boston Terrier/Staffy mix. Maddie is a sweetheart dying to be loved and as a bonus she hardly sheds so lots of cuddles are a must! She is crate trained and is doing good with her leash walking. Mighty Maddie was found in the median of a four-lane highway and although we don't know how she got there, she popped her head up from the bushes at just the right time to be seen. She was understandably scared but now that she knows she is safe she sleeps deeply enough that she SNORES! Maddie is spayed, up to date on vaccinations & microchipped. Meet her today: https://petlover.petstablished.com/pets/public/660364",

Medusa would prefer to turn other pets to stone and keep all the affection for herself, so other pets are a no thanks from her. Curling up on the couch with her family watching TV is her favorite place to be. When Medusa goes outside she takes a deep breath as if appreciating all the fresh air and sunshine. Medusa is an older gal between 7-9 years old, approximately 55lbs,and a medium sized, stout, gal. She does have a growth on her back left leg that cannot be removed safely. We would love to find a lifetime foster or adopter to let her live out the rest of her days. Medusa is truly a great one that would make a wonderful and loving companion.

Weve been told the only thing his master remembers is his faithful companion, Leo. DRDR is completely full but we want to help Leo find a forever companion so his dad will know his boy is safe. We think Leo is a cattle dog/heeler/bully mix. He is 3 years old, up-to-date on vaccinations, neutered, heart worm negative, and will be microchipped prior to adoption. He knows sit, shake, stay, and down. A neighbor is currently caring for Leo, but tells us he is really missing the companionship of his owner. He walks on a leash with the neighbors dog but he hasnt been tested with other dogs or cats. He is a quick boy and does backwards spins so he may enjoy agility or an active lifestyle. Leo is currently located in Anderson, SC. Applications can be submitted online at https://awo.petstablished.com/public/search/shelter/1154305",

He has a ton of really cute and animated facial expressions that make him the best selfie buddy. Comet picks up new commands quickly with a little treat motivation and is eager to learn new tricks. This 45lb happy boy likes to romp with the female dogs, and in his opinion, small and boy dogs are too wimpy to play with. Comet is crate and house trained, but likes to spend a lot of time outdoors exploring and playing. He has the wiggly boxer trait and would do best with older children who won't get knocked over. Comet would thrive with an experienced owner who can direct his energy. If you'd like to meet Comet, please submit an application at https://petlover.petstablished.com/pets/public/660469",

            "description": "Meet Brock! We are pretty sure that this boy is actually a fish disguised as a dog!! He certainly lives for life on the water! Brock likes the active lifestyle, walking, hiking, and you guessed it - swimming, swimming, and more swimming! What a fun fella for the outdoorsman! Check out the video of Brock taking a swim in the Appomattox River! What a ham, he's having a blast!  Into playing fetch at the lake or river or maybe even the beach? If so, Brock would like to apply to be your best friend and hang out buddy! Come meet Brock today!\n\nNOTE: In regards to children and pets, it is always best to remember that while pulling, tugging, poking, and pinching are all normal behaviors of a small child exploring the things around him, these behaviors can become frustrating for animals to tolerate. In response to pain or becoming overly annoyed, ANY animal can be subject to BITE, The pet and human relationship is an amazing bond that all pet lovers of all ages should be able to experience. As animal advocates and animal lovers, we want that experience to be an enjoyable one for every family that acquires a pet, therefore we always strongly recommend that parents/custodians of children (1) always monitor the interactions of their pets and their children, (2) never leave small children unattended with pets, (3) spend quality time teaching children how to be gentle with pets, respect the pet's personal space, and recognize behaviors that, even if they are not intended to be, are indeed bothersome to the animal and (4) be willing to set boundaries for children against behaviors that may be perceived by the pet as being annoying, fretful, or painful. Never underestimate the willingness of an animal to set boundaries on what it will not tolerate. When the responsibility of boundary setting is put upon the animal, it is usually carried out by nipping, snapping, and biting.\nRemember, YOU are the parent/custodian and YOU are the pack leader and thus YOU are the one responsible for making sure your \"kiddos,\" both two- legged and four, can live happily, safely, and harmoniously together.\n",

Rowdy has graduated from basic obedience training school and learned how to sit and stay in place, how to walk on a leash, and to focus his energy. He is loveable, energetic, and funny and is very food motivated, so further training in his forever home would work well.\n\nWith proper introduction, he gets along well with other dogs and is usually seen running around the farm with his best friend, Reyka. (also adoptable)\n\nGood with Dogs: Selective\n\nGood with Cats: Not tested but probably not as Siberians are notorious for their high prey drive and typically kill cats, rabbits, birds, chickens, squirrels, opossums, etc.\n\nGood with Children: Only older children, Rowdy can be a little .. ahem... \"rowdy\" \n\nHouse Trained: Yes\n\nCrate Trained: Yes\n\nRides Well in Car: Yes\n\nLeash Trained: Yes\n\nBasic Obedience: YES!

She is a very special girl who has epilepsy that is being controlled with medication.\n\nHazel was taken to Texas A & M to be evaluated by the best veterinarians in the state. They performed an MRI as well as several other tests to try to determine the cause of her seizures. The tests found nothing abnormal about her brain and no sign of any disease that could cause her seizures.\n\nHazel is very gentle, sweet, and independent. She gets along well with all of my dogs as well as all fosters that I've had. She is bell trained, doggy door trained and fully house trained. \n\nHazel needs a special adopter who will work in conjunction with a veterinarian to maintain her health and control her epilepsy. Her current medications cost roughly $150 per month at Kroger with their discount card. She also takes CBD oil twice a day. \n\nHazel would love to meet you! Won't you give this sweet girl a chance?\n\nHazel is available for introductions by appointment as she is currently living with a foster family. PLEASE EMAIL dogadoptteam@aartexas.org TO SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT\n\n\nEst. DOB: 11/23/18\n63 lbs.\nAAR does not transport for adoption",

Her favorite toy is her tennis ball and she loves doing zoomies.\nShe gets along with dogs, and even young children. She\u2019s a bit too pushy for cats.\nShe is updated on vaccines, spayed, and heartworm negative. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our dogs are healthy, spayed/neutered, vaccinated and on heartworm preventative. They live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. Many have basic obedience skills and all have been temperament tested. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, please visit our website to complete an application: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt\n(please note: app cannot be done on a mobile device)\n\nIf you have any questions, please email us at adopt@takepawsrescue.org",

I would make a great walking/hiking pal as I'm really good on leash.  I love other dogs and people but I would prefer a home without small children - teenagers or older are more my style.  Oh and don't laugh, but I am a bit scared of storms so I'm hoping you aren't a storm chaser.\n\n*All of The Right to Live dogs are fostered locally in San Antonio Texas and will be transported to other states to their new families upon adoption.  We believe fostering dogs and not having them decompress in a kenneled environment is more beneficial for the dogs and builds their trust and companionship in a family situation.  Adoption fee includes transportation costs, previous/current medical treatment (spay/neuter, etc.) and a health certificate for cross-state travel*",

She had been kept tied outside almost 24/7, and was in danger of freezing to death. She was also abused by family members who threw rocks at her and beat her. We scrambled to take her in, and since then we've learned a lot about this sweet girl. She's highly trainable, loving, playful, and has shown us how resilient she is. She's 4 years old and weighs 60 pounds. She would like to be the only animal in the home, with only older kids. She's insanely snuggly, and her favorite place to be is the couch or in bed with you! She's versatile and just as happy to be going on hiking adventures as she is chilling on the couch. She loves car rides! She'd do best in a quiet household with not a lot going on. She likes to run around the yard and get her roomies out, so a fenced in yard is a strong recommendation. She loves just lounging in the sun and hanging out outside. She's even good with baths and getting her nails trimmed! She's crate trained but isn't destructive in the home at all. She's EXTREMELY intelligent and trainable, and is super food motivated! This girl is a rockstar with her tricks and learns them so quickly. This dog is one of a kind and when she knows you're her person she'll be your best friend for life.",

He will forever be a bit traumatized from whatever happened to him while he was homeless, living outside of Lincoln Elementary School in San Bernardino.\nHe is a playful, silly boy, always on high alert, and still jumps when a sudden movement startles him. He went to boot camp training for 6 weeks where he mastered all his basic commands and his trainer said he is incredibly smart and athletic. You should see the flips and twirls this boy will do to catch balls midair! He is a total working dog, so he needs lots of mental and physical stimulation, so he'snot your average family dog -- rather than cuddle on the couch, he'd rather sniff around the yard searching for his tennis balls or whatever else he decides to sniff out.\nLincoln is looking for a large, power-breed experienced owner. Because he can be easily spooked, a home with no kids or kids over 16 required. Active home a must.\nAdopt Lincoln!

She is a great dog who is housebroken and knows basic commands like \"sit.\" You can even trust to her stay inside without being crated for the entire workday. Emma is treat motivated and is a gentle treat taker. She is currently working on \"leave it\" and \"heel.\" She walks well on a leash otherwise. She has the sweetest personality. She is still very much a puppy temperament and loves to play fetch or with other big dogs. She is a high energy dog and will need someone to walk her regularly or a large yard to play in. She should be fed separately from other dogs. She needs to be in a home without little dogs or cats. Emma is truly a well mannered girl and is desperate for a family that she can show this to.\n\nFor adoption: www.spcaeasttx.com\nFor more information: Adopt@spcaeasttx.com",

When he arrived at our shelter Jersey was heartworm positive but he has since completed his heartworm treatment. We have had mixed reactions when introducing Jersey to other dogs at the shelter. We always recommend a meet and greet with any resident dogs. Jersey has been on a slumber party during which he was introduced to resident cats which he chased excessively. At this time we don't believe Jersey would do well living with cats. Jersey was also on a slumber party with a child and reportedly did well. We always recommend a meet and greet with any children in the household or children that visit often, such as grandkids. Please call for more information or to make an appointment to meet Jersey.

Im loyal and loving, but not clingy- I like my independence. Some of my likes are: sniffing, walks, chicken, squeaky toys, and fetch. Some of my dislikes are: loud noises, other doggies, and getting burrs stuck in my fur (so annoying!). If you want to come meet me, set up an appointment with AAC! p.s. Id love it if you brought some yummy treats with you. Just saying. I weigh approximately 55 lbs. Click here to view my behavior notes from staff and volunteers.",

Cheddar has been working on eye-contact and engagement. Cheddar is crate trained and potty trained, but needs a firm and confident owner, that understands the needs of a deaf dog. Cheddar does fine with other dogs, and even cats (you can see videos of him engaging with other dogs and cats on our instagram page). But - being a deaf dog, Cheddar needs extra time to decompress each day as he can become amped up and moody, this is where his crate training comes in handy. He walks well on leash and knows basic commands through sign language. Cheddar needs an owner that can set boundaries and a schedule, and stick to them. Cheddar has been around young children but because he can sometimes be territorial over his food bowl when eating, we suggest a home with older kids if any. Please fill out and application on our website if you feel like you are capable of giving Cheddar the forever home he needs.",

Bo Woods is a handsome boy but needs a very specific type of home; no men in the home, no other animals and someone who will have to work with a trainer of our choosing. Since Bo Woods will need to work with one of our trainers we will need someone who is local to the Southern California area.
