            "description": "Preston is an approximately 3 year old American Pit Bull Terrier.\n\nHe is very smart, silly, affectionate, and playful. He loves to do zoomies before he goes on walks and can entertain himself with his toys.\n\nPreston loves to run around and play but he is just as happy to curl up on the couch and watch movies.\n\nPreston has received professional behavioral training. He is extremely loyal to those he trusts but needs slow introductions to meet new people. He has been doing very well with meeting new friends!\n\nHe just needs to find the right home with someone that is experienced with his breed as well as anxious dogs and has time & patience to work with him. Prestons perfect home is one where he is the only dog and no children.\n\nHis foster mom says He has continued to surprise me with how sweet and loving he can be in the face of everything he has gone through.\n\nAlthough he is still wary of strangers, he has grown to trust us over the last few months and I know in his forever home, he will grow to trust and love even more.\n\nHe is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nIf you think Preston is the dog for you, send us an email at furlovehaven@gmail.com or complete an application on our website furlovehaven.org.\n\n** Please understand that we are a volunteer run organization and we do our best to respond in a timely manner. Due to the high volume of applications, emails & phone calls we receive, we may be unable to respond to everyone.\n\nThe first step is to submit an application via our website furlovehaven.org.\n\nWe will review your application and you may be contacted if this animal might be a good fit.\n\nPlease be aware, submitting an application is not a guarantee, but if we think you might be a potential fit, someone will contact you within 72 hours.\n\nFeel free to reach out to furlovehaven@gmail.com if you haven't received a response after 72 hours.**",

            "description": "Katie was pulled from a high intake shelter in rural Georgia and is currently living in a Maine foster home. Katie's foster mom has this to say about her: \"Katie loves people and gets along with other dogs. She walks well on the leash, is treat motivated, and generally 'eager to please.' She will entertain herself playing with toys, but prefers to be in close company with her people, and can be vocal if left alone.\"\n\nKatie also has an allergy to grain and so needs to be fed an appropriate diet. At this time, we don't feel a home with cats would be best for Katie. But, she would be great with folks who work from home or are often home and want a big loving dog companion.\n\nAll of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heartworm tested and treated if necessary. Vet references are required and prior to adoption a home inspection will be conducted.   \n\nTransport options available. Adoption fee applies. \nIf interested go to www.pmarinc.org for an application.",

He was dumped at a shelter by a family member after his beloved owner had to go to a long-term care facility. On top of that, he'd been kept outside and had little or no care after his person was forced to leave him behind due to health issues. Poor boy, he's been one scared and upset guy ATDR's hearts went out to him Pepper is now in a comfortable foster home where he has soft blankets and his own little bed and an abundance of loving care from a kind foster mom. Sadly, Pepper is having trouble adjusting to his circumstances. Hopefully, in time, he'll become comfortable and be willing to trust and can learn to enjoy a new lap and comfortable chair to share with a person or people he can call his own again. When that time comes, if you have it in your heart to give Pepper a happy ending to his sad story, please submit an adoption application for him. He's deserving of love and gentle companionship like he lost when he sadly lost the only home he'd ever known",

He\u2019s neutered, vaccinated and microchipped. Deacon was hit by a car in Jan of 2020 & suffered 2 broken legs. He was taken to the shelter where he was going to be PTS. ERF rescue decided to give him a second chance. He underwent 3 complicated surgeries and is now in physical therapy. He gets many gentle daily walks. He is happy to chill in a crate or at your side. He is young and has learned many commands, this guy will flourish with an experienced owner who can give him structure. He will continue to need physical therapy and pain management throughout the rest of his life. He will probably not be able to be let off leash as he\u2019s very energetic & will need to be kept calm so he doesn\u2019t re-injure his legs . Deacon is dog friendly, if properly introduced but would NOT do well with cats or any other small animals, chickens etc.",

            "description": "Jagger is the cutest! He loves staying warm by the fire on these chilly nights! His siblings all got adopted and now it his turn to find a forever family. Jagger is a 5 month old chihuahua mix under 10 lbs. We are guessing maybe dachshund or rat terrier.\n\nHe\u2019s been neutered, fully vaccinated, dewormed, and microchipped! He\u2019s doing really good with the potty training and loves sleeping in his crate bundled up in his blankets. \n\nJagger would do great in a active home with another doggie playmate to grow up. He fostered in Suisun and we adopt locally as we need to be close enough for meets and a home check. If you are interested please send us a DETAILED email about yourself and lifestyle and request a application to fill out. We will not respond to one sentence emails! We are only adopting to home owners only with a fully fenced in yard. No renters or apartments. After we receive your application to review we set up a phone interview. When approved we will move forward with meets and a home check. It\u2019s about finding the right match for our dogs and potential families! \n\nPlease be patient as we are backed up with emails to get back to. It can take 2-4 weeks for a response. If anyone wants to join our team and volunteer some time to help please let me know! I\u2019m looking for committed people who will put in the time and not flake.",

            "description": "Meet Stryker! This gorgeous boy has been in my home for almost 4 years. That is a very long time to have a foster dog. Stryker is a dog that needs a very experienced home with no other pets. He has come a long way, but he will always be a work in progress. We have him on a schedule and have to constantly be working with him. Stryker can\u2019t be in a home with any animals or children. He is not good with dogs, cats, birds, chickens, none! He would need a strong handler who can take on a dog like him and give him the attention and training. His prey drive is very high and he isn\u2019t a dog for your average dog owner. He is not a dog park dog or a dog that can be off leash. \n\nStryker does love people and will be your best buddy once he gets to know you. He does tend to do better with men but likes women too. He really feeds off your vibe. Stryker listens very well and knows all his basic commands. Very food motivated and loves being outside playing with his toys. I can see Stryker loving life with someone who has property where he can run and enjoy being active. It\u2019s been a long road with him, but i won\u2019t fail him. A dog like him wouldn\u2019t have made it out of the shelter or would have ended up in the wrong hands. He was never socialized and has had a rough past.\n\nStryker is not perfect, but I know he would thrive when he finds a home that he didn\u2019t have to stress about other animals around. I know he\u2019s a dog that will stay with us for a long time, but maybe one day we will find his right home. I love this boy and would do anything for him. \n\nIf you are interested in Stryker and think you are the one for him please send us a detailed message and request a application. He is fostered in Sacramento. Must be a home owner with a secure fence at least 6 feet. No pets and no children. No apartments. He needs a yard.",

Even with a drain in her side and a cone on her head she was a sweet heart to be around.  She's active and needs to do more than just hang out in the back yard.\nRufina at shelter doesn't seem to like the other dogs but in a different situation, it could be different. She will also need to live in a cat free zone.  We think she's around 2 yrs old and she weighs 56.6 lbs. \nLocation: Othello, WA\n509-488-5514\nApplications: adamscountypetrescue.com  Please be descriptive with your application.\nAdoption Fee: $275\n\nPhone: 509-488-5514\nMailing/Physical Address:  1961 W Bench Road, Othello, Wa 99344\nAPPLICATIONS:  www.adamscountypetrescue.com \nIf you are wanting to adopt, please DO NOT click the Adopt Me button.

            "description": "Rocky Dee was brought to the NYC Animal Care Centers as an owner surrender in August 2020 because his owners were moving..  Due to overcrowding at the shelter,  he was slated for Euthanasia.  Pound Hounds was able to save his life due to a foster stepping up.\n\nWhile at the shelter he was reasonably stressed as that is what happens at the shelter.  He was slow to come around, however in his foster home and working with a trainer has now made him a great dog.\n\nRocky Dee's STATS:\n\nApprox 1 year old\n60 lbs\nHouse trained \nCrate-Trained\nRocky is high energy due to being 1 year old. Many calmer dogs cannot keep up with him. Rocky enjoys socializing and playing with other dogs. It is preferred Rocky is paired with a high energy dog around the same age as him.  \nKids over 11, please\nUTD on vaccinations, neutered and microchipped.\n\nHere is what his foster mom has to say:\n\nThe perfect home for Rocky will consist of active people. Rocky will do best with multiple walks and outlets for his energy daily. Heavy-duty puzzle toys, hikes, jogs, playtime with similar tempered dogs are great ways to get his energy out. \n\nAt this age, he cannot be left alone because he will get into things.  Best if not home to crate him.  He knows the words NO so please use them.  His foster Mom Is constantly training him but it will take time due to Rocky being a pup.  That is why it is best to tire him out during the day.  A tired dog is a happy dog!!\n\n\nRocky is a fun dog where he will keep you on your feet.  There is never a dull moment with Rocky Dee. He is always happy.  He loves to lean in on his human so he can get petted, loves to go for walks or play in the yard. \n",

We provide the heartworm treatment through our clinic, so that expense is covered for adopters. Andrew REALLY likes men. While he is fine with women, he really really enjoys a home where he can get plenty of male bonding time. He is super unique looking, and is really a good boy. He can be a bit grouchy and grumbly around younger kids, so we prefer a home with older kids only.\n\nIs Andrew a Lhasa? A Norfolk? Oh, who the heck knows. All we know is he is crazy cute and in need of a family. Can we get him one? To have your home considered for adoption, read about our adoption process or fees, and find out about interstate transport, please visit our website, www.LongWayHomeAdoptables.org and click the adopt tab!\n\nOur adoption fee is $200 for dogs, $100 for cats, and it includes spay/neuter, all vaccines, heartworm testing, fecal testing, deworming, flea/heartworm prevention, and a microchip. \n\nNATIONWIDE TRANSPORT available for an additional $200 fee. See our website for more info!\n\nPlease note: breed listings are based on educated guesses. Shelter animals and abused pets do not come with DNA profiles, so breeds listed on the profile are based on size, coat, markings, and body shape, but are in no way guaranteed. \n\n_______\n\nLong Way Home is a volunteer organization, comprised of a network of foster homes. Please keep this in mind, as we only have so much time to volunteer around full time jobs, family obligations, etc. It may take us several days to respond.",

She adores people and is looking for an active home to give her the romp time she needs before some serious couch and cuddle time. Although Pua has lived with other dogs, she has some reactivity to dogs she does not know, so we are looking for a dog-free home where she can be the center of attention. No small kids and a fenced yard is a must.\nDOGS:\n\nThe first step of our adoption process for dogs is to fill out our \"\" interested party application\"\" form online at this link \n\nhttps://service.sheltermanager.com/asmservice?account=ac0662&method=online_form_html&formid=12\n\n\nCATS:\n\nFor more information on our cats please send an email to cats@vipp.org\n\nPlease note we are an all-volunteer organization and it may take us several days to respond.",

She was not doing so good, sleeping all day, very sad to see. Like someone had abandoned her.  At first I thought she was overweight but discovered her body is actually shaped that way. She loves her walks, always ready to go!! She is potty trained and is a good eater. One thing she does which is hilarious is going to my closet and get my shoes then bring them to her bed and play with them. She doesn't damage them and even if you think she chews them, she doesn't. She is so funny, what a character!! She will bring anything she finds in her bed, T-shirt, socks. She will put everything in a circle and then sleep with it. She is with 3 other dogs right now but would be better as the queen of the house. She loves in the morning going out in her yard and sniff around. Take her time and go in and out all day long. We have doggie doors and she knows how to take use them. Would be great if someone likes to garden. \nShe listen well and would make a great companion. if you are interested in helping this title one please email at pets@findahomegiveahome.com\nshe is vetted, microchip and spayed. adoption fee is $100.00 . She just had a dental and got Pro heart 12 which is a shot to prevent Heartworm prevention for 12 months. All ready to go!! You will need a little patience with her but at the end of the day she will be a great little companion with character. \nthe shelter had her as Dachshund mix.",

Besides being handsome, Sampson is intelligent, athletic, and a great companion. He is a good hiking partner and loves to run! This guy has a heart of gold....he is ready and eager to be someone's BFF! \n\nWe were able to raise enough funds to send him to an intensive 4 week board and train program. (Not that it was actually needed, we just didn't have any available foster homes and he was starting to succumb to kennel stress in the shelter and we knew we had to get him out of there ASAP). \n\nHe did GREAT during training, and is now thriving with his awesome foster family in Santa Cruz. His adoption will also come with five free in home private training sessions by his trainer to show his new family everything he knows, etc. (Rescue dogs rarely come with almost $2K worth of a training background!)\n\nHis forever home and family will definitely be the better ones for it as Sampson is truly a special guy -- could it be you??\n\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "Sweet Talcum is a 40 lb lap dog! She is around 2 years old and likely a mix of a few different breeds but may have some Lab and Terrier in her. She is always happy and very affectionate with people. Talcum has been fostered with a few other dogs, big and small, and got along with all of them. When she sees other dogs on walks, she tends to get a little over excited mainly because she wants to play! She is also currently fostered with a couple of kitties and while she barks at them through the baby gate, she's polite and respectful of them when they are right in front of her. Talcum is house trained in her current foster home and sleeps quietly on her dog bed through the night. While she loves lap snuggles, she is also quite content to go take a snooze on her own on her dog bed. Talcum loves to play and rip apart her toys. She is working on not being mouthy in playtime and is quickly picking up her basic commands, especially when chicken is involved. She has done well around the kids (6 and 7 years old) that she has been around. She recently had surgery for an old leg injury and is the newest member of the tri-pawed club. She gets along just fine without her leg and will be available for adoption mid-February. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting mama Talcum when she is ready, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs.

Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most dogs we are only guessing at primary breed. We get to know each dog as an individual and do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not breed label.\n Primary Color: Red Brown Weight: 47lbs Age: 4yrs 5mths 1wks Animal has been Spayed",

I love playing and being goofy in the yards, and I also get praised for being an extremely sweet girl. Ideally, my furever owner(s) will be active, so we can go on runs or play around. I have so much to offer that I would prefer to be an only pet and prefer to live in a house vs. an apartment. Please, give me a chance!\n\nTo adopt, fill out an application at\n\nwww.paws4you.org/application\n\nTo get our newsletter, text\nPAWS4YOU\nto\n22828\n\nConnect with us:\n\nwww.instagram.com/paws4you\n\nwww.twitter.com/paws4you\n\nwww.facebook.com/paws4you",

            "description": "Meet Miss Piper, our tripod princess! Currently in a foster home in the Collierville area, we would love to arrange a meeting!  The first step to adopting Piper would be to complete an application at www.perfectmatchanimalrescue.org.  Piper is 5 years old and weighs approx 68lbs.  Read on for more information!\n\nPiper was hit by a car in June and found herself at Memphis Animal Shelter and was close to being euthanized. Thankfully, and in no small part due to her foster family stepping up, we were able to rescue her.  Between June and October, Piper had 4 different orthopedic surgeries to try to save her leg. When it became apparent that those efforts had failed, Piper went through amputation surgery in November. On top of that, the rescue also treated Piper for heartworms! We are happy to report that Piper is finally heartworm negative, she is healed from her surgeries, spayed, fully vaccinated, and is now ready to find her forever home. Piper is around 5 years old, settled, housebroken and is content to be with her person. She is intensely loyal, loves chin scratches, a soft bed and plenty of treats. She has been in a foster home with 5 other large dogs and a cat. She has tried to chase the cat but stops when told no. She would probably be best in a home with older children and one that has calmer dogs or no other dogs as she would adore being the center of attention and she will make the lucky family that adopts her the center of her world.  Please don't hesitate to reach out for more information.\n",

We are unsure of how he is with cats. Rex is in a temporary foster home, but we are looking for a new foster soon.\n\nRex is neutered, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, and heartworm negative.\n\nEmail us at info@adorehouston.org with any additional questions!",

We generally do not have much background info on them and cannot guarantee they are housebroken. They are all up to date on vaccines, spayed/neutered and microchipped.\n1 yr old. 50lbs. Transferred up from LA where she was surrendered by her owner as a result of the hurricane, poor JoJo sadly spent most of her young life cooped up in a crate. She appears housebroken and keeps her kennel very clean. She is very sweet. High energy so we are looking for an active family, a runner would be great! Breeds are a best guess, Shepherd, Border Collie, and some Pittie in there too we think. A home that is familiar with the breeds and their needs is also recommended. She is very smart and does know some commands. And we heard she would ring a bell to go potty! She is a herding breed so older kids may be better. Obedience training will be necessary, she needs leash manners (a puller). JoJo loves to be near people and cannot wait to be with a family for the holidays. Home with a fenced in yard required. *Per JSAC policy, puppies and kittens under 6 months will not be adopted to families with children under the age of 6 years.",

Don\u2019t let my age fool you\u2026 I\u2019m an energetic guy with so much love to give!\n\nIn my foster home, I love to play with my foster brothers, who are much bigger than me. When I\u2019m not playing with other dogs, I\u2019m a huge snuggle bug, and love to cuddle up with my foster parents and their young kiddos, who are 4 and 5 years old. When it\u2019s time to go to sleep, I prefer to be snuggled up in bed with my foster parents. I would be happiest in a home where I could spend most of the day by my human\u2019s side! I can be a little shy at first, but I warm up to new people in just a few days. I have had a few accidents in the house, but my foster parents say this improved once I got acclimated to my new environment! My new family may need to be a bit patient with me as I adjust to my forever home.\n\n To summarize, my favorite things in life include playing with my foster brothers, snuggles, and spending quality time with my foster family. Do you think I sound like a good match for your family? I hope so! I look forward to meeting you!  Just ask for me, Ossie, on your application today!\n\n",

In a home, an effort should be made to train Minaj in how to politely accept the entrance of visitors to the home. She has the potential to be territorial in a new home and will need an experienced, adult-only household. She was social and interested in meeting our helper dog, but was not playful. She may enjoy play with good, low-key dogs but would probably do best in a home where she is queen of the castle.\n\nHamilton Township Animal Shelter cannot offer any guarantees on the age, health, temperament, personality or mental disposition of any pet. Hamilton Township Animal Shelter cannot and does not represent, warrant, promise, or guarantee how the adopted pet will interact or react to the new home environment.\n",

Looking for either a foster or adoptive home. \nLibby is going to be a big girl when she finishes filling out. She weighs 100 right now and is still underweight.\n\nMiss Libby is going to do best with an owner who has experience with Anatolians or another flock guardian breed.  She is everything you would expect from an Anatolian... watchful, protective, alert, athletic and intelligent.   Libby is still rather puppyish and energetic so she is going to do best in a home with a secure fence and maybe a playmate such as a large male dog.\n\nTransport assistance may be available within 1000 miles, depending on where you live and the availability of volunteer drivers.\n\nPlease email for more information asdrescue@gmail.com",

            "description": "Lady is a lovely 9-year-old mixed-breed girl who currently weighs about 58 pounds. She came to SFAS when her owner could no longer care for her. Lady is so well-named - she is a delight to spend time with and she is excellent on leash. Lady will politely accept all the attention she can get. Let's just say she would love to be the queen of the house. If you have another dog at home, we do ask you to please bring them in for a meet n greet during your appointment. Lady's adoption fee is paid for by Mrs. Vigil's class at Nino Otero Community School. She is spayed and microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. To meet Lady or to be added to her waitlist, call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the DOG'S NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A GOOD PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org. A scheduler will call you back within 48 hours to confirm your request. If you have other dogs at home, tell the scheduler you would like to bring them along for a Meet n' Greet. SFAS offers a variety of excellent training classes, seminars and Trainer Talks led by animal behavior professionals. These are half-price for animals adopted from any shelter or rescue group! Due to current COVID-19 restrictions, classes and talks are all presented virtually using Zoom. For course descriptions, schedules and registration, visit https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/group-training-classes/ for classes and https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/special-seminars-and-workshops/ for seminars and Trainer Talks.",

She moved in with her foster family, started to gain some weight and raised her sweet puppies. Now that her puppies have found their furever families, it is time for Tippy to find her furever home! Despite her rough start, Tippy has learned that people are great. She is incredibly sweet and loves attention. She especially loves belly rubs and brushing. Tippy had not spent a lot of time inside a house, so she will need someone who will help her perfect her house manners. Tippy has been with cats and ignores them, but would be best as an only dog so her family can focus on helping her be the princess she so deserves to be :)\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

I'm a perfect gentleman on car rides too. I'm still a puppy and need help with potty training as I have never lived in a home before. I'm a distemper survivor! I have lasting symptoms from having distemper when I was a little pup. I have a rythmic tremor and my body is constantly in motion, even when I'm sleeping. I'm not in any pain and I don't require any medication. I have some difficulties using my back legs. I can still walk and run, I just drag my paws occasionally. I'm still a happy-go-lucky puppy and can do everything other dogs do! I would love a home to call my own where I am loved for all my special quirks. I may be good with other dogs, I just haven't met many. The rescue will help with dog introductions to determine if any potential furry family members could get along. Did I mention I make the cutest little grunty noises when I'm playing?! I will always have you smiling and laughing. I know you will love me once you meet me! Email Mayday today so we can start our happy life together!\n\nIf you or someone you know is interested in fostering or adopting, please visit our site at www.maydaypitbullrescue.org or send us an email at info@maydaypitbullrescue.org",

LOL! His owner passed away and the family doesn't know his age, but our vet really thinks he is about 8-9 years old according to his full blood work and exam. He is the sweetest and affectionate companion. He is a goofy guy that is easygoing and gets along with small calm dogs and adults, no cats or small children He loves to go on long walks and is happy just to be with you. Gus is a low rider, small with stubby legs, muscular, and a charming personality! He is friendly and loves to meet new people! He likes car rides and playing with his toys. He is house trained and signals when he needs to go out. He sticks to you like glue, happy, and kissy. He is a goofy guy and will steal your heart. He is healthy and wagging his nubby tail for your attention. Gus has his bags packed and is waiting for his forever family to come and take him home. If you are interested, please fill out the adoption application. This dog's adoption fee is $350 to go towards their vetting (vaccines, spay/neuter, heartworm/Ehrlichia/Lyme test, fecal test, pre-op blood work, dental cleaning, and microchip as well as grooming if needed). If you are interested please fill out the adoption application For additional information regarding our adoption process, please check our FAQ's Page. \n\nAll dogs in the care of Get a Life Pet Rescue live in loving foster homes while waiting for their perfect match. They don't live in cages or crates (unless there is a medical reason to do so.) They are treated as family pets while in our care. * All dogs in our care are fed premium brand holistic food as well as supplements and vitamins specific to each dog's needs. We don't buy inexpensive bulk dry kibble, our rescues are fed premium wet food diets as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation program to ensure maximum health.*All of our rescues receive complete quality vetting including full dental cleaning with pre-op bloodwork, spay/neuter, vaccines, and grooming. Dogs in need of specialized medicine will be seen by specialists, such as full cardiac workups, ophthalmologist visits, all suspicious lumps, and bumps are biopsied, and every medical need is transparent to potential adopters. *Once you adopt from Get a Life Pet Rescue, you become part of our compassionate family and we are here for you if a problem with your precious dog arises.",

            "description": "Finn is a laid back, gentle giant. His favorite thing is to lie on his bed, eat and watch old cartoons (Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and commercials) on TV :) He often sleeps with his sleeping bag which he gets under or inside. He is very gentle and slow taking food from your hand. He eats slowly, is not in any hurry and doesn\u2019t want to be bothered while he eats or share his food. Finn loves car rides and visiting folks, especially going to Lowes lumber and garden sections - he's never met a stranger and loves the attention! He walks great on a leash and is very attentive. Finn does not like small 'barky' dogs and may engage a cat, but he is great with other dogs. Finn is totally house trained and is the perfect house guest. He has never been in a crate (doesn't like them and doesn't need one). He doesn\u2019t require a lot of activity but does enjoy walks and interaction outside as well as inside. He will require a secure fenced yard but prefers being inside when it's cold. Finn has been good with children over 8 years of age. He had to have his coat shaved off due to severe matting but it's growing back nicely and he's looking good! He\u2019s very patient, listens, takes direction quickly and is eager to do things and learn. He doesn\u2019t bark unless he needs to go out or something is outside. Finn's hearing was poor due to a chronic ear infection but has improved tremendously. His foster says that Finn is very loving, gentle and precious and his new family will be very happy to have him as their pyrfect addition!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nNGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY. View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

He is a friendly dog who would benefit from structured activity and needs someone ready to set boundaries and stick to them. He is very playful and loving. Gus is a very smart dog, who loves to please and has great potential. He enjoys his training time with our trainers here and we're ideally looking for someone willing to work him and our trainers twice a week to continue his good work! Gus enjoys lounging in the sun and exploring the great outdoors, he loves to go on hikes. Gus would prefer a home without cats, but gets along well with some respectful dogs. If you are looking for a friendly fellow who is looking to learn, inquire about Gus and give him the home of his dreams! Gus is currently in a training program!",

My name is Bowser, and I'm a 7-month old, happy-go-lucky Husky mix. My foster Mom says I'm a confident, ENERGETIC boy that loves to PLAY! I would run and play all day long if I could!!\n\nI also love playing with toys and chewing on nylabones, but I really love running through the back yard with my 4-legged foster siblings. I would do best with another young, playful dog in the home to continue teaching me how to become the best dog I can be! I'm a young buck with a ton of energy to burn and will need a fenced back yard in my forever home. And I can jump really high so a 6 foot fence would be ideal.\n\nDid I mention that I love to play!?! But what I love most is SNUGGLING. And I only weigh 35-40lbs... perfect snuggling weight!\n\nI may accidentally knock down little humans, but I don't mean to and I'm learning to take it down a notch when I come inside. I can also be a little mouthy when playing, so I would do best without very young children in the home as I'm still learning what is appropriate to chew on. I don't mind being kenneled at night... it keeps me from exploring and finding new things to chew on. And I haven't had ANY accidents in my crate!\n\nI would love to become the newest member of a family that will include me in their activities. If you like snuggling after going on new adventures together, fill out an application and my foster Mom will contact you so we can meet!\n\nWe are a 100% foster-based rescue and all of our dogs live in approved foster homes. We are dedicated to finding the best Forever Homes, and will perform home visits and conduct veterinarian and reference checks for each potential adopter.",

            "description": "Looking into Calvin's eyes --- does your heart just break for him? You can just tell how sad and confused and lost he must be. This sweet, 2 year old boy came to us as a stray in November 2020, after being found by the police. He is a nervous dog, seemingly not knowing what to do with toys, or attention. If we had to guess, he probably spent most of his time alone, perhaps outside, and under-socialized with people. Calvin is friendly with other dogs and enjoys meeting them, although he probably doesn't know how to play yet. Sadly, Calvin was adopted and after one day, not nearly enough time to adjust into his new environment with new people, he was returned to us. Thankfully he is back with us now and is ready for his actually true, forever, loving home. Calvin is looking for a household with adults only. Calvin may be placed with another dog thats respectful and no cats. \n\nIf you are interested in learning more, please contact our placement team: \nT: (516)785-5220 \nE: Adoption@tohmail.org \nE:Foster@tohmail.org \nE: Rescue@tohmail.org",

Thank you!** \n\nMeet Pepper, a 2-3 year old, 56 pound Lab/Hound/Boxer mix lady. \n\nPepper was found under porch on while having her puppies. As soon as she was through labor rescuers brought her and her puppies to a safe and loving foster home. The puppies all went home and Pepper is looking for a family of her own.\n\nPeppers foster wanted to share this about her:\nPepper is an affectionate girl, loves attention, particularly belly rubs, and is very sweet. She will follow you everywhere and lie at your feet.  She is a wonderful companion.  Her tail is always wagging, and she loves to play. She is housebroken and loves to sleep at the end of your bed or on the couch at night.  She gets very excited when going on car rides and enjoys walks in the woods or playing fetch in the yard.  As an older rescue, Pepper is leash reactive; pulling hard to investigate other dogs so she is best if she can find a home where she can continue to work on changing this behavior.  We see her as a suburban dog where she can have a fenced in yard to play and can enjoy peaceful walks. She loves people and she is smart.  She is now following all commands of sit, stay, up, down, this way, leave it, off, come, heel, touch, fetch, drop it. When she wants to play, she will nudge you to let you know. As a young rescue, she can get a little over excited and mouthy; and may chew on soft items unless redirected to her toys. She loves tug-a-war and cuddles on the couch and will snuggle up beside you and sleep. Pepper should not be in a home with other dogs or cats but is great with kids. My son says she is the best, most fun foster dog we have had!\n\nPepper is ready to be somebody's special pup!\n\nPepper is good with children but since she takes time to adjust she can only go to a home with older (teen +) dog savvy children.   She would not be a good dog for a child's first dog.\n\nAll dogs are up to date on vaccinations and spayed/neutered at the time of adoption. All dogs require professional training to become the best family member they can be.\n\nPepper has finished heart worm treatment. She will need a blood test re-check in six months which can be done at the expense of the rescue if at our veterinarian.\nTo adopt or learn more about Pepper, you must fill out an adoption application. To find the application, copy and paste this URL into your browser: WWW.GDRNE.COM/ADOPTION-APPLICATION [Adoption Fee: $495]  **  PLEASE READ: If a dog is listed, then s/he is currently available for adoption. Their information is correct to the best of our abilities and the information we have been given as of the day of posting. Please note, GDRNE does not guarantee the breed of any dog or puppy unless stated that we have run DNA. All breeds listed are educated estimates. Our dogs are rescued from various situations. It is most likely that both their parents were strays and even if not, mixes of some sort and that their grandparents were mixes as well. The dog may have some genetic material of an American Staffordshire Terrier (pit bull). The dogs are usually mixes of many breeds, making them a breed all their own - a True and adorable American MUTT. If you are interested in this dog, you must submit an application. Great Dog is not a shelter so there is no building you can visit. Our dogs live in private foster homes until adopted. To learn more about our *shelterless* rescue, adoption fees, and procedures, review the list of Frequently Asked Questions on our website at WWW.GDRNE.COM.",

            "description": "Date of birth: 5/2019\n\n12/1/2020:  Reuben is a super cute Lab/Boxer mix!  He has sweet button eyes and a beautiful coat. He\u2019s long legged.  He currently weighs 50 lbs but should gain some weight.  He\u2019s 1 1/2 years old.\n\n\u2022 Reuben is very friendly and playful.  He loves playing with toys!  \n\n\u2022 He\u2019ll need a fenced yard. He\u2019s got a lot of energy! \n\n\u2022 We would also like Reuben to have a doggie friend in his new home. He gets along well with other playful dogs his size. He loves playing in the yard with other dogs and it\u2019s a great way for him to run off some energy. You could bring your dog to meet Reuben to see if they could buddies.  \n \n\u2022 Reuben is too rambunctious for a home with young children at this point. He jumps up quite a lot and is very much a big active puppy!  He\u2019ll need work on basic manners. He is very food motivated so should do well with training and be an eager learner.\n\n\u2022  He keeps his kennel clean.\n\n\u2022 Sadly, Reuben tested positive for heartworms.  He will get his first heartworm treatment on January 11.  He\u2019ll need to be restricted to limited activity at that point and for several weeks. The treatment is done in our clinic and the costs are covered. We can fill you in more about his heartworm treatment and what that entails if you are interested in adopting or fostering Reuben.\n\n\u2022 Reuben has been neutered, vaccinated and microchipped. He\u2019ll be a fun companion if you\u2019re looking for a happy and playful companion for yourself and your dog!  He was originally in a shelter in Arkansas and his time was up there, so we transferred him and some of his shelter buddies up here to find homes. \n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE:  PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU.  Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info.\u00a0\n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.521.2339\nhsgkc.org",

Active home.\nSpecial Info:\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

            "description": "Meet Lincoln\nThis handsome boy, Lincoln, was rescued from a high kill shelter. We brought him to the safety of our shelter as we search for his forever home.\nLincoln is nine month old Labrador retriever mix. He\u2019s medium size, weighing 54 lbs.  He\u2019s a super sweet boy who is finding it hard to be at the shelter. The noise and confinement of the shelter environment have increased his anxiety. Luckily we have wonderful staff who understand this and are working with Lincoln to help him adjust. He has a lot of energy that needs to be channeled. Outside of the shelter, this boy is a terrific dog. He\u2019s smart, sweet, and so much fun. He\u2019s much calmer and can focus better. Lincoln is very sensitive and just wants to belong to someone. Someone who can work with him patiently and give him the security and safety he\u2019s lacked his whole life. He is smart and learns quickly. He will make for a great hiking buddy. We don\u2019t yet know how he\u2019ll respond to other dogs or cats and can test for potential adopters. \nLincoln has a lot of potential and just needs to be out of the shelter for his true personality to shine through. He\u2019s loyal and earnest and tries so hard. If you are able to open your heart and home to a sweet young dog who will make for a wonderful companion, handsome Lincoln may just be the one. \nCall 706-865-4135 for information on additional health services provided as part of the adoption fee.  If interested in one of our puppies or dogs, please submit an application online or at the shelter. Applications can be submitted online at: https://www.charlessmithgallhumanesociety.org/page/dog-adoption-application \nOnce an application is submitted online, you will receive an email saying your application has been successfully submitted.  If you don\u2019t receive this email within 24 hours, please check to make sure all application fields were completed or please call our shelter at 706-865-4135. All adopters must complete an approval process which involves a reference check with current/recent vet and a brief home visit if located in the immediate area. We do permit out of state adoptions. Adopters MUST come to the shelter to transport their new family member home. We do not ship nor do we transport them to their new homes. Adoption policies and application procedures are detailed at the shelter website: http://smithgallhumanesociety.org/ under tab All Adoptable Animals.\nCharles Smithgall Humane Society (CSHS) is a No kill shelter. Animals in our care remain safe with us until adopted. Resident animals are primarily owner relinquished and also accepted from local Animal Control. The facility usually is operating at capacity with a list of animals waiting for space to open.\nAdoptions and meet and greets are being scheduled by appointment only. Please call our office, email us or complete an application and someone will be in touch just as soon as they can. \nLocation: 4823 Helen Hwy., Sautee, GA 30571, Phone: 706-865-4135\nEmail: smithgallhumanesociety@windstream.net\nOur shelter in Sautee GA is located about 3 miles south of the alpine town of Helen in northeast GA.\n\n\n",

He is a little protective of his food due to his not having food before being rescued, and he REALLY loves to eat.  He was abandoned and was in very bad shape when we found him.  He was treated by one of our vets and received all of his vaccines and has been neutered.  \nHe suffered a lot before he was rescued and was very fortunate to have survived since sadly, some of his siblings died.  He is a sweet boy and deserves the very best.  He would love a grassy yard and does well with other dogs so a home with another dog would be a big plus for him.  He needs someone who is patient and loving and will take good care of him.\n",

Housetrained? Unknown. Training needs? I know sit, but want to learn more! Energy level? Unknown. How did I get here?

Charlie is a pretty classy one-year-old, thirty-five-pound Terrier/Mix who is ready and willing to find his new people. Charlie is halfway through puppyhood and somewhere along the way has already earned some inside manners and it won't take much to help him understand your rules and for you to become familiar with his way of communicating. A quick obedience class and boundaries with everyone on the same page and you'll be good to go. Talk about a great time for a dog. This active and intelligent guy is going to be the hit of your neighborhood on your outings. Winter is coming and Charlie would love to help you get through the wintertime blues. Seriously, Charlie is exactly what the doctor ordered. Charlie has a placement restrictions of someone who knows how to read dogs when doing introductions and he would do better with no kids or older kids, and you are going to fall in love the minute you meet him. Charlie is a medium boy and he does need to be exercised so please keep that in mind. Charlie is up to date on all of his vaccinations, is neutered, and will be microchipped and whoever is lucky enough to adopt him is going to have a friend for life.

            "description": "Ruby is an 8 year old, 13 pound, female, terrier mix. Ruby is a big personality wrapped up in a small package. After living her whole life rather solitary with a single owner who passed away, Ruby needs to take her time meeting new people. She is very cautious and protective of herself to strangers, but give her some time, patience, and TLC and you will have the snuggliest little friend to share your bed with.\n\n\nRuby was surrendered when her owner passed away from Cancer. It was a hard\ntransition for her to move from the life she once knew. Now that she has\nsettled into her foster home, she is doing incredibly well. She is such a goofy\nand affectionate girl. She is a calmer dog overall, as she just loves to\nsnuggle with you on a couch watching TV. But she also loves her walks. For how\ncalm she is normally, she\u2019s surprisingly athletic as well, so she would be up\nfor just about any adventure! \n\n \nRuby is looking for an experienced owner, possibly one who has experience with terriers. Ruby will need someone who can help her come out of her shell and who has the confidence to get her through the adjustment period. Ruby will reward her future owner for committing to her care with tons of love and kisses once she gets comfortable. As mentioned, Ruby is extremely affectionate once she trusts you! And Ruby gets along well with other dogs and cats too! But, she is a typical terrier and would love all the attention to herself as well. If you think you have what it takes to be a confident owner and caretaker for Ruby, submit your application today!\n\nRuby is up to date on her vaccinations and is spayed. Experienced dog owner only with no young children living in the home. \n\nFor more information about her, please fill out an application at www.ALRcares.com and email Julie@alrcares.com. We schedule meet and greets for approved adopters only, an application is the first step in our approval process. Thank you!",

My Adoption id number is 315504.\n\nI AM AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION, HOWEVER DUE TO MY BREED MY ADOPTION WILL HAVE TO BE FACILITATED THROUGH A RESCUE ORGANIZATION. PLEASE SEE THE FRONT DESK STAFF FOR MORE INFORMATION.\n\nThis is Gilbert! He's a fun puppy that would go best to somebody that has enough extra time to work with him on training and obedience. In our experience he can be a bit mouthy when he's playing which is a bad habit that can be redirected to something productive such as a very durable toy. Gilbert is also very interested in being a lap dog which should be discouraged if you're not into that kind of thing. Overall Gilbert is adorable and would love to find his forever home very soon so he can start being a big boy dog in the real world! \n\nDog relationships can be just as complex and complicated as human relationships at times. We recommend separating any new additions in the home while unsupervised until a comfortable relationship has been established.\n\nAmerican Pit Bulls are a misunderstood breed; for this reason, we implore adopters to these beautiful dogs to be very vigilant in training and socialization. This breed is very energetic and will need daily exercise. Because of their strength and energy, apartment living may not be the best fit. This breed can be loving, loyal and very smart. \n\nThe above behaviors and personality traits have been observed while at the Shelter. If this animal was relinquished, information is gathered from the owner regarding behavior. Our wonderful volunteers spend time with these animals and give input on behaviors and traits. However, this description may not be all inclusive to how this animal will act in a loving forever home. Introduction to established family pets should be slow and monitored always. The same goes for children and other family members. Adopting a pet is a big decision and should be thoughtful. We suggest researching different breeds to match traits and personalities to your lifestyle. When adopting a pet, please know that this pet will be with you for their lifetime; patience and consistency will make for a successful adoption.\n Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: White Weight: 62lbs Age: 3yrs 6mths 2wks Animal has been Neutered",

My name is Tux.  I am a 2 year old, 55 lbs, male Lab mix.  The house training stuff was no big deal and I mastered it quickly.  I am a master of  crate training. While most of the time you\u2019ll find me lounging as close to you as possible soaking up all the belly rubs, I\u2019ll often show you a more playful side.  I am a perfect gentleman while on the leash and would make a fantastic friend for someone looking to find a daytime (I'm not a big fan of night time runs) running partner.  I\u2019ll be honest though, even with my fantastic leash skills, apartment or big rig life would just not be for me.  I could live with cats.  I am a recent graduate of the Pups for Parole training program and have learned a lot of new tricks!  I really would love to live with one special person to give me all the attention.  Too many humans in my home might be too much for me. Im all dressed up and ready to meet my forever human!\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

This lab mix is a beautiful, happy little fellow is about four and a half months old and weighs about 30lbs. We expect him to be around 60-70 lbs of love! He is in a foster home and is dog friendly and has done a good job of ignoring the cat. \n\nOdin was returned to us through no fault of his own (darn allergies!) and has had a great start in training and life.  Please send your application for Odin in pronto so you don't miss out. He is up to date on all shots and de-wormings, and carries an adoption fee of $389 which includes his micro chip. This happy little  boy is going to bring lots of joy to some lucky adopters, so don't delay, get your application in to your coordinator Cameron S. at\n\nhttps://tinyurl.com/MAMAS-Cameron\n\nor\n\nhttps://mamasshelter.rescuegroups.org/forms/form?formid=5828\n",

She was terrified when she first came in, but is slowly but surely coming out of her shell. Juniper is 5 years old and has been waiting way too long for her forever home to come find her. Thankfully, she is currently in a foster home and is doing amazing! She loves to lay out in the sun, and get love and attention from her foster mommy. Juniper makes the most loyal friend, is super smart (knows a tons of commands), is highly house trained, crate trained and is just a chill girl to hang out with. Juniper's ideal is home is with a single person household with no other pets. \n\nJuniper is only available to rescue groups, so if you are a rescue and would like more information: please email: rescue@tohmail.org",

She is passionate, animated, charismatic, spicy & sweet and is a devoted companion like no other. When she locks her eyes in yours, hearts go boom and vulnerability takes a whole new meaning.\n\nWilma is seeking a family who understands the breed. Someone patient. Someone dog-savvy and committed to continue her training. Someone who understands behavior and boundaries. Someone looking to earn her trust and in turn have the greatest friend of a lifetime.\n\nWilma would prefer a home with a yard. To set her up for success, a home with older children (over 10) is preferred.\n\nWe love our girl with lilac-blue eyes, who with one look can make the past, present and future rush through your veins. Her brain is to use. Her beauty is to enchant. She yearns engagement. She strives for confidence and enjoys finding solace in a savvy leader. She has so much love to give and will no doubt be an incredible addition to her forever family.\n\nTo learn more about Wilma or to fill out an application http://www.nlolchicago.org/adoption-procedures-and-application\n",

See I am deaf and even though I've lived with it my whole life it's still scary when someone sneaks up on me.I still need to be tested with other dogs. I do love going for walks and sniffing all the wonderful smells! I promise I won't pull to hard, I just get a little excited! Fill out an app today!\n\n*Huck is fully deaf and needs a home with no young children. He is a very smart boy and with the right training he will be able to communicate well with his humans. Past experience with hearing impaired dogs is a plus but not required. We do ask that potential adopters research owning a deaf dog to make sure they understand the training and everyday needs.All cats and dogs adopted from the Chequamegon Humane Association are spayed or neutered, up-to-date on age appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, and microchipped. Dogs are tested for heartworm and cats are tested for FeLV/FIV (results negative unless otherwise noted). A tax-deductible adoption fee of $150 is required for adult dogs, puppies are $200, and dogs over the age of 10 are $85. Adult cat adoption fees are $50, kittens under one year are $90, and cats over the age of 10 are $35.",

Alula has learned in only a week with her fosters to leash walk, wear a harness, and commands such as sit, come, drop, and down. Alula will chill by your side or go on a walk, car ride, wherever with you. But she is also perfectly content to relax by herself and sleeps all night in her crate. She would do best with someone who will take her outside or let her play in a fenced-in back yard for a good bit each day. She's not aggressive at all, in fact she is a little shy at first, but when she warms up to you, she'll want to be your best friend.\n\nIf you are interested in this animal please start by filling out an adoption application at <a href=\"\"http://www.cfp-nc.org/adopt\"\">CFP-NC.org/adopt</a> and we will get in touch with you.",

She came to us as a stray so her history is unknown. She has shown us that she is a super sweet girl who loves attention. She does not like other dogs however, so she would need a home where she can be the center of attention. She is very intelligent and a tendency to be a bit stubborn. She knows commands sit and shake. She loves long walks and to play fetch with her Kong, but she can't do that right now. She has a torn ACL and is set to have surgery to repair it so she can play again.\n\nThe surgery Cookie needs to repair her torn ACL is scheduled with Westview Veterinary Hospital on January 14th. She will need a foster home for her post surgery recovery and rehabilitation which will take 11-12 weeks. We require that this home have no other dogs or stairs. \n\nCookie is currently available as foster to adopt. Her adoption fee is $150, this includes her spay, heartworm test, vaccines current, deworming, heartworm/flea prevention and micro chipped. Her dog license is also required to be purchased for Sandusky County residents at time of adoption, which is an additional $20.75. \n\nPlease visit the shelter to meet him, we show dogs Monday through Friday 1-4:30pm and Saturday 1-3:30pm. Please note, we do not offer same day adoptions.Come and meet your new best friend today! The Humane Society of Sandusky County is open Monday -Friday 1pm - 5pm and Saturdays from 1pm - 4pm.

            "description": "Trevor is an adorable, petite, shy boy who we believe is a mix of Chinese Crested and possibly Chihuahua based on his appearance and temperament. He is very kind and sweet once he gets to know you but initially he is quite timid. He was found as a stray and his owners were never located. We are not sure of his history of course but we think possibly someone was not very kind to him and he may have lived in a fearful environment. Trevor is approximately 10 lbs. and is believed to be about 2 years old. He does well on a leash and in the car. Trevor is scared of children and would do best in a quiet home, perhaps with an older person or couple. \n\nTrevor requires minimal grooming but will need occasional nail trims. \n\nLike many of our rescued dogs, we are not sure how well house trained Trevor is. Frequent outings with lots of praise for doing his business outside will go a long way towards making sure his house training skills are tuned to perfection!\n\nTrevor's adoption fee is $325\n\nThis fee includes at least one health exam at our veterinarian while in our care, altering, all vaccinations including rabies (as permitted by age), a pre-adoption professional grooming and a microchip with lifetime membership that never will cost you a fee. \n All dogs also leave with a new collar and or harness and leash as well as a gift bag which includes among other things, a starter bag of the quality kibble that is being fed at the rescue.\nAdoption fees also allow us the ability to put funds towards the next homeless or unwanted dog in need of rescue!\nIf you'd like to considered to for this adoption or any of our amazing rescues, please fill our the application with the help of this link. https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/AZST/Dog.\nWe review each application carefully. Please understand that sometimes we get numerous applications for particular dogs and as a volunteer based rescue we do not always have the time to respond to each and every one. We do our best to choose the most suitable home for each dog based on their specific personality and needs. \n\nDue to Covid, our application review process has been taking longer. We will usually contact you within 1 week if we have chosen your application to set up a meet and greet. We appreciate all applicants and do our best to pair every dog and family for a successful and happy life.",

I am a playful, silly, and energetic puppy that loves to play. I love to eat chicken nuggets as a snack. I am looking for an active family that will take me running, hiking or any outdoor type adventures. Whatever the adventure, I am your BFF. I am not a fan of cats and will need older children. I have met and played with a husky, but will definitely need a slow introduction to any dog. I will be ready to take on the world with you!!My adoption fee is $200 Houston Area ($550 out of state includes adoption fee, transportation, and health certificate).I am up to date on all my shots, microchipped and neutered. I also tested heartworm negative. Fill out an app at www.soca-fbc.org/adoptables.",

He has been with his foster based trainers for a few months now & is proving what a great boy he can be! \n\nDespite his past, this boy has proved he has endless potential! Rio has come out of his shell & is showing us what a happy boy he is. He bonds to his person & looks to you for reassurance in situations he is unsure of. \n\nRio is a strong boy, who would love a bully breed savvy home. He would do best in a feline free home & would prefer to be in a home without children. He may be willing to share his home with another dog, permitting a successful introduction. \n\nTo set Rio up for success, we would like to do a short foster-to-adopt trial prior to adoption, to make sure that the placement is right for both Rio and the family.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Rio please fill out the application at our website - https://www.furryfriendsct.org/adoption-application",

            "description": "Name: Mumbles\n\nAge: approximately 1 year\n\nCurrent Weight: 35 lbs\n\nRescued from: Tennessee\n\nMumbles was rescued from an area where there is an abundance of homeless dogs, and not a lot of shelter space for them to go while they wait for their forever homes. Mumbles is a very sweet pup but does require a dog savvy owner.   Mumbles is still very much a puppy and is active, he can jump high so we do require applicants to have a fully fenced in yard that is at least 6ft.  Mumbles is dog selective so we are looking to place him in a home with no other dogs and he cannot go to dog parks due to his selective personality.    It would be great to have an adopter with breed experience but applicants must understand the heeler personality/ traits.  Mumbles loves his humans, loves to play and would love a home to cuddle up by your side after a nice run in the yard.\n\nMumbles is up to date on required vaccines, neutered, microchipped\n\nAdoption fee: $375\n\nTo apply to adopt Mumbles, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n\n**Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an approved application.**\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show. We have been told that you can go to the shelter and tell them you are there to meet this particular dog. No walk-ins allowed between 12-3PM and the end of the day. Please request a supervisor for a long timer or at-risk dog. We hope your adoption process is smooth and full of happiness!\n\nPrieta was surrendered by her owner along with two other dogs that lived in the same home; Bubby (A4314074) and Loba (A4314073). These three are really good friends and love each other but they are afraid of people they don't know. They were not leash trained even though they were in the home for over one year. They were probably back yard dogs that weren't trained and didn't socialize with people. Now they ended up at the shelter and are very scared. The behavior staff has been working with the three of them and they are improving. They are starting to learn to walk on a leash and they are very happy to see each other when they are brought to the play yard together. They are still wary of the behavior staff and don't solicit attention from them.\n\nThese dogs are going to need an adopter or rescue that can give them a quiet home and understands that it's going to take a lot of time and patience for them to warm up in their new home. They do not have to be adopted together but they may do better if they could stay together. They should not go to a home with small children. If you are able to open your home to these pups, please come and meet them today! Please bring the whole family who will be living with these dogs to meet them along with any other current dogs in the home.\n\nThis amazing pup is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4314075.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF APPS/INQUIRED WE RECEIVE, WE WILL NOT RESPOND TO APPS/INQUIRES THAT DO NOT MEET THE CRITERIA FOR THIS DOG. Thank you! \n\nMeet Huck!\n\nHuck is fully obedience trained on and off leash.  He is still very active and will require daily exercise no matter the weather.  He would make an excellent hiking buddy! He is excellent on leash, knows heel, sit, down, come, place, no, leave it, off and out. He is NOT a couch potato, but with proper exercise does lay down to chew on his antlers, benebones and even take naps.  He is approximately 110 lbs, neutered, up to date on vaccines, and takes monthly heartworm prevention.  He loves other dogs but can be intimidating to some other dogs as he is rather playful.  He has lived with dogs as small as 17 lbs.. Due to his size and ability to accidentally step on smaller dogs, other dogs in adopters home must be at least 15 lbs. He is very good with small dogs but if he was playing he may accidentally hurt a very small dog by stepping on them accidentally with his big paws.  He has never been with cats but can be cat tested if needed.  Because of his size and excitability we are requiring no kids under 16.  He does need a calm assertive handler as he does like to push his weight around.  He will require a physical fenced in yard (no exceptions). \n\nAdoption fee is $250.00. \nAdoption application & home visit required. \n\nIf interested in Huck fill out an app on our website www.muttsinarutrescue.com",

            "description": "Santo is a 9 month old hunk of love. He gets along well with other dogs and adores children. Due to his size and his exuberance we are wanting to place him in a home with kids over the age of 10 and dogs his size or larger. He is very sweet and loves to snuggle. Santo would benefit from a home that can continue his basic training and can help him work out with his puppy energy!\n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior pets have a history of being kept up to date on vaccines, annual exams and recommended bloodwork. We also do home checks to make sure that your home environment meets the needs of the particular dog you are interested in.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adoption, please fill out our online adoption survey at https://www.olddogsnewdigs.com/adoption-survey/\n\n",

To meet Denali, see the contact information below.\n\nHi, I\u2019m Denali, and I am SO excited to be in a lovely foster home after wandering the streets of Bakersfield. I was lucky that some really nice people found me. I was pretty sick and overweight with open wounds and a terrible sunburn (I\u2019m pale, folks \u2013 the shade is my friend) but even though I wasn\u2019t feeling my best, I was so grateful to be taken care of by kind humans. I\u2019m a 5-year-old cancer survivor who\u2019s doing great after having several tumors removed. Oh, and I\u2019m deaf but it\u2019s no big deal. I see everything! I\u2019ve been recovering in a foster home, losing weight thanks to a twice-daily thyroid supplement, growing lovely snow-white fur, and having regular spa days \u2013 such luxury! I\u2019m the perfect petite size at 42 lbs., and honestly, I\u2019m a completely different dog now! \n\nI\u2019m hoping to find a compassionate adopter, or a forever foster family who will protect me from the sun\u2019s harmful rays and help me to live my healthiest, happiest life. In return, I\u2019ll be the most loving, affectionate doggy ever because once you\u2019ve won my trust, I\u2019m yours.\n\nOkay, yes, I\u2019m a little nervous around new people, a little insecure in new situations, but I\u2019m always willing to try and to trust, even if it takes me a bit of time. I really need to be an only dog in a quiet home with low foot traffic, and if there are children, they need to be teenagers or older. A private yard with lots of shade would be wonderful! I\u2019m crate trained and have good house manners. I\u2019m so ready to find my forever home.\n\nTo meet me, please go to http://waggingdog.org/\n\n",

They are both large dogs weighing around 80-90lbs each. \n\nBowie and Kona are well mannered, mellow and sweet dogs that just enjoy being with their people. Kona (father) is more shy and dependent on his son for confidence and trusting a new situation is 'okay'. \n\nThey both enjoy walks and walk well on leash together. Bowie (son) has a little more energy than his dad and enjoys playing as well. They would make a great pair of family dogs. Bowie and Kona do well with other dogs, but are not super playful so would prefer laid back dogs in their forever home if there are any. They are not tested with cats. Kids over 8. \n\nKona and Bowie are neutered, up to date on shots and microchipped.",

            "description": "Some time ago, working in tandem with another rescue, we posted Matthew looking for a foster or foster-to-adopt home from him. Since then, he has become officially an FFFR dog.\n\nWhen he was brought to CT by another rescue, Matthew needed some guidance and training. Since then, he has been living with a foster-based trainer, and has made a huge amount of progress.\n\nThis boy is a puppy -- only about 10 months old. He is some mixture of herding breeds - not sure which breeds! - and he is totally adorable, and very smart!\n\nMatthew loves the company of other dogs - he would love another dog in the home to play with.\n\nHe needs to live in an adult home, with people who have experience with herding breeds.\n\nMatthew takes some time to get to know new people. Once that happens, he is a true cuddle-bug :)\n\nHe is an active puppy who will need daily physical exercise and mental exercise as well.\n\nA fenced yard would be a big plus for Matthew.\n\nWe want to set him up for success, and will want to do several meet and greets prior to moving him to a home. If you would like to adopt, we will want to do a trial foster-to-adopt placement, to make sure the match is a good one for both Matthew and his new family.\n\nMatthew is adorable, and a happy boy once he is comfortable with his people and environment.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: To foster or foster-to-adopt Matthew, you will need to be located within the state of Connecticut.\n\nTo foster Matthew, or foster-to-adopt, please fill out the appropriate application at our website - https://www.furryfriendsct.org/foster-application\n\nor\n\nhttps://www.furryfriendsct.org/adoption-application",

I am a big cuddle bug and love snuggling on a friendly human's lap.  I am house trained, crate trained, I do great on car rides and super funny.  I like to play, chew toys, eating and sleeping.  I love my humans so much, that I need to be the only dog in the home.  I like short walks, but I am strong. For additional info, please text 702-239-7986   He is good with dogs his size ,,,",

My owners came forward but decided they didn't want to provide me with any meidcal attention so they surrendered me to the shelter. I am very sweet and easy going. I am also good with other dogs. \n\nI get around great on my leg and the vet said it is an old injury and nothing needs to be done for it. So that is good news! I can go up and down the stairs with no problem. \n\nNote from foster: He turned 8 years old in December so is officially a senior-but don't let that fool you! He goes for a one mile walk in the morning and a one mile walk in the evening and is happy to go again. He can get up and down stairs well and also runs! Loves to play with his toys and chase a ball. I make him sit and wait for OK before he gets his food. I can take his food away. He is housetrained and loves his crate. He knows basic commands: Sit, stay, down, shake, leave it. He does not get on furniture unless invited up, does not jump up on people, only barks at delivery trucks. He is working on not barking at delivery trucks and getting much better. He is great outside with all dogs, puppies, kids and people.\n\n********PLEASE READ BELOW PRIOR TO EMAILING IN**********\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog or any other from our rescue, please go to https://www.hobocare.org/adopt to review our home requirements and fill out an application.

Ralphie is a bright boy with a bright future. He is exceptional in so many ways. One would believe he's seen a lot in short life, and he understands how the world works. Ralphie likes to be busy. He's not one to be idle. He'd do well with a job, and during playtime, he'd thrive with toys that make him think. This guy's brain doesn't stop, so fun but challenging games are great exercises for him.Activity is also a necessity for Ralphie. He would be a wonderful student for obedience training, and he'd do well in agility training and competitions also. Ralphie needs a serious owner who will enjoy working with him, while shaping, and molding him into the best dog he can be. If you're ready to be matched with a companion who will inspire you, make your day, and give you tons of love, Ralphie is the pup for you!",

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please download and complete an Adoption Questionnaire from our website and email Dena at DenaE@k-9lifesavers.org\n\nYou can learn about the adoption process and find a Word, PDF and ONLINE version of the questionnaire by visiting: http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/howtoadopt/.\n\nDog's Name: Bunny\n\nEstimated Breed : Lab Pit Mix\n\nApproximate Age: 2 years\n\nApproximate Weight: approx. 54 lbs\n\nCurrently Living at: Foster\n\nAdoption Fee: $300\n\nDOG'S DESCRIPTION\n\nBunny is a spunky sweetheart who loves to give hugs and sit in your lap. Bunny absolutely loves affection so even though she gets along with other dogs she doesn't want them around when getting attention so she would need some work when it comes to sharing a person. Bunny would be a great walking buddy, but also enjoys relaxing with you...as long as she is with you, she's good to go! She has not had a problem when her foster left her loose in the house and only played with her toys while he was away. She has been accident free for a few days now and is extremely smart and learns quickly. She listens well, learns quickly, and is eager to please. She will do best with an experienced adult only family that knows how to handle the big lap dog that can't contain all her love.\n\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\n\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\n\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\n\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\n\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\n\nPlease \"like\" our\nFacebook Page\nfor the most current events and new dogs.\n\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

He's a super handsome, super friendly 52 pounds cattle dog/retriever/super mutt with a heart of gold. Fido came to CCR from a shelter in Arkansas where he had been found stray. Whoever lost Fido must be missing him - this dog is great! He's a tolerant, affectionate, extroverted dog who thinks people are great, especially YOU! Fido lived happily in a home with kids, and we think he'd enjoy being a family dog for homes with kids 12 and up. Fido is an escape artist who can climb fences, and he has a very strong prey drive, likely from growing up in the country where there is lots to chase. He's looking for a home with no other pets where he can be safely contained in the yard by a tie out (he can climb even tall fences.)\n\nTo meet Fido, please submit an application at chicagocaninerescue.org!",

THEN I REALIZED HE IS NOT DESTRUCTIVE SO I STARTED LEAVING THE CRATE DOOR OPEN SO HE JUST SLEEPS IN HIS CRATE WITH DOOR OPEN.\nGood with dogs with proper introductions.  t\nUTD on vaccinations and microchipped.\n\nHere is what his foster mom has to say:\n\nSNOOP LOVES HIS HUMAN & WILL FOLLOW YOU IN THE HOUSE.  HE LOVES WALKS & JUST WALKING IN THE YARD EXPLORING.  IF YOU GIVE HIM A TREAT & IT IS NOT HIS FAVORITE HE WILL NOT EAT IT & LOOK AT YOU WITH THOSE SOULFUL EYES, LIKE WHERE ARE THE DELICIOUS TREATS YOU GAVE ME YESTERDAY?!  SNOOP IS VERY LOW MAINTENANCE. \n \nTHE ONLY ISSUE SNOOP HAS, IS HE WILL GRAB YOUR HAND IF YOU GIVE HIM A TREAT.  WE ARE WORKING ON THAT.\n\nI LOVE THIS BOY!! HE SHOULD BE THE POSTER DOG FOR ALL DOGS.  HE IS LOW MAINTENANCE, WELL BEHAVED WHEN LEFT ALONE, NEVER HAS AN ACCIDENT IN THE HOME & VERY EASY GOING.  HE WILL BE A GREAT FAMILY DOG!! \n\n**** He hasn't been neutered due to his age.\n\n\n",

She has been very gentle, although I have learned she does not like her feet touched!! She is absolutely 85 lbs of pure LOVE! She is a scared of a lot that I'm working with her and trying to adjust her to... vacuum cleaner, darkness and trying to clean her muddy feet after out back..But she is house trained and not crazy about the crate. Only 1 accident. But I do think after she is totally comfortable she can be left home alone outside the crate. She has only barked once while in the backyard chasing a squirrel. I see that see can be reactive and alert to smaller animals. She is gentle but stubborn. She needs an experienced dog handler. If you are interested in meeting Annie, please call our foster coordinator at 301-780-7202.",

Nik will require an adopter with experience with large, active dogs and some understanding of working with less than desirable behaviors. WTFR is a positive reinforcement rescue and seeks adopters that believe in the same training methodology.\n\nNik displays mouthing behaviors. When extremely excited or worked up, Nik may pinch or mouth a human. He does NOT break skin or leave any marks. He has improved greatly with increased, appropriate enrichment and stimulation. He is learning to get a toy to hold in his mouth when he is excited. Nik\u2019s backstory is unclear, so we are not sure how this behavior came to be, however these behaviors are not aggressive, simply undesirable. (Nik is fostered by a CPDT-KA dog trainer who can assert that these behaviors are not aggressive.)\n\nNik is a mix of high energy breeds. He can settle down in the home and in his crate, however he will need more mental and physical stimulation than the average dog; meaning more than a few walks around the block. Nik likes playing with toys and fetch. He will seek to find toys tossed out of sight (preliminary test for search and rescue evaluation). He may have enough drive to do search and rescue or hobby sports if his adopter is interested, but at this time we don\u2019t think his drive is extremely strong. \n\nAlthough not aggressive, Nik would not be a good match for a home with children. We believe Nik is good with other dogs from previous history and he has not shown any concerning behavior towards dogs in foster, but he still needs to be formally evaluated with dogs (we will update bio when completed).  \n\nNik is crate trained and seem house broken. He is neutered and will be up to date on vaccinations.",

It might take me a little to warm up at first, but once we're pals I'll just melt into you. I'm looking for a mellow home environment with no other animals because I require all the lovins. I'm also looking for a home who is either familiar with dogs with behaviour quirks or someone who doens't mind working on them with me. You see, since I'm timid of new things I can become very stressed out and overstimulated and I just don't like being put in those kind of situations. So I would love a calm, understanding home who's willing to be patient and work with me on these quirks. I promise I have so much to offer in return! I love lounging around with you and having quality snuggle-seshs but also love my daily walks! (Especially after gaining some quarantine weight). I really just want a relaxing home to call my own and someone to give all my love to. If you'd like to meet up or have more questions, just call my friends at the Santa Maria shelter and they'd be happy to help!",

Sadie lived life in an outdoor pen, neighbors fed her for over 5 years when they moved in because she was skin and bones from her owners neglect.  Fast forward to today, and Sadie was relinquished to us and she is a very healthy weight, has a shiny black coat, and all the comforts of an inside home.  Due to Sadie's isolation, she is not animal friendly and can be reactive on the leash.  Sadie graduated from Unchained Melodies Reactive Dog Class and is manageable on a leash, but she is certainly not a dog that can interact with other animals.  \n\nWhen Sadie came into rescue we noticed an prominent limp.  X-rays show that she has a luxating patella, basically her knew pops out of place.  Surgery was not recommended at her age and recovery time.  Medical management seems to be making Sadie very comfortable and she enjoys her walks around the neighborhood and on the trail.  \nIf you are willing to give a dog reactive dog all the comforts of home and spoil her to the end of her days, Sadie may be your girl! \n\nFun Facts:\n\nAge (best guess) - 7-8\nBreed (best guess) - Pitbull/Lab\nCurrent Weight - 47 lbs\nDog Friendly - No\nCat Friendly - No\nKid Friendly - yes\nPotty Trained - yes\nCrate Trained - yes\nLeash Trained - yes\n\nAll of our adult dogs are current on vaccinations, de-wormed, heart worm tested, spayed/neutered, on monthly preventatives & micro chipped prior to adoption. \n\n*Adoption Fee is $200.00, No out of State Adoptions ,Virtual Home Visits \n Required  \n\n*We do not require fenced yards for all dogs, fenced yards are required based on a dogs needs. *No invisible fences.\n\nIf you would like to meet this dog, please fill out an adoption application at www.unchainedmelodies.org/adopt/\n\nThank you for adopting!\n",

            "description": "Meet Poet!\n\nPoet was left in the night drop box at Animal Friends of the Valley after being found as a stray. He had a large ulcerated mass on his face near his ear. Fortunately, our vet was able to safely remove it. Poet is much more comfortable without the mass and because we started him on pain medication for his arthritis. He's feeling like a new man! Poet is approximately 13 years old and weighs 45 lbs. - a perfect midsize pup!\n\nPoet seemed a little confused in the Frosted Faces play yard, so we were thrilled he got to go on a two-week Frosted Fling, and that they decided to foster him through adoption! As Poet settled in, his sweet personality began to emerge. He began to engage more with his Foster Family and their dog. Poet now greets his Foster Mom with a wagging tail as he comes inside from potty breaks, and recently, for the first time, he ran around excitedly after being let out of his crate! These are precious moments for a dog like Poet, and we know there more ahead when he's given time to settle into a Forever home. Here's what else we know about this gentle boy:\n\nPoet's Fling Family helped him establish a successful potty routine that keeps him from having accidents. He goes out within 30 mins after eating, approximately every 4 hours after that, and 30 minutes before bedtime. Poet has a good appetite and shows no food aggression while he eats near the other dog in the home. He loves treats and adorably follows his Foster Mom into the kitchen to get one. Poet is low-key guy who enjoys slow walks with plenty of opportunities for sniffing.\n\nDoes Poet sounds like the perfect fit for the dog shaped spot in your heart? Apply to meet him: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees, and we help with medical costs!\n\nApply to become a family: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 2/2/21 KG",

She was picked up as a stray, so her background is not known to us.  She is a very happy dog.  Nala enjoys being with people and receiving attention.  She would not do well in a home with small children. She is a high energy dog that would need a fenced yard.  She enjoys playing with a tennis ball.  She is currently learning the sit command but will need more training.   She walks well on a leash.  Nala is heartworm negative, has current vaccinations, and is spayed.  Her adoption fee is $225, which includes her Avid microchip and registration.  $75 of her adoption fee has been sponsored for an approved adopter.",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Maple, and I am as sweet as pure maple syrup. I am a one year old, 32lb, beagle Australian cattle dog mix who cannot wait to meet you. My foster family calls me Maple Sue, and I know that it is me. I love people and my foster sister. I love to take walks, long and short, with my foster sister. My foster dad says that I am a dream to walk, no pulling at all. We play in the house and in the yard. Inside, I have found a stash of toys, and haven't met one yet that I don't like. I love to carry of of them onto the couch, and play with all of them.  Outside I like to play chase and wrestle with my foster sister, and I usually stop when she has had enough. I had a couple small accidents on the first day, but now my foster family takes me out a lot so no more. Plus, I am better at telling them that I need to go out. I am working on basic commands, and almost have sit under my belt, and picking up shake from watching my foster sister. I still need some work on keeping all four paws on the floor, but I'm just so excited!  I love other dogs, and really love people. I am more interested in the cats than they are in me, but I leave them be when I'm told. I haven't seen any little people yet, but I think I would love them, too. I go into my crate on my own sometimes just to relax, or for some me time. It sometimes takes a few minutes, but I always calm down and fall asleep. Because I'm so smart, love to please people, and love treats, my foster family thinks I'll be easy to train. Did I mention that I love people? I love to snuggle on the couch and give kisses to my foster family. I will stop when they tell me they have had enough, even though I have so much more. My foster family thinks I will be a great addition to an active family, maybe a fenced yard so I can run around, who would like an affectionate, smart and sweet Maple Sue.\n\nIf you would like to be considered as an adopter for one of our great dogs, please go to our website- www.luckymuttsrescue.org and submit an application. Our process includes landlord approval and vet checks. We try to get applications processed in a timely fashion. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and possibly cancel your application from being processed, so please make sure that you include valid information and contact information. You will be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions. Once your application has been processed, you may be contacted by one of our volunteers to set up a home visit interview. After your home visit interview is completed, all of your information is reviewed. If your application is approved, you will be notified. Meet and greets with dogs are only set up with approved applicants, so if you want to meet a dog, it is vital that your home visit is completed and that your application is approved. Adoption fees generally are: \n$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test and prevention (if old enough) and veterinary inspection certificate. Breeds of dogs are best guesses and we don't guarantee any breed. Adopters are chosen by what situation will be best for the dog. Submitting an application for a particular dog does not guarantee that you will be the applicant chosen to adopt that dog. Lucky Mutts strives to match dogs to the best home and will work with your family to find a good match. Please remember that we are an organization that is completely run by volunteers, so please be patient as many of us work full time jobs, have families and also foster dogs. Thanks for wanting to adopt!",

River Dee is affectionate and full of kisses. A total big MUSH:)  He just loves everyone he meets....especially other dogs.  River Dee will flourish with structure and an owner with experience,  since he tends to  act  like a tiny puppy. He is crate trained and is happy to settle in his little den for the night or whenever seen fit.  He is good with other dogs and it is suggested that River Dee go to a home with children over the age of 12 years old, reason being his goofy energy, need for love, and not realizing he is not the size and weight of a chihuahua.  River Dee is at our adoption center waiting patiently for YOU.   River Dee would NOT do well in a home with cats.  This handsome boy will truly complete your family...PLEASE give him that chance! \n\n**PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING**\n\nIf you are interested in adopting any of the puppies, our adoption fee is $495 ( puppies) $375 (adults) which includes transportation from the South and we do suggest putting a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several littermates.\n\n**Please understand that we are a volunteer based organization. While our volunteers try to answer all emails/questions as quickly as possible, below please find answers to some of our most frequently asked questions. We ask that you please read these FAQ's to see if your question has already been answered before emailing additional questions:\n\n- If a dog or puppy is listed on Petfinder, they are still available. Please do not email asking if they are still available. If a dog or puppy is still listed, then we are still accepting applications :-) We do not go on a first come first serve basis, but on best fit for the family and most importantly, the puppy or dog.\n\n- We are taking our best guess on breed and size when fully-grown (or already an adult), based on the puppy's/dog\u2019s physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. We rarely are able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. \n\n- Our dogs/puppies are either at our Adoption Center in Brewster, NY, in foster care, or are adopted straight from transport. An application is necessary to meet any dog/puppy. Often, dogs and puppies are spoken for before they arrive. Many people feel more comfortable with a meet and greet which we completely understand and respect, however please know you are taking a chance of that puppy/dog getting adopted by someone else before hand.\n\n- The way to start the process for any dog or puppy is by filling out an application. Applications for foster or adoption can be found at www.snarrnortheast.org and by clicking either adopt or foster from the main menu. If you fill out an application, please make sure you answer all the questions in as much detail as possible and that you receive a confirmation email, otherwise we did NOT receive it.",

Eleanor is a very sweet old lady who just wants all the love and a warm dog bed to lay in all day long. Tink is a very sweet kitty who enjoys affection and light playtime. Tink would be better without any other cats, especially female cats. \nThese two girls are a bonded pair and need each other for support. I really hope they have a home to call theirs for Christmas .",

            "description": "This youngster is truly a firecracker and at just 9 months there is still plenty of time to enjoy all of her puppy antics.  Bindee greets each new day with unbridled enthusiasm and literally squeezes all that she can out of every waking hour.  She is around 35 lbs., has an easy to maintain hair coat, and a \u201ccan do\u201d attitude.  Her perfect companion needs to be very active and intent on including her in the activities of the day.  She is very athletic and needs to be busy, I believe she would excel at agility, frisbee, or a running partner.  Bindee loves being outside and would adore a day on the boat, traveling in an RV, or hiking a challenging trail then snuggling up next to the campfire ready to do it all over the next day.  Bindee can be a bit sassy so consistent manners/obedience  will be a necessity.  She will need an age appropriate play partner, a sturdy fence, and no small children (not sure about cats).\nSo if you are looking for an excuse to be more active in 2021...Bindee is up for the challenge and won\u2019t let you waste a moment of your day. So why not grab a leash, throw open the door, and together relish the abundance at of each new day!\n\n\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

            "description": "Update:  Marley got some disappointing medical news and needs a very special understanding person to open their heart and home to him.   We learned when I know he was only a year old in his original home, he was hit by a car and had a broken pelvis and needed his tail amputated.  So he healed and was able to walk again, he does leak some urine likely due to nerve damage from the injury.  He will need someone to keep him clean and wear a belly band/diaper wrap.  This poor guy has been through a lot in his young life and we know he\u2019s not an easy placement but it only takes that one special person to change his life... could it be you?  Email njwoof@cs.com to meet him.  \n\n\nThis 5 year old chiweenie (chi/doxie mix) is short on legs but long on quirks in true doxie fashion ? \n\nHe was passed around a bit after his owner died and ended up in a shelter... he\u2019s a very nervous insecure little dude but sweet once he bonds to his person and is accustomed to a calmer adult home.  He is nervous with strangers and thinks it\u2019s his job to protect his chosen people so needs lower traffic home without close neighbors.  Marley failed his resource guarding test at the shelter, biting the fake hand (but really, does any doxie love having their stuff taken away!?) so his person should give him space and time to bond and practice trading him if you need to take something from him.  He came into the shelter with a skin infection that has already much improved with medicated baths and treatment, and he is hypothyroid and on inexpensive medication he takes easily in cheese!   He\u2019s the size and shape of a standard doxie, about 18lbs.  \n\nMarley is nervous around other dogs and about selective about his canine friends as well, although he\u2019s starting to improve in his foster home and even started to play with a chihuahua friend!  So he may be able to live with the right dog pending a meet and slow introductions. \n\nWe are hoping we can find a doxie-savvy person who will understand and appreciate him for who he is and love him unconditionally. \n\nPlease email njwoof@cs.com to meet Marley\n\nDue to COVID-19, we will not be holding our Sunday adoption events until further notice, but we can schedule socially distant appointments with a specific dog outdoors at our vet\u2019s office:\nVCA Morris Plains Animal Hospital \n3009 Rt 10 East \nMorris Plains (Denville on GPS) NJ 07950\nNow is the perfect time to open your home to a needy dog!  Submit an application from our website www.secondchance.petfinder.com to speed up the adoption process\nAll our dogs reside in foster care in Northern NJ until adoption. We are a small all-volunteer organization focused on rescuing local dogs from area shelters, as well as accepting some surrenders and puppy mill rescues. \n",

I have been at the shelter since Nov 02, 2020. Meet Maverick! Maverick has been at the shelter for a while and is ready to find his furrever home. This guy is all about people! He is a pretty mellow guy who enjoys leisurely walks but then just wants to chill on the couch and have some cuddle time with his humans. Maverick is looking to be your ONE and ONLY! He wants all the love and attention on him. Since Maverick like to do his own thing, apartment living is not a good fit for him. He doesnt want to share space with other animals. Maverick is just looking for a laid-back home to call his own! For more information about Maverick, please email DOGFOSTER@THEHUMANESOCIETY.ORG",

            "description": "Don't let his resting grumpy face fool you, Albus is an excitable boy that is full affection and love. Anytime you walk over to him his tail immediately begins to wag and his face starts to smile! He is also very playful and loves to chase the waves or play with toys. Albus is a bog boy at 2 years old and 25kg and probably some type of Boxer mix with maybe some St Bernard based on his colouring. While Albus will need a bit of training this handsome boy is certainly worth the effort!\n\nAlbus was abandoned by his previous owners and left to fend for himself on the streets. He became very skinny and sickly and some kind neighbours that had been watching over him contacted us for help.\n\nDespite his sad past Albus has a lot of love in his heart and is very excitable whenever he gets attention from his humans. Sometime his excitement means that he jumps up on you and mouths (but never very hard) so an owner that has experience correcting this would be beneficial so he can get endless cuddles and pets.\n\nAlbus is very good at listening to instructions and trying to do the right things so he only needs guidance to show him the way.\n\nSomething in his past has made Albus very nervous of new dogs that he meets while on leash, although he tends to be fine when greeting all the new dogs to our house when he is off leash. His reaction comes from fear and owners that can teach him how to behave and have the patience for him is essential. He is improving all the time and even goes to the dog park with over 20 other dogs but can not yet be off leash without constant and close supervision. We know that with the right owner he can be taught to no longer fear other dogs while on leash but it of course will take some time. Albus would be very happy to have a dog companion but adopters must know that they will have to facilitate a proper introduction for Albus so he knows he can trust his new pup sibling !\n\nHe is definitely a dog that is used to living alone but shows no signs of aggression to our other dogs in the house and very happily co exists with them. He even recently has started to play with one of our bigger females which has been a big step for Albus and we are hoping he will start to play more and more! Albus would likely try to hunt cats so he would prefer a home with no cats.\nHe has done quite well with kids both calm and excited, and was known as the \"childrens dog\" when he lived on the streets as he loved to play with kids, so we would be comfortable adopting him into a home with older dog savvy kids, over the age of we'd say 7 years old, and we will be firm on this solely because as we mentioned  he likes to be a little mouthy when he plays sometimes and we would hate for it to be seen as him being rough with a young child\n\nWe love this gorgeous and unique, grumpy faced boy and we know he will make his new family smile. If you think he is the right dog for you then please inquire with some info about yourself/ your home so we can see if we think this special boy could be the right match for you !",

            "description": "LAB- Sleek black coat with some white around the muzzle area.\nSENIOR LAB- Est DOB: 2012\nARRIVAL:  July 7, 2020\nHISTORY:  Eli had been languishing for months in a NC shelter and when the shelter closed due to Covid-19, Eli was quickly running out of options.  We spoke up for him before it was too late.\n\nWe are absolutely thrilled to formally introduce you to our amazing Eli!\n\nThese days Eli can\u2019t seem to stop smiling, and here\u2019s why: To say that 2020 has been a tough year for many of us would be an understatement, and Eli is no exception. Eli came to us from a shelter in North Carolina where he had been languishing for months. Due to COVID-19, that shelter closed, and Eli, stressed from shelter life, needed to get out. To make matters worse, Eli was sick with tick-related illnesses and heartworms. Things were looking bleak, and the shelter put out a call for help on his behalf. Eli\u2019s luck changed dramatically when CFC spoke up for him and welcomed him to the sanctuary. When word spread of this new development, donations poured in from all over the U.S. to cover his medical treatment. After his mandatory rest and recuperation, Eli recently received a clean bill of health, and he is more than ready to embark on the next leg of his journey.\n\nEli is an older lab mix, but don\u2019t let his adorable graying brows and beard fool you\u2013he has plenty of energy and desire to go and do and play and go and do some more. Eli is a good-natured, gentle, friendly, and playful yet easy-going guy who loves people (and the treats they dole out!), going for walks, playing with toys of all kinds, and fetching tennis balls. When people approach his pen, he leans his whole body against the fencing to create maximum exposure for receiving pets. He loves to collect toys in the exercise arena and will gently hand them to you if you want to join in on the fun.\n\nWe\u2019re hoping Eli\u2019s year will continue on this positive trend and wind up much better than it started. He has one more obstacle to overcome: finding a home of his own! With his sweet temperament and playful demeanor, we think Eli would fit in well with just about any family situation\u2013you name it, Eli\u2019s your guy. If you have another dog, we\u2019d be happy to set up a meet-and-greet to make sure everyone agrees it\u2019s a good fit. Don\u2019t wait! Contact Caring For Creatures now to set up a time to meet this special boy. You won\u2019t be disappointed.\n\nStaff Update Dec 2020: Eli is an eight year old lab mix who has been at CFC for the better part of a year. When I first started working as part of the animal care team, Eli was recovering from heartworm. He had to have indoor \"quiet time\" for most of the day and was clearly not feeling like himself! He has since made a full recovery and the difference is night and day. Eli has the energy of a much younger dog and gets excited whenever someone approaches his pen. Enter and he will likely reward you by wrapping his front legs around your waist. He loves visitors almost as much as he loves walks and loves walks almost as much as he loves food. He seems to get along well with other dogs and is a quick learner when it comes to training and cues. Eli is a happy, adaptable dog that would make a welcome addition to most homes, assuming he's given time to acclimate.",

Azul is learning what it feels like to be loved and cared for since his previous owners didn\u2019t treat him with love and respect. He\u2019s a friendly, sweet boy who loves a good conversation with his husky accent. Azul would do best in a home that is familiar with his breed. This warm and sweet boy is hoping to finally have a family that cares and loves him unconditionally. \n\nA physical fence is required for adoption. \n\nTo meet Azul:\nPlease email Rescue@LamanchaAnimalRescue.org and subject line: Azul\n\n\nNeutered, UTD vaccinations, chipped, wormed.\n\nHousetrained.  \n\n",

            "description": "We met Sweet Spunky Shelby when we were bringing pig ears as a Christmas treat to a local shelter in NC. \n\nShelby was being held on a cruelty case, but on top of that she had been born with a significant birth defect.  She was born without a tail and no anus, also known as atresia ani.   \n\nYou would never know it, because although Shelby was tiny, she was mighty.  If this defect was not corrected, she would eventually develop bladder and then kidney infections which could have killed her. \n\nSo we stepped up, said Yes! to taking her into our rescue. \n\nShelby\u2019s birth defects were more significant than we knew, and she is now recovered after 3 surgeries to get her all straightened out and ready for her fairytale ending.  \n\nShelby has so much zest for life and a ton of love to give.   Which is exactly why this post might be one of the hardest to write. \n\nWe are head over heels in love with this feisty lady. \n\nHowever, our home, while it\u2019s been a perfect place for her to lay her head and recover and learn to love, it\u2019s not her forever home because she needs more attention than we can provide.     She is living as a part time family member and that\u2019s not the life I want for her.  She needs a special family who will love her fully and completely and is willing to allow her to be the only dog,  Trust me she has enough love to give to you!   \n\nShelby is crate trained and does not mess her crate.  She is working on house training and has made significant progress.  She walks well on a leash and adores playing fetch.  She is active and goofy and such a sweet baby.  Oh... She loves posing for the camera and lots of treats. \n\nMedically she requires canned GI food (the only residual side effect of her birth defect).   This helps her go potty without issue.  It will be very important to keep up with these things to keep her happy and healthy.  She is also on anti-anxiety meds which are very minimally priced per month (approx $25). \n\nWhile Shelby is mostly house trained, she does need someone who will be understanding if you don\u2019t get her outside fast enough, because once she starts pooping it\u2019s not possible to stop it (she has no sphincter). She will find a pee pad if you keep it in a routine spot.  Her new family will get lots of coaching from us (Grace and Linda) as We know her body rhythms, and routine will be important, and crating when you are not home so she doesn\u2019t mess the floor. \n\nWe will require lots of updates and \u201cAuntie\u201d status as this little girl stole our hearts. \n\nWe know the right family is out there, but am willing to wait until that day arrives. \n\nWe are officially posting Shelby for adoption.  As hard as it will be to have her leave us, she will always be part of the Tanner family, our commitment to her has been and always will be to do what is in her best interest. \n\nIf you are interested in having Shelby join your family, please complete our adoption application at:\nhttps://form.jotform.com/83613156425152\n\nPlease be advised that we will require a home visit and a in person meeting with you prior to adoption.    While Shelby is currently in DE, both Linda  and I are committed to whatever travel may be necessary in order to place her in the perfect home.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out to us with any questions you may have in regards to Shelby and her care.",

After she had her puppies she was a little skittish and nervous, but since they've been born she has become more relaxed. She loves cuddles and attention after she sees she can trust you. She is house trained. She loves the crate. She is an escape artist, so a fully fenced yard is a must have. She will be spayed, microchipped and be up to date on vaccines before she leaves us.\n\nPlease note: We will happily answer any questions you may have about our animals available for adoption.....AFTER we have received a completed adoption application. That is the FIRST STEP in our adoption process.\n\nYou can have a meet and greet set up once your application is approved. Your patience is greatly appreciated. We do receive a high volume of emails daily; therefore, please allow up to 2 business days for a return email. We are a nonprofit, volunteer run organization. We appreciate your email and work hard to reply as soon as possible.\n\nThe applications can be found at https://www.jessaminehumanesociety.org",

The application to adopt can be found at www.camorescue.com.\n\n(Not 100% potty trained yet. Would do better in a home with another dog)\n\nSherlock is a very sweet boy! He has so much love to give and loves to snuggle! He is very quiet, and hardly barks. He is working on his potty training. He recently got neutered so he doesn\u2019t mark as much as he used to. He is very smart! Sherlock enjoys car rides especially the ones that go to Starbucks because he LOVES Puppuccinos! \n\nHe gets along with other dogs. Not a big fan of dog toys but he\u2019ll play with others if he\u2019s somewhat interested. His true focus is his human. Sherlock will be a great companion to someone who lives a relaxed life at home.   Sherlock is 2-3 years old and weighs 17 lbs. \n\nRead more about Sherlock at www.thepupblog.com/post/meet-sherlock\n\nAdoption fees are variable. Up to date vaccines, microchip, spay/neuter are included in the fee.\n\nOnce your application has been approved, we will put you in touch with the foster to set up a  meet and greet. We are a foster based RESCUE, not a shelter. All of our dogs are in individual foster homes. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We select the best applicant for each dog, based on the dog's needs. \nFor the safety of our small breed dogs and based on our past experiences, we will not place our dogs in homes with large breed dogs.    \n\nCAMO rescue is a 501c3 whose primary focus is rescuing small dogs from the euthanasia list from high kill TX shelters.   \nEIN # is 46-5486022\nWe rescue 800+ animals a year.\n\nFollow us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/camorescue\n\nOur donation link is http://www.paypalme/camorescue \n\nWe are strictly volunteer based, no salaries are paid and 100% of donations go towards rescuing dogs.",

That being said, he does not enjoy being touched by humans until he is very comfortable with them. He is not mean and will not hurt a fly, but he will keep his distance. He prefers quieter households with a clear routine. If something is different (a chair is moved, or there is a new box from amazon) be patient with him until he can assess the threat level. He is well behaved on walks, but again, does best in quieter areas with out a lot of people or bikes. He is an outdoorsy fellow when given a choice and would rather camp out then sleep inside. When he is in the mood, he will gladly snuggle next to his canine friends on the couch or the bed... and its ok if you happen to be there as well. If you are looking for a friend for your dog, and you are experienced and patient, you will enjoy Todds antics and quirky personality...

            "description": "Brawny is a sweet boy. He is 9 months old. Brawny is 80 to 90 pounds and still growing. He is energetic. He came from a loving home and with a sister- Blocky. He loves to play, whether with other dogs or with toys. As a puppy, he will need a home that gives him lots of activity, training, and attention. He might prefer a home where he would have a doggie pal.\nHe is neutered and has his rabies shot. He has one more set of puppy shots, due the 14th of January.\n*Note that puppies are at the highest end of our prices.* Also note that we ask that new owners be able to be home often, at least at first, because of the time and attention that a new puppy needs.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\n\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

I'm a little aloof and just a beautiful pup! I'm crate trained, love to run around in the yard, know my name and come when you call me (for the most part). I also LOVE treats. I never knew there could be so much love in the world until I was given some treats!\n\nPrince is looking for someone to give him lots of love. While we will never know his life before we got him, I suspect that his prior owners whomever they were did not spend any time with him. He loves to be near people and loves being pet! \n\nWe always recommend crate training, positive reinforcement training, exercise, playtime, and a regular schedule for potty breaks when bringing a new dog/puppy into your home. Adjustment takes time for both you and your new family member, so remember to be patient and enjoy this new and exciting time!\nIncluded in the adoption fee are age appropriate vaccinations, heartworm testing, deworming, spay or neuter surgery, and microchip.",

Adjustment takes time for both you and your new family member, so remember to be patient and enjoy this new and exciting time!\nIncluded in the adoption fee are age appropriate vaccinations, heartworm testing, deworming, spay or neuter surgery, and microchip.",

She is a senior girl, but don't let her age fool you. She is still quite energetic and likes to play. Molly is only 28 lbs and house trained. She is spayed, up to date on vaccines, on heartworm prevention and microchipped. Molly would probably do best in a home with no other dogs. She is a little unsure of children. Teenagers would probaby be OK. We are unsure about cats. If you can give Molly her forever home, please fill out an application at myhstc.org or call 229-995-7845 if you have any questions. Applications can be submitted at www.myhstc.org\n\nAdoption fee is $85\n\nWe do allow out of state adoptions however, you must be willing to travel in person to adopt. We do not transport nor ship sight unseen pets for many reasons.",

I was caught by animal control when I was living in a field in Rosenberg, TX along with a bunch of older puppies that looked to be mine. I had been there for quite some time and people were feeding me, but no one could catch me or the babies. When we were finally caught, the nice people from the rescue came to get me and my babies, to help us get used to people.\nMy foster mom and dad have taken their time and been patient with me to get me to come out of my shell. Whoever adopts me needs to be patient as well, because it was pretty traumatic and scary to be raising a litter of puppies in a field!\nI sleep all night on a dog bed and don't have accidents in the house. I will whine a bit when I need to go out. I go out to the fenced yard to do my but come right back in when I'm called. I'm not a fan of the leash and don't care to be picked up. I get along with all my foster brothers and sisters, big and small and am pretty submissive. A friendly, companion dog in the adopters house to show me the ropes, would be a big plus for me.\nI am spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, and have tested heartworm negative. My adoption fee is $250.

Easton is crate trained and working on his house manners. Easton is in a foster home with two large German Shepherds which he enjoys playing with.\n\t\t\nHe has some prey drive and he loves to chase, so no small animals for this boy.  Playing fetch is always fun with him as he will drop ball on command. This young boy is eager to please his person and is always at your feet or nearby. Being a young dog, he will require a good walk or run keeping him active and engaged with lots of socialization.\n\t\t\t\nEaston may look elsewhere for stimulation so teaching him leash control and recall command is a must.\n\nThis dog is a Level 3. Please be sure you understand what a dog of this Level requires. Go to our home page for an explanation of the Dog Rating Levels.\n\nFor more information and to see when this dog will be attending an Adoption Day, please see our Dogs page on our main website at www.gcgsr.org. \n\nWe operate within a reasonable driving distance from the Greater Sacramento area, the Central Valley down to Merced, and Lake Tahoe. A reasonable driving distance is determined by where one of our volunteers is willing to drive within our areas of service. That means we don't adopt out of our area, to Southern California, or Out of State. \n\n\nThank you for visiting!",

            "description": "Mallory is a brindle pitty, who is around 3 years old and is 51lbs. She is fully house trained and good in the house. I Leave her free range in the house when I leave or baby gate her to the kitchen and she does not bother a thing.  \nShe is Good with other dogs. She sometimes wants to play rough and is vocal when playing, so it scares some dogs. She is in foster with 3 dogs that don't play and she does great with them.  She has now done great with really playful visiting dogs thst actually haven't been scared of her play growling. She plays really well when they play back.  I will not home her with another female pit or a female alpha that plays.  She needs a silly fun playmate or just someone chill that will nap with her. \n   She loves kids.  She has not lived with kids, but she loves visiting kids or seeing kids in public. She gets excited and will ditch me for a child, every time.  \nAbsolutely NO cats, or birds, or other critters like that. She goes bananas when she sees critters. She has done fine seeing Cows and horses. I can't tell if she is scared of them or just has no interest, but she does not react to them.  She is a sweet girl. She is fun and loves to play with toys and run but also likes to nap. She Loves to be under the covers and gives a good laugh when we see her burrowing. She would prefer to sleep in the bed, but does fine sleeping in my living room with the other dogs. \nShe loves riding in the car and sometimes rides around with me at work all day. Loves water but not huge fan of the bath.  She is a bit grumpy when she is tired and likes to sleep through the night and is definitely not a morning dog. It takes a bit to encourage her to get out from under the blankets and get her day started. \n   She does fine with my 4ft fence.  She will need a fenced yard.  When she is off leash, not in a fence, she does not listen. She will follow her nose and keep on trotting. She is excellent on walks with a harness.\n   She is spayed and up to date on vet care. $150 \nWaverly Mo.\n    \n   There will be an application to fill out. \n  Please make sure bully breeds are allowed in your area before calling.\n\n     Please call and leave a message or text Laura 660-641-5667 \n",

He is approximately 5 yrs old and super super sweet, however he has a stubborn side and sometimes reacts by growling and/or trying to bite... especially when he is resting and comfortable and you need him to move or trying to get him in a crate.  90% of the time he is an angel but 10% of the time he turns into a beast and is not for an inexperienced dog person or household. He needs someone that understands him and his boundaries. \nChewey is great with other dogs and enjoys playing with them and also loves playing with his favorite toys and hoarding tennis balls in his favorite bed. He is also great with a majority of people, he doesn't like some men, and has no problem with children although we will only allow him to go into a adult only home or one with dog experienced older children.\n\nChewey is also UTD on vaccines, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, neutered and healthy but he does have allergies which requires him to see the vet regularly to get a shot to control them. He also has had recurring untreated ear infections before we rescued him so this led to growths in both ear canals that we had to have surgically removed. That helped a lot however he is, and always will be, prone to ear infections most likely due to his allergies so that is something that will always need to be monitored by you and your vet.\n\nChewey has had a horrible and painful past, due to raging ear infections, but he is super special and just like every other animal he deserves his perfect person and happily ever after.  If you think you could be that perfect special person for him please fill out an adoption application for consideration found at www.cubbyscrusade.org under forms.",

If he were a human, he\u2019d be a party planner \u2013 always willing to do whatever he can to make sure everyone is having a good time. He\u2019ll keep you laughing at all points during the day, and his sweet demeanor make him a dream to be around.\n\nGimlet is a very observant dog and always has his head on a swivel when outside of the home. He is a little wary of strangers and requires slow introductions that allow him time to get to know the person before they interact with him. Gimlet does best with female dogs and non-dominant males and needs close observation to ensure play with other dogs doesn\u2019t escalate. He rides well in the car, does well with loud noises, and is fully crate trained. Not much correction is required with Gimlet, he responds to voice commands and light corrections on a prong collar only when necessary. He has nearly mastered basic obedience and is working on more advanced commands in his foster home. Gimlet will need to be muzzled at the veterinarian\u2019s office and may require sedation for more advanced exams, however we expect this to improve as he is continuously socialized in his forever home.\n\nGimlet will thrive in a house with someone that has Malinois experience and is willing to enforce boundaries and routine as he continues to mature. He wants nothing more than to be a part of his handler\u2019s life, and so will do best in a home where he can be included in most, if not all, activities. Gimlet is still young but may find certain sports enjoyable as his drive continues to build. Overall, this boy just wants someone who sees life the same way he does: a party just waiting to be enjoyed!\n\nWEST COAST ADOPTIONS ONLY\n\nMust have previous or current, purebred Malinois experience OR other high drive working breed experience\n\nOur adoption process includes- completion of an application, followed by a telephone interview. If that goes well, we will arrange for a home visit.\nAdoption Fee: $500.00. Transport along Interstate 5 (Bakersfield, CA to Bellingham, WA) is available but cost not included in adoption fee. \n\nPlease visit www.woofproject.org and fill out an adoption application located here https://www.woofproject.org/application",

He is house and crate trained and loves his crate. NO CATS for this boy but he can be with a submissive dog. He is low to moderate energy and loves his car rides and puppuccinos!!! A fenced yard would be best for him so he can play ball and sniff. He considers himself a Ladies Man but if here is a male figure in the home he needs to show confidence towards Tanner and a slow introduction. He is almost 3 years old so he's out of the puppy stage and just a well behaved dog. He is a great snuggler and has good recall.  NO young kids!!!\n\n*** All of our Wigglers are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, hw tested/treated, and on preventatives. Most of our adoptable dogs need fenced in yards or an exercise regimen. We require proof spanning 2 consistent years of HW preventatives for already owned pets, UTD on shots, and spay/neuter in order to adopt. Please read their description above closely. Our adoption fee is $350. For an application to foster or adopt send us your number and email address in a message. ***",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter. We look forward to seeing you soon!\n\nLink to the Adoption Application: \nhttps://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/adoption-application/\n\nAnimal House Shelter\n13005 Ernesti Road\nHuntley, IL 60142\n\n847-961-5541 phone\n847-961-5537 fax\n\nOpen:\n\nSunday-Friday from 11 AM to 7 PM\nSaturday from 9 AM to 7 PM\n\nConnect With Us:\n\nLike Us On Facebook\u00a0!\nWatch Us On YouTube\u00a0!\nFollow Us On Twitter\u00a0!\n\nAdoption Application:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/adoption-application/\n\nAdopt a Pet:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/\n\nDirections to Shelter:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/visit/\n\nAdoptable Dogs:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/dogs/\n\nAdoptable Cats:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/cats/\n",

Initially, Paris doesn't show herself well and will try to scare off the scary humans but with just a tad bit of patience and maybe a snack or two, she is easily won over. She loves to run around and play and show off her best play bow, and her sploot is one of the best things ever. This little lady would do best in a home with a pretty calm routine without lots of visitors and other pets. She is crate trained/ housebroken and cannot wait to find her forever home.",

He is in a foster with another playful male dog and two cats (he does like to chase the cats).  Blue Lacy dogs are very intelligent herding dogs that NEED a job and an experienced dog owner. They are very trainable and need to be socialized!! so an active home is best for him. He would do well as a running and hiking partner and needs to be exercised daily!!! He can be the only dog in the home as he loves hanging with his people.\n\n *** All of our Wigglers are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, hw tested/treated, and on preventatives. Most of our adoptable dogs need fenced in yards or an exercise regimen. We require proof spanning 2 consistent years of HW preventatives for already owned pets, UTD on shots, and spay/neuter in order to adopt. Please read their description above closely.

Avi\u2019s wounds are almost all healed now and he\u2019s ready for someone to heal his heart with love now too! He is about 70 pounds and 2 years old. Avi\u2019s beautiful short coat comes from his Doberman mix. He does well with other dogs, but we are unsure of how he does with kids and cats. Avi is very playful and energetic! He likes to go on walks and play, but he\u2019s down to just hangout too. Avi is completely vaccinated, neutered, and microchipped. His adoption fee is $250. \n\nGo to our website https://redfernanimalrescue.org/ and FILL OUT AN APPLICATION if you are interested! Due to the amount of inquiries we are receiving, we are prioritizing adoption applications at this time. Make sure you\u2019re filling out an adoption application on Red Fern Animal Rescue\u2019s site in Colorado, as we are not a shelter in Tennessee!",

This boy is eager to please, making training sessions fun for him and his people! Max is a very cooperative boy and will thrive with a handler who is dedicated to positive reinforcement training to help guide him as he matures. This young boy is fun and absolutely LOVES playing with other dogs - he hasn't met any dog he doesn't become immediate best friends with! Max is the most affectionate and loving boy we have around, and he is trying to get the title of \"the most adorable lap dog\" of the year. Max will thrive in an active family where his people are dedicated to be consistent with his training. He will definitely benefit from having a sibling who can show him the ropes and keep him company. This boy will no doubt bring years of love and endless kisses to his furever family!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

            "description": "There is not a dog in the world cuter than Brody. This little guy is about 4 years old and hasn't had the easiest life so far. Brody was found chained up in the yard of an abandoned house, but even with a rough past, he is one of the sweetest and most loyal boys in the world once he becomes comfortable with you. Understandably, Brody is timid and nervous at first, and he takes some time to warm up; once he does though, you can't help but fall in love. From what we have seen, Brody is a sweet boy, but he does need a patient person or adult only family willing to give him the time to decompress, feel comfortable and settle into his new surroundings. Brody is going to need consistent training to help him face his fears, and because of this, Brody needs an experienced adopter, preferably someone who has experience with or knowledge about fearful dogs. Although he has shown great improvement and has been enjoying meeting new people, Brody's training is going to be a long-term process, and he needs an adopter committed to helping him feel comfortable in all situations and committed to his ongoing training. Although Brody has not shown a negative reaction to other dogs, it would be best for him to be the only dog in the home since it seems, based on his wounds, that he has had traumatic experiences with dogs in the past. But with all of the love Brody has to give, you won't even need another dog! Aside from Brody's amazing personality, he has the most adorable little face and the perkiest ears in the world! We just cannot get enough of this cute boy. Introductions are by appointment only. We will contact you once your application is received.

Under anesthesia, when they got a good luck, they found that he has multiple tiny polyps that they were not able to remove. The vet felt this may be due to allergies although the rest of his body doesn\u2019t look very allergic. We are seeking out holistic care which is no less expensive but will boost his immune system for better overall health and we are hoping that, kept with this regimen, the ears will not pose a problem in the future.\u00a0 Maxx\u2018s new family must have a good relationship with their vet so that they can work together as a team. Unfortunately this is now considered a pre-existing condition and will not be covered by insurance. Maxx is well worth the extra effort and care!\n\nMAXX is a 3 yr old Olde English Bulldogge. (see link for breed origins & info: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olde_English_Bulldogge#History). He was brought up in a family that was going through a divorce with lots of yelling and not enough time for the new puppy. Maxx is terribly shy and his first reaction is to retreat. He needs a family that will take things slow and get to know him on his own terms. Maxx has grown leaps and bounds with us - he has learned to trust a select few and now enjoys his walks in the park. He is a good boy who has excellent manners in the car, is housebroken & takes treats ever so gently. Maxx lived with kids age 10 and up but because of his flighty behavior and \u201cwork in progress\u201d status, we feel he would do best in a quiet adult-only home. Maxx has not yet been cat tested but seems to do well with a calm female dog. He was the only dog in his former home and would be fine as the \u201conly child\u201c so he could get all of the extra attention that he needs. Max will require several meet and greets before his eventual home visit in his new home so we would like to keep his adoption relatively local, within comfortable driving range. Max has been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and tested negative for heartworms. He has a polyp in his ear that is currently being treated. Adoption $250. Please fill out our adoption application at www.companimals.org if you are interested in starting the meet and greet process.",

He was turned into a county shelter by his owner who said he didn\u2019t have time for him. Really? Who wouldn\u2019t make time for this adorable boy?? He\u2019s with us now and is such a sweetheart. Chase is learning every day that people are safe and fun. His past owner obviously didn\u2019t do much with him because everything seems like a new experience. Chase is now looking at new things as a bit scary\u2026 but is definitely relaxing more and more. He\u2019s great with our volunteers and loves their company. We know he played a little with other dogs at county, but we\u2019re going slow with him and other dogs. He seems interested, but unsure. We think with the right match, he\u2019ll enjoy playing, but at this point he doesn\u2019t have a dog-buddy just yet. Chase definitely prefers human buddies. We believe he\u2019d prefer to be an only dog and get ALL the attention. We believe he\u2019s housebroken because he\u2019s had no accidents in his kennel. He\u2019s also super affectionate and loves to be loved. Chase is active, but not hyper... we think he\u2019d be good on hiking and camping trips. Remember, he is still a puppy and will need regular training and socialization to grow into a sound, well-rounded adult dog. If this handsome boy sounds like a good fit for your life, please fill out an application to meet Chase. \n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/91891552799173\n",

We get along with other dogs after proper introduction, cats and well behaved children! I love meeting new people and a great game of fetch.

We are a bonded pair of Weimeraners (who absolutely must stay together) who could benefit from some additional training. An experienced owner with a nice sized yard would be best suited for us! I can be stubborn at times and want to be King of the yard but Pandora and I work it out. We get along with other dogs after proper introduction, cats and well behaved children! I love meeting new people and a great game of fetch. Getting my steps in are crucial, so daily walks are a must! If you are looking to add two more to your pack, you've hit the jackpot!",

From her lush clean coat and well-kept figure, it seems that she had a loving home once, and it's hard to fathom that she ended up on the streets, abandoned and unloved. It's taken her a while to trust people again, and a slow steady pace and soft voice win her friendship.\n\n Estimated at 1 year old, and weighing about 45 pounds, we let Lucy set the pace and she's nailing it! \n\nLucy loves other dogs, wagging her tail, play bowing and ready to engage. She\u2019s very tolerant with exuberant dogs, a rockstar!! A staff and volunteer favorite she has so much love to give. Lucy is a snuggler, happy cuddling on the couch when she's comfortable with her person. Lucy welcomes  play bowing and happy to be going for a walk and now approaches people in the home \n\n.She does best in a quiet environment both inside and outside the home; city life/busy streets are not for our girl. \n\nWould do well with another dog in the home  to keep her socialized \n\n Lucy is spayed, up to date with appropriate vaccinations, microchipped, and ready to hunker down with her new person/family\n\nPlease fill out the application on this link \n\nhttps://poshpetsrescueny.org/dogs/",

Beto was surrendered with his sister Rosy when their owner could no longer care for them. These chunky monkeys do need to lose some weight as they were over fed and not exercised. They are currently on a low calorie diet at the shelter and getting walks every day. Beto is quite docile and compliant, he loves people. The only other dog for Beto is Rosy!  We wouldn't recommend this pair for a family with small children due to their size.\n\n\nRosy & Beto were lucky enough to be fostered over the holidays.  Here is what their foster parents had to say:\n\nThey were amazing!  Very loving and loyal.  Most of the time they would just curl up and sleep next to each other, otherwise they were following us around the house hoping to get kisses and loving.  They would curl up and lay at our feet or lay their heads on us while sitting on the bed.  They walked really well on a leash (except when seeing other dogs) and were always so excited to get out of the house and explore.  Surprisingly for how chunky they are, they weren't big beggars at mealtime.  They would noticed when it was mealtime, but didn't cry/bark/whine and eventually would just go lay down.  They definitely preferred when we were home, and would cry a bit when we went to bed or left the house, but then they would settle down.  They aren't very interested in toys but would chew on bones/a chew toy to calm themselves at night after we went to bed. Beto was nervous around new people and would look for solace behind one of us.  He would growl and bark, but it was clear he was looking for reassurance that the new people were ok to trust.

            "description": "Dudley is enjoying his time with his foster family! After an almost too late offer to pull him, he was more than happy to walk out of the shelter! He came into his foster home to 3 dog foster siblings - and is doing great. He takes queues well while playing and gives them space when they ask. He enjoys chewing toys and bones - and has no problems with his people taking them away or moving them. He does get a little mouthy while playing - but his foster is working on correcting this with verbal commands and giving toys. \n\nHe is working on house manners - sometimes he gets too excited but he calms down fairly quickly and corrects easily with a squirt from a water bottle. \n\nHe has done well on walks - sometimes pullin at first but when he calms down from the initial excitement he stops pulling and walks very nicely. He has not had any accidents at his foster home in the house and does well in the back yard (which is only a 4 foot fence). He is kennel trained - he goes into his kennel if his fosters are gone during the day and at night for bedtime. He whines at first but when he realizes it is bedtime he calms down quickly and goes to sleep (this has been getting better the longer he has been with his foster). He is learning manners and tricks, already knows that he has to sit nicely for his food, and when he is getting his leash on. He knows basic commands such as sit, shake and lay down. He is a very smart, fast learning boy and likes to be where his people are. He will follow you around or whine a bit if he is blocked in another room. He has met several new people of all ages and has done great with them all (kids and adults). With a little bit of work and training this boy will make a great addition to any home!",

He does not care for other animals, so he will need to be the only furbaby in the house.  He will need a fenced yard, either a privacy fence or a 4 foot fence that is reinforced with electric/invisible fence.  He does not appear to be a climber, but we do not want him upset with the neighbor pets.  Jansen is an active boy that loves to play, but then wants nothing more than to cuddle up beside you.  Jansen weighs about 70 lbs. and wants to spend Christmas with his new family.\n\nIf you would like an application go to our website (https://humanesocietypc.com/) and download one and email it back as a Word or PDF document. Please no Google documents.\n\nThis dog's adoption fee is $190. That fee includes spaying/ neutering, microchipping, deworming and vaccinations.",

I just arrived at rescue in November and am getting settled in.\n\nMy back story is one of love and comfort until love and comfort wasn\u2019t an option anymore. My mom took very good care of me my whole life before she had to go through yucky, long medical treatment, and inevitably became too sick to take care of me as she wanted.\n\nSo here I am at the ranch, waiting for a second life of love and comfort with another mom or family.\n\nI\u2019m 10 years old and about 15 pounds. I\u2019m UTD on all my shots and the vet (and everyone here) said, \u201cShe\u2019s a super dog and someone will be very lucky to have her.\u201d Do you feel lucky?\n\nI\u2019m selective about which dogs I like.   I\u2019m also very much a Jack Russell and full of boundless energy, but I\u2019m also wise and focused and know things these young four-legged whippersnappers haven\u2019t figured out yet.\n\nCome see me at\n\nhttp://www.jackrusselladoptions.org/\n",

I arrived at the rescue in fall of 2020 with a broken leg. Ouch! Doc put a pin in it, made me rest for what seemed like an eternity, and now I\u2019m good as new \u2026 which is good \u2026 \u2019cause I\u2019m new!\n\nYep, I\u2019m a big ole puppy with a big ole puppy brain in need of some training and guidance. I\u2019m not quite a year old yet, so life is all about quick naps between big ole spurts of relentless energy. Whee! And I\u2019m a Terrier, so that\u2019s 10x the normal puppy energy. Whee, whee!\n\nI\u2019m young, but I\u2019m already a big boy at 20 lbs and they think I may teeter more towards 30 lbs. when it\u2019s all said and done. But that\u2019s just because I\u2019m a \u201cstocky\u201d boy or \u201cvery solid,\u201d as some people say.\n\nSo, if you have puppy know-how and a lot of energy, I may be the boy for you. I don\u2019t come with an instruction manual, so I\u2019m depending on you (or your dogs \u2013 I love other dogs!) to show me how to be a \u201cgood dog\u201d when I\u2019m grown. I guess I\u2019m saying \u2026 don\u2019t ask if I\u2019m housebroken or have any manners yet because that\u2019s a \u201cno\u201d on both. But I\u2019m smart and learn quickly, so let\u2019s gooooo!\n\nCome see me at\n\nhttp://www.jackrusselladoptions.org/\n",

This little man loves snuggles and head pets, and to be close to his person. Tubbs is very friendly and playful with other dogs, curious about cats but we think he would get along just fine. He's lightning fast and loves running and playing in the house and yard. A fenced yard would be awesome for Tubbs! He is also really starting to master leash walking. Tubbs will kennel if needed, but in true chi fashion does not like to be far from his person. You can instantly earn Tubbs affection with his favorite snack, sweet potato!",

            "description": "Meet Timothy!\n\nTimothy is a very shy boy. He absolutely LOVES dogs. He needs a home with no young kids. We are unsure about kitties at this time. \n\nTimothy is only around a year old. He does have some crate anxiety, so we ordered him a special anxiety crate. He walks great on a leash, and he keeps his kennel very clean. He\u2019s only around 45 lbs. he\u2019s a petite little guy. \n\nThe ideal foster for Timothy is one with at least one other active dog. Someone that is willing to work with him through his anxiety. A fenced-in yard would be awesome, but it\u2019s not a requirement. He will need someone to take it slow with him since he can be nervous at first. But he is really a love bug once he warms up to you. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in fostering or adopting Timothy, please fill out the application https://www.speranzarescue.org/foster-application",

            "description": "Looking to add some spice in your family equation?  Michael's your guy!  This fun-loving year and a half old Lab/Corgi mix will immediately bring a smile to your face.  Just look at him!!  At 45 pounds, Michael is compact enough to feel like a small dog, but the Lab in him brings out his super playful and sweet side.  Michael loves to take hikes and long walks and is particularly adept at backyard fetch.  When all the action is done, he is quite happy to chill out with his family.  As he is young, Michael still has a lot of puppy-like energy.  He would be very happy settling in with an active family with older kids who can play with him and keep him well exercised. Michael is housetrained and is just starting to understand commands.  He is very eager to keep working on learning more. \n\nMichael is looking for a family who can spend some time giving him loads of attention and playtime in return for endless love and licks!  \n\n\nThank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (https://anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible organization. ANCAR is a foster-based rescue, and we adopt within a 90 mile radius of Bedford Hills, NY.  You will find the adoption application here: (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/).  All fields on the application must be completed.\nPlease read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) so you'll know what to expect when you submit.   \n\nOur dogs are in foster care and we do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. This is a firm policy. Our busy volunteers are not able to respond to questions about the dog or dog meeting requests in the absence of an application.  We know these dogs very well because they are in foster care. Please read the profiles of the dog(s) you are interested in prior to submitting an application.  If there are specific requirements stated (ie: Fenced Yard or Canine Friend Required) these are included because they are vital to the happiness, health, safety and adoption success of that dog. \n\nWe are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering and microchipping before transporting our dogs. We provide all supplies, preventatives and any follow up vet care necessary while they are in foster care. These costs are high and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you.  We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources. If you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through the kindness of supporters like you that we are 'changing lives...one tail at a time' by providing our dogs with 'A New Chance.' (https://anewchancear.org) \n\nThanks so much.",

            "description": "Miss Molly is a 10-11 year old Yorkshire Terrier/Poodle cross (YorkiPoo) that was surrendered to our rescue when her senior owner entered hospice care. She is a tiny girl at only 8-9 pounds and has a soft coat of hair which requires routine grooming with hair cuts. This sweet little dog is quite timid initially of new people and other dogs, probably because she lived a very quiet life with her senior owner. Thankfully, over the past month, she has come out of her shell more in her foster home. Molly now lives with a few other small to medium sized dogs and she has started playing with them. She's not a big player with toys but does enjoy hanging out with the other dogs and with her foster mom.\n\nDespite being so small, Molly does not like to be picked up nor held; she will actually shriek when picked-up; she's not in pain - it's fear. She does, however, enjoy laying with you on the couch or chair when she feels comfortable. Molly has a cute and funny way to let you know when she has to go outside, by stomping stomp her paws on the floor and barking while looking at you - so funny and cute. Molly will need an adopter willing and able to take her to the vet regularly for anal glad expression; she's had some anal gland issues which now need to be monitored. Because Miss Molly is initially timid, we feel she'd do best in an adult only household providing her a calmer environment in which she feels more comfortable. The ideal situation would be a senior person or couple.\n\nThis dog has been examined by a licensed veterinarian, provided inoculations, dewormed, tested for diseases, spayed and microchipped. ADOPTION APPLICATIONS are available by request from acaringplace@comcast.net Our online application is not working properly at this time.A Caring Place - All Breed Dog Rescue adopts throughout the Greater Chicagoland Area. All dogs and puppies live in foster homes, providing you as the adopter, with information on the animal's behaviors, needs, and requirements. We are always in search of fosters care providers. If you are one of those special people willing to open your heart and home to an animal in need and would like to receive information on how you can foster an animal, please contact us.",

            "description": "Ben is an adorable, fast-growing puppy with a silky white coat with brindle patches. We believe he\u2019s a herding breed mix, possibly Aussie.  Ben is already exhibiting herding breed traits, nipping at heels and noise sensitivity, so we want to place him with adopters who have experience with herding breeds. He is a pup who will quickly become a dog who needs training, daily exercise and \u201ca job.\u201d Full-grown, he could weigh at least 50lbs or possibly 60+ pounds. He was born around October 6 and by late January, Ben already weighed 20 lbs.  \n\nBen is all puppy but learns quickly. He knows \"sit\" and is learning \"come\" and \"leave it.\" Ben sleeps through the night and is crate trained. He\u2019s doing well with house training but needs a home with someone who is vigilant and will continue his routine.\n\nHe likes meeting new people, playing with his toys, other dogs and being outside. He is still a puppy, so he is teething and must be monitored closely and instructed on what is ok to chew and redirected when it\u2019s not. He enjoys playing with his foster Mom but needs to be instructed not to nip when he gets too excited.\n\nPuppies need a home where people have the time and patience to train them properly. Young dogs need to go out regularly to establish proper housebreaking habits, so please consider this as you think about adopting this puppy.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Ben, you MUST meet ALL criteria below (NO EXCEPTIONS):\n\n1) You live in the Greensboro area. Ben needs the rest of his puppy vaccines and is too young to neuter, so we will do that at our vet once he is old enough.\n2) Willing to housetrain and obedience train a puppy and are spry enough to keep up with a mischievous puppy\u2014this is at least a 15-year commitment.\n3) Have a fenced yard at least 5 ft high, preferably 6ft\n4) An adult only home (or children over the age of 10)\n5) Ben needs a home where someone is home most of the time (post-COVID). \n\nThe adoption range for this dog is limited to Greensboro, NC. If you are interested in adopting this dog, contact h2hadoptions@gmail.com. \n\nAn all adult home with a fenced yard (fence must be attached to the home) is required to adopt from Hart-2-Heart Rescue. \n\nThere is an application process and adoption fee. We are an all-volunteer organization, and in addition to saving dogs, we have other responsibilities, so we appreciate your patience and understanding during this process. Response time can take up to 5 business days. \n\nVeterinary Care: All Hart-2-Heart Rescue foster dogs are spayed/neutered, current on heartworm prevention, parvo/distemper, bordetella, and rabies vaccines and are professionally groomed. As needed, our foster dogs have teeth cleanings, extractions, bloodwork and other diagnostic testing.",

WE are a high intake No Kill Shelter ran by a staff of 4 and do not always have time to answer every question asked by so many. If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced. It is never our intention to ignore a request about an adoptable animal in our facility.\n\nSandy Brown, Director, PAW Animal Shelter\n\n319-372-2274",

If that's a pup you are looking for, then Brutus is your boy! This sweet, silver fox is a happy fellow with a loving spirit. He loves splitting his time between playing and snuggling. His favorite place to land would be a home where he is your one and only canine companion, and he'd prefer to live with adults rather than youngsters. He's a guy that enjoys being around patient and mature grown ups. He can handle himself on his own, loves the belly rubs, but not foot massages, and has some solid skills from his friends and trainers. Treats are a sure fire way to get him to show off his smarts, and we promise...he will bring adventure and joy into your life! Come meet this sweet silver nugget, he would love a belly rub!",

            "description": "Sweet Bridget is just about as affectionate as they come. Her foster parents can attest that this lovable doggo will make a lucky family very happy one day. If they weren't going to be so busy after this COVID mess, then they'd definitely keep her for themselves! Two broken legs may stop most, but definitely not this pup. Bridget still manages to waddle after her favorite humans, play tug-of-war with her toys, and snuggle with anyone and everyone. What she's missing in mobility, she definitely makes up for in kisses. This oversized lap dog wants her big ol' head in someone's lap 24/7. She quickly became her foster mom's shadow and will sit at her feet when she's working and sprawl across her lap when relaxing. Before you see Bridget you can hear the THUMP THUMP THUMP of her excited tail. Her smile is contagious and her goofy personality is a day-maker. Bridget is loyal, companionable, and expressive with her body language. She is potty trained and will stand by the door to let you know she needs to go out. She minds her manners, doesn't beg for food, and listens to commands. She does great in the car and is really just happy to be included in whatever's going on. While she does love to snuggle in bed, she also feels comfortable in her crate (good thing, too, because she's a bit of a bed hog and wants to sleep underneath you for most of the night). Bridget is a great companion and will be the best, most comforting new addition to the right household. Come meet her and see if this snugglebug is a good fit for yours and follow her silly antics on Instagram @bridgetthepiglet!",

Then she'll want to cuddle up with you and take a nap with her head in your lap. This snuggly lady likes going for walks, pulling on her leash, sniffing everything and hoping to chase those silly squirrels. Then back home, she's happy to be a couch potato, snoozing most of the day. She likes to follow her humans around, but is also happy to chill out in her crate or on the couch. She's a smart girl who answers to 'sit' and is working on 'down,' hoping for treats as a reward. June is a calm girl who has done very well with kids in her previous foster and would love them in her future home. She may do best as the only pet since she has done some resource guarding in the past. Come meet your future lapdog!",

He's an extremely energetic and intelligent dog who needs daily exercise, both physically and mentally. He loves to play, and will catch a case of the zoomies running laps around the yard. He definitely likes a wide-open space. He absolutely loves going on walks and meeting new people, where he tends to be extremely excited. Johnny is very loving, and will greet you happily when you get home from work. He also enjoys cuddling with you when you have a blanket, so you can watch your favorite movies and shows. He'll lay down with you when you go to sleep, he curls up in a little ball (which is an optical illusion since he is not small). He also enjoys napping on his bed or wherever he can find a space to curl up! Johnny will sleep in his crate, his bed, or in your bed if you like. He needs patience, and would benefit from more training. He shows great capacity to learn, and knows some commands already. He is still working on controlling all that energy, but he also has so many good habits. He doesn't bark too much unless someone gets close to the house, and is not scared of much of anything except a silly oven mitt for some reason. He is also a house trained pup who has not had any accidents in the house. This pup has allergies and will need to avoid certain foods to keep his skin and ears cleared up. He's a hungry boy and will go after anything on the floor. Johnny has so much potential to be a great companion! Come meet this adorable boy and let him entertain you!",

            "description": "Are you looking for a smart, high energy dog who would enjoy training and being your running companion? Well, let me introduce you to Troy, a 40 pound, Pit Bull Terrier/Belgian Malinois mix who is between 1 and 2 years of age. Troy is a very loving dog who wants to snuggle and be close to his family. He absolutely loves going on walks, which he currently gets twice a day. Troy walks nicely in general but does get animated when he sees another dog. In addition to his walks, Troy goes for runs/jogs with his foster dad 3-4 days a week. In his foster home, Troy really enjoys the fenced in yard where, every day, he plays frisbee, chase his tennis ball, or play pull with his rope toy. If you haven't already noticed, Troy is a VERY active dog who requires a lot of exercise each and every day. He is also a very smart dog who learns quickly; his foster family is working with Troy every day teaching commands including sit, shake, down, and stay. Troy is crated when his fosters leave the house.\n\nFor inside the home, Troy requires a calm, more quiet household; a lot of activity and noise overwhelms him. Troy needs a patient slow introduction with new people and new dogs because he can be protective of the family; however, once he get to know a person, he loves them unconditionally. Because of this behavior, we are requiring previous dog ownership. He is approved for households with adults only or adults with older teens. Despite liking other dogs and wanting to play with them, he becomes over stimulated and doesn't know what to do with the added energy. Because of this, Troy should probably be the only dog in the home where he can receive undivided attention.\n\nThis dog has been examined by a licensed veterinarian, provided inoculations against diseases, been tested for heartworm disease, neutered, and microchipped. ADOPTION APPLICATIONS are available by request from acaringplace@comcast.net. A Caring Place - All Breed Dog Rescue adopts throughout the Greater Chicagoland Area. All dogs and puppies live in foster homes, providing you as the adopter, with information on the animal's behaviors, needs, and requirements. We are always in search of fosters care providers. If you are one of those special people willing to open your heart and home to an animal in need and would like to receive information on how you can foster an animal, please contact us.",

I would do best in a home as the only pet. I live with other dogs in my foster home, but it takes me awhile to warm up to new dogs. I'm too curious about cats so a home without cats is best for me. I make a great human companion. I love to cuddle and spend time with my human.\n\nIf you're interested in a sweet, friendly companion to add to your family, please email.\n\nDo Not call to let us know you are interested. Follow the step stated below.\n\nAdopter for Kissy must be at least 25 years old. Adoption fee is $550.00. She is completely vetted. Kissy is up to date on vaccinations, and spayed.\n\nKissy is currently in Texas but will travel to the PNW once an adopter has been found.\n\n***The first step in the process if you are interested in being considered for Kissy email us information about yourself and your family. A brief introduction to your family will be helpful in determining if Kissy is a good fit for your family. Please include where you live, current/past vet, etc. Send your inquiry to rogarcia58@yahoo.com. Do not inquire through the Petfinder site. Those inquiries are not being received by the rescue organization.",

He needs an experienced owner who can advocate for him. \n\nLamb would do best in a home with active adults and same size dogs and room to run and play. \n\nLamb loves to play catch and tug and also loves to chill with his human and pup friends on the couch. He loves the outdoors, hiking and swimming. He would make someone a very great companion. \n\nLamb isn\u2019t a huge fan of thunderstorms or fireworks. \n\nLamb comes with a behaviorist and trainer that will ensure he integrates well into the home and guide you with what he needs as far as structure so Lamb will flourish and succeed. \n\nLamb is available for adoption through Forgotten Coast Animal Rescue, Houston.

            "description": "Snow is a sweet girl that has been dealt a crummy hand in life initially before she arrived at HONAR. She was bounced around to supposedly 5 different homes before she was 6 months old. The last individual that surrendered her was not able to care for her properly and address her simple allergy issues that left her with chronic ear infections and is said to have some scar tissue on her ear drums making her a little hard of hearing. Previous owners were physically abusive to her, thinking she was stubborn and not listening, when she just could hear everything. Snow has shown progress with a Salmon grain free diet and has stopped chewing feet and her ears are clearing up. She does hear and does well up close but if she was away from you a bit of distance, she may not hear clearly. Snow has learning \"sit\", \"shake\", \"down\" (with a treat), and \"off\". She is learning proper walking on a leash and we are working on not jumping on counters, people and/or jumping fences/gates. Snow is getting use to routine, crate training, and with routine/schedule seems to be housebroken. We were told that she would get into fights with the dogs she lived with prior to coming to rescue but HONAR has not seen any issues with the dogs in her foster home and she does well with the cats in the home, she can play a little rough with kittens but does not appear to want to harm them. She doesn't seem to be a dominant dog, usually happy-go-lucky, just wants to be with people. \nSnow is a very agile girl and would be an amazing dog for consideration of agility or anything requiring athleticism, she loves jumping and climbing. \nSnow is fully vetted, spayed, UTD on vaccines, HWT negative, and microchipped. Snow would love an active home and one that may have experience with Boxers and their active nature as well as someone patient with her learning new things and when teaching commands give her hand signals along with the word prompts.\n***SNOW ABSOLUTELY HAS TO HAVE A PRIVACY FENCE for confinement, she WILL scale any height chain link.",

You can make an appointment to meet available dogs at our ADOPTION CENTER by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet and available cats at MEOW PALACE by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet1. \n\nFor animals in FOSTER homes, please submit an online application and an adoption team will reply with next steps. We thank you for your patience as we work to keep saving lives during this difficult time.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out our dog adoption form on the website, or email messagemarybeth@gmail.com for any questions! \n\nPLEASE VISIT THIS WEBSITE TO FIND THE ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE:\nhttp://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-forms/\n\nLatte is a VERY shy girl, but has made AMAZING progress over the past few weeks! \n\nHi! \nMy name is Latte and I am looking for someone to love my quirkiness. I need someone who will be patient with me. I am finally coming out of my shell and seeking my foster brothers for playtime. I love toys and like to collect them all in one place. When foster Mom comes into her room, she will find a pile of toys and chew bones on her bed! Oh, I am also a hoarder of socks and slippers. If you are missing one you will probably find it in my crate! I like my crate and will go there for naps or if I get scared. Loud noises or quick movements make me run for safety. I really hope to have a dog brother or sister to play with and help me gain confidence. Cats are okay too even though they won't play with me. I am still working on house training. I use potty pads just fine but the big backyard is a little frightening to me. I need some help with leash training. I use to live in a very scary place but have now figured out not all people are bad and now like affection! I hope to meet my new forever Mom soon. I find men unnerving even though I now tolerate the 2 human boys that live here. (11 and 14), so maybe I can get use to one in time. Younger, noisy kids may be too much for me. I would be a great Covid work from home buddy. I am very quiet and happy to sleep behind your chair but don't be surprised to find a pile of my favorite toys behind you! \n\nLove, Latte\n\nLatte needs a home with a good natured dog (or a couple) who will bond with her and show her that home life is safe. They must have a fenced yard for days Latte is not feeling the leash, as she is still improving in that department. \n\nShe is not aggressive. Just getting used to living in a home! \n\nPlease let me know if you would meet the above listed needs for Latte!!! \n\n\nAdoption Coordinator: Mary Beth Maggio\nLocation: Foster\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $475. This fee INCLUDES spay/neuter and microchip. \n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program",

After a month in the shelter's care, he gained enough weight and underwent parasite treatment to gain weight to travel to us. \n\nEthan weighed 38lbs when he arrived and is still underweight, but his foster's are fattening him up nicely.  \n\nEthan is a lover, he wants to be near his people.  He is highly intelligent and you have to be on your toes with him.  He thinks he can drive the vehicle despite being told he does not have a license to do so.  \n\nHe is crate and house trained, he will begin training classes for basic manners in the next week.  \n\nHe is undergoing heartworm treatment and is expected to have a full recovery. His adoptive family must bring him to our vet in Shorewood to complete his heartworm treatment.  \n\nEthan would prefer a home with a fenced yard to run and play in after he beats the heartworm disease.\n\nPlease apply do NOT send inquiries.",

He spends lots of time with doggy cousins, small and large and also loves to play and spend time with some human cousins too. He\u2019s extremely gentle and easy going and would thrive in a quiet home with a yard to run. He would do best in a home with at least one owner working from home because he suffers from separation anxiety. He needs a patient owner who is willing to work with him on it. \n\nMorocco is mostly potty trained and won\u2019t have accidents in the house when regularly walked or let out in the yard. This big guys drinks tons of water and needs lots of potty breaks! He is also a master at learning boundaries and is a great listener. Mo is very food motivated and so far knows sit and is working very hard on paw and down! He is still used to being in the city, so he does need some encouragement when walking on busy streets. This guy is the perfect family dog and is waiting very patiently for his forever home! Adopt this sweet baby today!!\n\nThis pet's adoption fee is $425. He is being fostered in Brooklyn",

            "description": "Apply on our adoption application at leadrescue.org. We only adopt and foster in Illinois and only with 50 miles of downtown Chicago.\n\n\u201cYou can have her. I want a Pomeranian instead.\u201d\n\nWe in rescue all say the same thing: we could write a book. In fact there should be a recurring segment (like about those horrible dating stories) on late night tv about all the stuff we hear, see, wish we didn\u2019t hear and see, and things we would like to forget. You will get a kick out of the things quite possibly excuses, even normal looking people, come up with to get rid of their pets.\n\nMishka was part of a very convoluted story. As part of the series of rescue books I could start, she would have her own chapter. The cliffnotes version is that Mishka had an owner who kept losing her. When returned, the owner seemed to think the way to discipline her was by using force. Obvs, that was and will never be okay. She got loose again and a caring woman found her. Through scanning for a chip, they were able to find the original owners. When called they said they don\u2019t want her anymore and exclaimed, \u201cI want a Pom anyways.\u201d Although our blood boils over the lack of commitment to this dog, this was good news seeing how abuse and dog ownership shouldn\u2019t go together. \n\nThe chip company also made contact and eventually the chip was transferred to the caring person\u2019s family. So if there happens to be a Pom on the street in Chicago at some point, well let\u2019s just say I hope it\u2019s not from the same owner. \n\nSo the new family had every intention to keep this dog as their past Husky just passed away. But that\u2019s the thing about a low key senior dog vs. a young, ready to run an Iditarod bolt of energy, you gotta be prepared to MUSH! Mishka was becoming destructive inside the home because she was just flat out bored. She even would throw her ball up in the air to try and entertain herself. But that only lasted so long. She instead realized 6 foot fence jumping looked like a better way to spend her days. \n\nMishka is a 1.5 year old Siberian Husky, who every single person adores. She is extremely kid and dog friendly (bestie is a Doxie) and it was definitely tough to take her away from the grandchildren who fell madly in love with her. She does like to stare/chase birds and squirrels so cats are probably an iffy one. She is your supreme talky Husky but if you already love this breed, the talking isn\u2019t annoying to you. Mishka really, really needs a family who wants her first, but secondly, who will be the person to throw the many toys for Mishka to catch, nonstop so she will never play catch by herself again. We believe she won\u2019t chew your Timbs if exercised enough with another dog(s) or your wild n\u2019 out children. Which leads me to tell you, she might have some separation anxiety and a crate will be your Godsend. Otherwise you will experience her opening a can of paint (her fosters were gone for 45 minutes), obvi getting it on her fur, and when they came home, in her excitement ran all over their bed with THE PAINT. Run, jump, squat, bike, she doesn\u2019t care. Just take her with! Since she enjoys 6 foot fence jumping, she can live in an apartment with no yard and take her to the dog park or HAS TO BE on a tie out, supervised in a fenced yard. And lastly, poor girl throws up when she gets in the car, so always have paper towels on standby. You knew that CostCo membership was gonna work out for you.\n\nOne last thing to mention. It is very evident she got used to the abuse dealt in her short life. High hand gestures, putting her leash on too fast, or even just accidentally stepping on her paw or leash on a walk, her body language says it all. She cowers, ears go back, eyes squint, tail down. Therefore, she needs someone who isn\u2019t going to even raise their voice in the home. Someone who can only show affection even if she runs around your home with wet paint. Someone who can rebuild her confidence and glue back together this dog.\n\nIf interested in not a Pom, not a Pomsky, and not a Shepsky, but a real purebred, amazing Husky, please apply for Mishka at leadrescue.org!",

This petite beauty wants love so much, but is insecure in this new world she finds herself in. Loud noises terrify her.  We believe she would not thrive in high density living such as apartments. A quiet home with a secure fenced yard is what we are looking for.  Do you have the patience to draw her out of her shell?  If so you will be rewarded.\n\nCarmen has tested positive for treatment resistant hookworms and is under her first round of treatment.  As hookworms are treatment resistant she may need more rounds of treatment.\n\nThe FastK9's Adoption fee is $400.00. Carmen has been spayed, is microchipped, current on vaccinations and has tested negative for heartworm, erlichia and lymes disease.\n\nTo find out more or to stay up to date on all the greyt-ness follow us on: \nFacebook: /fastk9s\nInstagram: /fastk9s_adoption\nWeb: fastk9s.org",

CTDR received a call from a Veterinary Hospital in Houston telling us that Diesel had been surrendered by his owners after a bigger dog in the family got into a fight with diesel and tore his ear off. The family could not afford the veterinary expenses and decided to surrender him. CTDR jumped into action as there was no way we were not going to take this boy into Rescue and get him taken care of. We are honored that this Vet Hospital entrusted us to take care of Diesel and to find him a forever home. He is recovering nicely from his ear surgery, he was neutered and had a dental. If you are interested in giving this little guy a forever home , please complete an application at ctdr.org.",

Ada can take a little time to warm up to new people,  She gets along with other dogs and is doing well with housetraining in her foster home.  She is basically blind, but that doesn't slow her downand she learns quickly how to get around.  Due to her vision impairment we are looking for a home where she will be safe- away from open balconies or staircases.  Ada has had a dental cleaning as well as a full senior workup.  Ada's adoption donation of $200 helps cover the cost of her medical care.  \n\nApplication, reference checks, and home visit required. Adopters must live 1.5 hours driving distance from Romeoville, IL. For more information on adopting, please email us at info@perfectpooches.org.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete an adoption application, which can be found on our website at www.perfectpooches.org under the Adoption Process tab.  All dogs are spayed/neutered, current on vaccines, heartworm tested (age appropriate), fecal tested and/or dewormed, and microchipped.",

Blind dogs learn everything a seeing dog can, including doggie doors, beds, food and water and fence lines. A secure fence is a MUST for her safety. She is adoptable within 3 hours of Granbury, Tx. She will be up to date on vaccines, wormed and microchipped. Adoption fee is $100 plus a REFUNDABLE $300 spay/neuter deposit.

I'm a sweet and lovable 2 year old bull terrier mix whose favorite thing is to be close with humans and get all the pets and cuddles. I like to play too! Squeaky toys are my favorite, and I will play with them all day when I'm not napping at my Foster Mom's feet or following her around. Sometimes I'll even grab my Foster Mom's shoes or socks when she is not looking or paying attention to me, all so I can get more attention and love of course. I'm completely house trained, crate trained, and leash trained, and I love to go on walks. In fact I get so excited when it's time to go on walks that I just run around in circles! I do the same when it's time for food, too! I did have puppies in August (and I was a great Mom!), but they are weaned now and have moved on to their Furever homes. I'm also heartworm positive but I am currently undergoing treatment and the nice rescue that saved me will cover the cost of treatment until I test negative.\n\nI would do good in a home that can give me lots of love and attention. I'm ok with some dogs, but it depends on their personality. I would probably not do well with cats because I tend to like to chase them. I like to be Queen of the house so any dominant dogs may make me nervous. I'm best buds with my foster mom's pup now but that's mostly because he lets me be Queen. I'm also good with kids. I'll even play with them a little! But I'd prefer to just sit and have them pet me. I'd do best in a home with older kids or kids that are gentle with me.\n\nI'm ready to meet you and find my Furever home!\n\nIf you are interested in giving Sheba a forever home, please visit the link below to fill out an application! http://fureverafterrescue.org/adoption-application.html It is best to submit an application through a computer. We have experienced some problems when applications have been submitted using a mobile device. *When you submit the application, you are not obligated to adopt however it does reserve for you the opportunity to adopt that particular animal. We review them on a first come first served basis. If your application is approved, we will contact you and allow you the opportunity to adopt. If you choose not to adopt, we will contact the next approved applicant. If you have any questions or difficulties, please contact us and we will be glad to help!",

He would sneak what food he could out to her until he could find someone to take her.  We are so glad we were able to help this sweet senior girl. \n\nCOMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES! IF you are interested in adopting, the FIRST step is to complete an application! Please email for an Application or copy and paste the following URL: \n\nhttps://fs26.formsite.com/nogreaterlove/form2/index.html \n\nUpon receipt of your application, the rescuer and foster in AL will contact you so you can ask any specific questions you may have! If there is more than one decision maker in the home, all of them should be in agreement! \n\n Adoption Donation: Unless otherwise stated in the pet's bio, our standard adoption fee is $250 which covers age appropriate vaccines (DHPP vax) and (Rabies vax if 12 weeks and older), utd on flea/tick prevention and heartworm prevention, worming, heartworm test @ age 6 months or older, microchip, fostering costs and health certificate.\n\nThank you for your understanding and consideration and for helping the dogs and puppies in need!\n\nWe do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21",

            "description": "Adoption fee on this dog is $100.\n\nWe are proud to announce the arrival of our super senior citizen, Sherlock.  At 13 years of age, this boy is humble yet loaded with colorful personality!  Because he was a stray, we know nothing about his former years except that he must have won Best in Show for Style & Stamina. One look at his face and you\u2019ll agree that it radiates pure perfection. And despite being significantly underweight at 63 lbs, he is fueled with mental and physical eagerness to \u201cGO\u201d.  In fact, this boy can complete a 2-mile walk and at the pace of a dog half his age.  Shorter walks are highly recommended, however, to minimize his arthritic pain.\n \nSherlock shares his home with other female fosters, with whom he can display \u2018pesty interest\u2019. In fact, that seems to be his greeting style when he meets most other dogs.  Supervision will be necessary to redirect his intrusive curiosity.  After a couple days, this diminishes and he learns to ignore them.   When he is asked to engage in play, he will do his very best to reciprocate, but this only lasts a few minutes leaving his canine friends very disappointed.  In the home, Sherlock spends most of his time laying quietly on his dog bed near his human.  On occasion, he will chit-chat and tell you stories of his past. Nothing pleases him more than sharing his tales while getting a jolly belly and face rub.  You\u2019ll be impressed with his baritone talent!  When left alone, Sherlock will express his displeasure by vocalizing with his deep howl.  This lasts a few minutes, then he settles down to rest patiently for your return. He is not destructive and finds little interest in chew toys or dog bones.  \n \nSherlock sleeps in a crate during the night and is housebroken using a dog door.  He receives human assistance using a cloth hip sling when climbing up a long flight of stairs, but he can descend on his own with cautious ease. He is friendly to all humans, however care should be taken with small active children because of his diminished eyesight.  He is outright eager to go on car rides, and requires gentle assistance getting in the vehicle. Because he is mentally and physically ready to move forward, attention must be given to estimate his lasting endurance so he can return safely and comfortably. \n \nAs expected with many dogs his age, Sherlock has moderate kidney disease and arthritis.  This is managed with dietary modification and one daily pain medication.  He can be a picky eater, so his favorite tasty morsels are always included to enhance his pleasure in life.  \n \nLet us know if you would like to meet this special boy. Few dogs offer us the opportunity to share in their last years with safety, dignity and joy.  He will repay you with his charming songs of gratitude. \n \nSmall dogs, critters and cats unknown.\n\nThis dog is a Level 2. Please be sure you understand what a dog of this Level requires. Go to our GCGSR Dogs page for an explanation of the Dog Rating Levels.\n\nFor more information and to see when this dog will be attending an Adoption Day, please see our Dogs page on our main website at www.gcgsr.org. \n\nWe operate within a reasonable driving distance from the Greater Sacramento area, the \tCentral Valley down to Merced, and Lake Tahoe. A reasonable driving distance is determined by where one of our volunteers is willing to drive within our areas of service. That means we don't adopt out of our area, to Southern California, or Out of State. \n\nThank you for visiting!",

Confined to a crate and used for breeding, she never got to learn toys and play and unfettered joy, but she's picking up on these things quickly now. Knowing she is safe and loved brings out her happy, silly spirit. She\u2019s doing great on her obedience basics and meeting new people. Slow and steady introduction to new things, coupled with yummy treats, works wonders with sweet Storm! Slow and steady also applies where other dogs are concerned.  \n\n \n\n~  Est DOB:  Oct 2013  \n~  Intake weight:  46#  \n~  Storm comes with free training!

He gets along with other dogs and uses a doggie door. Seems to be house broken. Guido would love to sit on your lap and watch tv with you! Low energy and would do ok as an only dog (as long as he had people around) or with another dog. He is learning to walk on a leash but does pull a bit. He will need a secure visible fence for his protection. His adoption fee is $150 and he is adoptable within 5 hours of Granbury, Tx. Adoption applications can be found at www.scftx.org",

Lexis must be adopted with her sister, Princess (four years old and approximately 20 pounds).  These sisters have been together for their entire lives and are looking for a furever family where they can be together.  \n\nLexis loves to give hugs!  This girl is a champion at snuggles and will happily wrap her paws around you!  When she\u2019s not snuggling, Lexis loves to play in the yard.  She does well with other dogs, but can be a little nervous when meeting a new friend for the first time.  Once she warms up, she\u2019s ready to play.\n\nLexis is crate trained and will sleep in her kennel at night (snuggles before bed are appreciated).  She appears to be housetrained.  Lexis is new to walking on a leash and is a little hesitant.  She will need some patience as she continues to develop her confidence on a leash, but having her sister along for walks helps!  Lexis also loves treats and is working on her manners. \n\n\nAll dogs come with a microchip, annual vaccinations including EBR rabies license and tag, dewormer, vet exam and spay/neuter. Adoption fee is $95-$175.\n\nCompanion Animal Alliance\n2550 Gourrier Ave.\nBaton Rouge, LA 70820\n\nphone: 225-408-5360\n\nOpen 7 days a week - 10 am to 5 pm\n\nAll animals in foster care are adopted on an application basis.

            "description": "Amazing adopter needed for an amazing dog! Penny\u2019s foster parents can\u2019t say enough good things about our sweet, sweet, sweet Penny. Penny is a special girl who needs an adopter who will be patient and understanding of her fear of new people. Penny is not the type of dog who enjoys \u201csocializing\u201d and meeting new people, however when it comes to her people at home, she is such a LOVE. It didn\u2019t take Penny long to warm up in her foster home and once she did, her silly, playful, goofy, truly amazing personality began to shine. And did we mention snuggly? Penny is such a loving, sweet, affectionate dog, making her the all-time favorite of her foster parents.\n\nPenny, nervous at first, may appear to be a low energy dog, but she is actually a very typical playful, fun, athletic young dog. She loves to run and play and enjoys her walks. Check out her video to see how well she is doing with leash walking. Penny is very food motivated and has proven to enjoy her training sessions very much. She is so super smart and would love a home who will continue with her training, as she absolutely loves it! \n\nPenny walking on leash: https://youtu.be/VoxEN6BTG34\n\nPenny also loves car rides, is housebroken and crate trained. Due to her general nervousness with new people, she will do best with a savvy adopter - and no kids. Also due to her intelligence and energy level, she will do best with someone who will continue to keep her mind and body engaged via both mental exercise (obedience and other activities) as well as regular physical exercise (hiking, jogging, etc.). \n\nShe is approx. 1.5 years old, spayed, microchipped and vaccinated. Please note that the first step in our process is the adoption application found on our website www.midatlanticbullybuddies.org.",

He has gained weight and is now about 55-60 pounds.  He loves all people, but he is particularly fond of women. As his foster mom, he follows me everywhere and is my constant shadow.  He listens well and I can take him for walks without a leash in the yard.  He is crate trained and sleeps well in his crate all night.  He loves to go on rides and sits well in the car without moving around.  His favorite activity is to ride to the end of the driveway and wait for the bus with my two daughters.  He is not aggressive with my other two dogs or my cat (he doesn\u2019t even notice the cat).  He should be ready for adoption in February after he has fully recovered from his fast kill treatment.  \n\nAll dogs come with a microchip, annual vaccinations including EBR rabies license and tag, dewormer, vet exam and spay/neuter. Adoption fee is $95-$175.\n\nCompanion Animal Alliance\n2550 Gourrier Ave.\nBaton Rouge, LA 70820\n\nphone: 225-408-5360\n\nOpen 7 days a week - 10 am to 5 pm\n\nAll animals in foster care are adopted on an application basis.

            "description": "PLEASE READ BEFORE COMPLETING THE APPLICATION: \n\nTilly is a special little girl that has a condition called cerebella hyperplasia. She is amazing and super sweet with the people she loves, but is defensive when meeting new people and will bite if people try to touch her without her knowing them well. Her condition makes it difficult to stand up and walk, but she does not let that stop her! When given access Tilly will get food and water as she needs it and is mostly potty trained if taken outside on a regular basis. She likes to do things on her own, she is Little Miss Independent, and can get upset if you try to do things for her. She would do well in a home that will give her the time to trust and provide lots of positive incentives (treats) as they get to know her. She would need to live with other dogs that are very predictable and safe since her condition makes her very vulnerable. She would also need a home where she is inside with short supervised play time outside in an area with no pools or other bodies of water that she could fall into. If you think she might be the right girl for you, please fill out the online application.\n\n What is Cerebellar Hypoplasia?\nThe symptoms of cerebellar hypoplasia are often not noticed at birth, and may not be noticed until the pet begins to be more active from around 6 weeks of age. Incoordination, jerky movements, and tremors may indicate the condition. \n\nAlthough there is no treatment for this disorder, often pets can go on to live quality lives. As this disorder can present similarly to other conditions it is important to discuss any concerns you may have that your pet is suffering from this disorder with your veterinarian.\n\nThe cerebellum is the part of the brain responsible for coordination, balance, and depth perception. Cerebellar hypoplasia is a congenital disorder in which the cerebellum is not completely matured at birth. This can be caused by a genetic disposition that affects some canine breeds or a number of conditions affecting the pregnant bitch, such as infection, poisoning, and malnutrition",

He is about 7 years old we think, and has been neutered. Luey is heartworm positive; this will be treated at the vet. As you can see from the pictures Luey is as cute as can be. He's still a little timid, but he happily joins his foster beagle brothers and sisters in playing, barking, and general beagle antics. He loves food, and loves being where he can keep an eye on his foster mom. He does bark a bit when she leaves, so care will need to be taken if he goes to an apartment or townhome. He is happy to go in a crate if needed and does not try to destroy anything in the home. Luey is just a doll who will make the right family or person very happy!\n\nLuey's Webpage - http://beaglemaryland.org/brsm_ms/vIndividualCurrentDog.aspx?dogid=69872\nAdoptable Dog Webpage - http://beaglemaryland.org/brsm_ms/vCurrentDogs.aspx\n\nIf you'd like to adopt one of our beagles:\n*Go to our Website - href=\"http://beaglemaryland.org\n*Review our  Standards for Adoption - http://beaglemaryland.org/Home.aspx?pg=standardsforadoption.htm\n*Fill out an Adopter Profile - \nhttp://brsmbeagles.org/new_site/documents/BRSM_profile_secure.pdf\n and email it to us (or print it off, fill it in and send it via regular mail, if you prefer)\n*A BRSM volunteer will contact you to guide you through the rest of the process!\n\nWe hope to hear from you, and so do the beagles!",

We are unsure of a lot of Max's history and past, but he is very timid and scared.\n\nMax is very wary of new people and new surroundings, and he will need a very patient home willing to give him the time he will need to decompress and feel comfortable.\n\nMax has done okay with most dogs in the play yard, but did have an incident escalate with 1 of the male dogs, so if you currently have dogs a meet and greet will be strongly recommended.\n\nBecause of Max's timidness and wariness, he will need to be in an adult-only home, no kids.\n\nIf you would like to meet Max, please visit our website for our application www.underdogaz.com",

I know you think you NEED this puppy, but let me tell you what I need!\n\nI have a condition called Megaesophagus. Simply put, my food doesn't make it to my stomach if I don't sit just right. I have to sit in a special chair when I eat, and the humans make me stay there for about 15 minutes. Sitting upright allows gravity to push my food to my belly.\n\nAs you can see.. I'm skinny. So I REALLY need that food to get to my belly so I can grow to be big and strong. I'm just about 5 months old. With proper care, nutrition, and a good doctor to help guide my new family, I can live a long and healthy life! I love to play with the other dogs in my foster home, and the kitties are so fun to chase. Foster mom tries to tell me not to chase them, but...Kitties! They run because they want me to chase, right?\n\nAnywho, I gotta go play now. If you think you can give me the proper care, let the nice people here know. If you have questions, ASK! They will be VERY picky about what last name I get. I'm just THAT special!\n\nWilla is current on vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative\n1/29/21 3:12 PM",

He had lived a very sheltered life before coming into rescue, but he spent some time in foster based training & is really coming out of his shell! \n\nHe loves to go walks & play with his squeaky toys! He is also knows sit, paw, & down! He has gained lots of confidence with meeting new people & other animals & he is willing to do just about anything for food! \n\nHudson would do best with an active family that has shy dog experience. He would do best in a home with older children. Hudson has been working on meeting new dogs & has been doing well, but can be selective about the dogs he likes due to a past trauma in his life. He may be willing to share his home with another dog, but is also more than happy being your one & only! \n\nWe want to set Hudson up for success, and therefore would like to place him in a foster-to-adopt home, to make certain that the placement is the right one for both Hudson and the family.\n\nTo apply to foster-to-adopt, please fill out the application at our website - https://www.furryfriendsct.org/foster-application\n",

As a former Tails and Scales Animal Rescue pup, we quickly pulled him from puppy jail and have been working to assess all behaviors over the past month. This very handsome boy is so loving, sweet and full of energy. Axl is well trained in basic commands and tricks, walks well on leash, house broken, crate trained, and an overall really good dog. The true definition of man's best friend, and he is so gentle with children. Due to his higher prey drive we have determined Axl will thrive best as the only pet in the home. Currently fostered with Tails and Scales Animal Rescue, looking for his forever home! If you are interested in Axl email us at Adoption@tailsandscales.org",

I'm kind of like Nemo with his \"special fin.\" I was born with a birth defect but it doesn't stop me from cruising around town! I just want to be loved and snuggled, and have a special human to love on. \n\nI've got a bit of arthritis (I mean, who doesn't at this age?! Am I right?) and sometimes I need a little help to pee or poop. It's embarrassing for me because I don't like asking for help, but you do what you gotta do when you gotta doo doo. \n\nI'm on a med called Petandim which keeps my coat shiny, makes me more playful (as if I needed help in that department) and it makes my joints feel better. \n\nI would love to meet you and see if we are a good fit. You can stop by Oldies But Goodies any day. I've cleared my schedule this week so we can have some quality time. 1750 S. Rainbow Blvd # 10. Open 10-7 weekdays and 10-5 weekends.",

He would love a family that will give him his space to roam in a securely fenced in yard (he will require a 6 ft fence). Luke can be nervous in new situations but is very sweet once he warms up and gets familiar. He has a mild temperament and is happiest relaxing in the yard, calmly keeping watch over his humans. Luke is looking for a family that has experience with the breed and understands how to give a sometimes anxious Pyr their space - he will be the Pyrfect companion for these type of humans. With a little patience and a lot of love, Luke will be a wonderful addition - apply for this adorable guy today!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

He had quite a bit of untreated infections and therefore does not always hear well. So when you surprise him he can occasionally react and grab you. An adopter should be aware of this and understand to approach him from the front. Because of that no toddlers or small children who could approach him the wrong way!\n\nOtherwise he is an awesome dog, goes well on the leash, comes when called, sits but can be a little food aggressive. He does well with other dogs, especially smaller ones and loves to play with them. But again if he is not feeling well he can get snippy with them.\n\nAll in all Bear is an amazing, loving boy!\n\nA BIG FENCED YARD TO RUN AROUND & PROTECT EVERYTHING AROUND ME IS A MUST! 2/1/21 8:33 PM",

Christopher Robin's very playful and he adores other dogs and people. Christopher Robin has lots of energy and is always on the go! Christopher Robin likes to hang close to his people, but he also likes to explore. He's intelligent, fearless and curious by nature. He's never met a stranger seeing as he's very outgoing.\n\nChristopher Robin's an active little guy and will need a family that can provide lots of exercise and stimulation. A fenced in yard and a young furry sibling (similar in size and energy level) is desirable for this guy. After a long day, he enjoys cuddling up on the couch. He'll gladly spend the evening curled up watching TV with you- he prefers shows/movies with animals, as he's very intrigued by their sounds and movement on the screen!\n\nChristopher Robin is young and working on his puppy manners. He's crate trained and continues to work on his house training. He'll gladly play fetch and he appreciates any and all toys. He's not picky when it comes to food or treats; although, if he had his choice, he'd prefer something he can chew on, such as a bone. Christopher Robin is very social and affectionate. He has not been tested around cats. For families inquiring, all kids must be at least 7 years old.\n\nChristopher Robin is up to date on his vaccines and is fixed.",

            "description": "Age: 2 years\nGender: Male\nWeight: 70lbs\nEnergy Level: Moderate\nOverall Drive: Moderate\nLocation: Monroe, WA\n\nToddy is a lovable guy who longs for all the attention he can get from his handler, and as such is always within reach to receive scratches and belly rubs. If he were a human, he would be a professional athlete: he has endless amounts of energy and is extremely coordinated and agile. He loves to run and will play with anything that can be thrown or caught.\n\nToddy can be very eager but is easily distracted while out away from the house. He can be slightly reactive to both people and dogs when on leash and can struggle refocusing when there is lots of activity around him. He will need continued work with a skilled handler to ensure his focus stays on task. Toddy has played well with other dogs off leash and has also done well meeting new people when not on leash. Due to his high prey drive and high energy, he would likely do best in a home without cats, small animals, or children. Toddy rides well in the car, doesn\u2019t react to loud noises aside from the occasional bark, and is fully crate trained though will sometimes protest being in his crate during the day. He is working on mastering basic obedience and ensuring he is chewing appropriately. Toddy will need an experienced handler who can provide him with structure and support while he continues to learn how to harness his energy and drive.\n\nToddy would do best in an active household where he could be included in all the hustle and bustle. He has lots of love and energy to give, and with the right handler he will continue to blossom into an amazing companion and partner. Looking for a goofy, athletic, and eager dog who is ready to give all of himself to you? Toddy is ready to meet you!\n\nWEST COAST ADOPTIONS ONLY\n\nMust have previous or current, purebred Malinois experience OR other high drive working breed experience\n\nOur adoption process includes- completion of an application, followed by a telephone interview. If that goes well, we will arrange for a home visit.\nAdoption Fee: $500.00. Transport along Interstate 5 (Bakersfield, CA to Bellingham, WA) is available but cost not included in adoption fee. \n\nPlease visit www.woofproject.org and fill out an adoption application located here https://www.woofproject.org/application",

He is fearful of new people and does take some time to warm up to you. Once he trusts you he will follow you and allow some pets. He watches everything going on around him and picks up on how to play and walk on a leash very quickly. He now enjoys his toys, treats, and can now be leashed with the people he trusts. Minnegan is a big boy. We do not recommend he be placed in a home with small children. His breed is a Tosa Inu. Please research this rare breed before considering him a fit for your home.",

I have lots of energy so if you like to run, I'm the doggie companion for you. I'm searching for my fur-ever family. I really enjoy walks outdoors, getting scratches, and playing with my foster brother. My ideal family would be me, my foster parent(s) and maybe a fur brother or sister to play with. I'm friends with all of the dog friends I meet. I recently learned that I do well with calm older children (over 12) but not so much with small children - I don't understand what to think of the loud noises they make and their energy is something else! I'm looking for a family who has time to train me, and give me lots of love. A fenced in yard for exercise is a plus, too! My favorite place to be is next to my human(s). I love them so much that when I'm in the car with them, I'll bark really loudly when someone walks up. I just want my family to know STRANGER DANGER!! At night, I sleep in their bedroom and alligator roll all over the bed until they send me to my bed, tuck me in and tell me goodnight. My foster parents say I'm doing well with leash manners but sometimes I'll try to go for a squirrel or a bunny if I see one. My prey drive is one reason why I should not live with cats. My foster family is working on basic manners with me. Right now, I can sit and shake for food. Why would I do it if there is no pepperoni involved?! Sometimes I get in trouble for counter surfing, but who wouldn't steal chicken from the counter when no one's watching? My people also don't love when I mouth them, but I can't help it when I want pets or get too excited. Sometimes their hands and arms just end up in my mouth! I'd never do anything to hurt them though. I am extremely protective of my people when visitors come to my house or approach my car. For this reason, I will need an experienced German Shepherd owner that is willing to help me become my best self. If you think you'd like to get a chance to know me better, please reach out to your adoption coordinator. If you do not have an adoption coordinator, please fill out an adoption application at https://freedomgermanshepherdrescue.org. I am being fostered near Fayetteville. Love, Echo",

            "description": "Boo was adopted out as a puppy almost 10 years ago and he thought he was home for good. But he was recently returned to us because the stress of a new baby in the house made him very anxious and protective. We feel that Boo really needs a quiet, adult-only home with someone who can give him the time and attention he craves and has been missing. Boo will follow his people from room to room, just wanting to be near them. He does still have high energy, even as a senior dog. He can be very strong on a leash and is a little stubborn when he wants to be. Boo also prefers females over males but is capable of loving both! The best home for him would be one who has few visitors as he bonds strongly with his owners.\n\nBoo has never lived with another dog, and can be selective with them when meeting on walks, etc., so we are not sure how he would do with another dog in the home. He does have a high prey drive, so cats would also be a definite \"no\".\n\nIf you are interested in Boo, please fill out an application today at www.ehrdogs.org. We would really love to see this poor boy back in a home after having had one for ten years.",

Lola, along with her human owner, her 6 four-day-old puppies, 3 furry sisters, and 2 furry brothers were evicted from their home last October. Luckily, when asked to help, we had room for all the dogs in the family. Lolas puppies have now all found their forever homes and she is looking for hers. She is very bright. You must gain her trust before being accepted. Fortunately, she is easily persuaded with patience and treats. When she allows you to join Team Lola, it is fast friendship. She is quick as lightening and is expert at the worlds fastest zoomies. She is a medium sized dog and is fully house trained. She played well with the other dogs she lived with in her previous home, but a meet and greet with any other resident dogs would be a must. A physical fence is required. \n\nAHeinz57 Pet Rescue and Transport is a 501c3 no-kill animal rescue located in De Soto, Iowa. Our pets are located at our facility and in foster homes around Central Iowa. We do adopt to out of town applicants, however we do require new family members be picked up in person. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting one of our adorable adoptables, the first step in our process is to complete an adoption application. To complete an application or read more about our adoption process, please visit our website:\n\nhttps://www.aheinz57.com/adopt-a-pet/adoption-process/\nOur adoption fees are:\n\n$300 - Puppies (up to 6 months)\n\n$195 - Dogs age 6 months - 7 years\n\n$100 - Senior Dogs (age 8 and up)\n\n$200 - Bonded Buddies\n\n$100 - Kittens (up to age 6 months)\n\n$150 - 2 Kittens\n\n$60 - Cats age 6 months and up\n\n$90 - 2 Cats\n\nFor the most up-to-date listing of adoptable animals, please visit our website: https://www.aheinz57.com/adopt-a-pet/\n\nThank you for considering adopting a rescue animal!",

            "description": "Drake is an approximately 5 year old black male who came from a shelter in upstate New York. Sadly Drake has tested positive for Heartworm and will need Heartworm treatment. He was recently neutered and will be starting his Heartworm treatment in October once recovered from his neuter. On top of all of that, Drake has a serious happy tail. His foster mom is working hard to heal it and we are hopeful it will not need to be amputated. It will take a good two months of careful wrapping and protection to do that. Drake had a double ear infection and needed antibiotics to treat that. The antibiotics then caused quite the tummy upset. Since then, Drake has had a hard time adjusting to several diets that his foster mom has tried and is suffering with colitis. His foster mom is working on finding the right combination of foods, probiotics and supplements to get that under control. Despite all these issues, Drake is so sweet! He loves everyone and gets along with all the dogs in his foster home. He is constantly wagging that long strong tail and hence the challenge of keeping it bandaged. The current methods seem to be working. Once Drake starts his Heartworm treatment he will need to be on crate rest and limited activity for at least two months. Drake certainly has been a challenge to care for but is worth all the efforts on his behalf, he is an absolute love and whoever is lucky enough to take him home will have a wonderful Dane companion. Drake came to MAGDRL in September of 2020 (3).\n\nFor more info on this dog and our adoption policies, visit <a href=\"http://magdrl-nj.com/our-dogs\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">NJ MAGDRL\u00a0at </span>http://www.magdrl-nj.com/our-dogs/ .\u00a0</a>\n\n<strong>MAGDRL adopts Great Danes in NY, NJ, PA, MD, DE, DC, VA & WV.</strong>",

She walks well on leash, does not chew things up, and working on redirection. Things she's not so crazy about: Doesn't like to share food and toys. Has a prey drive so NO cats or small dogs. She's dog selective and can be quirky about meeting new people. Piper will need an experienced owner who can give her a structured environment with rules and boundaries.

Rowan is only 2 years old and weighs about 48 pounds. The volunteers say that he is a super sweet dog with a great personality. He already knows to sit and lay down on command, and walks nicely on a leash! Rowan is up to date with his shots and neutered, and will be microchipped and heartworm tested upon adoption. Rowan is waiting to meet you in cage 805, and his ID# is 626123. Go meet Rowan as soon as you can! \n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

She is playful, high-energy, and very well-behaved. We are working on basic commands and she is good walking on a leash. Hayla is crate-trained and quiet in her crate. She is also quiet around the house, and she gets along incredibly well with my two older dogs. She would likely appreciate having a young, high-energy sibling for playtime! Hayla does have some issues with mobility and with pottying. She has seen a neuro-specialist, and the specialist said she does show signs of a spinal cord issue and/or issues commonly seen in \"cork-screw tail\" breeds. Hayla is incontinent, and she does not seem to feel when she goes to the bathroom at all. The specialist gave a poor prognosis for correcting this, and she will likely be incontinent her entire life. Hayla does very well wearing a diaper around the house! We are working on a pottying routine helping her express outside.\n\nHayla's back feet are also a little uncertain. She has a very unique gait, but this does not stop her from running and jumping with her buddies! She does not show any signs of pain... It seems like she can't feel very much and doesn't exactly know where her feet land. Hayla does show a surprising amount of coordination despite this, though!\n\nHayla LOVES to play with other dogs, and she does well meeting new people and animals. She can get overwhelmed in new places, but with a treat and some kind words, she is quickly won over! She also finds a lot of confidence from being around her doggie siblings.\n\nHayla is a wonderful dog! Her personality is unique and adorable.",

Meet this handsome, 46 pound boy in run 81. His ID number is 626091. He is up-to-date on vaccines, and he will be neutered, microchipped, and heart worm tested upon adoption.

You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information.

I was picked up so that I didn't get run over. While in the rescue, they found out I had some medical concerns, so my medical journey began. Well, I am feeling great now and I am ready for a new chapter. I am a super cuddly Chihuahua. I am good with other dogs about my size and older kids. I love to lay on your lap, or on the couch snuggled in my favorite blanket. I sleep all night, under the covers in my foster's bed with a doggy foster sibling as well.\n\nI have what's called a collapsed trachea. No need to worry about it, because I have a good medication regime that I got from a specialist, that's not expensive. I just completed heartworm treatment so local adoptions only please. My ideal home would be mellow, calm and loving. My specials needs would be daily medication and a harness. That's not too much to ask for right? My adoption fee is $250 and it includes all my vaccines, neuter and microchip. Fill out an app at www.soca-fbc.org under the adoptable tab.",

Alex is a quirky, playful guy looking for a GSD experienced home. He enjoys walks and playing with his plastic toys. Alex is good with other dogs and likes to play with the neighbor dog through the fence. We were told he previously spent a lot of time outdoors, and it certainly shows as he can keep himself entertained. In typical GSD fashion he loves his person and will be your shadow. Alex loves to go for walks and is easy to handle on leash. He does not like to be kenneled, but he does well when confined to an area when left alone. If you\u2019re looking to give a senior boy a loving home in his golden years, apply at www.gsrescue1.org",

She is a loving dog that enjoys her walks and down time. She is HW+ and will be receiving treatment but that doesn't get her down. She will make a wonderful companion for anyone looking for that dog that they can relax with and go for daily walks and hikes. She does need to be your one and only as she prefers all of your attention. We are not sure about young children so 10+ is preferred. Adopt Winky today!",

            "description": "MEET KELSOS RIVER\n \nTiny Kelsos River already struck out as a racing dog, never having made it out of training school. We're convinced that's because her true destiny is as someone's companion.\nShe's a delicate, tentative soul who is seeking a special home where she can forget her worries and find peace and security.\nAt the top of young River's list of requirements is a quiet environment with people who are home a lot, and who are familiar with the Greyhound breed. She is not a hound for first-time adopters.\nFor a dog who never raced, River is quite athletic. Since we have been told she can easily clear a 4' fence, we'd feel better if she had a sturdy 6' fence.\nShe is startled by loud noises and sudden movements, so leash walking in the neighborhood is something that should be delayed until she becomes more confident. A two-leash system, one attached to a collar and one to a harness, is perfect for her at this stage in her transition.\nNext up on her must-have list: another Greyhound or two who can show her the ropes. There's an unspoken language among Greyhounds that they all understand, whether or not they raced. River needs guidance and reassurance from her own kind as it will show her how to act, and react, to life on the outside. \nIn the two weeks that we've had her, River has already made great strides. She sailed through her spay surgery, and even made friends with the veterinary nurses taking care of her. She has also been helped by her well-experienced foster parents, by the other Greyhounds in her foster home, and by the pheromone-based calming collar that she has been wearing for the past week.\nOne way in which River is not shy is when it comes to eating. If eating and counter-surfing was an Olympic sport, River would go for the gold. She is very enthusiastic and happy to munch away, seemingly without a care in the world. This means, of course, that training her should come easily since she is food motivated. Using a treat as a reward/incentive goes a long way.\nSince River is only 14 months old, she is still very much a puppy. She is affectionate, and would be glad to have you pet her as long as you are will to keep going. She knows the phrase used in racing circles, \"kennel up,\" and immediately goes into her crate for meals, and overnight. \nRight now, young River weighs just 50 pounds, but she is still growing. Still, she'll never be a very big girl, maybe 7-10 pounds heavier and a few inches taller.\nWe tried cat testing River when she arrived, but she was so overwhelmed by the new sights and sounds that she could not focus on the cat or anything else. Now that she's a bit more settled, we'll test her again.\nRiver is a fast-learner who will soon gain even more confidence and be someone's best friend for many years to come.\n",

            "description": "Scooby loves everyone he meets, and he enjoys other dogs. He's about a year and a half, and he's a Bassador (Basset Hound - Labrador Retriever mix). He has a big ol' chocolate lab head and a basset body. He is a really sweet boy and wonderful companion. He enjoys toys, treats, and big soft beds. \nScooby is excited to find his new family, and he has a few requests:\n? Scooby really loves to be with his people, so he would like to find a home where someone will be with him most of the time.\n? He gets a little nervous around unfamiliar doorways and will need someone to help him learn that it's safe (a few times in and out on the leash does wonders for him).\n? Scooby is a laid-back guy, but he does love to play and gets the zoomies (for about 10 minutes before he crashes ? ). It's not a requirement, but he'd love to have a playmate.\n? He loves going on walkies and it's important for his health to stay active. He'd like to find a family who will take him on walks.\n? Scooby doesn't realize his size, so he would do best in a home with children over the age of 5.\nHe is a goofy, sweet, fun, happy, loving, well-behaved boy who needs a family to give him a little time to get to know them and to help him get settled in to their routine. In return, he will be your best friend and the best dog ever.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: www.tinyurl.com/IADRAdoptionApp\n\nIf you'd like to help Scooby while he searches for his very own family, you can sponsor him for only $19/month here: https://petbucks.org/pet/6208/sponsor/create\n\n\n***IMPORTANT- PLEASE READ***\nThe State of Texas requires rescues to collect sales tax on any adoption fees. Our adoption fee is $175. Texas State Sales Tax will be added to that amount.\n\nDue to the nature of our adoption process, our fosters are usually only able to consider potential adopters within the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. A vet reference is required, and a trial period will be completed before finalizing the adoption. Thank you for your understanding.",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Maple. I love going on walks and being with my people. Playing in the leaves is super fun too! I enjoy chewing on antlers and having my ears rubbed. I tend to get super excited at meal times or when being let out of my kennel so I might jump up or clip your fingers with my mouth. Don\u2019t worry \u2013 I\u2019m just happy and want to share my excitement!\n\nI am a 2yo female pit bull mix from Tuba City. I love other dogs and all sorts of people. There are two things that I love more than anything though\u2026and that\u2019s food and giving kisses. Here\u2019s why\u2026\n\nWhen I was rescued, I was very skinny and had been hit by a car, too. That car really did a number on my insides and even fractured my back-right leg. However, after a pretty intense surgery and weeks of bed rest, I am all better and raring to go! Sometimes you\u2019ll notice a hitch in my gait, especially when I\u2019m running. But this does not slow me down at all.  I even love going to Doggie Day Camp.  So many fun friends and hooman hugs! \n\nI would love to have a home to call my own and I really want another confident, playful dog in the house. I really don't like getting in trouble, so I need a hooman who will be patient with me.  A simple correction works for me.  Do you work from home? Maybe you don't go to work anymore and want a compact girl like me to add to your family? \n\nMaple kennels up easily and knows to go lay down (in a certain spot) and sit, and she rides well in the car. She is also a very fast learner.\n\nEveryone at TCHS calls me their miracle dog \u2013 could you be my miracle?\n\nMaple is up to date on her vaccinations, neutered and is currently being fostered in Flagstaff. Her adoption fee is $150\n\nWe are a small rescue/foster group without an animal shelter. If you are interested in meeting Maple, please fill out an online adoption application, located here: http://tubacityhumanesociety.org/tuba-city-humane-society-dogcat-online-adoption-application/ with more information about our adoption process here:\nhttp://tubacityhumanesociety.org/adoptions/\n\nOnce we receive your application, which answers basic questions for us, we will have a conversation with you, before setting up a meeting. For more information, please contact Deb at dfranklin@tubacityhumanesociety.org or by phone at (928) 853-1046 (No calls after 7 p.m. please.)",

I'm learning my manners and I'm very treat motivated. I'm also known asa greatcuddler.I'd do best as an only dog and in a home with older children, 13 years old and up.\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\n I am very social and love every person I meet!I am high energy and I love to work and train and stay busy.I'd probably do best as an only dog. I can be a bit reactive on leash when I see other dogs, but I'm working on that. I have lots of puppy energy and am still learning my manners. I do like to chew things, so I need lots of project toys. I do well in my crate.\n\nDoes Jax like other pets?\n\nI'd do best as an only dog and no cats, please.\n\nDoes Jax like children?\n\nI have lots of energy and may be a bit too much for small children. I'd probably do best in a home with older children, 13 years old and up.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\nI love my Kong, rope toys and bones filled with yummy treats.\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\n I need an active family and one that is willing to work with me and keep me busy. I love attention and I really enjoy being with myhumans. I'd love a yard to run and play in. I'd also do best as an only dog and in a home with children, 13 years and older.",

He knows sit, lay down, and shake.\nBenny loves people, and he loves children once he has gotten used to them but can nip at them for the first few days upon meeting them.  It only takes him a few days to warm up to children though, then he absolutely loves them!\nBenny is very cuddly and loves sitting next to you on the couch and loves belly rubs.\nBenny does well on a leashed harness when taken for walks.\nHe does well with other dogs.\nHe does well with free feeding and is non food aggressive and has no resource guarding issues.\nBenny is a total love bug.  Adoption fee $400\n\nAll UnderDogs are spayed/neutered, heartworm checked, microchipped, up to date on vaccines and heartworm/flea/tick preventatives.  For consideration for one or more dogs, we require that an on-line application is filled out.  \n\nTO ADOPT THIS DOG PLEASE FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AT https://underdogrescueofflorida.com/. \n\nSorry, we do not adopt outside of Florida.  Applicants are subject to a home visit, and veterinary references will be checked. Please include a vet reference (including phone number) when applying online.\n\nOur application process:\nFIRST, an application must be approved for adoption from our rescue.\nSECOND, we determine whether the dog that has been applied for is a \"good match\" for the household that wants to adopt him/her.  We take into consideration the dog's activity level, compatibility with other members of the household (human and other pets), etc.\nIf your application has been approved, but the dog you applied for is no longer available, please take the time and look over our adoptable dogs again.  We will make every effort to find the right dog for an approved applicant.\n\nWe hope you agree and understand that our goal to find the best forever home is our #1 priority! Please fill out an Adoption Application at https://underdogrescueofflorida.com/",

Hera has been fighting the infection for 6 months now.\n\nWhen we first rescued her, it took several doctors and a specialist to figure out what was wrong since the infection is so rare.\n\nThe fungus invaded Hera\u2019s entire body. She was in an oxygen tank for 4 days, she couldn\u2019t use her front leg, and the infection caused her to be blind. \n\nNow, after $16,000 in vet bills, Hera\u2019s clinically doing well, but her Blasto levels are still high at 11.4.\n\nWe continuously monitor her blood and organ values as her antifungal meds can damage her liver and kidneys. She goes back for a recheck in January.\n\nBeing blind has not stopped Hera from being a normal pup. At only 1-year-old, she enjoys playing with other dogs more than anything. She has learned how to go up and down steps as well.",

            "description": "Beautiful Bella is ready to meet her new family.  This sweet beagle mix is about 9 years old but she has plenty of love to give.  We don\u2019t know what this girl is mixed with - (maybe spaniel? Your guess is as good as ours) - however she weighs about 25 pounds.  She recently had surgery to remove a mammary mass and is getting back to being her playful self.  \n\nBella found herself in need of help after her owner passed away.  We were given the privilege to help her transition through her loss and find a new family to love.\n\nBella is dog and cat friendly.  She is good with older children who respect her boundries.  She is good on a leash, house broken, and crate trained. It took some time but she learned how to use the doggy door and now uses it like a pro.  This little lady likes to catch treats, will sit for you (sometimes) and respects furniture rules.  She is not a velcro dog but does like to be with her people.  She is pretty chill and loves belly rubs and a good nap.\n\nAs we know, no dog is perfect and so we share the faults.  Bella does guard her food and must be fed separately from other dogs to prevent issues.  She loves to dig and has a history of trying to dig under the fence.  It will come as no surprise that one of her favorite things to do is talk -  with her big beagle voice.\n\nBella\u2019s foster mom tells us that while \u201cno dog is perfect, Bella is pretty darn close to it\u201d.  Could she be perfect for you?\n_____________________________\n\nThe adoption donation for Bella is $200. All of our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, current on vaccines, and on flea/tick/heartworm prevention. \n\nOur applications can be found at https://www.apaprescue.com\n\nIf you would like to meet this dog, you must have an approved application on file and be willing to travel to the Columbiana, Ohio area for a meet and greet.  All of our dogs reside in foster homes. We do not have a physical shelter.\n\nApplications will be reviewed/approved, and each dog will be placed in the home that can best meet their individual needs.  Submitting an application does not guarantee adoption of any dog.\n",

She arrived to her Virginia foster on December 19th. Ruby is doing AMAZING since her move to Virginia. Most all of her beautiful coat is growing back, I hope her coat will be full and bushy by spring. She's eating and drinking very good, she gets a daily supplement which I'm sure is the reason her fur is growing so nice. We are introducing her slowly to our pack, 2 Shepherd s and 1 Lab. She is good friends with our Lab , she s very interested in our Shepherds but they are a lot bigger and stronger. This girl is getting her strength back, she's still a little wobbly in her hind legs. She has very little muscle so we're watching over her to make sure she's safe. She likes men and women, we have not met any children yet. She loves to play ball in the yard and sleep in her new bed, most likely her 1st one. Ruby I\n\ns ok in the car no sickness , still a little unsure of where she's going so I'll work on making car rides a good thing. Her !st Vet. visit was good she loved everyone and they adored her, we will have her results soon so rescue can get her started on her heartworm treatments. We will be at events soon! check us out on the website and Facebook for her updates...If you are an approved adopter and are interested in this dog, please let your case worker know. If you are not yet an approved adopter but are interested, please complete an adoption application!\nYou can review our adoption process, www.shenandoahrescue.org/adoption-process if interested. Donations can be made at shenandoahrescue.org/donate or on PayPal to info@shenandoahrescue.org",

Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nGreeley is a handsome 1 year-old Beagle/Collie mix male who found himself homeless at an overcrowded rural county dog shelter and made the trip to Canine Lifeline so he could take his time finding the perfect new home. We don't have any history on his pre-shelter life but he's been a very friendly guy with all people he's met since coming to us. He's been particular about his dog friends though. Some dogs he meets and instantly starts wrestling and playing with them and others he doesn't like at all. He would not be a candidate for doggie daycare or the dog park and would need to be monitored closely on walks should he take a dislike to a dog he meets. We also want to place Greeley as the only dog in the home as he doesn't like to share his things with other dogs. Greeley has done very well with crate-training in his foster home so should be able to pick up the house rules quickly in his new home. Greeley needs a yard that has a secure aboveground fence to keep him safely at home. He would also benefit from attending an obedience class with his new family to work on his canine good manners. With some time and patience, this sweet dog is going to make a fabulous companion for his new one-dog family. Greeley weighs about 38 pounds and his adoption fee is $325. He's neutered, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Greeley. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Greeley and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

He is up to date on vaccinations, preventatives, and is microchipped and neutered. Stormy is house trained and adores being with his person.\n\nStormy can be protective over his person, so a home without children or other pets is best for Stormy. He needs an owner who understands both of his breeds and is dedicated to obedience training and providing positive energy outlets for him.\n\nStormy is currently being cared for by the wonderful staff at Bowzee Wowzee Pet Lodge in Ft. Mill, SC.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Stormy, please visit the Adoption Process page on our website \u2013 http://carolinasrescue.com/Adoption_Process.html. You can download our Adoption Questionnaire there, then email it to us at adoptions@carolinasrescue.com. That will start the process.",

She hasn\u2019t had an accident in last two days inside- (but we are really on top of it and take her out every hour).\n\nHere are the negatives: \nShe\u2019s bonding strongly with just me- (even though I\u2019ve made it a point to make sure my kids and husband are fully engaged and part of the daily love and training and they\u2019ve all been around her and home as much as I have since we got her) - she might be more of a one person type dog- \nShe has a Chihuahua style tenacity about her that doesn\u2019t listen and/or give up when focused/engaged on something she wants- but in a bad way.  \n- she is possessive over me and reacts when my children approach \n\nShe\u2019s skittish and nervous at times- but the type that isn\u2019t just puppy behavior- it\u2019s more temperament \n\nWe will be looking for an experienced adopter\n\nThese adorable babies were released to the rescue by their mommies owner she had several big dog mixes and was unsure of who their dad was. We stepped in had mommy spayed and got the puppies all their needed veterinary care, puppies are now de wormed, up to dat on vaccines and looking for their forever homes.\nIf you are interested in meeting them start by filling out an adoption application\nhttp://mixedmuttsrescue.com/adoption-application\nThe puppies adoption fee is $600 you receive a $100 refund if proof of spay/neuter is provided by 1/30/2021\n",

            "description": "Please complete an adoption application before inquiring about Remy.   If he is still listed then he is still available.   Please ready his entire description and if you feel you might be a decent fit, then we would love to see your application!   Be as thorough as possible with your answers...  Remy is a great boy, but needs a very particular home...    \n\nHere is the link for our online adoption application:\nhttps://www.emailmeform.com/builder/form/reDsnda01Xg1el09\n\nRemy is a courtesy listing to help his owner find the right forever home for him.    He is a 4 yr old husky/shepherd mix, 75 lbs,  housetrained,  UTD on vaccines, microchipped and neutered.    Very playful and sweet boy!   However he is fairly leery of new people and can be dog selective, so is not a candidate for dog parks.   Knows several commands and has a good amount of energy.   Loves any outdoor activities, loves to swim and will need a physically active owner.   Experience required, he is not the dog for a first time dog owner or someone who is not a leader.    Remy will require daily structure, leadership and exercise.       A busy home with lots of people or kids in and out is not the right fit.    He bonds very strongly with his person and is off leash trained.    He would love a quiet home in the country with an active person who is home a lot.   Preferably who works from home or possibly retired.    (not required but preferred)   \n\nRemy is currently being boarded at Liberty K9 Training in Barnum MN and potential adopters will be able to meet him there.   He has also gone through a Board and Train program there.   \n\nReferences, home visit and completed application required.   \n\nA note from the trainer!\nRemy is a very high energy dog that will require a large fenced in yard, or a very active home that will take him for walks, hikes, swims, etc. Remy LOVES to run and swim. Remy has completed a very high level of off-leash obedience training. Remy comes back when he is called, waits at doorways, lays down and stays, sits and stays, knows how to \"leave it\", stay on place and walk nicely on a loose leash. Remy is very particular when it comes to other dogs. He enjoys being around other dogs, but only if they are appropriate and not too pushy. Remy also has some other behavior quirks. Sometimes when Remy is walked on leash, he gets very worked up when he sees other dogs - this is something that can continue to improve by utilizing his obedience. Remy will come with 2 free private lessons at Liberty K9 in Barnum, MN so that his new owner(s) can better understand his quirks and continue with his obedience. Remy is a lover and very social with people he trusts... but is very unsure of new people - especially men. This is also an area that can continue to be improved. Remy does not like small children as they often don't understand boundaries and are not very appropriate with him. Remy would make a great adventure buddy with someone who is active and willing to help him work through his issues.",

He can use a little training but is super motivated, loves treats, and eager to please. He loves his long walks and running in the yard chasing balls (we're working on retrieving but he\u2019s half way there!), so an active home is preferred. His ideal home is one where he is the only pet and there are no small kids (due to size and still playful energy). Photographs don\u2019t do this handsome boy justice. His soulful eyes will hypnotize and touch your heart. Sadly, he has been overlooked because of his size and his preference to be the only pet. But he has so much love to give, we know his family is out there. Will you give him a chance? Please inquire about meeting him!!",

            "description": "Bailey is 2.5 years old, about 55-60 lbs and a total sweetheart!! There is an innocence and vulnerability in her eyes, in the way she looks at her people. Bailey was found by one of the shelter staff on the side of a road. She had a tag but when her owners were called, they said they no longer wanted her. She is medium energy (medium high when she\u2019s excited) as she's still young, and very playful. She loves to give kisses, hugs, and loves to play ball (she can fetch for hours!). She's young,  eager to please, and loves treats so is highly trainable. A home with no small kids (due to her size), no other pets, and a backyard would be ideal. She's truly an amazing girl with the cutest bunny ears!! She is a bit shy at first but she\u2019s a real foodie, so you can win her over with treats fairly quickly. Once she knows you, she will shower you with unconditional love. She just need a chance!!! Please don\u2019t let her continue to grow up in the shelter!!! Inquire about Bailey today!",

He\u2019s overcome a lot!\nDue to the abuse he received he lost use of his back legs and tail for a while, but he is using them now! He can play right along with the other dogs. The nerve damage from abuse also led to some incontinence but with the use of a belly band he does great and has made his condition very manageable and easy. \nHe loves playing with his foster siblings and taking naps with his foster parents. He has not been cat tested, but he does loves kids or anyone else who wants to play. \nHe sleeps through the night in his kennel but does fine out of it as well. He is up to date on all of his shots and heartworm negative. \nDespite what has happened to him, he continues to show unconditional love. Please consider opening your home to Billy!  \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

            "description": "This dynamic duo, Buffy & Rocket, have become best friends in foster & are looking for their forever family together.  Both dogs are wonderful, sweet, loving & fun young pups.  Buffy is very timid at first, she takes longer to warms up & want to snuggle by following Rockets lead.  Rocket is very curious, confident, outgoing & is a real attention hog. Both are still pups about 9mo and 1yr old and 10lbs. \n\nThey are active little pups; up early to go potty (trained with a dog door), they enjoy the freedom to go out to run, play with toys, wrestle & sun bathe.  So an outdoor yard, a doggy door & secured fencing is required.  They bark when they play or at scary sounds & whine when left alone.  They still act like babies; chewing on blankets & stealing your shoes.  \n\nAs young pups they will need a family focused on their needs, with time to give them a ton of attention, be committed to training, give them positive encouragement, patience & understanding to help them to feel like loved family members.\n\nThank you for reading about our awesome dog. All dogs came to us from different situations and we often do not know much about their past, but they are rescue dogs who deserve a second chance and need patience on their journey. All of our dogs our are in foster homes all across the bay area. \n\nThe first step of the process is you must submit an application in order to set up a meet and great or talk with the foster family. Once application is submitted the foster parents will contact you to chat more about the dog and make sure they're a good fit and can answer any further question. The application answers most of all of our questions and can best match you. If you do not get the dog you apply for we can use your same application for 90 days towards another dog in our care and simply forward your app to that foster parent. \nhttp://form.jotform.com/underdogca/dog-adoption-application\n\nAll dogs will be fully vetted (Spay/ Neutered, Micro chipped, DHPP and Rabies Vaccinated) and other possible vet care prior to adoption.\n\nThe adoption fee is $300, which is considered a non refundable donation\n\nvisit us at underdogca.com or follow us on FB and IG @underdogca\nhttps://www.facebook.com/underdogCA",

I\u2019m an 18 month old staffy mix on a journey looking for my forever family! I\u2019ve had less than an ideal start to my life, being passed from family to family until ultimately I was sold on Craigslist and ended up with a family who didn\u2019t have the experience to have a larger, strong dog and luckily a group of dedicated people found a rescue for me!\n\nI am a very strong and active boy! I\u2019m looking for an active family with previous bully breed experience. I lived a very sheltered life before rescue, with lots of changes so my new family needs to be willing to initially allow me to acclimate to my new environment and be comfortable with new people, and be willing to utilize positive, reward based training with me! I have previous positive experience living with children, but I would likely be best suited in an adult home due to my energy level and size. I absolutely love to play ball, it\u2019s one of my favorite activities, but I also very much love to hike and splash around in the rivers/streams on our adventures.\n\nI am housebroken and crate trained! I know lots of commands like sit, down, paw, and stay! My leash walking skills could use a bit of work, but I\u2019m very food motivated and a fast learner. I\u2019m also dog friendly, but would do best with a dog similar to my size! I cannot share my home with cats or other small animals are just too excitable for me!\n\nI am looking for an adopter or a foster-to-adopt family. If I sound like a match for you, please ask about me today, I promise, you won\u2019t be disappointed!\n\nTo adopt or foster-to-adopt, please fill out the form at our website - https://www.furryfriendsct.org/adoption-application",

            "description": "PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE BIO ON THIS DOG BEFORE REQUESTING AN APPLICATION.  MANY OF OUR DOGS HAVE STRICT REQUIREMENTS FOR THEIR ADOPTION.\n\nSPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR BRAVA'S ADOPTION:\n\n1.  6 FOOT FENCE.\n\n2.  NO SMALL CHILDREN\n\n3.  SHE CANNOT LIVE IN AN APARTMENT, TOWNHOME, OR ATTACHED LIVING.\n\n6 month old female herding breed mix, about 15 pounds.\nBrava is an active, bouncy herding dog type. She has a softer temperament and is not as drivey as her brother Custer, but just as active and athletic.\nShe tends to be the submissive one of the two to both humans and dogs. She would love to have another dog to play with but tends to bond to her human. She can also settle and snuggle at times.\nShe can easily go over baby gates and shorter fences. 6' fenced yard required.\nNO small kids as she has shown some tendency to be quite afraid of small humans.\nShe is just a puppy so she needs all the things a puppy needs including manners, training, socialization and house training. \n\nAdoption contract and fee applies.  All adoptable dogs can be met at adoption events hosted every weekend. For a list of scheduled events go to: https://www.facebook.com/SmidgetRescue/events .  Smidget Rescue is not a shelter, and dogs cannot be seen at the Rescue location. All dogs are fostered throughout the Puget Sound area and are brought to the events where they can be met by prospective adopters. Additional pictures of adoptable dogs can be seen at: https://www.facebook.com/SmidgetRescue/photos_stream?tab=photos_albums.   All adoptable dogs are spayed or neutered at 6 months of age or older, and always before being placed in their new homes.  APPLICATIONS CAN BE OBTAINED BY EMAIL ONLY. Adoption process includes application, meet & greet, home visit and reference check. Email Jamie at smidgetrescue@hotmail.com or click on the CONTACT link on this page.  PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS BEFORE SENDING.  We get a fair number of incorrect emails and Jamie is not able to contact potential adopters.  Notice:  We do not ship dogs out of state.  If you live within a five-hour radius of Seattle, WA, (such as Portland, Vancouver B.C., etc.), we can arrange for a home visit.  If your home seems like a great fit for the dog you would like to adopt, you must then drive to meet the dog at one of our weekend events or at the fosters home.",

He arrived there because his owner - who was a dog trainer - died suddenly and unexpectedly. He is currently with a foster-based trainer, working on re-learning some basics and gaining confidence when meeting new people.\n\nWe would consider a foster-to-adopt home for Chewy. His ideal family will have a securely fenced yard and experience with rescue dogs.\n\nChewy has settled in well. He has shown himself to be a dog who just loves belly rubs and attention.\n\nHe does take some time feeling comfortable meeting new people. It doesn't take very long, and then he is happy to make new human friends :)\n\nHis family will work closely with his trainers to ensure a smooth transition and make sure that Chewy is set up for success.\n\nTo foster-to-adopt, please fill out the form at our website - https://www.furryfriendsct.org/foster-application",

MANY OF OUR DOGS HAVE STRICT REQUIREMENTS FOR THEIR ADOPTION.  \n\nSPECIFICS FOR CUSTER'S ADOPTION:  \n\n 1.   FOOT FENCE REQUIRED\n 2.  NO SMALL CHILDREN\n3.  HE CANNOT LIVE IN AN APARTMENT, TOWNHOME, OR ATTACHED LIVING.\n\n6 month old male herding breed mix puppy, about 15 pounds. Custer is an active, bouncy, driven herding dog type that needs a savvy adopter to rein him in! This guy loves to run and play chase with other dogs but tends to be a bit dominant with other dogs. He is submissive to people, however, and will 'smile' at you in submission. This is not at all aggression. He would love to have another dog to play with. He loves to nip you from behind and bounce off your butt when you are walking. This is typical for the breed and needs consistent correction until he understands that there is a time and a place. He would love to do agility or go sheep herding to burn off some of his energy while you are building a solid relationship. He will guard his food from other dogs (not humans), so separate feeding is recommended. He can easily go over baby gates and shorter fences. 6' fenced yard required. NO small kids as his teeth are sharp and he doesn't understand that kiddos are not play toys. Once he has grown and matured with some training, he will be ok with 10 and up. He is just a puppy so he needs all the things a puppy needs including manners, training, socialization and house training.   \n\nAdoption contract and fee applies.  All adoptable dogs can be met at adoption events hosted every weekend. For a list of scheduled events go to: https://www.facebook.com/SmidgetRescue/events .  Smidget Rescue is not a shelter, and dogs cannot be seen at the Rescue location. All dogs are fostered throughout the Puget Sound area and are brought to the events where they can be met by prospective adopters. Additional pictures of adoptable dogs can be seen at: https://www.facebook.com/SmidgetRescue/photos_stream?tab=photos_albums.   All adoptable dogs are spayed or neutered at 6 months of age or older, and always before being placed in their new homes.  APPLICATIONS CAN BE OBTAINED BY EMAIL ONLY. Adoption process includes application, meet & greet, home visit and reference check. Email Jamie at smidgetrescue@hotmail.com or click on the CONTACT link on this page.  PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS BEFORE SENDING.  We get a fair number of incorrect emails and Jamie is not able to contact potential adopters.  Notice:  We do not ship dogs out of state.  If you live within a five-hour radius of Seattle, WA, (such as Portland, Vancouver B.C., etc.), we can arrange for a home visit.  If your home seems like a great fit for the dog you would like to adopt, you must then drive to meet the dog at one of our weekend events or at the fosters home.",

She had puppies with her and once they were all with us, they were adopted out to separate families. Sadly, Snooki\u2019s family fell on hard times and could no longer care for her so she went back to her original foster home and has been doing amazing. \n\nShe loves all the dogs in her foster home and plays great with them. She would probably do best with dogs that are similar to her in size or larger with similar play styles. She is not a fan of cats though so will need a cat-free home. Her first home had kids, including a baby, and she loved them all and did great with them. \n\nShe is truly the sweetest and once trust is established, she loves her people and just wants to be with them. She can be a little wary of men in the beginning, but patience and treats will change her mind. Her most lovable attribute is that one ear that always stays up and, of course, her infectious smile! \n\nShe\u2019s a great car companion and would love to go on an adventure with you!

Other then needing to be diapered he is a pretty normal pup. He loves kids, adults, and other dogs. He will require a home with a fenced in yard so he can have diaper free time. He is great in the house and doesn't require a crate. He will play with his toys and not chew on things he is not supposed to. Loves to go on car rides and absolutely loves to visit with other dogs at the park. Must have English bulldog experience.  If you think Lil Man would be a great addition to your family please visit https://www.watersedgegreatdanerescue.com/adoption-process to find out more about our adoption process.\nIF THIS LISTING IS STILL POSTED WE ARE STILL ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS FOR THE DOG.

I was 21lbs overweight, walking was hard, nail polish painted all over my body. I had double ear infections and wounds covering my snoot. Now? I'm thriving and in love with my foster family.\n\n- Love me and I'll love you 100x times more! I'm super affectionate towards women, men and even children 10+. I have never met younger kids, so I'm not sure how I will be. I am also great with other dogs and cats... so pretty much a great fit with everyone!!! :) \n\n- All the belly rubs please! I am quick to roll over and show my belly to anyone who I think will pet it!\n\n- Even though I'm an adult I'm still like a puppy! I have tons of energy and LOVE playing.\n\n- I love human connection and thrive in a structured environment that has set rules. \n\n- I have never really been in a home before my foster home, so I am still learning what it's like to live inside, and what the boundaries and rules are, like not jumping up on the table, etc. With structured play, rest, meals and cuddles I have become very responsive and actually THRIVE in this type of atmosphere.\n\n- Even though I've never been in a home before, I am fully potty trained and have never had an accident in the home... I'm such a smart girl! \n\nMy perfect home will be:\n- With an active individual or family that doesn't have small/young children who is committed and willing to put in the time to maintain my training, and give me physical and mental stimulation daily.\n- With a yard, where I will have enough space to run around and play\n- With other dogs OK. I'm best with large dogs, and not small until I've been properly introduced. One of my foster brothers is 13lbs and he's pretty cool in my book!\n\nIf you see me online I am still available for adoption! If you are interested in adopting me please fill out an application here: www.hitlivingfoundation.org/adoption-application, and email a video walkthrough of your home and yard to BOTH Nicole@hitlivingfoundation.org AND Marta@hitlivingfoundation.org. Your application will not be counted as valid without your video. You will hear back from us within a few days.",

MANY OF OUR DOGS HAVE STRICT REQUIREMENTS FOR THEIR ADOPTION.\n\nSPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR ROCKABILLY:\n\n1.  NEEDS ANOTHER CONFIDENT DOG.\n\n2.  NO SMALL CHILDREN.\n\n6 month old male Dachshund/terrier/chihuahua mix puppy, about 16 pounds.\nRocky is a shy boy to humans but very playful with doggies! He loves to run and chase and play in the grass! He takes a bit to warm up to humans, but once he does, he loves pets and snuggles. His signature move is rearing up like a pony!\nHe's a quiet boy that would do best in a patient home with another confident dog to provide support and guidance. Older children would be best as to not over face him.\nHe is just a puppy so he needs all the things a puppy needs including manners, training, socialization and house training. \n\nAdoption contract and fee applies.  All adoptable dogs can be met at adoption events hosted every weekend. For a list of scheduled events go to: https://www.facebook.com/SmidgetRescue/events .  Smidget Rescue is not a shelter, and dogs cannot be seen at the Rescue location. All dogs are fostered throughout the Puget Sound area and are brought to the events where they can be met by prospective adopters. Additional pictures of adoptable dogs can be seen at: https://www.facebook.com/SmidgetRescue/photos_stream?tab=photos_albums.   All adoptable dogs are spayed or neutered at 6 months of age or older, and always before being placed in their new homes.  APPLICATIONS CAN BE OBTAINED BY EMAIL ONLY. Adoption process includes application, meet & greet, home visit and reference check. Email Jamie at smidgetrescue@hotmail.com or click on the CONTACT link on this page.  PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS BEFORE SENDING.  We get a fair number of incorrect emails and Jamie is not able to contact potential adopters.  Notice:  We do not ship dogs out of state.  If you live within a five-hour radius of Seattle, WA, (such as Portland, Vancouver B.C., etc.), we can arrange for a home visit.  If your home seems like a great fit for the dog you would like to adopt, you must then drive to meet the dog at one of our weekend events or at the fosters home.\n\n",

You will never have another sad day because Johnny always knows how to make anyone smile with his quirky antics and his fun spirit. Johnny was born with 2 deformed front legs which causes him to walk on his elbows. It sounds like this would slow him down but, not a chance! He still does most things other dogs do but just in his own way. Hes such an active and happy dog! He gets around just fine but would probably be best doing shorter walks. Hes a major love bug! He wants what all dogs want; a family. A family that will embrace his differences and love him the way that he is. We think hes perfect, but we know he longs for a forever home. We do recommend that he be in a home with children over 14+ and he would be best as your one and only pet. Doesnt Johnny sound amazing? Thats because he is! Contact us today if you're interested in a once in a lifetime dog like Johnny Rico!",

I was nothing more than to please my human, but I do need a family that is good at teaching/training, implementing boundaries and teaching me how to be a good boy. You know what things I've learned in just a week? Sit, down, look at me, and place. Commands, \"come,\" and, \"stay,\" are 2 things I'm still working hard at! I also have a lot of energy and like to be very active! Hiking, running, count me in! If I can't let my energy out, I tend to find myself in trouble, so a backyard and room to run plus other activities, are a MUST for me to be happy and not chew up your favorite slippers/shoes! I'm a loving boy though and my foster dad is pretty awesome and can fill you in about more!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org/available-dogs",

Letty is loving and affectionate. She gets along well with other dogs, unknown with cats, and we do believe she would do well with children. She is house trained, does not need a crate but likes one for her comfort. \n\n \n\nWe are a foster based rescue based out of Muskegon, MI. We have an application process for adopting our pets. We have an application on our website www.caninesrescue.com. PLEASE DO NOT EMAIL US WITH YOUR APPLICATION INFORMATION. WE REQUIRE YOU FILL OUT THE FORM. We check vet references, backgrounds for abuse or neglect and home ownership or speak to the landlord to verify you are allowed to have a pet. Once the application is received and approved then we will set up a time for you to come and meet our pups that are available. All our dogs are up to date on shots, microchipped, been dewormed at least once, and sterilized. All meet and greets are APPOINTMENT ONLY.

We only have volunteers and are unable to answer general adoption questions/questions about a dog over the phone.\nHi my name is Ellie Mae and I\u2019m a 2 year old Decker Rat Terrier. I have been spayed, vaccinated, micro-chipped, and am now ready for my new home! I weigh around 16lbs.\n\nHere\u2019s the deal... I was surrendered by my owner. I was kept in a pen outside with two other Decker dogs and they kept beating me up. I got hurt pretty bad a couple of times. I do not want to be an outside dog. I am crate and potty trained! I have never had an accident in my foster moms home. I don\u2019t tear things up so you wouldn\u2019t have to crate me. I get along great with the other dogs and puppies at my foster home I do need a house with at least one other nice dog around my age. I do like to ride on a Gator, snuggle on the couch, and play with other dogs. You must have a fenced yard. If you would like to adopt me please complete the online adoption form. Adoption fee is $95.00.\n\nTo meet one of our animals and possible adopt, please fill out this pre-adoption form so it can be sent to the foster:\nhttps://form.jotform.com/200005720739042\nSome sites won't allow you to open the link--Copy and paste it into you URL or email us for a form. cimarronhumane@yahoo.com. We do adopt out of state but we do not ship animals, If you want to adopt one of our animals, you must come to pick them up in Oklahoma.",

It took a few months to get all of this vetting done. But he's a healthy happy boy now.\nHe's about 2 yo and around 23#. He is very smart and eager to please.

            "description": "This litter of Valley pups don't talk funny, but they'll layer you with kisses.\n\nWith a guesstimated birthday of Oct. 5th, they were abandoned so it's uncertain what their mom and dad look like.\n\nEach pup in this litter is sweet and loves people.  They enjoy playing with other dogs and snuggling. \n\nApril 2020:  We are not holding public adoption events at this time.  Qualified families are being invited to appointments to meet specific dogs.  There are currently no opportunities to view multiple dogs and adoption events aren't being held at Tractor Supply in Lenoir.\n\nWhether dogs / puppies come in as strays or owner surrenders, we usually have to make our best guess as to birthdate and breed.   \n\nIf adopted into a home with other animals, particularly cats, your new pet should be crated or secured when you're not available to supervise to insure a harmonious relationship.  \n\nA vet reference is required to confirm responsible pet ownership.  We suggest first time pet owners look for an adult dog for companionship and to gain experience through another rescue or your local government-run animal control..\n\nAdoption fee covers two vaccinations plus spay / neuter if using our local low-cost spay/neuter clinic (overnight stay required) and surgery occurs as agreed upon in the adoption contract.  Convenience fee equal to refundable spay/neuter deposit may be added if using our veterinarian.  Additional fees for 3rd puppy vaccination, refundable spay/neuter deposit, etc. may apply.  \n\nWe are an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue.  We receive no funding from agencies.  Available animals can be seen most Saturdays at Tractor Supply in Lenoir from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  We recommend interested parties contact us to pre-qualify for adoption so their new furry family can go home once paperwork is complete.  Fees are required in cash.  For more information on our organization, our website is www.petpartnersrescue.org.",

            "description": "This litter of Valley pups don't talk funny, but they'll layer you with kisses.\n\nWith a guesstimated birthday of Oct. 5th, they were abandoned so it's uncertain what their mom and dad look like.\n\nEach pup in this litter is sweet and loves people.  They enjoy playing with other dogs and snuggling.  \n\nApril 2020:  We are not holding public adoption events at this time.  Qualified families are being invited to appointments to meet specific dogs.  There are currently no opportunities to view multiple dogs and adoption events aren't being held at Tractor Supply in Lenoir.\n\nWhether dogs / puppies come in as strays or owner surrenders, we usually have to make our best guess as to birthdate and breed.   \n\nIf adopted into a home with other animals, particularly cats, your new pet should be crated or secured when you're not available to supervise to insure a harmonious relationship.  \n\nA vet reference is required to confirm responsible pet ownership.  We suggest first time pet owners look for an adult dog for companionship and to gain experience through another rescue or your local government-run animal control..\n\nAdoption fee covers two vaccinations plus spay / neuter if using our local low-cost spay/neuter clinic (overnight stay required) and surgery occurs as agreed upon in the adoption contract.  Convenience fee equal to refundable spay/neuter deposit may be added if using our veterinarian.  Additional fees for 3rd puppy vaccination, refundable spay/neuter deposit, etc. may apply.  \n\nWe are an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue.  We receive no funding from agencies.  Available animals can be seen most Saturdays at Tractor Supply in Lenoir from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  We recommend interested parties contact us to pre-qualify for adoption so their new furry family can go home once paperwork is complete.  Fees are required in cash.  For more information on our organization, our website is www.petpartnersrescue.org.",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Grinch is 5 years old at the time of intake in November 2020. Grinch is good with people of all ages and other dogs. Grinch was picked up by Animal Control and brought to a kill shelter. It's obvious that Grinch's life was one of neglect, abuse and cruelty. His skin was like concrete due to a severe skin infection, he was emaciated, weak and very depressed. And when perhaps he thought he was being saved, he was dumped on the dirty, cold floor of the shelter and he was still alone. But Grinch is no longer alone; he's now a Rescue Dogs Rock NYC dog and that means he will get a do over life and this time he will be kept safe, he will know what it's like to give and get love, to feel a kind touch and hear a soft, loving voice. Grinch is leashtrained, and he loves to play catch, cuddle on the couch and play with toys. And he makes an awesome office assistant! If you can give Grinch his do over life, please apply online to adopt Grinch (TX) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

He was rumored to at one time belong to drug addicts that allowed another of their dogs to die on a chain, uncared for. He was very malnourished and he was very thin. Covered in fleas of course. We took him to the vet the very next day and ran a full blood panel on him and found he was also heartworm positive.  \n\nWhen I met him he jumped right into my car and rubbed his head all over my chest and it placed it under my arm. Like he knew we would take care of him.  We did. He is now ready to find his forever home.  He has been treated for the heartworm disease and has gained over 20 lbs.  \n\nLupa is such a sweet boy!  He loves to be with people (kids included)  He is a big boy now at 80+ lbs.  He LOVES to eat!  He has been great with all the different dogs he has met here.  Untested with cats. \n\nCrate trained/House Broken\nGets along well with the other dogs\nCurrent on vaccines\nSpayed\nMicrochipped\nNegative for tick borne diseases (Lyme, Anaplasmosis, and Ehrlichiosis)\nKept on heartworm, intestinal parasite, and flea prevention\n\nIf you are interested in any of our dogs, please go to www.howlatthemoonrescue.com and fill out the application.  Adoption fee is $300\n\n",

            "description": "Daisy is a nine-year-old Black Lab who has quite a story. This special girl lived in a car with her homeless owner for most of this year. Both Daisy and her owner had some significant health challenges and Daisy was diagnosed with diabetes this fall. When her owner became permanently incapacitated, Daisy was surrendered to the county shelter and we were able to rescue her.\n\nManaging doggie-diabetes may seem scary, but it really isn\u2019t. Daisy\u2019s daily care is fairly straightforward and simple. She eats a set amount of regular dog food and then gets an injection of insulin immediately afterwards. She eats every 12 hours, currently at 7 AM and 7PM, but this can be tweaked a bit to suit your schedule. Her insulin and needles are purchased from the pharmacy at Wal-mart for $40 and neither requires a prescription. Daisy cooperates beautifully for her shots and she is a normal dog in every other way. \n\nDaisy is good with other dogs, both small and large, but she does need to be fed separately in her crate. She is great with children and she is very much a people-pleaser. For obvious reasons, Daisy absolutely loves riding in the car. She prefers to be your front seat passenger but will lay on the back seat if requested. Daisy is housebroken and crate-trained. She enjoys snuggling on your bed and sofa with you. Due to her past, Daisy has learned to be quite flexible. She really just goes with the flow. She\u2019s a simple, happy girl and she wants to make you happy, too. \n\nDaisy is fully vetted -- spayed, microchipped, heartworm negative, and current on vaccinations and deworming.Adoption fee is $250. You can see more photos and apply to adopt her by submitting an application at www.sohfga.com.",

She is able to run play and get around and is not in pain and no surgery is required.  Her ideal home would have limited stairs and would have a backyard.

She is able to run play and get around and is not in pain and no surgery is required.  Her ideal home would have limited stairs and would have a backyard. \n\nBecause of their bond, we are seeking someone to adopt both Mattie and Shelley together. \n\nPlease visit our website at www.anlcf.org to complete an online application.

Some were dumped, abandoned in an empty house, left tied to a tree, picked up by animal control as strays, or simply unwanted by their owners. We ask that only serious and committed adopters apply as these dogs have suffered enough.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet please apply to adopt at\nhttp://www.wagsandwhiskerspetrescue.com/adopt.html\nif the pet is still available for adoption and you are approved to adopt we will contact you.\n\nCalling and checking the status of your application will not increase your chances of adoption",

He does great with everyone, but he needs to learn that he trusts you first. Get your application in to meet this sweet boy!\n\nRocky is up to date on his vaccinations and is neutered.

Our veterinary partner estimates that Rocket is 3 years old at the time of intake in November 2020. Rocket is good with people of all ages and other dogs. Rocket was attacked by a pack of dogs, and with no one there to protect him, he was ripped apart. His right ear was ripped off, one side of his face was ripped to the bone and we believe he has a broken elbow. Rocket was brought to a kill shelter and scheduled for euthanasia. But it wasn't Rocket's turn to die, as we heard about him and immediately grabbed him up out of the shelter and brought him to our veterinary partner for lifesaving treatment. We would like to have Rocket's forever home waiting for him when he is ready to take off, so if you have space in your heart to give Rocket the love he deserves and you can keep him safe forever, please apply online to adopt Rocket (TX) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

She is a 9 year old Pit bull that recently found her way back to Paws and Prayers due to no fault of her own, sadly her mom was going somewhere that Diamond could not tag along. Diamond prefers to be the only pet in the home, but they have said shes done well with some more submissive dogs. Diamond is a little shy when you first meet her but after a little bit of time she warms up. Diamond has some joint pain in her back legs which is normal with age and shes currently taking an OTC hip/joint supplement to help with this. Diamond is house broken, and does well in a crate. Diamonds adoption fee is $150 she is fixed, up to date on vaccines, microchipped and current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention.",
