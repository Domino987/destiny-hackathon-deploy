            "description": "Winona mom (Willa) came to our shelter VERY pregnant and delivered six puppies just days after arriving to her foster home.  The babies struggled a lot in their first three months of life- horrible coccidia, major worm infestations, and a case of parvo that nearly took their lives.  Thanks to an amazing team of volunteers who worked around the clock (and a team of veterinary professionals too), all six puppies (and mom) survived. \n\nWinona  is a pretty girl looking for a forever family. She is 15 weeks old and weighs 20+ pounds.  She is expected to be about 70-80 lbs at adult weight. Her mom is a Rottie/Hound Mix (see photo- Willa) and we don't know a thing about dad.  Based on her size and shape of her head, we're guessing he was a Mastiff or Great Dane mix.\n\nWinona is spayed; vaccinated for rabies, distemper, and bordetella; and microchipped with a lifetime registration. She is current on flea/tick and prevention too.\n\nInterested in meeting Winona? Please visit our website www.HalfwayHomeRescue.org and complete an adoption application. Adoption donation $550.\n\nWe anticipate a LOT of applications for these puppies.  At this time, we are ONLY accepting applications from CT residents.  Applicants must own their homes and be able to provide proof of ownership.  Applications that do not meet the criteria, will not be considered.",

Thank you for your patience! We are working to find everyone a companion. \n\nDino is an adorable 9week old lab mix. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting the first step is to fill out an adoption application on our website aaanimalrescue.org. We are currently very busy! Please reach out to allaboardanimalrescue@gmail.com if you have an approved application on file! Please fill out an adoption application on our website if you are ready to adopt! \n\nThank you for your patience and understanding during this difficult time! We are on a mission to find everyone companions, we will continue to rescue dogs weekly! We update our page every Monday evening. We are not currently hosting any Petco adoption events for the public. We will be hosting meet/greet adoption appointments!\n\n\nBreed and size disclosure: As a rescue all of our dogs come to us from high-kill shelters or other rescues, so we do not get a lot of background or information on these dogs. We occasionally receive the mother with the puppies, but in most cases both parents are unknown. Because of this we do not know the full breeding of the dogs. We are required to list the dogs based on the breeds provided to us on their records, but they are all mixed breeds as far as we know, and we cannot guarantee the actual breeds of any of these dogs. Since the full breeding of the dogs is unknown we can also only give you an educated guess on the full-grown size of the dogs. All of the current information we have on the dogs is listed in their bio above. More information may be available at our adoption event, since a lot of the fosters turn in report cards on how the dog has done in their care when they drop them off. \n\nAdoption Process: If you are interested in adopting from us, the first step of our adoption process is to fill out an application online at http://aaanimalrescue.org/adoption_app.html. It takes us 24-48 hours to process your application and get back to you, via email. Applications turned in Friday afternoon or Saturday morning will not be processed since we are preparing for or at our adoption event. We do have applications on site at our events, but are not always able to approve them at that time and many of the dogs will already have holds on them, so we suggest you fill out an application prior to attending an adoption event. We can place a hold on one dog per approved applicant after a deposit fee has been received, please do not ask to hold a dog if you have not turned in an application and been approved, for the first hour of our adoption event, so that they can get the first chance to meet and hopefully adopt that dog. After the first hour of the event all dogs are available on a first come, first serve basis. If you already have an approved application on file, there will just be more paperwork and the adoption fee at the event, but you will be able to take home the dog/puppy that day. Since we are foster based and do not have a location, our dogs are only available to meet at our events, unless otherwise noted.",

We can place a hold on one dog per approved applicant after a deposit fee has been received, please do not ask to hold a dog if you have not turned in an application and been approved, for the first hour of our adoption event, so that they can get the first chance to meet and hopefully adopt that dog. After the first hour of the event all dogs are available on a first come, first serve basis. If you already have an approved application on file, there will just be more paperwork and the adoption fee at the event, but you will be able to take home the dog/puppy that day.

He came into rescue very emaciated and we are working closely with our vet to determine any underlying condition as the cause for this. Broc is curious about cats and currently working on house training. He will be fully vetted, vaccinated and microchipped prior to adoption.\n\nWe will require Broc to be in basic obedience training within 30 days of adoption. Basic obedience training is a great opportunity for Broc to bond with his new family, learn new commands and reinforce good manners.  \n\nFor more information about our adoption process and an application please visit www.whitekissesgreatdanerescue.com/adopt\n",

The babies struggled a lot in their first three months of life- horrible coccidia, major worm infestations, and a case of parvo that nearly took their lives.  Thanks to an amazing team of volunteers who worked around the clock (and a team of veterinary professionals too), all six puppies (and mom) survived. \n\nWynter is a pretty girl looking for a forever family. She is 15 weeks old and weighs 20+ pounds.  She is expected to be about 70-80 lbs at adult weight. Her mom is a Rottie/Hound Mix (see photo- Willa) and we don't know a thing about dad.  Based on her size and shape of her head, we're guessing he was a Mastiff or Great Dane mix.\n\nWynter is spayed; vaccinated for rabies, distemper, and bordetella; and microchipped with a lifetime registration. She is current on flea/tick and prevention too.\n\nInterested in meeting Wynter? Please visit our website www.HalfwayHomeRescue.org and complete an adoption application. Adoption donation $550.\n\nWe anticipate a LOT of applications for these puppies.  At this time, we are ONLY accepting applications from CT residents.  Applicants must own their homes and be able to provide proof of ownership.  Applications that do not meet the criteria, will not be considered.",

Coming in second smallest of the 3, she and her siblings were surrendered to a high kill animal control. It was a pretty scary place but they all came to Illinois in hopes of finding their forever homes. Though small she is an energetic puppy with lots of love to give. She loves to be held, playing with her siblings, (both canine and human) and her toys. She is learning all the basic puppy manners which consist of crate training, potty training. Due to her size we are asking no small children and she cannot be left home alone more then a few hours to continue her training and socialization. Are you Reign\u2019s forever home?.

Allow me to introduce my small puppy self to you and tell you a couple very special things about my exceptional personality and looks.\n\nClearly you can see I'm gorgeous. Shiny... black... I mean, what's not to like here?! I have nice floppy ears and pounce around the yard like a rabbit when I run.\n\nI'm a sweet little gal and need to find out a couple of things about you too.\n\n1. First, do you speak French? Actually it doesn't matter. I don't either.\n2. Are you capable of cooking gourmet meals? Oh, that doesn't matter either. I like puppy kibble fine.\n3. Do you like to get puppy kisses? This one matters... because I always need to give them.\n\nI guess that's about it for now. If I'm too beautiful and wonderful for you to consider, take a gander at my sister Mahalo and my dumb little brother Shaka. They are quite inferior to me, but if you must... take a look at them.\n\nAloha is a Female Lab mix (we think) that was born around 11/22/2020 and is a great little pupper.",

She is good around around kids and other dogs but has never been around cats. If you would like to meet her please call 419-294-4477 to make an adoption appointment. ***Our adoption process is done in two steps . Your first trip to the shelter will include visiting with the animal and if you choose to do an adoption, all the paperwork will be completed at this time and the adoption will be paid for. The second trip will be to pick the animal up once it is spayed or neutered, micro chipped etc and ready to go home. All of our animals are spayed/neutered BEFORE they leave the shelter.  Because of our strict return policy if an adopter cannot keep an adopted pet, adoptions to homes more than 100 miles away will be considered on a case by case basis.",

She currently weighs in an estimated 70 lbs, but I expect she\u2019ll fill out and possibly grow a little more. Her primary breed is Great Pyrenees; possibly with Golden Retriever. She is spayed.\n\nSadie is one the sweetest, cuddliest dogs I\u2019ve ever been around. If a potential owner is looking for a giant blonde fluffy shadow, this is the dog for them. Potential owners must be aware that she\u2019s a hand nudger! If you have a empty or available hand, she will immediately be shoving her nose into it searching for pets! Like most giant breeds, she plays hard and runs in spurts but will happily sleep and laze around the house for hours on end. Sadie loves being around her people and pack, so she doesn\u2019t necessarily like her kennel. She\u2019s learning and with time and patience has started to adjust wonderfully. She\u2019s pretty sedate for a dog so young. One of her favorite things is to take the squeaky ball out of the toy and then just play with the toy. Overall, she\u2019s a very gentle, sweet, loving girl; who will thrive with the right family. Just be prepared for all her hair!!\n\nSadie has not been around children but we would assume so she would be good; she\u2019s been wonderful around all adult people she\u2019s met. She gets along with other dogs; not sure about cats since she\u2019s never met one. She DOES NOT get along with chickens (or any birds really). \n\nShe is house trained and will \u201calert\u201d at the door when she needs to go outside. While she has had a few accidents in a kennel over the past 2 weeks, mostly she is kennel trained. Her main issue is learning to self sooth and relax in her kennel. She does know simple commands of sit, down, stay, and come but she is still a puppy and gets herself distracted. She has been caught counter-surfing a handle of times, but responds to a firm No (I think she knows she\u2019s not supposed to). She\u2019s up to date on shots and heart worm negative but will need her next pill shortly. As an extra note, she\u2019s been eating Royal Canin Giant Breed adult formula.\n\nThis dog is a Benefactor Dog. His/her increased adoption fee will allow them to act as a benefactor to other dogs in our care that require special medical care and a better chance at adoption.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (that application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\n The adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information.\n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale:\nBenefactor Puppies under 12 months - $500\nBenefactor Dogs over 12 months - $400\n\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

I have never lived with children and because I am a bit shy at first all children in the home should be at least 10 years of age. I am eager and excited to learn new things. My adoption includes a 4 week puppy training class at the Zoom Room. My friends here at the VBSPCA want to set everyone up for success. If you have the time, patience, consistency and love for a guy like me, please ask to see me. I am right over here, ask for Rocky.",

Because of the circumstances he came from ,he will need a patient family. He would very much love to be a loved member of a family. Blue is sweet but he has most likely lived outside all his young life. Good news is he is still a puppy and can only blossom in the right home. Blue's adoption also comes with 4 weeks of puppy training with our friends at the zoom room. Because Blue is shy at first and we have no knowledge of him living with children previously, all children in the home must be 10 years and over. If you are interested in giving this pup a happily ever after, please ask to meet Blue today.",

            "description": "*PLEASE NOTE: ADOPTERS INTERESTED IN MRS. JONES MUST HAVE ANOTHER DOG*\n\nMrs. Jones is a 2.5 year old spayed female Carolina Dog mix who weighs about 50 lbs. Mrs. Jones was rescued from an overcrowded shelter after being found as a stray. To say the shelter was a scary place for this girl is an understatement. All she wanted to do is run away. We cannot wait until she feels safe enough and realizes she doesn't have to flee. Once she gets to know you, Mrs. Jones is very sweet and gentle. She seems to prefer women over men, and doesn't feel comfortable with kids. She absolutely loves other dogs, and would love a confident canine sibling to help show her what a dog's life should be. She will need a patient family willing to give her time to settle in and realize she is out of harms way. A quieter home would be best for her as she is easily scared of loud noises. Mrs. Jones is so deserving of a dedicated forever family to call her very own. Please help us find Mrs. Jones the forever home she's been searching for!\n\nInterested in adopting? Take the first step and complete an adoption application on our website: https://www.all4pawsrescue.com/\nWe are a foster based organization, so we do not have a facility to visit. Please read our FAQs to learn more: https://www.all4pawsrescue.com/faq\nFollow us on Facebook for foster updates and a full list of our adoptable pets: https://www.facebook.com/all4pawsrescue/",

He loves to play with toys and will bring them back to you. He will destroy the toys to get to the squeaker, but is not destructive in the house.  \n\nHe\u2019s not a barker and we are working on his house training.  He was found running the streets of Tijuana with 2 other dogs. Unfortunately while he was living on the streets he was hit by a car and one of his legs was broken.  It is completely healed and he just needs more exercise to continue to strengthen his leg. He walks on it but sometimes he doesn\u2019t. \n\nOdie is fine around other dogs but has a very dominant personality so we prefer he be the only dog in the household.  He does not like to share his attention and may snap at another dog. He\u2019s great around cats, the foster has one and says he ignores the cat. He is ready to find his forever home. \n\nOdie is neutered, up-to-date on vaccines and microchipped.  If you are interested in him, please complete the on-line application that can be found on our website: www.adoptmerescue.org or contact us for more information.\n\nLocal area adoption only.",

            "description": "Gunner (responds to Axl) is approximately 2.5 years old, 10 lbs. He has so much personality and and a very impressive vertical leap for such a tiny guy!! He absolutely loves snuggling and loving on his humans, as well as barking at kids outside. He has a major little man complex and always wants to be the alpha dog. He does not get along well with other dominant dogs therefore he should probably be the only dog in the home. He cries a bit when his humans leave the house which may not be ideal for apartments or condos with shared walls. This guy really knows how to lay the cuteness on thick, and will make a great companion for some lucky person.... is it you?!\nAll SAAP animals are vet checked, UTD on vaccines, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, and given flea and heartworm preventative as age appropriate.\n\nOur website is: http://www.adoptastray.com/\n\nTo check if this animal is still available visit our master pet list on our website at:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/adoptable-animals/\n\nHave questions:\nPlease email us at saap@adoptastray.com for more information about this animal or to answer any questions you may have.

Once he trusts you, he is playful and friendly. He is friendly with other dogs but has that doxie \"little man\" personality. He has a grade 4 heart murmur and is on Vetmedin, he has no symptoms but needs this pills twice a day. It costs around $45 a month.\n\nIf you serious about adopting, the first step is to fill out an adoption application on our website: https://www.smalldogrescuene.org/",

My mom died and her family couldn\u2019t keep me and four of her dogs, so I\u2019m grateful New Hope took us so we didn\u2019t have to go to the shelter.\n\nMy foster describes me as a \u201cstereotypical miniature poodle\u201d in that I\u2019m all about my humans and that\u2019s about it! I\u2019m an amazing lapdog and white I get along peacefully with other dogs, I\u2019m probably not going to be a playmate for other pups in your house. I like to have the human attention on me!\n\nI can be somewhat vocal (I whine) when I want attention and foster dad is working on my potty training and says I\u2019m making huge progress.  Foster dad crates me when he leaves the house and at night.  I\u2019m not a huge fan of the crate since I want to be close to you but I tolerate it.   \n\nI don\u2019t seem top lay with toys and I\u2019m medium energy and highly food and treat motivated.   My my leash training is in progress and I\u2019m currently enjoying short walks and stick close to my foster dad when I\u2019m in the yard.  \n\nIf you are excited about meeting me, please fill out an adoption application right away as it's the first step! \n\nhttps://nhanimalrescue.org/adoption-information/",

            "description": "Katie Sparkles is a 46 pound, beautiful 9 month old yellow lab mix.  She is sweet and loving.   She enjoys playing chase in the yard and chasing squirrels.   She LOVES kids.   She acts shy at first, but warms up quickly.   She will make the perfect family dog and deserves her very own furever family.    \n\nAll our adoption fees include spay/neuter, micro-chip, up-to-date vaccinations, including rabies thru date of adoption. This pup tested heartworm negative, and is on regular monthly heartworm prevention & on flea/tick prevention. \n\nIn order to be considered for one of our beautiful pups, please go to our website and complete and application: https://www.mustluvdogs.org/adoptable-pets.\nPlease note that we are a DUE DILIGENCE adoption organization. Part of our approval process requires, among other things:\n* Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered.\n*The majority, but not all, of our pets require a fenced yard or secure enclosure.  In the case of apartments, we require Landlord approval and designated dog area in complex.\n*Verifiable good veterinary history INCLUDING regular vaccination/visits and good Heartworm Prevention history is a MUST!\n*Adopter must be able to have time to spend with the pup and be able to provide the pup a safe environment to live.\n*ALL our dogs are expected to be primarily INSIDE dogs.  They MUST sleep inside the home.  We truly understand that some folks have working dogs (i.e. farmers, ranchers,etc); however, the majority of our dogs have had a rough life prior to coming to us & we want to make sure that they are showered with LUV & maybe even a bit spoiled for the rest of their lives. \n\nOther facts are also considered, including whether children or other pets are a good fit with the dog. \n\nMust Luv Dogs reserves the right to deny any applications that we don't think are a good fit with the pup. Our first & foremost concern is the dog's best interest. It is our MISSION to place them in a home that is a great fit for their needs for a lifetime of luv & being part of a family.\n*We will consider adoptions in any area; however, will do not ship or transport puppies under the age of 12 mos. We will ONLY transport an adult dog on a transport approved by MLD, at adopter's expense.\n* In order to be affordable and afford every family an opportunity to have a pup of their own, we keep our Adoption Fees low; however, please keep in mind that the fees we charge do not cover all costs for the pup.  Any additional donations are greatly appreciated!\n\nPlease note that all of our pets are in private foster homes. In order to reduce any stress or confusion for our pups, we require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meet & greet for any of our pups.  Alternatively, you are always welcome to come meet any of our pups at one of our regular Adoption Events.   Our events are always posted on PetFinder OR on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/mustLUVdogs.org.\n\nFinally, THANK YOU for considering Must Luv Dogs for your next pet. \n\n*Most dogs require a fenced area in yard. \n*Apartments okay IF nearby dog park or walking trails (with landlord appoval).\n*ALL dogs must be INSIDE dogs and treated a part of family. \n*We are a DUE DILIGENCE Adoption Rescue.  \n*Must have good Vet history & Heartworm prevention is a MUST!\n*ALL dogs are fully vetted, spay/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption.\n\nFYI:   Even though this pup tested heartworm negative, we provide the following procedural information for your information:  Any of our pups who test HW+ are treated with the *slow kill method of treatment.   The *slow-kill method, simply stated, is a 30 day regiment of  doxycycline followed by a monthly dose of Advantage Multi for 12 months, then retesting.   Most dogs test negative after one year of following this treatment; however, we always recommend that potential adopters consult & follow the advice of their family veterinarian upon adopting any of our hw+ pups.   Although the fast-kill method is still considered the \"gold-standard\" by the AVA, and may be preferred by some vets; the slow-kill method has proven to be effective in our rescue. The main reason we utilize this method is due to our limited financial constraints and the high number of our rescue pups that are infected.   In the cases of severe infection and if the pup is highly symptomatic, we sometimes use the fast-kill approach instead.   Again, we recommend for you to consult with your veterinarian after the adoption is complete and follow their recommendations.",

They are now old enough to be weaned so now we can focus on finding her the home she deserves! We estimate her to be around 2-3 yrs old and is currently 44#.\n\nShe is a HUGE sweetheart, very calm but still very shy. She will really benefit from an owner that will help her through exposure to different things and socialization in public to help build her confidence. She is very weary of new people, but if you go slowly she takes no time at all to warm up and wants all the love that you can give.\n\nWe are working on crate training and house breaking, and she's doing very well! She has ignored the cat and other dogs in the house.\n\nYoung children will not be a good fit for her at this time as she is still very skittish and loud, fast movements will most likely frighten her.\n\nDo you have the patience and kindness to help this girl blossom?\n\nShe will be up to date on all vaccinations, microchipped and spayed at the time of her adoption (her spay will be in a couple weeks as she just weaned her puppies). She has been heartworm tested (negative) and on prevention. The adoption fee is $250.00 If you are interested in adopting Zima please fill out an application.\n\nhttp://www.ajssearchandrescue.org/adoption-application",

They were taken to the vet immediately and given their vaccinations and were treated for their mange. \n\nThe mange is not contagious and Elena is finished with her mange treatment from the vet. \n\nElena looks to be a boxer mix, she is around 4 months old, and very friendly with all dogs and humans!! Elena is a very pretty pup! She is playful, sweet, friendly and would want nothing more than to snuggle in your lap!! She wants affection and attention that we are not able to give. \n\nPlease consider Elena when looking for a companion and family member!!",

He loves to be picked up and held and will give you a lot of kisses when he gets to know you.  He has tons of energy and loves to play.  His favorite toys are ones that make noises because he talks back to them!  \n\nMacaroni needs an experienced dog owner that will help work with him on his training. He is still working on his potty-training.  He has a big personality and can occasionally be nippy, so a home without small children would be best.  He has a silly stubborn side to him and doesn't always liked to be scolded, so he will need someone who is comfortable working with him.  He is ready to love and bond with the kind person who will be patient with him and train him to be the best he can be.  \n\nThe NAWS Dog Adoption Program operates as a rescue versus a shelter.  We believe in matching the right dog with the appropriate family based on each specific dog or family's needs.  To achieve this, we believe in spending the appropriate amount of time with each family to allow for enough interaction time with potential adopters.  This cannot be achieved if people stop by unexpectedly to meet our dogs.  Please e-mail Stacy at stacy@nawsus.org to setup a day or time to meet with one of our adoption counselors and our potential adoptees.  Thank you!\n\n",

Loves to sit in your lap but also enjoys playing with other dogs. I think she could be happy in a household with multiple dogs or as a single dog if her family was home most of the time. She loves to ride and is quite portable with her size. \nMia came from a kennel but was never used for breeding. It will take a little work to get her housebroken but shouldn\u2019t be too bad. She is used to going outside to potty and doesn\u2019t mind staying in a crate. If she goes out every 3 to 4 hrs she is great in a crate. \nMia would love to have someone that is home most of the time or can take her with them. She thinks she is a frenchie and is quite the talker. \nShe is spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, Heartworm tested negative and current on HW meds. If you are interested in adding Mia to your family plz contact Ginger for an adoption application.  Her adoption fee is $600. Located in Central MO.",

            "description": "For my Petfinder.com friends, please contact the Shelter at (248) 858-1070 for more information. My ID number is 337312\n\nMeet Akasha! Gorgeous Akasha is looking to find, just the right person to move in with! After two years in her home, Akasha had to come to the Shelter. Seems she has not much training, and her former people chose not to peruse that avenue! Akasha is a sweet, young, girl who is bursting with potential. She is a smart lady who knows basic commands, and is quite eager to learn. Akasha enjoys being brushed, really likes to play and especially is fond of going for walks. This deserving girl, is patiently waiting for a fantastic, energetic new owner, to swoop her up! Akasha will thrive in a home with older children.\n\nThe above behaviors and personality traits have been observed while at the Shelter. If this animal was relinquished, information is gathered from the owner regarding behavior. Our wonderful volunteers spend time with these animals and give input on behaviors and traits. However, this description may not be all inclusive to how this animal will act in a loving forever home. Introduction to established family pets should be slow and monitored always. The same goes for children and other family members. Adopting a pet is a big decision and should be thoughtful. We suggest researching different breeds to match traits and personalities to your lifestyle. When adopting a pet, please know that this pet will be with you for their lifetime; patience and consistency will make for a successful adoption.\n\nConfident, courageous and smart are just some of the adjectives to describe the Shepherd. There is a reason that police departments use these beautiful dogs to work alongside of policemen and policewomen; loyalty, the ability to learn commands and willingness to put their lives on the line in defense of their family. They were originally bred to herd livestock; so, this breed will need exercise and not just physical but mental as well. \n\n**SELECTIVE ADOPTION ONLY** Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: Tan Weight: 59.6lbs Age: 2yrs 0mths 1wks Animal has been Spayed",

            "description": "-Ben is a 9 year old Pitty Mix. He is current on his vaccines, neutered, house trained, crate trained, microchipped, and adorable.\n     -He is extremely friendly to any human he has ever met including kids and toddlers. Sadly, he is not good with other animals because of abuse before I got him. However, I have found it very easy to keep him away from other dogs on walks. Ben enjoys playing fetch and hardcore tug of war. As he is older though, it seems that his favorite activity is to curl up next to me while I am working. The best way to describe Ben is \"attached at the hip\"; he is just happiest when he is with humans and interacting. \n     -In order to calm some of his anxiety, Ben is on prozac which costs approx $8/month and can be picked up at any pharmacy. His prescription is half used and will be good for another 3 months before his vet can issue a new one. \n     -Ben is highly trained and knows a wide variety of commands. Although he is house trained, I would recommend crating him if you leave the house as he is most distraught when alone and tends to have a hard time not peeing on something. However, he is fine unattended as long as he knows you are in the house with him.\n     -I am rehoming Ben because I am getting married and my fiance and I aren't able to afford a house where our pets can be separated safely and her cat is much older than Ben and not likely to survive the trauma of being rehomed. \n\nBen is a courtesy post and not a Hello Pitty Rescue. Please reach out directly to \nKyle Scribner at kylescribbles@gmail.com\n",

            "description": "Boots is a beautiful 1 year old Shepard Mix. She adores her foster mom and playing with her foster fur brother. Boots loves being pet, affection, and to have her ears scratched. She isn't fond of her crate, but will go in without too much fuss if necessary. She barks for a few minutes when she first goes in her crate, but otherwise she is an extremely quiet dog. She doesn't bark when the door bell rings or when she hears the neighbor dogs bark. Boots shows no interest in chewing or destruction and will mostly likely be able to be trusted crate free in the home after she settles in. She is potty trained and has no accidents in her foster home. She will quickly pick up which door to stand by to alert you she needs to go out. She is a gentle giant who thinks she is a small lap dog and is happy to just be around her people on the couch watching a movie or as a work from home assistant in your home office. She is eager to please, intelligent, loyal, and loves treats so training her should be a breeze. She's an easy going dog who would love the opportunity to go to doggy school for a beginner obedience class to learn some basics (stay, leave it, go to a bed) and help her build confidence. She has never had to opportunity to learn leash manners but loves walks and has responded well to her first leash training sessions with her foster mom. Her new family should continue basic leash training with her. She doesn't show any interest in cats. Because of her size and her slight shyness with sudden movement she would do best in a home with children 10+. Boots is a social dog and will do best with another dog in the home if she has to be away from you most of the day. She would love a family who will take her on walks, jogs, or hikes. She loves to run around the backyard, but after her energy is out she is a zen lapdog. She enjoys having a fenced yard to run around, but will do okay without one if she gets walks each day. Boots is the type of dog you can take anywhere...the beach, dog park, camping...she's up for anything as long as she can be with her family. She's a great car passenger, she sits in the backseat and enjoys the ride. What she wants most in the world is to be a loyal companion in a family.\n\nBoots was rescued from Oklahoma and is a 1 yr female Shepherd mix weighing approx. 50 lbs. Boots is dog and cat friendly.\n\nIf you would like to meet Boots please complete an online application that can be found at: http://hopeanimalrescueofiowa.org/forms/196/dog-application\n\nAdoption fee is $250 which includes spay/neuter, age-appropriate vaccines/tests, and microchip.",

            "description": "Maple is a 3-4 year old sheltie/collie mix who is sweet as can be! She is a huuuge cuddler and loves to be around their human at all times. She is completely house/potty/crate trained. Some things she may need to work on is leash training and basic commands, but with some treats I'm sure she can pick it up in no time! She's not huge into toys but definitely loves her bones which helps burn her energy.\n\nMaple recently had one of her babies surrendered to Hope. The family that had her told us they got her when a farmer was going to shoot her for eating his chickens. We believe Maple to be between 4-5 years old and weighs approx. 55 lbs.\n\nIf you would like to meet Maple please complete an online application that can be found at: http://hopeanimalrescueofiowa.org/forms/196/dog-application\n\nAdoption fee is $250 which includes spay/neuter, age-appropriate vaccines/tests, and microchip.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Hello! My name is Melania. I am looking for a lap to call my own, a wardrobe of XS sweaters and dresses, and maybe a doggy purse so I can go everywhere with you! My owner died and I came to rescue without a name. So my foster mommy gave me a big beautiful name - Melania. You could call me Mellie, Lani, or rename me if you like. I just want a calm and patient home where I can learn to trust this big, new world. Small noises do not bother me as much as loud, motor sounds. I used to have babies, but now I look forward to being one. I'm house trained, sleep and nap in my crate, get along with other dogs, use stairs, and so far, my bark is only for alerting, not annoying. The main sounds I make are little squeeks and grunts when I am snuggling close. I smile when I am sleeping. And I'm loving my homemade dog food!! Yummy!! My legs are only four inches long so I like short walks. I weigh five pounds. When I zoom across the yard, my foster mommy laughs as it takes me awhile to get from here to there. But I think I'm running really fast! I like having a yard for my safety as I am pint sized. I am being foster near Pinehurst, North Carolina. I'm spayed now, up-to-date on shots, and micro-chipped. If you love tiny Chihuahuas, then please submit an application for me. 2/2/21 9:46 AM",

He is a 16-month-old, 77 pound goofball of a puppy with energy to spare. If you love the protective nature of a German Shepherd, you'll appreciate Axel. He has a big bark and is an excellent watchdog - he will let you know with anything is out of the ordinary on your property. He's looking for someone who will appreciate him just as is he, but he is definitely receptive to training and loves food and play as rewards. The best environment for Axel would be a calm, adult-only home with a securely fenced yard and another similar size and energy-level dog friend. He would also be fine by himself, as long as he got plenty of attention from his family. Axel is very energetic, he loves to run zoomies around the house and yard and loves toys, chew bones, chasing squirrels and playing fetch. He is generally friendly but can be wary of strangers especially behind a fence or barrier. Axel is not aggressive to cats but definitely thinks they are fun to play chase if they run. Axel is house trained and crate trained. He thrives with a routine and lots of exercise. He has recovered from a skin condition (but may have some ongoing allergies) and knee surgery and is now healthy and ready for a family of his own. If you think this big silly boy would be a match for your family, please apply today.\n\nInterested in adopting? Take the first step and complete an adoption application on our website: http://aarf-tn.com/adopt/adoption-apps/\n\nIf you have questions that are not covered in the profile, visit the Pet Inquiry Form: http://aarf-tn.com/contact/pet-inquiry-form/.\n\nTHIS PET IS FOSTERED IN TENNESSEE! We do list and adopt our pets nationwide. Typical transport cost to the Northeast is $160. Due to interstate adoption regulations, we are not able to adopt to RI and MA state residents.\n\nA.A.R.F. (All About Rescue and Fixin' Inc.) http://aarf-tn.com/ is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) no kill animal rescue organization located in the Upper Cumberland area of Tennessee. A.A.R.F. is comprised of unpaid volunteers and survives only on public donations. Thank you for thinking adoption first!\n\nPrior to adoption, all canines and felines are spayed or neutered, have received their age appropriate vaccinations, have been de-wormed for common parasites, and have received treatment for prevention of fleas and ticks. All canines over the age of 6 months have been tested for heartworm. All canines are put on heartworm prevention as soon as possible - this means dogs as soon as they are tested negative. Puppies are put on prevention immediately. All felines, regardless of age, have been tested for Feline Leukemia/FIV. Each animal receives a health check by a licensed veterinarian prior to adoption. Anything else found will be treated by our organization prior to adoption.",

The biggest of his litter. He and his siblings were surrendered to a high kill animal control. It was a pretty scary place but they all came to Illinois in hopes of finding their forever homes. Though small he is an energetic puppy with lots of love to give. He loves to be held, playing with his siblings, (both canine and human) and his toys. He is learning all the basic puppy manners which consist of crate training, potty training. Due to his size we are asking no small children and he cannot be left home alone more then a few hours to continue his training and socialization. Are you Ryder\u2019s forever home?. If interested please fill out an application on our website www.foreverhomedogrescueil.org\n\n\nWE DO NOT DO OUT OF STATE ADOPTIONS\nThank you for considering the adoption of one of our rescue dogs.  We are committed to finding our rescues the perfect home. Together we can make a difference in the life of a dog.\n \nThe adoption process should be a fun and exciting time for families and dogs. Our goal is to place our babies in forever homes.  The potential adopter needs to be dedicated to their care and training for life. \nUnderstand that sharing your life with a dog can be a commitment of 15+ years. This would include feeding, exercise, training, vetting, and providing a loving home. Ask yourself, \"Am I ready for this type of commitment?\"  If you are ready, we are here to help.  We do have some requirements to help us find the perfect placement of our babies. \n\nWE ARE A FOSTER BASED RESCUE ONLY. WE DO NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL BUILDING\n1.  Apply online at https://www.foreverhomedogrescueil.org\nWe must have an application, conduct a phone interview, and meet your entire family (including other dogs) to approve an adoption. Only a final approval for adoption can take place after a successful meet and greet. This is done by appointments only. We will not proceed with the adoption if everyone has not met the dog.  This will allow others the opportunity to adopt the dog.\n2.  Adopters MUST be 21 years old.\nInformation on all adults/members living in the home is required\nWe REQUIRE you to provide proof and vet reference that all current and past pets have been kept up to date on all routine medical.\n3.  Illinois law requires that all of our dogs and puppies be spayed/neutered within 30 days of adoption. In order to fully comply with this regulation and reduce the number of homeless dogs and puppies, \n4.  If you do not own your home, you must provide landlord contact information on the application and a copy of your lease that outlines the rules for dog ownership in your residence.  \nLarge breed dogs will not be adopted into apartment settings or where there are breed/ size restrictions.\nPuppies have special needs and require a home where someone is available to care for, socialize, and give basic training.  If you are gone for more than a couple hours at a time, please consider adopting a teen or older dog.\n5.  Adoption fees are $350. We accept checks or cash. (Prices are subject to change without notice).\n6.  All dogs and puppies adopted through Forever Home are fully vetted with age appropriate vaccines.

We are committed to finding our rescues the perfect home. Together we can make a difference in the life of a dog.\n \nThe adoption process should be a fun and exciting time for families and dogs. Our goal is to place our babies in forever homes.  The potential adopter needs to be dedicated to their care and training for life. \nUnderstand that sharing your life with a dog can be a commitment of 15+ years. This would include feeding, exercise, training, vetting, and providing a loving home. Ask yourself, \"Am I ready for this type of commitment?\"  If you are ready, we are here to help.  We do have some requirements to help us find the perfect placement of our babies. \n\nWE ARE A FOSTER BASED RESCUE ONLY. WE DO NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL BUILDING\n1.  Apply online at https://www.foreverhomedogrescueil.org\nWe must have an application, conduct a phone interview, and meet your entire family (including other dogs) to approve an adoption. Only a final approval for adoption can take place after a successful meet and greet. This is done by appointments only. We will not proceed with the adoption if everyone has not met the dog.  This will allow others the opportunity to adopt the dog.\n2.  Adopters MUST be 21 years old.\nInformation on all adults/members living in the home is required\nWe REQUIRE you to provide proof and vet reference that all current and past pets have been kept up to date on all routine medical.\n3.  Illinois law requires that all of our dogs and puppies be spayed/neutered within 30 days of adoption. In order to fully comply with this regulation and reduce the number of homeless dogs and puppies, \n4.  If you do not own your home, you must provide landlord contact information on the application and a copy of your lease that outlines the rules for dog ownership in your residence.  \nLarge breed dogs will not be adopted into apartment settings or where there are breed/ size restrictions.\nPuppies have special needs and require a home where someone is available to care for, socialize, and give basic training.  If you are gone for more than a couple hours at a time, please consider adopting a teen or older dog.\n5.  Adoption fees are $350. We accept checks or cash. (Prices are subject to change without notice).\n6.  All dogs and puppies adopted through Forever Home are fully vetted with age appropriate vaccines.

When she first came to us she wouldn't eat, wouldn't move and would shy away from affection. We quickly found her a foster in hopes this would help her feel more comfortable. Annika has a very supportive, understanding and calm foster sibling (a Ridgeback) and she has been able to help Annika come out of her shell. \nNOW, Annika is playful, funny, goofy, sweet and loves to explore! She even has visited her foster homes vacation place up north. She enjoys sun bathing, playing with her foster sibling, sitting for treats and going for walks. \nWe think Annika is about 4 years old, she is spayed, chipped, and vaccinated. If you are interested in meeting Annika, we request you visit our website www.azhartt.org and fill out her application and we will connect you and her foster family to arrange a meet and greet.",

Chopin is an 8 month old mixed breed boy, he is currently about 43lbs and still has some filling out to do. He was originally transferred to our shelter from Louisiana as part of the hurricane disaster relief, so we do not know much about his past. In his time here, we have learned that he LOVES to play and he has a LOT of personality. Chopin has been a very sweet boy, and would love a family who has time to play with him and provide exercise and mental stimulation! Since he was transferred in from a different shelter, we aren't sure how he is with children or other animals, so if there are any children in the home or other dogs we will need to do a meet and greet to make sure everyone gets along before adoption; just to be safe! We don't know where he is on his potty-training, and he might need some time to learn in a new home. Chopin is neutered, current on his vaccinations, heartworm negative, and microchipped. Come meet this cutie patootie at the Waggin' Tails Adoption Center in Benbrook, open every day from 12-6 pm by appointment!\n\n*Please give us a call at 817-249-3647 to schedule an appointment with us!",

Anxious to be held and give you kisses, Bella's going to be an easy girl to spoil. A bit shy in the presence of strangers, she was a little nervous (and cold) for her pictures. We tried toys, treats, whistling, all manner of distractions to get her cute ears to perk up, but to no avail. Bella is a darling and also a bit of a diva. She's treat finicky, but we've found one she favors: Vienna sausages with or without Ready-Whip! Bella's adoption fee is $175 and helps cover the cost of her spay, vaccinations, worming, monthly heart worm, flea and tick preventive, microchip and care while at CCHS. She is heart worm positive and will need treatment.\n\nIf you're interested in sponsoring a portion of Bella's heart worm treatment, you may do so by clicking on the donate button on our FB page or website and thank you!",

I'm a fairly calm dog but I have my silly moments too! I'm very curious about other dogs but I haven't really been around any since I've been with my foster family. Who, by the way, are amazing and I love them! They are committed to finding me a forever home, so if you'd like to meet me or learn more about me, please call them at 760-620-4950 or 831-254-0231. \n\nMy adoption fee will be $125 and includes my spay, microchip, and vaccines up to date!",

The smallest of his litter. He and his siblings were surrendered to a high kill animal control. It was a pretty scary place but they all came to Illinois in hopes of finding their forever homes. Though small, he is an energetic puppy with lots of love to give. He loves to be held, playing with his siblings, (both canine and human) and his toys. He is learning all the basic puppy manners which consist of crate training, potty training. Due to his size we are asking no small children and he cannot be left home alone more then a few hours to continue his training and socialization. Are you Rambo\u2019s forever home. If interested please fill out an application on our website www.foreverhomedogrescueil.org\n\nWE DO NOT DO OUT OF STATE ADOPTIONS\nThank you for considering the adoption of one of our rescue dogs.  We are committed to finding our rescues the perfect home. Together we can make a difference in the life of a dog.\n \nThe adoption process should be a fun and exciting time for families and dogs. Our goal is to place our babies in forever homes.  The potential adopter needs to be dedicated to their care and training for life. \nUnderstand that sharing your life with a dog can be a commitment of 15+ years. This would include feeding, exercise, training, vetting, and providing a loving home. Ask yourself, \"Am I ready for this type of commitment?\"  If you are ready, we are here to help.  We do have some requirements to help us find the perfect placement of our babies. \n\nWE ARE A FOSTER BASED RESCUE ONLY. WE DO NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL BUILDING\n1.  Apply online at https://www.foreverhomedogrescueil.org\nWe must have an application, conduct a phone interview, and meet your entire family (including other dogs) to approve an adoption. Only a final approval for adoption can take place after a successful meet and greet. This is done by appointments only. We will not proceed with the adoption if everyone has not met the dog.  This will allow others the opportunity to adopt the dog.\n2.  Adopters MUST be 21 years old.\nInformation on all adults/members living in the home is required\nWe REQUIRE you to provide proof and vet reference that all current and past pets have been kept up to date on all routine medical.\n3.  Illinois law requires that all of our dogs and puppies be spayed/neutered within 30 days of adoption. In order to fully comply with this regulation and reduce the number of homeless dogs and puppies, \n4.  If you do not own your home, you must provide landlord contact information on the application and a copy of your lease that outlines the rules for dog ownership in your residence.  \nLarge breed dogs will not be adopted into apartment settings or where there are breed/ size restrictions.\nPuppies have special needs and require a home where someone is available to care for, socialize, and give basic training.  If you are gone for more than a couple hours at a time, please consider adopting a teen or older dog.\n5.  Adoption fees are $350. We accept checks or cash. (Prices are subject to change without notice).\n6.  All dogs and puppies adopted through Forever Home are fully vetted with age appropriate vaccines. Keep in mind once you take possession of your newly adopted dog, any and all future medical costs or care is YOUR responsibility.\n7. First time puppy/dog adopters will be required to sign up for and pay in advance a basic training class. A deposit of an extra 50.00 will be required until a class has been completed, it will then be returned. \n8.

            "description": "Attention please! most of your Questions about the dog and the adoption process are answered here.\n\nImportant information about Tuck:\n\nAge: 4 months\n\nCurrent size: small\n\nCurrent weight: 12.8 Ibs\n\nSex: Male\n\nBreed: lab mix\n\nColor : Black and white\n\nAnticipated size : Medium\n\nSterilization: Neutered\n\nMicrochipped: yes\n\nVaccines received : Rabies, Bordetella, Parvo, distemper, adenovirus i, adenovirus ii, and parainfluenza.\n\nStory & background:\n\nTuck is a rescue from San Bernardino. He was found roaming with his brother (will be posted for adoption soon) on a dirt road. There was a great rally for dirt bikers on that road at the time the puppies were found. Our volunteers were concerned about the saftey of the puppies especially that they can be easily hit by dirt bikers. Therefore, the volunteers hurried to capture the puppies with some treats. This motivated the puppies to come closer to our volunteers. The puppies seemed very malnourished and dehydrated. At that point, our volunteer reached out to our corporate office to describe the situation. Immediately, our corporate office booked an appointment with a trusted veterinarian to help assess the health of the puppies. The veterinarian ended up prescribing them some vitamins and supplements to help compensate for the nutrients they lacked. The rescue then assigned the task of taking care of the puppies to one of our trusted fosters to help socialize them and help them gain weight through a healthy diet. The rescue has provided the puppies with all the required vaccines. They also all got Neutered. \n\nBehavioral wise, the puppies get along with larger and smaller breeds of dogs. We have not had them around cats. However, since they are still young puppies, we believe that they are trainable to work with cats. They also do great around people and children. They are also exceptionally smart and so cuddly.\n\nPetEmber Animal Rescue is a California 501 (C) (3) charitable non-profit organization that does not receive any governmental funding and relies only on the donations of the public to help provide urgent care for abandoned, neglected, and abused dogs and puppies. All donations are tax-deductible. Our rescue is in continuous improvement and we strive to cope with all the technologies of the era to help provide better services to our customers and better care for our rescued dogs. When adopting a dog from PetEmber, you receive a well-rounded healthy dog that is up to date on all vaccines since all proceeds are directed to provide a supreme veterinarian care, nutrition, and training for the dogs we have. These proceeds are also used to help care for other senior, disabled, or hard to adopt dogs due to behavioral issues. The adopter receives a complete health record for his/her adopted dog on site at the time of the adoption. Necessary paperwork such as the rabies certificate, Spay/neuter certificate, vaccination record, and a copy of the adoption agreement are all handed to the adopter at the time of the adoption. These documents help the adopters in the process of licensing the dog or registering the dog as an emotional support animal (ESA). All dogs posted for adoption are 100% ready for their forever homes.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting any of our adoptable dogs, we created an online adoption application that better works with Safari or google chrome browsers.\n\nLink to the adoption application :\n\nwww.petember.com/adoption-application\n\nPlease fill and submit your adoption application as soon as possible. We receive hundreds of applications for each dog. Submitting your application earlier and filling all the required fields will help prioritize your adoption application. We review all application but will not have enough assistance to help provide reply on each individual application. Therefore, if your adoption application is approved, you should hear from us within 24 hours after your application is submitted. Please be sure you are ready for immediate meet and greet. \n\nStay safe during this Pandemic.",

First, dogs just want to be happy and feel loved. Living inside and being a part of the family is really important to us. A lot of the things you need as humans to stay happy and healthy, us dogs need too. We depend on you for things like vet visits, nutritious food, clean water, social and play time with people and other pets, training classes, toys, and of course, lots of love and attention! Regular baths, nail trims and grooming help us to look and feel our best, while monthly flea and heartworm prevention help us to stay healthy. Did you know that depending on our size and breed, dogs can live up to 20 years? Just think of the wonderful life we could have together!",

This sweet face was picked up from wandering the streets. Unfortunately no one ever came to claim her as their family pup. Jenny is a doll. So sweet and well mannered. Jenny loves all people including kids. She knows basic commands and gets along well with other dogs. Jenny is a little assertive, sort of a \u201chall monitor\u201d when she plays.

She knows how to sit, lay down, and is house-trained! Cassie is a love bug and is affectionate with her people. We think she would be a wonderful fit for someone who likes to be active and would like a partner for outdoor adventures! Contact BRHS to set up a meet and greet with Cassie! \n\nMost of our dogs are currently in shelter - but some are in foster homes.  If you would like to see a specific dog, feel free to contact us to see if they are in shelter or in foster care!  Dogs in shelter are available to visit or adopt daily.  IF a dog is in a foster home, they come in on Saturdays from 11:00am to 4:00pm. Arrangements can be made to have specific dogs brought in during the week- just give us a call or email to see if the dog you are interested in is in a foster home and set up a meeting time if necessary.\n\nOur adoption fees include the following: all of our dogs/puppies are current on vaccinations (DHPP and Rabies if over 3 months of age) at the point of adoption, dewormed, heartworm tested and current on preventative, microchipped, treated for fleas/ticks and are spayed or neutered. Our large dog adoption fee is generally $150 + tax. Our small dog and puppy adoption fee is generally $250 + tax. Adoption fees may vary in special circumstances. Due to space limitations, we do not hold dogs.\n\nBecause we are on a busy street, we require that all dogs leaving the shelter be in a carrier or on leash. All pets remain up for adoption until an approved application is processed and their adoption fee paid. Adoptions will stop a half hour before we close, at 5:30pm M-F and 3:30pm Saturday.",

Unfortunately, She was surrendered to the shelter because she didn't mesh well with the current doggos in the home, so with that being said Pepper would need to be the only furchild in the home. This girl is one of the sweetest and smartest little ladies you'll ever meet. She know multiple commands such as sit, right and left paw, down, roll over and many more. Her previous owners said she is great with children and from what we have seen we also agree. She is a very calm and obedient girl, but also still has the drive of a cattle dog. Therefore, she would be a great companion for hiking, jogging, or even just chilling on the beach. Her previous owners also mentioned she is crate trained and housetrained. She has a lot of love in her heart and is looking for someone to share that with. Pepper is current on her vaccines, microchipped, heartworm test negative, and spayed so she is ready to join your family today! Come meet this fantastic canine at the Waggin' Tails Adoption Center in Benbrook, we are open everyday from 12-6pm.\n\n**Please call 817-249-3647 to schedule an appointment today.\n",

            "description": "Do you have a sweet tooth? Then you should meet our boy Mills. With his caramel and white coat, he resembles a warm caramel latte. He's just as sweet, will warm you up with snuggles, and leave you wanting more! Mills is also super-smart, knowing basic commands, some tricks, is housebroken and crate trained. His foster mom calls him low maintenance and a lovable goof! He loves to play with other dogs or play fetch with his humans. Adopt Mills today and satisfy that sweet tooth without it going to your hips! \n\nMills is about 3 years old and weighs about 50 pounds.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Mills, please visit our website to learn about our adoption process and to fill out an application, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs and cats will be micro-chipped, spayed or neutered, and up-to-date on vaccinations at the time of adoption. For more photos of Mills, follow us on Facebook Gateway Pet Guardians and Instagram @gatewaypets ... #gpgMills. \n\nTo view other adoptable pets from our shelter, please visit, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nGateway Pet Guardians is proud to offer a variety of mixed breed dogs available for adoption. However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

            "description": "Age: 2 Months (as of 1/24/2021)\nWeight: ~ 8 lbs (as of 1/24/2021)\n\nThis dog has been spayed/neutered, is up to date on shots, on heartworm preventative and is microchipped.\n\nThe HappyDays pups are here to bring joy to your life!\n\nThese puppies are playful, even-tempered, and very affectionate! The litter is three adorable girls - Marion, Joanie, and Lori Beth and four handsome boys - Fonzie, Howard, Chachi, and Richie. We are thinking these cute babies are an Australian Shepherd and Carolina Dog mix. This litter is named after the classic tv show Happy Days that aired in the 1970s - 1980s. The pups love all people including the two teenagers that are living in their foster home. They are friendly and playful with each other but we don't know how they are with new dogs, but given that they are so young we anticipate that they would get along with a new dog sibling well. Their current foster home has two cats and they seem interested and playful when they encounter them but we can't guarantee they will do well as they grow older with co-habitating cats. They love toys and are happy to chill with a squeaky ball or fun chew toy when not playing with you, and t\n\nheir favorite play styles are wrestling or a fun round of chase.\n\nThe pups are pretty quiet but you might hear them bark when playing.\nThough a fenced yard is an ideal place for your puppy to romp and play safely, if that's not an option then lots of daily leash walks and opportunities to play off leash is the next best thing.\n\nPuppies are a lot of work and require a strong commitment to teaching them obedience and socializing them with other dogs and people. A well-mannered, obedient dog will be welcomed most anywhere you take him/her.\nAs the pups are still so young, they haven't yet started on potty training, crate training or leash training but think they will pick up these skills quickly as they seem very smart. All the HappyDays pups are eager to please, toy and treat motivated, so puppy training classes will be lots of fun!\n\nFonzie would love to find a forever family that has lots of time and patience to raise a puppy properly, and who has lots of extra time for loving and cuddles. Think Fonzie (or one of his littermates) may be perfect furry addition to your family? Fill out an application today!\n\nHappyDays pup's Backstory: These pups came from an unplanned litter in Arkansas and have been in SOS foster care since birth. They are getting ready to make the ride to New England to meet their forever families!\n\nAdoption Fee: $585\n\nTo apply for this dog, fill out an adoption application on our website: www.sosarl.org/aa/\n\n**Additional info you should know - For most of our dogs, we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each of our dogs as an individual and do our best to describe and place them based on personality not breed label. Some dogs may not yet be in New England, nor ready for immediate adoption. There may be additional vetting, quarantine, waiting periods and/or fees depending upon your state of residence. If you have questions or concerns on any of this, you can discuss this with your Adoption Counselor.",

As much as I like it in my foster home, I really really want to find my forever home.\n\nI will come with the works (Neutered/Spayed, up to date on everything, micro chipped, fecal, heartworm tested if age appropriate, heartworm, flea and tick preventative, one month insurance and free vet visit).  What more could a new family ask for?  COVID 19 restrictions:  If I have not been altered by adoption I will have to return to my vet for my procedure.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and thinking about adoption, please visit our website http//www.wagginghearts.org and submit an adoption application. Include the name(s) of the animal(s) you are interested in the subject line of the email. Due to the high volume of applications we receive we are only able to process fully completed applications. We do not reply to inquiries. Since we are a foster based rescue we are unable to set up meet and greets until a completed application is on file and has been approved. \n\nWagging Hearts is a 100% foster-based, non-profit rescue organization. \n\nOur mission is to rescue abandoned, neglected, and stray companion animals. Please visit http//www.wagginghearts.org if you would like to adopt and provide a forever home to one in need.",

            "description": "Cosmo is a super sweet male Australian Shepherd/Border Collie mix. His original owners surrendered him as an Aussie/Border mix, but we think he may have something else in him too... possibly Great Dane. Born on 3/25/20, he's 10 months old and around 60 pounds now. Cosmo is housebroken, crate trained, dog/kid friendly (though he's still learning his size), and happy-go-lucky. He's a smart boy, food motivated, and eager to please. He has normal puppy energy for his age and his breed mix, and he really enjoys playing with other dogs. He'd love active adopters who will exercise him, train him, stimulate his brain, and a fenced in yard of his own for a fun game of fetch. He might even be pretty good in agility or other dog sports. Cosmo is a great pup and will make an excellent companion for a very lucky adoptive family. No apartments. Please do not apply if you do not understand the Aussie/Border breeds and their needs. He is fully vetted, neutered, microchipped, and ready for adoption! \nTo help pay for vet bills and care (transportation, food, toys, etc..) a $300 donation is requested at the time of adoption. All of our adoptions are contingent upon an approved application, home visit, reference check, obedience training agreement, and signing of adoption contract. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped before adoption. Our dogs are companion animals that live indoors as part of your family. Please do not apply if your plan is to have them as outside dogs, garage dogs, porch dogs or outside kennel dogs. We do not ship dogs. All of our dogs are in private foster homes. We are not a shelter with hours. A visit can be arranaged after an adoption questionnaire has been filled out and sent in. Please try email first. We are all volunteers that work so we can not easily take or make phone calls.",

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please download and complete an Adoption Questionnaire from our website and email Nora at NoraL@k-9lifesavers.org\nYou can learn about the adoption process and find a Word, PDF and ONLINE version of the questionnaire by visiting: http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/howtoadopt/.\nDog's Name: Tiny Tim\nEstimated Breed : Chihuahua Mix\nApproximate Age: 2-3 years\nApproximate Weight: approx. 18-20 lbs\nCurrently Living at: Boarding\nAdoption Fee: $300\nDOG'S DESCRIPTION\nTiny Tim is an adorable little guy looking for his forever home. Tiny Tim will need a quiet, calm, and nurturing home. He is nervous around new people, especially males. He has nipped in the past when scared, so his adopters will need to move slow with him and give him time to open up and trust. Tiny Tim would be happiest in a single family home with a yard in a quiet neighborhood. He needs a mature household (no young kids). He doesn't know how to walk well on leash and will most likely need some work in the housetraining department. If you feel you have the right home environment for this cutie, then Tiny Tim is ready to come home with you and be showered with love. Once he learns to trust, we know he will make a wonderful companion!\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

He loves to play with toys and is overzealous playing fetch. He has been getting along well with his foster siblings but can resource guard at times.\n\nHe is a high energy dog and will need a daily exercise routine. We were told he went to hunt training school, but do not know the results of the training, so far in his foster home he's shown he needs reinforcement of basic commands. He is house broken, and crate trained.\n\nWe will update as we learn more about Jagger.\n\nJagger is being fostered in Minnesota.\n\nComplete the adoption form here : ADOPT ME\n\n*Please be sure to read the adoption info/FAQ tab on our main website before applying for a dog.",

I love to snuggle up on couches and snuggle up with people. In the house, I didn't have any accidents! It would take some time for me to get used to your schedule, so accidents may happen, but I'd just need a refresher course! I'm really an amazing dog and I love to play. I'm still pretty rambunctious! If you think I could be a good dog for your home, come see me today!",

She is ready to go when you are and would love an active home to keep up with her active lifestyle. She\u2019s a lover of people and other dogs, so some kids or dogs in her forever home would be a huge bonus to her. Maaaaybe some older kids or bigger dogs. She is a puppy after all and has that puppy exuberance for life.\n\nShe has a love/hate relationship with the crate, sometimes it\u2019s awesome, sometimes it\u2019s a prison meant to prevent her from enjoying life. Keep her on a schedule though and she is fully potty trained (girl knows when she needs to go, keep up with the program)\n\nRebekah is a 3 month old pit mix. She is spayed, up to date with age appropriate vaccines, and microchipped\n\nHer adoption fee is $200",

            "description": "Boo is a 9 - 11 month old male Australian Shepherd. He is loose and wiggly, and comes when called. He like to just up in your lap and give gentle face greetings. He has a high energy level, so he will need plenty of exercise. He pulls on a leash, but this can be resolved with obedience training. Boo is food motivated, and knows the command sit. He gets along with dogs in the shelter environment, but is afraid of cats. Dogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Our cat test should be used as a general-purpose screening only to rule out overt aggression; we always recommend caution when introducing dogs to cats in the home. Recommendation on suitability of placement with children by their ages is based on behavioral observations including energy level and response to body handling. We never recommend leaving young children unsupervised with dogs, and we cannot guarantee the behavior of dogs with children, other pets or cats. Behavior evaluations should be considered as a snapshot of the behavior of the dog at this point in time; JHS believes all dog families need to be prepared to invest time and energy into training as well as provide common sense management of their new dog. We always encourage family to do some research on the breeds or mixes of breeds prior to adoption as many can have some unique characteristics that may or may not fit into their families. Always remember that the majority of dogs at our shelter have been exposed to or may have kennel cough. Kennel cough is contagious to other dogs, please talk to your vet if you have any questions about kennel cough prior to adoption. Please ask your adoption counselor at time of adoption if you have any unanswered questions regarding illnesses and treatments of the path that you are adopting. For more information about this dog or any others at our Shelter, please visit www.joplinhumane.org. We are the Joplin Humane Society in Joplin, Missouri. 417-623-3642.",

He likes to jump up in your lap and give kisses. He pulls on a leash, but this can be resolved with obedience training. Yeller is food motivated, but currently does not know any commands. He is a little timid around other dogs, but has not shown any signs of aggression towards his kennel mates. He is intensely interested in cats in the shelter environment.

            "description": "found on 2nd and hill It would be hard to find a dog to much cuter than Chase! This silly little guy is one happy fellow, even though he does have a congenital issue with his left front leg. He's been examined by a veterinarian who has determined that although his leg looks pretty crazy, it is non-painful. Of course as he gets older, you should expect some arthritic developments here. He does use the leg and gets around quite well. Chase is a 3 - 4 yr old male Pitbull. He has a high energy level, so he will need plenty of exercise. He is loose and wiggly, and comes to his person when called. He pulls on a leash, but this can be resolved with obedience training. Chase is food motivated, and knows the command sit. He gets along with other dogs in the shelter environment, but is afraid of cats. Dogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Our cat test should be used as a general-purpose screening only to rule out overt aggression; we always recommend caution when introducing dogs to cats in the home. Recommendation on suitability of placement with children by their ages is based on behavioral observations including energy level and response to body handling. We never recommend leaving young children unsupervised with dogs, and we cannot guarantee the behavior of dogs with children, other pets or cats. Behavior evaluations should be considered as a snapshot of the behavior of the dog at this point in time; JHS believes all dog families need to be prepared to invest time and energy into training as well as provide common sense management of their new dog. We always encourage family to do some research on the breeds or mixes of breeds prior to adoption as many can have some unique characteristics that may or may not fit into their families. Always remember that the majority of dogs at our shelter have been exposed to or may have kennel cough. Kennel cough is contagious to other dogs, please talk to your vet if you have any questions about kennel cough prior to adoption.

            "description": "Arlo is a 7 - 9 month old male Pitbull mix. He has a high energy level, so he will need plenty of exercise. He is loose and wiggly, and likes to jump up in your lap and give kisses. He pulls on a leash, but this can be resolved with obedience training. Arlo is food motivated, and knows the command sit. He gets along with other dogs in the kennel environment, but is intensely interested in cats. Dogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Our cat test should be used as a general-purpose screening only to rule out overt aggression; we always recommend caution when introducing dogs to cats in the home. Recommendation on suitability of placement with children by their ages is based on behavioral observations including energy level and response to body handling. We never recommend leaving young children unsupervised with dogs, and we cannot guarantee the behavior of dogs with children, other pets or cats. Behavior evaluations should be considered as a snapshot of the behavior of the dog at this point in time; JHS believes all dog families need to be prepared to invest time and energy into training as well as provide common sense management of their new dog. We always encourage family to do some research on the breeds or mixes of breeds prior to adoption as many can have some unique characteristics that may or may not fit into their families. Always remember that the majority of dogs at our shelter have been exposed to or may have kennel cough. Kennel cough is contagious to other dogs, please talk to your vet if you have any questions about kennel cough prior to adoption. Please ask your adoption counselor at time of adoption if you have any unanswered questions regarding illnesses and treatments of the path that you are adopting. For more information about this dog or any others at our Shelter, please visit www.joplinhumane.org. We are the Joplin Humane Society in Joplin, Missouri. 417-623-3642.",

He comes when called, and likes to jump up in your lap and give kisses. He pulls on a leash, but this can be resolved with obedience training. Toby is food motivated, and knows the command sit.

Like to laugh. \n\nFoster mom says I have an active mind and the body of an athlete. I would probably make a great hiking partner. Most dogs cannot leap effortlessly over a 2.5 ft tall gate- I'm just that cool! Kind of like a big dog in a small dog body. I love playing with toys, dogs, and people. I am crated when unsupervised, but foster mom thinks I won't need to be crated after we establish a routine, since I haven't had any accidents. I know what you're saying, I sound perfect- and I can't argue with that- I'm just looking for someone who can match my energy and my heart! \n\nTia is a Female Chihuahua/Terrier Mix that we estimate to be around 3 years old and weighs 12 lbs.",

I also love to hang around and play with my two foster siblings! My mom says I wouldn't hurt a fly but what are flies anyways? I would do best in a home with other dogs or someone who can be home with me quite a bit because I'm not very confident on my own. I know to do my potties outside but I still get confused sometimes because I'm in a new environment. Speaking of new things, stairs and new floorings confuse me but I gain confidence once I'm sure that the floor isn't lava!

We are currently running an Embark DNA test to see what he's mixed with. However, because so many fosters end up adopting their foster dogs, we will need fosters that actually qualify for adoption just in case (we would hate to deny a foster the ability to adopt based on our requirements). So please only apply to foster if you absolutely meet all requirements.\n\nTo apply to foster: www.friendsforliferescuenetwork.com/foster\n\nRequirements:\nOwn your own home- You, the applicant, must be the owner of the home. NO renters. No condos without yards.\n\nFenced in yard- must be fully fenced\n\nLive locally- Within 20-30 minutes of West Los Angeles due to veterinary care requirements.\n\nHave your own vehicle. We require fosters to travel back to West LA every few weeks for vaccines, etc.\n\nNo restrictions on your homeowners insurance based on breed of dog.\n\nExperience with large bully breeds is a plus. Having another dog in the home is a plus.",

She can be a bit sensitive with new people, but loves to snuggle up once she knows you. She shows potential with other dogs, but would do best with a dog that is more calm and laid back. Since she is such a sweetheart she shows potential to live in a home with children as well. She is a friendly and goofy girl who loves to play when she gets the chance, but is very laid back and relaxed most of the day. Honey would love to find her forever family to snuggle her days away with. \n\nIf Honey looks like the pup for you, give our adoptions counselors a call at 234-212-9843 to schedule an appointment to meet her today!",

He is 1 of 7 siblings surrendered to the shelter, so they all came to Illinois to find a forever home. Though from Arkansas he loves the snow and his toys. He is an energetic puppy who adores attention and a lot of love to give. He does great with everyone, kids and other dogs. He is learning basic puppy manners, crate training and potty training all of which are going well. He will need someone home (not left alone more then a few hours) to continue with these basics and socialization skills. With love and patience he will make a wonderful addition to any home.\n\nWE DO NOT DO OUT OF STATE ADOPTIONS\nThank you for considering the adoption of one of our rescue dogs.  We are committed to finding our rescues the perfect home. Together we can make a difference in the life of a dog.\n \nThe adoption process should be a fun and exciting time for families and dogs. Our goal is to place our babies in forever homes.  The potential adopter needs to be dedicated to their care and training for life. \nUnderstand that sharing your life with a dog can be a commitment of 15+ years. This would include feeding, exercise, training, vetting, and providing a loving home. Ask yourself, \"Am I ready for this type of commitment?\"  If you are ready, we are here to help.  We do have some requirements to help us find the perfect placement of our babies. \n\nWE ARE A FOSTER BASED RESCUE ONLY. WE DO NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL BUILDING\n1.  Apply online at https://www.foreverhomedogrescueil.org\nWe must have an application, conduct a phone interview, and meet your entire family (including other dogs) to approve an adoption. Only a final approval for adoption can take place after a successful meet and greet. This is done by appointments only. We will not proceed with the adoption if everyone has not met the dog.  This will allow others the opportunity to adopt the dog.\n2.  Adopters MUST be 21 years old.\nInformation on all adults/members living in the home is required\nWe REQUIRE you to provide proof and vet reference that all current and past pets have been kept up to date on all routine medical.\n3.  Illinois law requires that all of our dogs and puppies be spayed/neutered within 30 days of adoption. In order to fully comply with this regulation and reduce the number of homeless dogs and puppies, \n4.  If you do not own your home, you must provide landlord contact information on the application and a copy of your lease that outlines the rules for dog ownership in your residence.  \nLarge breed dogs will not be adopted into apartment settings or where there are breed/ size restrictions.\nPuppies have special needs and require a home where someone is available to care for, socialize, and give basic training.  If you are gone for more than a couple hours at a time, please consider adopting a teen or older dog.\n5.  Adoption fees are $350. We accept checks or cash. (Prices are subject to change without notice).\n6.  All dogs and puppies adopted through Forever Home are fully vetted with age appropriate vaccines. Keep in mind once you take possession of your newly adopted dog, any and all future medical costs or care is YOUR responsibility.\n7. First time puppy/dog adopters will be required to sign up for and pay in advance a basic training class. A deposit of an extra 50.00 will be required until a class has been completed, it will then be returned. \n8. WE DO NOT DO OUT OF STATE ADOPTIONS \n \nMedical included is as follows:\nSpay/Neuter (age appropriate) *Forever Home uses Fox Valley Animal Welfare League in Aurora, IL\nAge appropriate core vaccines\nFecal testing and deworming\nFlea and tick preventative\nFree 1st Vet visit at one of our participating vets\nMicrochipping\n \nForever Home Dog Rescue reserves the right to deny any applicant.",

I need a home with no small children under 10 please.\n\nI am up to date on vaccines, spayed, micro-chipped and Heartworm negative. The cost to adopt me is $200.00 and the adoption process begins with an Adoption Application that can be located @ www.faithfulfriendsnc.org under the Adopt tab. Once your completed application has been reviewed the humans will contact you with questions and/or set an appointment for you to meet me. Thank you!\n\nPlease take a moment to review the FFAS website and review the adoption guidelines. Thank you again.",

They are all named for a previous or current DOTUS (Dog of The United States!) At 6 weeks old, Ranger (named for George H. W. Bush's beloved pup) is a big lovable pupper. He weighs 9 pounds.  He spends most of his day sleeping and playing with his sisters. Dad hails from Tenneessee but unclear what breed, we would guess shepherd or labrador. Mom is the cuddliest 28 lbs you will ever meet! Also a mix, mom appears to be part beagle and part golden retriever. These pups are also cuddly, just like their mama! With proper training and frequent exercise, these pups will be a fantastic addition to your family!\n\nAll dogs are up to date on vaccinations and spayed/neutered at the time of adoption.  Due to the young age of this puppy, he/she is not housebroken or trained unless otherwise specially indicated. All puppies require professional training to become the best family member they can be.\n\nTo adopt or learn more about Ranger DOTUS, you must fill out an adoption application. To find the application, copy and paste this URL into your browser: WWW.GDRNE.COM/ADOPTION-APPLICATION [Adoption Fee: $550]  **  PLEASE READ: If a dog is listed, then s/he is currently available for adoption. Their information is correct to the best of our abilities and the information we have been given as of the day of posting. Please note, GDRNE does not guarantee the breed of any dog or puppy unless stated that we have run DNA. All breeds listed are educated estimates. Our dogs are rescued from various situations. It is most likely that both their parents were strays and even if not, mixes of some sort and that their grandparents were mixes as well. The dog may have some genetic material of an American Staffordshire Terrier (pit bull). The dogs are usually mixes of many breeds, making them a breed all their own - a True and adorable American MUTT. If you are interested in this dog, you must submit an application. Great Dog is not a shelter so there is no building you can visit. Our dogs live in private foster homes until adopted. To learn more about our *shelterless* rescue, adoption fees, and procedures, review the list of Frequently Asked Questions on our website at WWW.GDRNE.COM.",

            "description": "Gunther is a ball of energy! He is a clown and enjoys everything life has to offer. His photos can be a bit deceiving, as he is around 45 pounds. He is stocky. He is great in his kennel and is fully housetrained. Gunther will need a good structured routine and firm expectations. Group training classes with him will be very beneficial for him and can help him establish base obedience and some self-control. He does not really know how to relax on his own and is on the go all the time. When he is not on the go, he wants all the attention all the time. He will need adequate exercise, but a busy home with lots of activity may be overstimulating for him. He loves his foster dog sister, and would do great with one other dog in the home. More than one dog may increase his energy level too high, but one dog as his friend would be great.

He was abandoned and surrendered to the shelter, so he came to Illinois to find a forever home. Though from Arkansas he loves the snow and his toys. He is an energetic puppy who adores attention and a lot of love to give. He does great with everyone, kids and other dogs. He is learning basic puppy manners, crate training and potty training all of which are going well. He will need someone home (not left alone more then a few hours) to continue with these basics and socialization skills. With love and patience he will make a wonderful addition to any home.\n\nWE DO NOT DO OUT OF STATE ADOPTIONS\nThank you for considering the adoption of one of our rescue dogs.  We are committed to finding our rescues the perfect home. Together we can make a difference in the life of a dog.\n \nThe adoption process should be a fun and exciting time for families and dogs. Our goal is to place our babies in forever homes.  The potential adopter needs to be dedicated to their care and training for life. \nUnderstand that sharing your life with a dog can be a commitment of 15+ years. This would include feeding, exercise, training, vetting, and providing a loving home. Ask yourself, \"Am I ready for this type of commitment?\"  If you are ready, we are here to help.  We do have some requirements to help us find the perfect placement of our babies. \n\nWE ARE A FOSTER BASED RESCUE ONLY. WE DO NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL BUILDING\n1.  Apply online at https://www.foreverhomedogrescueil.org\nWe must have an application, conduct a phone interview, and meet your entire family (including other dogs) to approve an adoption. Only a final approval for adoption can take place after a successful meet and greet. This is done by appointments only. We will not proceed with the adoption if everyone has not met the dog.  This will allow others the opportunity to adopt the dog.\n2.  Adopters MUST be 21 years old.\nInformation on all adults/members living in the home is required\nWe REQUIRE you to provide proof and vet reference that all current and past pets have been kept up to date on all routine medical.\n3.  Illinois law requires that all of our dogs and puppies be spayed/neutered within 30 days of adoption. In order to fully comply with this regulation and reduce the number of homeless dogs and puppies, \n4.  If you do not own your home, you must provide landlord contact information on the application and a copy of your lease that outlines the rules for dog ownership in your residence.  \nLarge breed dogs will not be adopted into apartment settings or where there are breed/ size restrictions.\nPuppies have special needs and require a home where someone is available to care for, socialize, and give basic training.  If you are gone for more than a couple hours at a time, please consider adopting a teen or older dog.\n5.  Adoption fees are $350. We accept checks or cash. (Prices are subject to change without notice).\n6.  All dogs and puppies adopted through Forever Home are fully vetted with age appropriate vaccines. Keep in mind once you take possession of your newly adopted dog, any and all future medical costs or care is YOUR responsibility.\n7. First time puppy/dog adopters will be required to sign up for and pay in advance a basic training class. A deposit of an extra 50.00 will be required until a class has been completed, it will then be returned. \n8. WE DO NOT DO OUT OF STATE ADOPTIONS \n \nMedical included is as follows:\nSpay/Neuter (age appropriate) *Forever Home uses Fox Valley Animal Welfare League in Aurora, IL\nAge appropriate core vaccines\nFecal testing and deworming\nFlea and tick preventative\nFree 1st Vet visit at one of our participating vets\nMicrochipping\n \nForever Home Dog Rescue reserves the right to deny any applicant.",

They are all named for a previous or current DOTUS (Dog of The United States!) At 6 weeks old, Major is our most curious pup. She weighs 8 1/2 pounds.  Named for President Biden's pup, she loves to play with new toys and discover. She is such a lovebug. Dad hails from Tenneessee but unclear what breed, we would guess shepherd or labrador. Mom is the cuddliest 28 lbs you will ever meet! Also a mix, mom appears to be part beagle and part golden retriever. These pups are also cuddly, just like their mama! With proper training and frequent exercise, these pups will be a fantastic addition to your family!\n\nAll dogs are up to date on vaccinations and spayed/neutered at the time of adoption.  Due to the young age of this puppy, he/she is not housebroken or trained unless otherwise specially indicated. All puppies require professional training to become the best family member they can be.\n\nTo adopt or learn more about Major DOTUS, you must fill out an adoption application. To find the application, copy and paste this URL into your browser: WWW.GDRNE.COM/ADOPTION-APPLICATION [Adoption Fee: $550]  **  PLEASE READ: If a dog is listed, then s/he is currently available for adoption. Their information is correct to the best of our abilities and the information we have been given as of the day of posting. Please note, GDRNE does not guarantee the breed of any dog or puppy unless stated that we have run DNA. All breeds listed are educated estimates. Our dogs are rescued from various situations. It is most likely that both their parents were strays and even if not, mixes of some sort and that their grandparents were mixes as well. The dog may have some genetic material of an American Staffordshire Terrier (pit bull). The dogs are usually mixes of many breeds, making them a breed all their own - a True and adorable American MUTT. If you are interested in this dog, you must submit an application. Great Dog is not a shelter so there is no building you can visit. Our dogs live in private foster homes until adopted. To learn more about our *shelterless* rescue, adoption fees, and procedures, review the list of Frequently Asked Questions on our website at WWW.GDRNE.COM.",

Her fosters have been so impressed with her .\nShe continues to be super patient with our 18 month old. She never chews on his toys. She takes treats gently. She would be a huge blessing for a family with small children. Loves nothing more than to sit around and be loved on. She follows you from room to room because she likes to be with her people. She's perfectly house trained and crate trained.\nLady has met with a trainer and her walking on a leash and barking at other dogs is improving. She is trying very hard. She still does have some anxiety when there is a lot going on around her (public park on a nice day) but consistent work and lots of treats has made a huge improvement. She would be a wonderful companion for a family.",

They are all named for a previous or current DOTUS (Dog of The United States!) At 6 weeks old, Champ is a delightful, spirited young pup! She weighs 9 pounds.  SHE (yes, Champ is a SHE!) is very bouncy and playful. Dad hails from Tenneessee but unclear what breed, we would guess shepherd or labrador. Mom is the cuddliest 28 lbs you will ever meet! Also a mix, mom appears to be part beagle and part golden retriever. These pups are all so cuddly, just like their mama! With proper training and frequent exercise, these pups will be a fantastic addition to your family!\n\nAll dogs are up to date on vaccinations and spayed/neutered at the time of adoption.  Due to the young age of this puppy, he/she is not housebroken or trained unless otherwise specially indicated. All puppies require professional training to become the best family member they can be.\n\nTo adopt or learn more about Champ DOTUS, you must fill out an adoption application. To find the application, copy and paste this URL into your browser: WWW.GDRNE.COM/ADOPTION-APPLICATION [Adoption Fee: $550]  **  PLEASE READ: If a dog is listed, then s/he is currently available for adoption. Their information is correct to the best of our abilities and the information we have been given as of the day of posting. Please note, GDRNE does not guarantee the breed of any dog or puppy unless stated that we have run DNA. All breeds listed are educated estimates. Our dogs are rescued from various situations. It is most likely that both their parents were strays and even if not, mixes of some sort and that their grandparents were mixes as well. The dog may have some genetic material of an American Staffordshire Terrier (pit bull). The dogs are usually mixes of many breeds, making them a breed all their own - a True and adorable American MUTT. If you are interested in this dog, you must submit an application. Great Dog is not a shelter so there is no building you can visit. Our dogs live in private foster homes until adopted. To learn more about our *shelterless* rescue, adoption fees, and procedures, review the list of Frequently Asked Questions on our website at WWW.GDRNE.COM.",

            "description": "Tinsel is a love! He adores his person and everyone he meets. He wags and leans in for pets. He is such a resilient boy despite being blind. I have learned that non tipping water bowls and food bowls help him. He really uses his nose, sense of smell and high stepping prance to navigate.\n\nTinsel has just recently learned to play with toys and prances proudly with his favorite in his mouth. It seems tennis balls are his favorite and I can absolutely see him learning to fetch with his person.\n\nTinsel is house trained and crate trained. He gets along well with other dogs and cats. He is good with children. Tinsel does well on leash and does not pull. He has been a perfect patient at the vet and does so well.\n\nTinsel is around 5 years old and weighs about 70 pounds. Tinsel is a good boy who just wants love. He does well once he understands his new environment and guides very well by a collar or by following my steps and voice.\n\nTinsel loves a dog bed but his favorite place is to be beside you on the couch. I do not crate him. I do keep him in a room gated off with a dog bed when I leave and at night and he does super. He is a super sweet pleaser who will be such a gift to anyone who opens their heart to him, despite his blindness\n\nTinsel doesn\u2019t jump and is well-behaved. He has only growled if startled out of a deep sleep by a pouncing puppy. Otherwise, he never makes a peep; although he cried once to go out to potty.\n\nTinsel is looking for home where he will be an adored family member and accepted despite his blindness. Respectful kids of any age will be great, he adored the 7 year old he met here. I think pouncing toddlers may scare him if he is asleep. No noises seem to scare him, he really is a very chill, good energy, happy pup.\n\nHe does have some allergy issues but is responding amazing to treatment the vet did. I also switched his protein source to lamb and that may be helping too.\n\nHe eats about 1.5 cups of Iams Lamb adult AM and PM. He loves all cookies, cheese and sometimes I add pumpkin to his food and he loves that too.\n\nIf you are interested in Tinsel and are an approved adopter, please contact your Adoption Coordinator to be added to Tinsel\u2019s list. If you are not yet approved you can find our adoption guidelines and application at:  www.savealabrescue.org\n\nTinsel is fostered in RI\n",

Her finder spent 2 weeks looking for her owner, but nobody claimed her, so she asked for our help in finding a great home for Buffy. Buffy is 1 year old and weighs about 15 pounds. The vet says she has some Pomeranian in her, but is a definite mix. Buffy is very sweet and playful. She would love another young dog to play with in her forever home. She's been doing good with pottying outside using a petdoor or being taken out regularly. Buffy would try to back out of her collar or harness when we got her, but she's doing better now with walking on leash. She likes to chase cats if they run, but is never aggressive with them. Buffy likes older children that will play with her. She has been a delight to foster. She's a very loving girl and would love a forever home.\n\nIn order to adopt, you need to send an e-mail to rescue@secondchancepoms.org asking for an application.  After you send this back, we will check references and someone will visit you in your home to discuss adoption.  We ask a donation of $425 for adults, which includes an applicable Texas sales tax, and $475 for puppies, which includes an applicable Texas sales tax.  This covers shots, spay/neuter, and any medical treatment, such as de-worming. We do not ship our pomeranians, but an out-of-state adoption can still happen if the adopter comes to the Houston, TX area to pick up their pom.",

            "description": "Oh, where do I begin with my precious girl Zola? She has so many beautiful sides to her that are wonderful. There's the energetic, wiggle butt, who barks excitedly when I come home from work. There's the quiet more laid back Zola when I'm on the couch watching a movie. There's the attentive at my feet Zola while I cook dinner. Zola does have a bit of energy but it's mostly when I come home from work. She is kenneled when I leave the house so I'm sure she's ready to get out and play as soon as I walk through the door! I have a large yard so Zola gets plenty of time to run around and get her energy out! Once she's done running around and playing, she'll come in and plop down and relax. Zola is a very friendly and love-able dog. She is friendly to all and has a heart of gold.\n\nZola does chew. On shoes! She has ruined quite a few pairs of mine and my children's so I have to keep them locked up in the closet. You\u2019ve been warned! This happy girl is a bit clumsy when she is let out of her kennel and does a spin, dance, twirl move which tends knock over anything in her path; almost like she's a miniature tornado.\n\nhave so enjoyed having Zola with me. Zola came to me, during a difficult time in my life last year, and I found myself leaning heavily on her gentle soul. She's attentive to my needs and was always right there to snuggle with me when I needed her. Even my cat, who is a recluse when it comes to my other dogs, snuggled with Zola on the couch or bed. Animals know a gentle soul when they meet one and Zola's is so full of love to give. Zola has eyes that cross a bit when she looks up at me with love in her eyes and I found myself falling more and more in love with those big, brown, crossed eyes every day. \n\nWatch your bag of dog food! I was so confused for months as to why it always seemed like I had less and less dog food than I remembered, and at one point even felt alarmed at how bad my memory was becoming, until one day I caught Zola with her head shoved all the way down the bag of dog food happily chomping away. She didn't even have the decency to look ashamed when I caught her. She just looked at me with her tail wagging, crunching away at her endless buffet. I now keep it in a large closed container. \n\nZola is around 3 years old and weighs about 60 pounds. She is crate trained and house trained. Zola is good with kids, other dogs and cats as well. \n\nTo the person that ends up with Zola, your life will be for the better having her contagious bubbly energy and love radiate throughout your home. I was beyond blessed having her here with me and the wonderful laughs she brought to my family. Her presence will be greatly missed but I can't wait to see where the next chapter of her life will take her. Best wishes!\n\nIf you are interested in Zola and are an approved adopter, please contact your Adoption Coordinator to be added to Zola\u2019s list. If you are not yet approved you can find our adoption guidelines and application at:  www.savealabrescue.org\n\nZola is fostered in RI\n",

This handsome fella is Turner, a 4 year old, 47 lb Hound/Shepherd mix who is house trained, laid back, and very well mannered. He gets along great with dogs his size and smaller, but seems to be intimidated or scared around dogs larger than he is, so a canine sibling needs to be on the smaller side. Turner is super affectionate, loves his humans, and just wants a safe place to lay his head (such as a couch!). We don't know how he does with cats. He is microchipped, vaccinated, and neutered. His adoption fee is $400.",

She is potty trained, crate trained, and loves to ride in a car. She is working on leash manners along with social skills. She is very submissive and will submissive pees on occassion. Millie Jane loves to be by her female fosters side at all times but will lay with foster dad as well. Her loving, wiggly, crawling, underbite self, is perfect for the Chichuaha lover! Her favorite thing to do is to take all the toys out of the toy box and relocate them throughout the house. She still has a lot of puppy in her. She will eat what is on the floor including dust bunnies, leaves, or anything else she can swallow so kleenex and trash cans need to be put up before leaving her for a long period of time. She is not destructive by any means just a little mischievious! \n\nShe will require a Chihauaha experienced home with understanding it takes at least three days for her to trust hand and voice commands. She needs to go at her own pace and requires the adopter to understand this. She can be mouthly so a home with no children is a must. She can be fierce when she thinks she is in harms way and will protect herself. Once she knows you mean her no harm and you have chicken she is your shadow!!! She is so sweet and loving.",

Daisy is a middle age (estimated at about 7) retired mother who has raised her kids and now just needs a long vacation, several hundred naps, a few good books, and maybe a nice red. Daisy is looking for a nap partner who will share the covers and maybe throw another log on the fire for her. She is great with kids, cats, and dogs who realize she doesn't want to play but is totally down to be the little spoon. She is a little thing weighing in under 20 pounds.\n\n \n\nDaisy is fully crate trained, low energy and working on her potty skills. On warm days she likes to go outside, but on cold days getting up from her warm spot to go outside isn't really on her agenda. Maybe a nice warm coat or some homemade mittens could entice her to stray from her busy schedule of napping and dreaming. Daisy really is a dream herself and will make some chill, low-key person an amazing forever companion. If your couch has a small spot left to share for this sweet gal, she would love to keep it warm for you. Daisy is spayed, microchipped, and up to date on shots. Her adoption fee is $275, and you can apply to adopt her at www.rescueofhope.com/adoption-application",

            "description": "Merry Clara Hippopotamus was the 25th dog rescued in 2020 by Sketchy Mutts and Underdogs. It was just before Christmas, so she needed a special holiday name. Where did Hippopotamus come from....? Just look at her!\n\nThis cute little hippo was taken to the shelter as a skinny, itchy, scabby stray with swollen feet and bilateral ear infections. Her feet were so painful that she had to be carried outside and she would only walk short distances before she would sit down and hold her feet up. Her ears were cropped short, and she appeared to have had several litters of puppies. The rescue loved her at first sight!\n\nIn her foster home, Merry got lots of love, good food, medication for her skin and ears, medicated baths and lots of fancy new sweaters to keep her warm while she healed. Now she\u2019s ready to find a forever home of her own.\n\nThe sad, tired dog who came to the shelter is now a spirited, spunky girl who greets every human she meets like they\u2019re her long lost best friend. She loves stuffed animals, cuddling on the couch under a blanket and car rides. Her feet are much less painful, but she does have a condition called hyperkeratosis possibly due to an  untreated illness when she was a puppy. She\u2019s gone from needing to be carried outside to enjoying two mile walks with her foster mom!\n\nMerry likes one of the dogs in her foster home, but is not too fond of the other one. Most likely, with proper introduction, she would be fine with a big, friendly, dog who would be tolerant while she figures things out. On walks, Merry is very focused on the neighborhood cats and small dogs she has seen, and would probably do best in a home without small animals. While foster mom is at work, Merry stays in a room with baby gates and mostly sleeps on the couch all day. She is house trained, but will use a potty pad if she can\u2019t wait until foster mom comes home. Merry has learned so much, and is thriving in her foster home. She will be a great companion for one lucky family.\n",

            "description": "Pablo is a 10yr old, 10lb Mini Poodle boy. Talk about a face you cant say no to! Pablo is an adorable, affectionate, and special companion. Pablo is completely deaf and since he cant hear his humans, he likes to stay close to you - whether snuggled up in your lap on the couch or next to you in bed at night. He will be your shadow and follow you closely wherever you go, often standing right at your feet. This little guy will love his person so much, he does not want you to leave - so a home where someone is home more often than not is a definite must have for him. He walks well outside on a leash and is comfortable riding in the car. He is kind, mild-mannered, and oh so sweet. Pablo is on heart medication he takes twice daily, which costs around $60 per month. Due to his mellow nature and close attachment to his humans, he would do best in a home that is calm like he is without children. Pablo has shown great house-training manners when kept to a schedule. He is good with other dogs, and while there aren't any cats in his foster home, we think that he would be ok with them as well. \n\nIf Pablo sounds like the new lap dog youve been looking for, please visit our website www.PoodleandPoochRescue.org where you will find the application to adopt. Pablo is up to date on his vaccines, neutered, heartworm negative, and microchipped. His adoption donation is $250.",

He has such good manners!\n\nSammie is very well house trained, and lets you know when he needs to go out. Due to his maturity, he sometimes needs to go as often as every 3-4 hours, but he does sleep through the night.\n\nHe enjoys walking on a leash, but should only walk for short distances, especially in the heat. He likes to ride in a wagon or a pram for additional fresh air when his short legs and senior body dictate that he should not walk further.\n\nSir Sammie Loves:\n\nSharing a chair and snuggling next to his human.\nListening to the \"Easy listening\" music station on Comcast, and the Divinity of Dogs album by George Skaroulis\nWatermelon, Pupperoni, fish flavored Food\n\nHe does NOT like:\n\nPeanut Butter or Thunderstorms!\n\nSir Sammie has some aches and pains, but is very stoic about them, unless he is picked up wrong. He will let you know if you are unwittingly causing pain.\n\nAngel Among Us is treating his pain with joint supplements and pain meds, and he is already starting to feel better. The Angels are also arranging additional medical evaluation soon to make sure that all of his health issues are addressed, so he is only available for pre-adoption at this time.\n\nSir Sammie will make a wonderful, loving companion for a loving human. He will be fine as an only dog as long as he has human companionship, but has demonstrated that he can get along fine with other gentle dogs. We do not know about cats.\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal. However, we have many wonderful homeless pets available.",

Sadly, Coco was surrendered because he wasn't getting along with the other pets in the home, that being said, he will have to be the only animal in his new home. Coco really is a character of a dog, he lights up any room he walks into with his underbite alone! Coco loves running around outside, getting treats, and curling up next to his favorite person! Coco's previous owner's did say that he does not get along with smaller children, so a home with older children that know how to handle dogs would be best for him. Coco does not like having his paws touched at all, so you will have to work with him on trimming his nails. Sadly, in his previous home Coco spent almost all of his time outside, so he is still adjusting to his new life indoors, but is loving the AC and soft blankies! Coco loves getting tummy rubs and will even lay on his side, with his belly up in case you feel like giving him a tummy rub at any time! This sweet boy is current on his vaccines, heartworm negative, microchipped and neutered so he is ready to come home today! He is still adjusting to the new potty routine in the shelter, so he will need some time to adjust to the routine in his new home; so please be patient with him. Coco is available at the Waggin' Tails Adoption Center in Benbrook, open every day from 12-6 pm, by appointment!\n\n*Please give us a call at 817-249-3647 to schedule an appointment!",

I am a nearly 2 year old Great Pyrenees/ Border Collie mix and I am looking for my forever home!! \n\nI am a super sweet guy that absolutely loves kids and I would love to go to a home with some for me to play with!!! I am house trained and I love the snow!!! I would love to have a fenced in yard so I can run around in the snow but a fence is not required!! I am a playful guy and would be great with other dogs that are about my size or larger but I can be a little rough with dogs that are smaller than me! I have not been around cats. \n\nI really LOVE being with my family so when they leave the home for long periods of time, I do suffer with a good bit of separation anxiety. Because of that I am required to go to a home with a family that has atleast one family member that is home for majority of the day!!! (even after the covid restrictions are lifted!!!) \n\nMy adoption fee is $300 and includes all age appropriate vaccinations/ microchip & neuter! If you think Id make the perfect addition to your family, please fill out an application on the website crossyourpaws.com - once your application has been reviewed/approved you will be contacted to set up an meet and greet!! \n if you have an application already on file and would like Brutus attached to it, please send us a PM! DO NOT EMAIL! Thank you! \n\nI cannot wait to meet you! \n- Brutus \n\nPlease share \nKenny Ross Subaru #cyprescue #KennyRossSubaru #subarulovespets",

            "description": "Buddy was abandoned by his owner and was left to roam around a small Missouri town. Some folks in town were kind to Buddy, some were not. Thank goodness a kind woman, who had been feeding Buddy, called BBRH to help. He had been spending time near her home and was even playing with her kids. This is how he got his name. The kids called him Buddy. \n\nBuddy is in really good shape for being a stray for a while. We think he is 1-2 year old tri-colored male beagle. After getting a bath, we found his fur is very soft. Buddy appears to be house trained, only having one accident since living with his foster family and that was after we left the doggy door close. Speaking of doggy door, he learned how to use it quickly so he seems quite smart.\n\nBuddy didnt sleep much when he first came to us. We believe this was from having to sleep with one eye open out on the street. He has relaxed and is getting more rest, becoming more comfortable with us each day. He is still timid and scared by loud noises, but very, very friendly. We get lots of kisses from him. He does have some separation anxiety which is understandable after being abandon. He doesnt like the kennel. He doesnt seem to be a chewer. He tried to dig under and bite through a fence, but he was trying to get to his foster dad, who hes become attached to.\n\nBuddy plays well with other dogs and seems to be ok with kids. We dont know how he is with cats. He has been good on car rides. He eats fast, but not sure if this is from not always having a regular meal or just being a beagle.\n\nBuddy is neutered, heart worm negative, up to date on all vaccinations, and chipped. His adoption fee is $350 and being fostered in the Kansas City area. You can apply for Buddy B at www.bassetandbeagle.org",

Molly has quite a bit of energy and will do best with another playful, high energy dog, to keep her engaged and build her confidence. Molly loves to go for long walks but does need help with her leash manners. She is affectionate and sweet and loves humans of all sizes and ages. She has NOT been cat tested. Molly likes to bark, so a single home is optimal.\nMolly is vaccinated and microchipped and will be able to go home after she is spayed (2/12/21). If you think you might be a good match for Molly, please fill out the application below. \nMolly is being fostered in the Lehigh Valley, Pa. \nWe are a small rescue and can only facilitate local adoptions within a 45 minute radius. \nIf you wish to meet Molly you must complete the application. Link below.\n\nhttp://hairofthedogrescue.org/adoption-application/",

Both girls came from a puppy mill adopted to a home 2 1/2 years ago and returned. The owner was no longer able to care for them. They are very shy and sweet girls.  They are crate trained and do best sleeping in crates side-by-side at night. Both love the yard for play and lizard chasing. They need to be adopted together.  <br /><br /><br /><strong>Please note: RFSC adopts to those living in the Southern CA counties of Riverside, San Diego, Orange, and San Bernardino residents only.

            "description": "After 659 days in rescue we were ELATED when she was adopted! We even waited weeks to make sure that it was going to stick before announcing. The day after we announced her adoption we were told it wasn't going to work. Scarlett has lived a life the past 659 days in a strict routine as she isn't dog friendly, so she was on a crate and rotate schedule. She was out in a new home and just was given too much freedom\nAnd change too fast and became overwhelmed. Scarlett needs a home, without kids (it had the largest negative impact on her relationship with the kids), that can take it slow. We REALLY want to avoid having to bring her back here to her previous foster to crate and rotate again. Can anyone help Scarlett?? \n\nScarlett Josephine\n\nLocated in the Gillette WY area\nBulldog/Staffordshire Terrier/Boxer aka a tiny French Mastiff lookalike \n4 years old\nNeeds work with other dogs, just no ability to read social cues, very workable she's come SO far in the past year \nNO cats\nNo young kids. Despite being great with kids in past fosters (but when overwhelmed it was the children in her home that she directed at, so we are now saying no kids)\nLoves to cuddle\nCrate trained (most of the time) and working on commands\nHouse trained\nFully vetted\n45lbs\n\nI ran across this horrible intake photo of a sweet little red bully mix where you can't even tell if it's a tongue or a growth on her face and knew she wasn't likely to make it out. She was emaciated and had sores all over her legs and feet, she was drooling and obviously scared out of her mind. Do to her emaciated state she was immediately out in the rescue only building and thus very few people saw her. Then I watched 2 videos of her and her face kept me up at night. She was desperate and scared, and you could tell she's had a horrible life with very little human kindness! I couldn't stop thinking about her, checking her posts to see if they had the update we were all hoping for. \n\nAs the California shelter continued to fill and there were no updates and she was going to die I reached out to some people to see if we could help in any way. I needed to see that she got her miracle, her 2nd chance, because in rescue that's what we do.\n\nWe got her pulled and she had horrible kennel cough and a URI. It was also discovered that her unique smile is likely because she suffers a birth defect that results in her not growing all her teeth, which gives her the most adorable smile ever! She stayed at the vet for a while where they determined she was dog reactive. Unfortunately because she went from one stressful kennel environment to another that's not an assessment that we can trust. She had a foster who was finally able to pick her up from the vet after a couple weeks. She kept her for a few weeks. When Scarlett arrived she was still super skinny.\n\nScarlett's life had been horrible, during her first 3 years on this planet she had seen little to no human kindness and yet, her favorite activity is cuddling with her humans and giving out lots of love! She's got the sweetest personality which makes the idea that she likely lived in a small area full of her own feces(sores on her feat and lack of care regarding sleeping in her own mess ), hit (scars), neglected (horrible condition she was in), starved (emaciated state) and ignored before basically being left to fend for herself on the mean streets of Los Angeles is epically heartbreaking! \n\nEven after a year Scarlett is a work in progress and need a PATIENT and epically understanding home. She hasn't been properly socialized with other dogs and thus she doesn't understand the concept of person space and she cannot read social cues, at all. Due to this we are looking for a home for her without other dogs. We believe with work and time in the future she may be just fine with other dogs, she has made great headway in the past year, but right now that's just not something we are willing to risk. After everything she's been through she really deserves to be insanely adored!\n\nIf you're willing to open up your home and heart to this adorable little flower please contact us ASAP! We are so excited to play such an epic role in her journey to find her FURever home and we cannot wait to meet her special humans wherever they are and watch her blossom in her own home! \n\n $200.00 Adoption Fee \n(Which is considered a non refundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible. The fee itself is not negotiable, our vets don't negotiate and thus neither do we.) \n\nWE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY ALL OUR DOGS ARE LOCATED IN FOSTER HOMES. This means there is no place for you to go in person to view our dogs. We ask that an application be filled out and we will go from there!\n\nTo Contact Us\n\nMessage us through our website http://www.highplainspaw.org\n\nMessage the Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/HighPlainsPAW\n\nFill out our Adoption Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/adoption-application\n\nFill out our Foster Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/foster-application\n\nEmail us at highplainspaw@gmail.com\n\nCall our voicemail at (402)957-1578",

            "description": "Brisket is a 1.5 year old chocolate lab mix who was found wandering around an oil patch in rural Texas. We looked and looked for his owner but it seems they did not want to be found. All the better for Brisket because now he gets to find a new home who will take good care of him and make certain he never gets lost or abandoned. At 50-55 lbs, Brisket is a medium size boy who is perfect for those hikes, games of fetch and of course, snuggles on the couch! He has been a little growly toward some male dogs who get in his face so he has asked to be placed in a home with only female dogs or as an only child. Before he came to Colorado his Texas foster family said he slept quietly and contently in his crate and would walk right in - no fuss! This smart boy learned the routin quickly and only had 2 accidents in the house so he is pretty much house trained once he knows the routine. Kids adore him and Brisket returnes the sentiments. He was great with her kids and also didn't seem to mind the barn cats but that doesn't necessarily mean he will be great with every house cat. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting Bart please complete an application at https://www.circle2rescue.com/dog-adoption-application/ The adoption fee of $350 includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, microchip and dewormer.\n\nPlease note, Circle 2 Rescue cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have limited history prior to them entering the rescue. We make every effort to ensure the dogs are healthy.",

Her foster mom describes her as a love bug. She said they sing to her, \"Ruby with eyes that sparkle\". She said she has a deep blue color to her and likes her groceries! She loves to play with her siblings and has puppy energy! Ruby is up to date on vaccines, and will be spayed when age appropriate. She is estimated to be a medium sized dog when fully grown (mom is only 35lbs) *FENCED YARD REQUIRED, MUST OWN YOUR HOME.* To apply to adopt Ruby, go to www.charliescrusaders.org",

Roxy's mom Reesey lived outside on a chain in TN and once the pups were born all of them were surrendered to rescue, thankfully all able to stay together. Roxy's foster mom says Roxy is the sweetest. She loves to give kisses and play with her littermates. She really enjoys being held by foster mom and also enjoys eating. She believes Roxy has a brindle coloring to her. Roxy is up to date on vaccines, and will be spayed when age appropriate. She is estimated to be a medium sized dog when fully grown (mom is only 35lbs) *FENCED YARD REQUIRED, MUST OWN YOUR HOME.* To apply to adopt Roxy, go to www.charliescrusaders.org",

Pictures just dont do me justice because I am much cuter in person; my medium black silky coat has a touch of white on my paws and stomach and when the sun shines on my coat there's a slight brown highlight and my foster mom loves my curly tail. I am a little more rambunctious than my brother Louie and Ill come running with pure excitement when I hear the word SIT because I know that I can earn lots of treats while learning my basic commands. Im also learning how to be gentle while taking my treats and sometimes I just get a little too excited but I AM NOT food aggressive. My foster mom uses training techniques from the TV show Its me or the dog which is positive reinforcement. Im still working on my potty training and I have very few accidents at night in my kennel. While my foster family is away, theyll provide me with plenty of chew toys with treats inside, although I like them I sometimes prefer to play with the other pups and my mom. Im a social girl but I can be reserved at times especially when my foster boy runs around, thats when Ill retreat to my kennel unless I feel like playing and chasing him with my mom. I love playing with other dogs but I havent been around cats yet and I love to cuddle with my humans. Im not huge on barking but will at times when Im engrossed in playing , other than that I pay no attention to the doorbell and it doesnt bother me when we have visitors. Overall I am super cute, a quick learner and ready to find my forever home.",

            "description": "0121062\n\nI need a single family home with a fenced in yard since I require lots of physical and mental stimulation!\n\nMy name is GUCCI Im approximately 2 year old female Boxer mix with short white and black hair; my foster mom isnt sure what I a mixed with but thinks it might be a Basenji because of my curly tail and other features and I recently had two puppies Chanel and Louie that are now ready for adoption. When my foster family first brought me home I was overly rambunctious but with stimulation and lots of walks, Ive settled down quite a bit. Im really good with other dogs and I love to go on walks. I sometimes pull but for the most part I am good on a leash, however if you stand in one place too long I will try and take the leash from your hand, so lets keep walking lol. I can get cold easily so I wouldnt mind wearing a coat during walks. I havent been around cats yet but I love my little 4 year old human! We play catch, hide and seek, tug a war and lots of other games together; for the most part I do well but occasionally I will get so excited that I will bulldoze right through him especially if its a BALL. My little foster boy can also get overly excited and play rough or fall on me and I just keep playing with him. My foster mom loves to watch us play tug a war because I keep encouraging my little man to take the rope from my mouth, I like to initiate play and help him out if he loses his grip. If I could talk, I would tell you that my favorite human is the little boy because we play a lot together. My foster mom has been working on training me but I can be stubborn and I am motivated by treats. I do know sit, lay down and I have selected hearing when it comes to come. I dont know the command for dance but I love to free stand on my hind legs. Initially I would resource guard my food and water but with training and time, I no longer guard my food or water. My foster mother uses training techniques from the TV show Its me or the dog which encourages positive reinforcement. I am kennel trained as well as potty trained but Id love to sleep by your side or one the floor if youll let me. Ill do well in an active home where I can get a lot of attention and with someone who loves to play ball with me. I enjoy chewing on toys with treats but they need to be durable or they simply wont last. If you love BALLS as much as I do then well be perfect for each other!",

Her happiest place is sitting on someones lap. Or curled up on a pillow. She sleeps on her back and cracks us all up with her cute personality. Aubrey is crate trained and is working on her potty training. She is very smart and is easily redirected when told no. She loves kids of all ages and gets along well with other dogs. She will be a fantastic addition to any family.",

Pictures just dont do me justice because I am much cuter in person; my medium black silky coat has a splash of white across my chest and when the sun shines on my coat there's a slight brown highlight and my foster mom loves my curly tail. Im a little more laid back than my sister Chanel but Ill come running when I hear the word SIT because I know I can earn a lot of treats while Im learning my basic commands. Im also learning how to be gentle while taking my treats and sometimes I just get a little too excited but I AM NOT food aggressive. My foster mom uses training techniques from the TV show Its me or the dog which is positive reinforcement. Im still working on my potty training and I have very few accidents at night in my kennel. While my foster family is away, theyll provide me with plenty of chew toys with treats inside, although I like them I sometimes prefer to play with the other pups and my mom. Im a social boy but I can be reserved at times especially when my foster boy runs around, thats when Ill retreat to my kennel unless I feel like playing and chasing him with my mom. I love playing with other dogs but I havent been around cats yet and I love to cuddle with my humans. Im not huge on barking but will at times when Im engrossed in playing , other than that I pay no attention to the doorbell and it doesnt bother me when we have visitors. Overall I am super cute, a quick learner and ready to find my forever home.",

I love to play and my foster mom calls me tenacious. I get along great with kids, other dogs and even cats (although I do try to play with them too). I am learning about potty training and walking on a leash; however I will require a fully fenced yard. I am spayed, current on vaccines and microchipped. My adoption fee is $400. Please note that while I am currently 35lbs., as a Dane mix I will be a large dog when fully grown. In addition, I will require a medical procedure on my eyelids after my 1st birthday. Do you want to be my valentine this February 14th?\n\nTo meet beautiful Opal, please fill out an adoption application located on our website at www.pawprinthearts.com.\n\nPlease NOTE: PPH does not adopt dogs to homes farther than a 1 hour drive from Tampa, FL.",

As a young girl, she's eager to learn the ropes of being a spoiled house dog. \n\n**This dog is heartworm positive and will be treated by the rescue and will be available for foster to adopt for a local family in or near Charleston, SC that is comfortable with the restriction requirements for the duration of treatment.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out an application. We do allow out of state adoptions and any transport costs are at the expense of the adopter. If you have further questions about this dog, please email us at ccradopt@gmail.com and someone will be in touch as soon as possible. Please note we are unable to hold dogs for adopters as this ties up valuable foster homes.\n\nPlease understand that we are an all volunteer group and we have jobs outside of this organization. We do our best to provide quick responses but occasionally they are a little slower. If you do not receive a response in 48 hours, please resend to make sure it's received.",
