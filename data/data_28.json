We would love to find her the perfect home for the holidays!\nAt this point we think she would be best as an only pet, all though she has done well her with some submissive type male dogs, in the long run it might cause issues down the road as she can be territorial. \n\nBaby was an owner surrender. She takes a little while to warm up to strangers and is leash shy if roaming free. Once she gets comfortable with you she's very much glued to your hip. She knows how to sit and lay down but won't do it unless she's super comfortable with you. She was housed with another dog and did fine until a recent move which is why she ended up here. She doesn't seem bothered by any of the dogs here and has been non reactive through the fence. She will need someone with patience and a quiet home to regain confidence in herself. She is 2 years old and 52#.",

She is still in the cone of shame as the paw is slowly healing. She is very good about getting her bandages changed, and she'll need continued care for this wound to heal properly. She is super sweet and cuddly. If Stormy could be for you, please fill out an application today. \n\nThe Animal Rescue Project (www.animalrescueproject.org) is committed to the best possible veterinary care for the pets it rescues and it is looking for adopters who will be similarly committed.\n\nAll dogs and puppies are given a general check-up when they enter our program. They receive medication to remove any intestinal parasites (worms), fleas, and ticks they may have. Dogs greater than six months of age are checked for heartworm. If heartworm positive, the Animal Rescue Project treats the disease. Dogs and pups receive all age-appropriate vaccinations for distemper, and dogs greater than four months of age are also vaccinated for rabies, in compliance with State of Michigan laws. All dogs are also microchipped.\n\nMost dogs and older puppies are spayed or neutered before adoption. In the case of puppies not old enough to be safely sterilized, a $50 deposit is required at the time of adoption and is refunded to the adopter with proof of sterilization.\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project requires every adopter to establish an active relationship with a veterinarian no later than 10 days after adoption. Adopters will receive a plan for routine veterinary care at the time of adoption and are expected to work with their vet to complete the plan.",

            "description": "Hi there! I am very excited to meet you! I am a friendly dog that likes to be touched, I like it so much I will even roll over onto my back for you. I do, however, need some training; I do not know my basic commands and I need to learn how to walk on a leash. I am also a very good bouncer so my future home must be fully enclosed with a fence tall enough to keep me in. I love my toys! I will definitely be needing lots of those in my new home. I like to play fetch and the best part of it is that I bring the toys back and drop them. Unfortunately, I am not perfect. Despite taking treats gently from your hand, I do get possessive over my raw hide and do not appreciate it being taken away from me. Also, please leave my food bowl alone. Now when it comes to dogs I just get so excited seeing one!! I will pull and jump on two feet towards one in an attempt to meet! I am a bit rude meeting other dogs because I don't respect boundaries I suppose. :( So I do believe I need further socialization when it comes to meeting new dogs. Overall, I think I would do great in an adult only, experienced household. If I fit your lifestyle, I hope to meet you soon!",

            "description": "Meet Fred! Fred is the Love Buggiest Fred you'll ever meet. He burps. He sighs and snores like a bulldozer. He sometimes smells. But beneath all that, he is the ultimate lap dog. He wants nothing more than sit in your lap, gaze into your eyes, and give you the sloppiest kiss you've ever received. He gives love eyes. He purrs. He will cuddle with his head on your shoulder. He LOVES food. Like seriously. He. Loves. Food.\n\nFred has a number of health issues that we are treating. He is significantly malnourished and positive for Lyme. Fred\u2019s health is improving every day, and his goofy personality is really starting to shine through.\n\nDuring time in his foster home, Fred has gotten along with two other large dogs after a slow introduction. He has not been around cats or children so we are unsure about his behavior around them. Fred is still working on potty training, especially since he needs to go potty often on his current (and temporary) medications.\n\nFred loves bed time. He hops into his crate, gets a treat, and within 10 minutes he is sawing logs. Fred\u2019s new family will have the opportunity to teach him commands like sit and stay since he hasn\u2019t quite picked them up yet.\n\nIf you want to fully experience the Fred, help Fred with his long recovery, and give him a lifetime home, please submit an adoption application and we can schedule a socially-distanced meet and greet with Fred in his foster's backyard.\n\nFred is getting up-to-date on his vaccinations and is estimated to be between 1-2 years old. He has been neutered and microchipped. Fred is good with other dogs his size after a slow introduction. Unsure of how he would respond to small dogs or cats. Fred has spent time with children as young as three and behaved really well.",

Prefers females and socially appropriate dogs. Cats/Small Animals: Same as above. If you have small dogs you should expect to come meet him with your dogs first before being sent home with him. Children: Suitable in a home with children. Energy Level: Moderate. Likes to play tug and fetch. Food/Object Possession: Shows competitiveness with food and food toys. Please take that into consideration especially if you have other animals in the home. Separation Anxiety: Unsure. Potty Trained: Does not seem to be potty trained. Can be managed though. ***Behavior may change once in a stable home environment. This is a summary of behaviors noticed and tested for during the animals stay at the shelter.*** Chili has been in foster care, this is what his foster dad had to share about him... Sweet boy that just wants snuggles and play. Potty training is in the works but constant attention is needed so he does not go inside the house. He does great in cars, walks and on bike rides. Lots of love to give. He gets a little mouthy while petting but can be easily distracted by toys and things to chew on. He gets very excited around other people and dogs but is very gentle and kind. Separation anxiety is a potential concern hopefully crate training will help.",

            "description": "Jessie unfortunately had to be surrendered to the shelter because his owners because they thought he needed more space than they could provide him with. Their notes on him say that he was great around their 13 year old son, but he was starting to have some problems getting along with their other, smaller dog. Jessie, like most animals surrendered by their owners, is finding the shelter to be very scary and stressful. That fear sometimes causes him to act out. He is very protective of his kennel, and he makes people earn his trust. He really only feels comfortable around the people he sees on a regular basis. Once he trusts you, he's as sweet as can be and he'll happily let you leash him up and take him out for a walk as well as pet himit just takes him awhile to build up to that point with new people. He loves treats, especially beef or bacon favored treats - that's one way to help build trust with him!",

She has some anxiety-driven behavior that she needs help with.  This includes running after her tail, and biting her tail.  This may sound like playful behavior, but for Luna it's actually a way of dispelling her anxiety.  Luna needs to be gently redirected when she displays this behavior, and encouraged to calm down in other ways.  She's looking for a patient and kind person with a calm and quiet house to make her foster home, or even her forever home!\n\n**** If you see a pet posted from us, they are AVAILABLE (we update constantly). Please apply right away as opposed to inquiring about if they are available. You may ask additional questions you need answered if you can't find info in our description!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting and think you can provide a great home for this pet, please complete an online application so that we can better assess if this pet is a good match for you and your family. Once that is complete and we've approved your application, we can set up a time for you to meet your potential companion for life! \n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: www.vida4animals.org/adoption-application/\n\nFor more information on this pet, please see the contact information.\n\nAdopt Responsibly.

            "description": ",Due to COVID-19, all adoptions will be by appointment only. To adopt, complete our online adoption application and an Adoption Counselor will contact you within 48-hours to schedule your adoption appointment. Adoptions for any pets in foster will be completed offsite at our PetSmart Claiborne location on a case by case basis. The safety of our foster parents and community is of utmost importance to us and it will be at the foster's discretion if they'd like to meet at this time. Thank you for choosing adoption! \n\nMeet Midnight! He had a bit of a rough start in life. He was found by an NOPD officer outside of a burning apartment building. He was seen caught amongst large groups of frantic people. He is a very friendly boy who loves affection. The way to his heart is butt scratches and lots of attention. This young pup is very playful and very busy. He has never met a stranger so make an appointment to come meet him today at our Mardi Gras Campus at 1700 Mardi Gras Blvd.\n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

He is dog aggressive so has to be the only pet.  He has not been child or cat tested but is probably best at a home without children and no other pets.  He is lovable, playful, frisky, happy and very handsome.  His adoption donation is $350 which includes his neuter, vaccinations, microchip.  He is heartworm negative and on monthly preventative.  His picture does not do him justice, so please come to meet him to see how good looking and lovable he really is.\nhttp://www.aforeverhomeanimalrescue.org/Project/champagne/ \nWe are only able to adopt within the state of Florida.  \nWe have a page on our website that explains our adoption process, and contains a link to our adoption application.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.KodaBear is a very handsome young Pyr who will be arriving at Old Farm Kennels in Florence, MT on January 30th. This young guy can be the most loving boy ever - but he has a couple of issues that need to be worked on before he can be adopted out. First thing is the boy is going to be neutered on February 5.... but even before that is done he will be worked with about giving up things that he isn't supposed to have.... which is why he is available in the first place.\n\nKodaBear's owner loves him deeply and is very sad to have given him up, but he did bite her when she found him on a countertop with a skillet that she had used to fry hamburger. He does NOT like to give up things that he wants, and when she reached for the skillet he reached for her hand... not good.\n\nOnce that issue is under control this young man will make someone a wonderful buddy. He loves being outdoors and maybe he could learn to provide protection to a hobby farm of some sort. Lots to figure out before this boy will be sent to a new home.\n\nFeel free to stop by Old Farm Kennel and meet KodaBear and the other dogs we have boarded there. Best visiting times are from 10a.m. to 4p.m.",

            "description": "Meet Charlie!\n\nLooking for a small, 23 pound, 9 year old walking buddy? Need a friend to take a road trip with? Want someone who will sleep in his OWN bed? If you answered yes, I might be your guy. I need a safe place to \u201chang up my leash,\u201d if you get my drift. \n\nI just LOVE to go on walks, every day if possible! I would love a quiet home with maybe one other small dog (or I can be your one & only). Bigger dogs stress me out. I don\u2019t need to be cuddled, but I do like to be petted and loved on my terms. I\u2019m sensitive at times, so be careful touching my face, ears, or feet. I need a person who will listen to me when I let them know I don't want to be touched, so kids are a no go for me.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about my favorite subject...food! I absolutely LOVE food; dog food and human food. I\u2019m getting better about this, but I may whine, bark, or beg for your food. Sorry, it\u2019s a bad habit I developed many years ago. Here\u2019s a positive-I love carrots and cucumbers for a snack! Mmmm. \n\nI\u2019ve got some anxiety and have started taking a special medicine, which seems to be helping me relax and enjoy life a bit more. I also take joint supplements, which help me stay active. \n\nIf you think I\u2019m your next buddy, please apply so you can meet me. The name is Charlie!\n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $275.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

We are still learning about this handsome guy, but what we know so far is that he loves his frisbee, and loves attention. If he could be for you, please fill out an application today!\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project (www.animalrescueproject.org) is committed to the best possible veterinary care for the pets it rescues and it is looking for adopters who will be similarly committed.\n\nAll dogs and puppies are given a general check-up when they enter our program. They receive medication to remove any intestinal parasites (worms), fleas, and ticks they may have. Dogs greater than six months of age are checked for heartworm. If heartworm positive, the Animal Rescue Project treats the disease. Dogs and pups receive all age-appropriate vaccinations for distemper, and dogs greater than four months of age are also vaccinated for rabies, in compliance with State of Michigan laws. All dogs are also microchipped.\n\nMost dogs and older puppies are spayed or neutered before adoption. In the case of puppies not old enough to be safely sterilized, a $50 deposit is required at the time of adoption and is refunded to the adopter with proof of sterilization.\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project requires every adopter to establish an active relationship with a veterinarian no later than 10 days after adoption. Adopters will receive a plan for routine veterinary care at the time of adoption and are expected to work with their vet to complete the plan.",

            "description": "\nWhy Choose Me?\n\n*Sugar has $200 in sponsorship for rescue!*\n\nUpdate 12/31: Sugar has been treated for heartworms (received her Diroban shots). She will need to be on crate rest for the next month while the worms die off, but she\u2019s on her way to being healthy! Please wish this sweet girl well while she recovers.\n\nUpdate 12/4: Look at Sugar! She\u2019s come so far, and it\u2019s because she\u2019s been in a home with an amazing foster mom. When Sugar first came to the pound, she hid in the back of her kennel shaking. She didn\u2019t know anything about walking on a leash and had to be carried. Today, she walked easily on a leash and would come to me for pets and treats. Instead of hiding beneath the table, she hopped on it to sit with me. Sugar is still shy, but that\u2019s okay. She\u2019s super sweet and doing well. Her life is so much better. Since she has heartworms, Sugar is only available to rescues or a foster-to-adopt. Hopefully, one day she\u2019ll have her forever home. Being in a foster home has given her that chance.\n\nUpdate 10/16: Sugar is making progress in being more comfortable with people. Unfortunately, she has tested positive for heartworms. While Athenspets & ACCAS will help with the cost of treatment, a rescue should be prepared for some added expense and the exercise restrictions of treatment. To learn more about preventing and treating heartworms, please go to the American Heartworm Society\u2019s website: https://www.heartwormsociety.org/pet-owner-resources\n\nSugar could use some sweet kindness in her life. She\u2019s always lived outside, and when her owners moved, they just left her behind. She had been on her own for so long that it took time to catch her and bring her to the shelter. Sugar is frightened, and when I first met her, she was visibly shaking and her tail was tucked tight. I sat on the bench and waited as she checked out her surroundings. Eventually, she didn\u2019t run when I approached and let me scratch her back and behind her ears. Even though she was uncertain, she never snapped at me. \n\nWhen she finally took treats from me, I felt like she was a little more comfortable though I know it will take time for her to feel safe and at ease. Until that happens, Sugar is only available to rescues. How wonderful it would be for her to be rescued and finally know what it\u2019s like to be cared for and loved.\n\nIf you are interested in rescuing Sugar, call 706-613-3540 to discuss options with staff.\n\nYou can read more about this dog and check out additional photos here: https://athenspets.net/Adoptables/54142-sugar/ OR check out our urgent dogs (http://tinyurl.com/Athenspets-FB-URGENT-Dogs) on Facebook!\n\nThis dog is currently at Athens-Clarke County Animal Control, located at 125 Buddy Christian Way, Athens, GA. For the most timely information on hours, location, availability and how to adopt, call the shelter any day from 10am-4pm at 706-613-3540 or go to https://www.athensclarkecounty.com/133/Animal-Control.\n",

He is a little shy at first as all Dalmatians are. Once he warms up, he loves to give hugs and kisses! He is a fence climber so he will have to have supervised yard time at all times! If this handsome guy could be for you, please fill out an application today!\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project (www.animalrescueproject.org) is committed to the best possible veterinary care for the pets it rescues and it is looking for adopters who will be similarly committed.\n\nAll dogs and puppies are given a general check-up when they enter our program. They receive medication to remove any intestinal parasites (worms), fleas, and ticks they may have. Dogs greater than six months of age are checked for heartworm. If heartworm positive, the Animal Rescue Project treats the disease. Dogs and pups receive all age-appropriate vaccinations for distemper, and dogs greater than four months of age are also vaccinated for rabies, in compliance with State of Michigan laws. All dogs are also microchipped.\n\nMost dogs and older puppies are spayed or neutered before adoption. In the case of puppies not old enough to be safely sterilized, a $50 deposit is required at the time of adoption and is refunded to the adopter with proof of sterilization.\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project requires every adopter to establish an active relationship with a veterinarian no later than 10 days after adoption. Adopters will receive a plan for routine veterinary care at the time of adoption and are expected to work with their vet to complete the plan.",

He is available with the Friends of Glocester Animal Shelter in Rhode Island! \n\nHe was adopted for 3 weeks,  but absolutely refused to get along with the cat in the house.  Butch needs a special home,  and we will be extremely picky about where he goes - he can easily be set up for failure,  and we won't allow that.  Butch is an energetic,  protective,  attention craving,  job seeking, loving boy.  He needs a firm,  but patient person.  He will walk all over you (sometimes literally) if allowed,  but he's very eager to please, and highly trainable. He has learned everything he knows with positive reinforcement and the use of a \"mom voice\".  \n\n**He needs a home with no children,  and no cats but probably best in a home all of his own. His new person/people need to understand that he will never be a super social dog. He's a ladies man,  but will attach to a male in the house over time. \n\nIf you think this big lug sounds like he could fit into your life,  please call and make an appointment to come visit and discuss your plans for his forever home.

His current family loves him dearly, but sadly, they need to re-home him. Please read his bio below and contact his family directly (Katy Daher at katy.daher@gmail.com, 404-272-1500 or Wilson Fish at fishwilson@yahoo.com, 404-964-3068) if you'd like to get more information about Petey and possibly adopt this beautiful boy! \n\nPetey is a loveable, sweet dog who needs a good home. Due to a relocation, Petey went from a house and yard to apartment style living situation which is not working for him.  Petey is neutered and up to date on all his vaccinations. He is house trained and never chews. Petey is full of energy and loves to run and play, but is also a great indoor dog.  He loves to take walks/runs and is a water dog who can swim all day if you let him. He is a little shy at first, but warms up to people very quickly. Petey\u2019s ideal next home is a single dog/animal family.  He gets along very well with his human family and wants to be the center of attention, but can become protective when faced with other dogs and is territorial.  Petey is a healthy, active dog who needs a good yard to run in and a warm lap to lay on.",

I am up to date on all my vaccinations, neuter, and microchip. I also tested Heartworm Negative. Gatsby is such a sweetheart. He doesn't have a mean bone in his body. He is a lover. He wants to be with his person all the time. He is a lapdog and does not wait for an invitation to jump up in your lap. He gets along fine with other dogs and loves a good game of zooming around the backyard with them. He is starting to eat all of his food now but does need encouragement as he is easily distracted. He loves treats too. He is working on potty training but does mark at times. He understands what no means and will stop any bad behavior when told the \"no\" word. I'm sure he would be fine around older, considerate kids. He has seen my cat from another room and joins in with the others at barking at her. He doesn't like the crate and will voice his complaints. He will jump up on the bed, the couch and unfortunately even the table. He needs training. If he could be with a family where there is someone at home with him during the day, that would be ideal. He also likes to sleep in bed with his person but will accept sleeping on the couch if that is an option.",

            "description": "Hi there. My name is Hudson, but my foster mom calls me Huddy or Weirdo, and Im a Powderpuff Chinese Crested. Im not naked because Im sick..Im naked because thats what my breed is likewere all mostly hairless! Youd think that would be a problem up here in the Great White North, but Ive got lots of jackets and pajamas to keep me warmplus, I love, love, love to cuddle under a blanket with my people! Speaking of people.I love them. I love kids. I love ladies. I love men. If youre a two-legger, we can be bestiesbut Im a little bit particular about my dog friends. Im sort of selfish with my toys and chewies, and will growl at any other dog that looks at them, so Id do best either as an only dog, or with a dog that doesnt really mind sharing. If there arent toys or chewies around, I like to play with other dogs. In my current house, I love to chase and bark at the other dogsuntil they turn around, then I realize how big they are and I run away, but I like it when they chase me. I would also do best in a home where I can be left to roam when my humans arent home because I really, really, really dont like kennels. I will scratch myself raw trying to get out. Im really good loose in the house.although, sometimes I do use the bathroom in thereespecially if Im not let out right away in the morning. Im not a fan of going outside in the snow, but my foster mom just puts booties and a jacket on me, and then Ill run through the snow with the big dogs to do my business, no problem. The last thing is that I am an allergy dog. I have indoor and outdoor allergies, but I am currently on a 10 month course of allergy shots that help keep them in check. My foster mom gives me a shot once every couple days, and Im really good about getting them. I dont mind at all. My foster mom keeps my nails cut short so that I cant damage my skin when its itchy, and Im really good about getting them cut too.I just lay on my back and she snip-snip-snips them short. Easy peasy. My foster mom says to tell you that shell miss me a lot, and that whoever gets me has to promise to only use her for dog sitting if you have to go on vacation without me. If she had more room she would 100% keep me, but my foster sisters dont really want a little brother. If youd like to meet me, reach out to Northern Lakes Rescue and we can get together and see if this is a love match! Hudsons adoption fee is $350 which covers his neuter, vaccinations, microchip and any additional medical care he may have needed while in the rescues care. We are a foster based rescue, we do not house dogs at a facility. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website www.northernlakesrescue.org",

Petey's world went sideways when his best two legged friend passed away and Petey ended up in a kill shelter. We couldn't let Petey's life end in that shelter, so we picked Petey up and now he's a Rescue Dogs Rock NYC pup! Petey absolutely loves other dogs of all sizes and he loves playing outside. Petey ignores cats. If you can help us put Petey's life back on track and give him the fantastic home this senior boy deserves, please apply online to adopt Petey (SC) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

If a dog/puppy is still listed on Petfinder- we are still accepting applications for them**\n\nMeister is currently in Houston, TX and can transport to the PNW mid February.\n\nMeister, 2 years old, male, pitbull, 43 lbs. This adorable dog was brought to our attention when he was placed on the euthanasia list in San Antonio, TX. We were able to spring him from the shelter life and are hoping to find his forever home in the PNW. \n\nMeister has been friendly with every dog he has met. He has been in a foster home with both male and female dogs. If the dog does not want to play with him, he leaves them alone. When Meister saw the dog in his foster home his face lit up and his body didn't stop wiggling. We think he would love a four legged friend to have as a companion. He does not seem overly playful and isn't needing an active playmate. \n\nHe is friendly to both females and males and we've seen no aggression, fear or anxiety. We have no history with kids so we recommend a home with kids 10 years and older. \n\nMeister is housebroken, but has had some accidents when first in a home. He has done some marking as well, but we know he is a smart boy & will easily catch on once he's taught! He walks great on a leash. \n\nMeister loves to snuggle, give kisses and lounge around the house. He appears to have low/moderate energy and is not super active. \n\nMeister would make an amazing emotional support animal as he just loves being with his people! Meister does have separation anxiety and has managed to escape from several crates.  In doing so he has several cuts on his face as we believe we squeezed through  or pushed through the door. He has scratched up a door to get out of the room he was in to find his person. He will need someone who is home more than they are away. He will also need a secure crate/area where he can't get out or destroy anything in trying to get out. \nWe would be willing to pay for one training session to help with this behavior with an agreed upon trainer in your area. \n\nWe have no history with cats. \n\nMeister is an incredibly sweet dog who wants to be loved. We are hopeful someone will be willing to help ease his separation anxiety and will be able to see what an amazing dog he is.\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time.\n\nThe first step in our process is filling out an application. We will review your application as soon as we are able- there are two of us and we do the best that we can. We review applications on a first come first serve basis and look for the best fit/match for dog and applicant.\n\nhttps://heartoftheunderdog.org/adoption-application",

            "description": "ID #:  A46300187\nHoss came to the shelter as a lost dog in mid December. At that time, he was pretty skinny.....now he's gained a few pounds, and enjoys being cared for by our staff. His beautiful eyes tend to captivate you, yet try as he might, he continues to be passed up by potential adopters. Hoss is a senior, heartworm positive pitbull. We think he's absolutely gorgeous. Because he was a stray, we do not know how he is in the home (housetrained? kids?) but we do know he likes to chase cats and seems friendly with other dogs as he walks by them. He's also a sucker for a Milkbone! Hoss's fee is waived, because we think a home for our seniors is PRICELESS.\n His heartworm treatment will be covered as well. Hoss is a simple man, with a short wish list:  a home to let him enjoy sniffing around in the yard, time for short walks, and telling him he's a 'good boy'. If this sounds like you, please email us! Or, call 504 736-6111 to make an appointment to meet him.  \n\nAdoption  includes vaccinations, spay/neuter, heartworm test, and microchip.\n*Dogs are pending behavior and other-animal assessment unless otherwise noted here.\n\n\nAvailable for adoption, foster, or rescue at the following location::\n\nJefferson Parish Animal Shelter - Eastbank\n#1 Humane Way, Harahan LA 70123\n504-736-6111\n\nPlease provide ID number when  contacting or visiting the shelter. Thanks!\n\nAdoption application can be downloaded through the link below and emailed to: tstinson@jeffparish.net\n\nhttp://bit.ly/JPASadoptionapp",

Once he gets to know you, he is affectionate and happy.  He should have an owner who is experienced with dogs.  He is motivated by treats and should be easy to train.",

I like to play with other dogs but can be very selective with who I choose to play with. I also tend to be very protective, particularly over my brothers and my space. I also am known to guard my resources (primarily food and water), usually due to a fear that they may be taken away from me. My protective behaviors are most likely due to living in an unstable environment for an extended period of time. I would really benefit from an experienced dog owner who is familiar with working with dogs who lived in difficult situations, thereby creating protective and fearful behaviors. The best fit for me would be an adult-only home without any other animals so that I can truly be the king of the castle. I would love to have a great big yard to run around and play in, but for the most part I think I would enjoy a quiet lifestyle in my new home. I would benefit from continued training to help me learn to be more confident in myself, which should translate to being more confident in my surroundings. I do appear to be potty trained but I have not thoroughly enjoyed learning how to walk on a leash yet, probably because I most likely have never seen a leash until I arrived here on the ranch, so I'm sure with further exposure I will get used to it.",

Annie may be a little older but that means that this girl is already house trained, walks good on a leash and knows come, sit, stay, down and kennel up. She is good with other dogs, trustworthy with free roam, she doesn't bark, dig or chew on anything that she shouldn't and is good in the car. Annie doesn't like to be crated and she would do best in a home with dog door access and someone home more often than not. Due to the recent changes in her life she does get a little unsure and anxious in new situations but her foster family will be working with her to help her gain a little more confidence again. This sweet girl has some medical issues we will be getting her evaluated and helping her get the care she needs. Annie's favorite toys are a squeaky lion and stuffed animals and is happy as a clam to be play with them all day long.\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

First off, I\u2019d like to tell you that I\u2019m a little bit shy when I first meet a stranger\u2026 but give me a few minutes and a stranger you\u2019ll be no more! It\u2019s hard to believe that a beautiful young thang like me would have low self-esteem, but it\u2019s true. I do love the company of other big dogs, but no cats for me! I will adore the attention of respectful and gentle children 8+ as long as they know how to give me space to feel comfortable when needed. My crate training is coming along nicely, and I am eager to learn all of the other things you want to teach me. I just need to find a loving home with patient people who will have the time and compassion to help me come out of my shell and spread my wings. \n\n1 year old-43lbs. My adoption fee is $280 and includes neuter, microchip & registration, reduced-cost training class, free veterinary exam, 1 month pet health insurance, leash/collar, food sample, toy & treat packet.",

He is not trustworthy with free roam but does chew at times when he is bored. He will bark to alert, true to his breed, and will make a loyal guardian for his forever home. This boy is good with dogs, cats and kids. A Good Samaritan helped trap and care for this boy after his original owners dumped him. Toby is reportedly very laid back and is great at listening and cooperating with people. He truly deserves a fresh start with a family as special as he is!\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

            "description": "Beautiful Chiba is a 7 year old Cane Corso Mastiff Mix that came to us from a shelter in Virginia, where she was surrendered by her owner that was moving. Chiba is a very large girl and came to us at least 50 pounds overweight. At one point, she was 80 pounds over! The vet thinks her goal weight is around 100 lbs. Due to the extra weight, Chiba is understandably less mobile and her foster family is working on helping her regain mobility and go on extra walks. Chiba is a friendly and sweet girl and likes to greet people with her little nubbin tail wagging! Her foster family is giving her some time to come out of her shell and she also needs entropion surgery and treatment for tick-borne illnesses, which will be done while she's in foster care. All this girl needs is a retirement home with a warm bed for her and good quality care for her remaining years. Can that be you?\n\nGolden Rewards Program\n\nAll of our adoptable grey muzzled gentle giants who are at least 7 years young are available for adoption for a reduced $250 donation!\n\nAlready a Golden Rewards Club member? If you've adopted a senior gentle giant from Big Dogs Huge Paws in the past, we have great news for you! Adopt a second senior for a Golden Rewards Club adoption donation of $200, and if it's your third senior dog adoption we are offering a special Golden Rewards Club reduced donation of only $150! Why wait?\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

If a dog/puppy is still listed on Petfinder- we are still accepting applications for them**\n\nMeister is currently in Houston, TX and can transport to the PNW mid February.\n\nMeister, 2 years old, male, pitbull, 43 lbs. This adorable dog was brought to our attention when he was placed on the euthanasia list in San Antonio, TX. We were able to spring him from the shelter life and are hoping to find his forever home in the PNW. \n\nMeister has been friendly with every dog he has met. He has been in a foster home with both male and female dogs. If the dog does not want to play with him, he leaves them alone. When Meister saw the dog in his foster home his face lit up and his body didn't stop wiggling. We think he would love a four legged friend to have as a companion. He does not seem overly playful and isn't needing an active playmate. \n\nHe is friendly to both females and males and we've seen no aggression, fear or anxiety. We have no history with kids so we recommend a home with kids 10 years and older. \n\nMeister is housebroken, but has had some accidents when first in a home. He has done some marking as well, but we know he is a smart boy & will easily catch on once he's taught! He walks great on a leash. \n\nMeister loves to snuggle, give kisses and lounge around the house. He appears to have low/moderate energy and is not super active. \n\nMeister would make an amazing emotional support animal as he just loves being with his people! Meister does have separation anxiety and has managed to escape from several crates.  In doing so he has several cuts on his face as we believe we squeezed through  or pushed through the door. He has scratched up a door to get out of the room he was in to find his person. He will need someone who is home more than they are away. He will also need a secure crate/area where he can't get out or destroy anything in trying to get out. \nWe would be willing to pay for one training session to help with this behavior with an agreed upon trainer in your area. \n\nWe have no history with cats. \n\nMeister is an incredibly sweet dog who wants to be loved. We are hopeful someone will be willing to help ease his separation anxiety and will be able to see what an amazing dog he is.\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time.\n\nThe first step in our process is filling out an application. We will review your application as soon as we are able- there are two of us and we do the best that we can. We review applications on a first come first serve basis and look for the best fit/match for dog and applicant.\n\nhttps://heartoftheunderdog.org/adoption-application",

            "description": "COURTESY POST \n16 year old Benjamin Franklin needs a new home.\n\nI very recently rescued a 16 year old beagle from animal control with the intention of keeping him. \nHe was in rough shape when I got him. He had been found hypothermic on the side of the road with a gaping hole in his side and a fair amount of hair loss. \n\nSince then  he has received his shots, heart worm check (-), and antibiotics for his side and ear Infections. He is healing up very nicely. He still has some dry skin but is getting better. He just needs 1 fish oil capsule in his food daily. \n\nBecause it is very possible he has testicular cancer he will be neutered on feb 8th. I\u2019m covering  all of the costs.\n\nHowever what we have determined is that he needs to be in single dog household.  He doesn\u2019t get along with other dogs. \n\nFor interested adopters I will be asking for a veterinarian reference and will be doing a home visit at his potential adopters home.\n\nHis personality:  he is very loving, loves attention and to be petted. He loves walks but does pull some on the leash. He loves to sniff around outside.\nHe is a bit hard of hearing but can see just fine. Even though he isn\u2019t currently neutered he never peed on anything in my home. He loves baths and treats. He even knows how to sit for treats. He loves to be next to his human on the couch or bed. He sleeps quite a bit. \n\nHis name is currently Benjamin Franklin. \n\nPlease contact me at (989) 450-7566 if you have questions or think they can provide him a loving home",

PLEASE DO NOT EMAIL REGARDING FEE OR IF THE DOG IS STILL AVAILABLE**\n\n**We are located in Tulsa, OK. We do not adopt puppies under 4 months out past 150 miles of Jenks, OK. Applications are found on our website at puppyhavenrescue.com**\n\nLola Bunny is a female heeler mix around 7 years old. She and her litter of pups were given up by their owner. Lola Bunny is just a super kind and loving little soul. She has learned so much in her short time with us. She absolutely loves the other dogs and the kids in her foster home. She will go lay down on her bed on command and sleeps through the night on her pet bed. It is believed she was a strictly outside dog before Puppy Haven, but despite that she has had zero accidents in the house.\n\nShe LOVES to chase after and catch tennis balls. She is extremely smart and eager to please. She has learned sit, shake and lay down since being with us. She has this cute quirky little \u201clean in\u201d when she wants pet. She comes up to you, gives her paw and then just flops on you sideways. This girl loves to love!\n\nShe stays in her crate when her foster fam needs to go anywhere and has handled that fine as well. She is leash trained and does great on walks! She is going to make a family very happy. Although it might take her a moment to warm up to someone new since she is learning to trust humans, once she falls for you she is the most loving, sweet dog ever. She has not let her past affect her personality as she definitely has a ton of love she wants to give!",

I am 1.5 year old, spayed Great Pyrenees Mix, who came into rescue with my sister, Biloxi. We were found abandoned behind a local store and were fortunate enough to have a nice lady rescue us and take us home. But now, that nice lady has to give us up because of some health issues...so here we are searching for our next forever home. I mainly have lived outside but am crate trained. I don't do so well with free-roam and do dig and chew when I am bored. I get along nicely with dogs and love children. I haven't lived with cats, so that is unknown. What is known however, is that I am super sweet! I also am very food motivated and will learn quickly with positive reinforcement. If you are ready for a one of a kind type of gal with double letters in her name, I am the one for you!\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

This stunning fellow was surrendered to one of the humane society's we work with due to his owner passing away.\n\nDuke is energetic and enjoys activities where he can burn off some energy while still having your undivided attention. We believe he would do great with a family who has an active lifestyle and tons of love to give. He is a bit of a scaredy-cat when it comes to loud noises, so it doesn't take much to spook him. Duke loves to be included in whatever we do and really enjoys interacting with us. He may go explore the fields for a few minutes but then he comes back to check in with us and to say hi. He likes to make sure you're staying close by. \nThis cutie pie gets cold easily during the colder months and loves to snuggle down in warm, fuzzy blankets before drifting off to sleep. \n\nDuke is so adorable and would be very happy in a home with a loving family and a fun doggie playmate.\n\nDoes handsome Duke sound like the guy for you?",

He is an independent fellow and everyone needs a little ''me'' time sometimes. He was found as a stray, was placed on a ''stray hold'' and when the microchip was scanned our partner shelter contacted the owner several times but never got a response. He's such a great dog and we are happy we could take him in.\n\nTurin loves to explore our fields and soak up all the different scents and visuals surrounding us. He will come back to us for some pets and hugs but then he's off again to explore. He has a chill personality and he likes to relax and sunbathe in his outdoor kennel deck. Even though he is a low-key type of guy, he does have a good amount of energy and is athletic. If he was a person he would be in the NBA with his jumping skills. He for sure could slam dunk!\n\nDoes Turin sound like the companion you've been looking for?",

She is often very laid back, but does get excited and have minor bursts of energy. Callie is very mannerable and rarely has needed redirection. She is fantastic with other dogs, but has chased the resident cats a couple of times playfully. She is 100% house and crate trained and rarely barks. She was fantastic with a small group of people and will likely be great with children due to her gentle demeanor.\nAll SAAP animals are vet checked, UTD on vaccines, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, and given flea and heartworm preventative as age appropriate.\n\nOur website is: http://www.adoptastray.com/\n\nTo check if this animal is still available visit our master pet list on our website at:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/adoptable-animals/\n\nHave questions:\nPlease email us at saap@adoptastray.com for more information about this animal or to answer any questions you may have.

For this reason mama Odie will need a special adopter who is willing to put in some love and work into this mama. She is basically afraid of the world but once she trust you she will cling to you. Mama Odie loves to cuddle up with me now on the couch and will even nudge me for pets. She has a long way to come, but she would love a forever home to do it in. Consider giving this mama a chance\n\nThings Mama Odie will need:\n- lots of time and space to learn you\n- a relaxed home environment\n- peanut butter ( she loves it)\n- a martingale collar ( this will come with her)All SAAP animals are vet checked, UTD on vaccines, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, and given flea and heartworm preventative as age appropriate.\n\nOur website is: http://www.adoptastray.com/\n\nTo check if this animal is still available visit our master pet list on our website at:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/adoptable-animals/\n\nHave questions:\nPlease email us at saap@adoptastray.com for more information about this animal or to answer any questions you may have.

            "description": "Meet my handsome friend, Dogtown!\n\nDogtown is a 72lb boxer/pittie mix that is 2yo. He is the most submissive and empathetic boy. He is excellent with kiddos, tolerant of kitties, and also good with dog friends. Dogtown has some anxiety in new places; he showed it by some pacing and drooling. He is a velcro dog and loves to people please. Dogtown is housebroken and has been perfect in his crate; goes in on his own, no accidents, and silent. He does best in a plastic crate verses a wire crate as it makes him feel more secure and relaxed. Dogtown would be best suited in a home with a confident dog friend that will bring up his confidence and compliment his excessively submissive personality. A yin to his yang if you will ;) He is a loving boy and a joy to have as a guest in my home. Won't you choose him as your new best friend?

Due to the ONGOING INCREASE in COVID-19 cases in JAN 2021 we will be using a SAFE method for placing dogs in their new homes. As new Rescue Huskies are available the following will apply: Adoption Applications MUST be completed and reviewed before we schedule a 'Meet and Greet'. Applications are available by request. We require properly worn masks, gloves and any other PPE you would like to wear. Please do not be offended if we cannot place a husky with you at this point in time. It doesn't reflect on YOU as a pet owner...it's very difficult for us to provide the 'hands on', personal approach we're accustomed to. Have patience with us as we navigate these unusual times! Stay Safe! Thank You for understanding!\n\nInterested in a Rescue dog? Please send an email and/or call 815-439-2313, press (star)* 2 and leave a message. (No calls after 8PM, please!)",

Applications are found on our website at puppyhavenrescue.com**\n\nPhoenix is a female heeler/pyrenees mix. She and her siblings were rescued from TAW. She is the cutest! She is pretty active and loves playing outside and going on walks! When she is tired, she loves to lay down in your lap and take a nice snooze. She is working on potty training outside, but knows to go on a puppy pad for the most part! She does great with other dogs and loves having them around! She sleeps through the night in her crate with her brother with no complaints. Phoenix would make a great addition to a semi-active family!",

PLEASE DO NOT EMAIL REGARDING FEE OR IF THE DOG IS STILL AVAILABLE**\n\n**We are located in Tulsa, OK. We do not adopt puppies under 4 months out past 150 miles of Jenks, OK. Applications are found on our website at puppyhavenrescue.com**\n\nBluford is a male heeler. He was found as a stray and was surrendered to us. He\u2019s full of energy and loves to play all the time. He does really well with the other dog in his foster home! He is very high energy and jumps when he gets really excited. His fosters are working on that but he\u2019s not fully aware of how big he is. We advise against small children because of this. He is potty trained.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t love getting into the crate and sometimes needs a little coaxing, but sleeps through the night just fine once he\u2019s in there. When he\u2019s not playing, he loves chewing on his Kong bones (and he is a heeler so having chew toys is a must!), or snuggling up on the couch. He gives lots of kisses and appreciates lots of pets.\n\nHe is working on leash training. He knows sit and is very treat motivated, so we are starting to work on other commands! He\u2019s a gentle giant who would do really well in an active home or with another dog.",

Don't let his age or size fool you. This good looking senior will win everyone's hearts. Chicharron is a boy that knows what he wants in life and he will happily let you know. Being a senior boy, Chicharron will need a little extra TLC; he does have the beginnings of arthritis, and he's actively being treated for a wound on his elbow. Otherwise, this boy isn't asking for too much...just some good food, a comfy bed, some tasty treats, and someone who wants to just hang out with him on a leisurely walk, or a long nap by the couch. Are you ready to offer Chicharron your undivided attention? Then make a phone appointment to speak with an adoption counselor. He'll be waiting.

Applications are found on our website at puppyhavenrescue.com**\n\nTaz is a male heeler mix. He and his siblings were given up by their owner. Taz is a sweet, loving, playful, rough and tumble little ball of puppy. He loves to be held and walked around like a true baby, but he also enjoys his independence. He sleeps well in his kennel and plays well in his playpen. He sleeps a lot right now since he is so young, but is very active when he is awake. He is good about using the piddle pads and is just now being introduced to the outdoors. He shares his food well with his brother. Nuzzling is a favorite of his as well as giving kisses.",

If that could be with you, please fill out an application today! \n\nThe Animal Rescue Project (www.animalrescueproject.org) is committed to the best possible veterinary care for the pets it rescues and it is looking for adopters who will be similarly committed.\n\nAll dogs and puppies are given a general check-up when they enter our program. They receive medication to remove any intestinal parasites (worms), fleas, and ticks they may have. Dogs greater than six months of age are checked for heartworm. If heartworm positive, the Animal Rescue Project treats the disease. Dogs and pups receive all age-appropriate vaccinations for distemper, and dogs greater than four months of age are also vaccinated for rabies, in compliance with State of Michigan laws. All dogs are also microchipped.\n\nMost dogs and older puppies are spayed or neutered before adoption. In the case of puppies not old enough to be safely sterilized, a $50 deposit is required at the time of adoption and is refunded to the adopter with proof of sterilization.\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project requires every adopter to establish an active relationship with a veterinarian no later than 10 days after adoption. Adopters will receive a plan for routine veterinary care at the time of adoption and are expected to work with their vet to complete the plan.",

            "description": "This handsome guy is going to make someone a wonderful new family member. Comet will win you over quickly when he bats his baby blues. We think he is a smooth collie mix. He is two years old and weighs in at 63 pounds but the vet tells us he could lose a few pounds. He is a very friendly boy. His former owners only had him for two weeks before they decided they didn't have enough time for him. They didn't even give him a chance!\n\nComet loves to run and play so a fully fenced yard is important. He will be a good walking or running partner for his new family as well.\n\nHe seems to be dog friendly so he would have fun with another canine family member. Of course, we will do meet and greets if an applicant has a dog to be sure they are a good fit. We have cat tested Comet and unfortunately he did not pass. So needs a home with no cats.\n\nSo, if you think Comet is the perfect new family member for you, come meet him on Saturdays from 10-2 at 809 Rockford Rd SW. He looks forward to visitors. If you are interested, we urge you to fill out an application prior to your visit.\n\n",

She was born in the rescue and recently returned due to no fault of her own! Paddy is a super sweet girl who just wants love and attention! She is almost completely potty trained and will let you know when she needs to go out! She sleeps in a crate at night and sleeps through night. She has been good with other dogs, but needs work through food aggression. She does need an adjustment period to figure out where she is in the pack, but is generally pretty submissive in meeting new dogs! She does need a firm owner, as she likes to push the boundaries.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Hi my name is Stella! I'm a very sweet and laid back, 2.5-year-old girl.\nI was found as a stray so my background is unknown. I can be a bit shy at first meeting, but get over it fairly quickly. A few weeks after arriving at my foster home I had 4 seizures the day after I was spayed. We are not sure what triggered them but I am now on medication and have had no issues since. I actually look forward to taking my medication because my foster mom wraps it in cheese - and what dog doesn't LOVE cheese?!\n\nI am still working on my manners. I did a little counter surfing and dumpster (trash can) diving for the first few days but I have been working on this and have only dove into the can once since then - it just all smells so good. I know some basic commands like sit and lay-down. I'm housebroken and mostly crate-trained. It takes me a few minutes to settle, but eventually I do. My foster family says I really no longer need the crate and that I am a really good girl when they are away. I just play with my fur sister and lay at the door until they get back. I play well with other dogs and my fur sister and I have lots of fun together. We do play little ruff at times, but love each other. My bark can be a little loud (high) when playing as I do get excited. I also love playing fetch but what German Shepherd doesn't?! I walk great on a leash and am very good in the car.\n\nI do not get on the furniture and actually prefer to lay on the floor. Loud noises (beeping sounds, motorcycles, loud trucks and snoring) can make me pace if too loud - especially the loud snoring, which my foster mom says isn't too bad when she gets the room to herself with just the dogs haha. I like meeting new people and will bond quickly with my family! I have only been around one child and it wasn't for long but I seemed ok.\n\nI have been around cats, but to me they are just indoor squirrels, so I try to chase them. Once I get used to a space and people, I am a great companion and will follow you anywhere!\nIdeally, I want a backyard with a buddy to play with.\n\nI am being fostered near Raleigh.\nIf you think you can offer me my furever home, please reach out to your adoption coordinator. If you do not have an adoption coordinator, please complete an adoption application at www.freedomgermanshepherdrescue.org",

            "description": "Duncan John, Duncan John, Duncan John...what a fine guy you are! \n\nDuncan John, although very loved by his young family in TN, they could no longer afford to keep him so he was surrendered to a shelter. According to shelter records he lived with children ages 6 and 8, but we haven't had him officially \"\"kid tested\"\" yet. He completely ignored the cats in their kennels during his cat test at the shelter, so he may get along with cats, but we cant be positive about that! With his intelligence, sweet demeanor, and good looks Duncan John quickly became a shelter favorite. \n\nNow he is ready to find his forever home! At 4 years old he is the perfect age- no longer a puppy but still his entire life left! He gets along well with other dogs, but does play a little rough sometimes so he needs a dog of equal energy level and understanding. He is crate trained and working hard on house training. He still pulls on a leash but with basic obedience training we expect him to do well. Duncan John loves to be loved on and gives the most gentle kisses. \n\nYou know you need a Duncan John in your life so get your application in today!\n\n\nName: Duncan John\nBreed: Pit Bull Terrier mix\nSex: Male\nAge: 4 years old\nWeight: 54 pounds\nSpayed/Neutered: No\nVaccinations: Up to date\nHeartworm: Negative\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nBASED ON OUR OBSERVATIONS: \nGood with Children: Has lived with children before but has not been around children in our care. \nGood with Dogs: Yes\nGood with Cats: Unknown\n\nAdoption Fee: $475.00\n\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION:\nInterested in a specific dog, please fill out an application if you are interested in a dog. The number of individual inquiries is overwhelming and we are finding it difficult to respond to each one. We cannot guarantee you will receive a timely response.\n\nPaws New England is a rescue, not a shelter, and as such we do not have our dogs housed in one location - they are in foster homes both in New England and in our southern foster homes. If you're interested in a specific dog, please complete a short online application and you will receive a reply within 48 hours so you can ask questions.\n\nAt present, if a dog is listed on our website, the dog is considered still available HOWEVER, may have applications that have come in before yours but it's still too early to know if any are a good match; therefore we encourage you to apply.\n\n\nNOTICE WITH REGARD TO LOCATION OF DOGS: Please note: Paws New England is a foster-based rescue. We do not have a brick and mortar building to house the dogs we rescue. We have found that dogs in foster homes are much more adoptable because they have been observed in a home setting. Dogs listed with Paws New England typically reside in various locations throughout the south (primarily Tennessee, Texas, and Arkansas) and New England (not necessarily in the state of Rhode Island). You will be notified by the adoption coordinator of the location of the dog you are interested in so you have the ability to decide whether to pursue adoption or not.\n\nDogs transported to New England are done so at a fee of $150.00 paid directly to the transporting company by Paws New England; no additional transport costs are responsibility of adopter. This fee is included in the adoption donation.\n\nAdoption donations cover pre-adoption vet costs (including vaccinations, spay/neuter when age appropriate, and heartworm testing/treatment when necessary), a microchip, and transportation to New England if necessary.\n\nDonations for our young, healthy puppies and dogs support their fellow canines of advanced age or suffering from injuries and abuse whose donations are reduced but whose veterinary costs are typically much higher. We appreciate your understanding that your dog will help others in need.\n\nAll known information about the animal is listed above. We do our best to give accurate information, but most of our dogs are rescues and do not come with a known history.\n\nPaws New England abides by the dog importation regulations set forth in the states of MA, CT, NH and RI.",

PLEASE DO NOT EMAIL REGARDING FEE OR IF THE DOG IS STILL AVAILABLE**\n\n**We are located in Tulsa, OK. We do not adopt puppies under 4 months out past 150 miles of Jenks, OK. Applications are found on our website at puppyhavenrescue.com**\n\nKatie is a precious 11 month old lab. Katie was adopted out early in 2020 and returned a few months ago. We haven\u2019t introduced her until now because Katie was returned due to a medical issue that we wanted to first understand.\n\nKatie accidentally ingested raisins in her last home and was not seen by the vet in an urgent manner. This resulted in Katie going into renal failure as just a puppy.\n\nWhile Katie does have special needs because of this, the vet has given her an 8-10 year life span and her condition is very manageable. She needs to be on a strict diet to help her kidneys for the rest of her life, but she isn\u2019t on any medication at this time. Katie does drink an excessive amount of water due to the condition, so she needs to go out to potty multiple times throughout the day, more so than a regular dog would. Katie does not have any leaking and while she can hold her bladder throughout the night, her ideal home would have someone that is home most of the day to let her out when needed.\n\nKatie may need to go back on meds in the future as she gets older, but we don\u2019t know that for sure. Due to her young age, a lot of factors are unknown. What is known is that Katie is more than worth it for the right family.\n\nKatie is very special. Her entire body wiggles with joy every time you come home, or when she\u2019s getting extra loving. She loves to play with other dogs, both big and small, and know to be gentle around the smaller ones. Katie is smart, and wants to please. She loves working on commands and goes straight to her crate for dinner waiting patiently. She will sleep in her crate but prefers to be close to her humans.\n\nThis sweetheart just wants to be loved, and will stop everything for some belly rubs. She loves everyone she meets and is excellent with kids but will also alert you when strangers ring the door. If you are looking for a pet who will love you unconditionally, and show it every single day, Katie is your girl!",

Katie does not have any leaking and while she can hold her bladder throughout the night, her ideal home would have someone that is home most of the day to let her out when needed.\n\nKatie may need to go back on meds in the future as she gets older, but we don\u2019t know that for sure. Due to her young age, a lot of factors are unknown. What is known is that Katie is more than worth it for the right family.",

We will form a line like usual based on who has an active and approved application in. We will go through our line to set up a private meet and greet for potential adopters to foster.\n307-739-1881\nadopt@animaladoptioncenter.org\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/42994530730154\n\nElanor\n2 year old, female, Shepherd mix\nHOLY EARS! Elanor is a perky gal looking for a new start. Unfortunately she and her little dog family had to be surrendered at the shelter in Riverton when her humans lost their housing and couldn't keep her. This girl has been very loved in the past and is just looking for a new start. She has lived with other dogs and cats and we are told that she has spent time around kids and done well. She is a gorgeous md/lg size and will make an excellent partner for all your outdoor adventures and indoor snuggle sessions. \n\nPlease note, Animal Adoption Center cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have no history prior to them entering the rescue. We make every effort to ensure the dogs are healthy.\n\nPlease know that our intention is to insure long lasting committed homes for the animals at the AAC. If we feel that an animal and a potential owner are not a good fit we reserve the right to refuse adoption.\n\n-For more info on this pet, to fill out an adoption application, and find out who we are and more our adoption process, please go to our website www.animaladoptioncenter.org  \n-We require potential adopters to foster a dog for at least one night prior to adopting once they have an approved application submitted.\n-We welcome out-of-area adopters, but please be aware we do require prospective adopters to come to our facility and meet the animal in person. You may either foster the dog locally in pet friendly lodging (preferably with any other dogs you own) or if you choose to drive the dog back home you agree to drive the dog back to Jackson if the dog isn't a good fit. Before you make the trip we encourage you to fill out an adoption application and submit it, to be sure you will qualify to adopt. Adoption applications can be filled out on our website. We cannot \"hold\" any animal. We have a \"first qualified adopter can foster first\" policy. \n-We will not ship animals. \n-Feel free to send over an inquiry or fill out an application for a dog you are interested in!\n\nPlease note, Animal Adoption Center cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have no history prior to them entering the rescue. We make every effort to ensure the dogs are healthy.\n\nPlease know that our intention is to insure long lasting committed homes for the animals at the AAC. If we feel that an animal and a potential owner are not a good fit we reserve the right to refuse adoption.",

She loves young children and will seek them out to play with her, though she sometimes jumps up to get their attention (we're still working on that). She loves to explore during walks and is an adventurous little girl. She enjoys playing with other dogs and would do best in a home with a fur companion to look up to. Nippie is intelligent and learns routine, schedules, and expectations quickly\n\nNippie has been spay, received an update on her yearly vaccinations, de-wormed and kept on her monthly preventatives.\n\nApplications should be submitted at socorescue.com",

PLEASE DO NOT EMAIL REGARDING FEE, AGE, OR IF THE DOG IS STILL AVAILABLE**\n\n**We are located in Tulsa, OK. We do not adopt puppies under 4 months out past 150 miles of Jenks, OK. Applications are found on our website at puppyhavenrescue.com**\n\nCherokee is a male Aussie mix around 10 months old. He was recently returned to us due to no fault of his own. Cherokee is the sweetest, loyal, lovable dog. He weighs about 70 pounds, and has the softest, prettiest brown fur that accompanies his beautiful green eyes. He is energetic and playful, but also can be chill and rest right by your side. He loves to go on walks, chase squirrels, and loves playing with other dogs. Playing fetch is one of his favorite things to do, and he also loves to chew on bones. He is a busy boy who loves to be your shadow and follow you everywhere you go. He loves car rides and playing at the dog park, but also loves cuddling in bed. He is very strong and is sure to beat you when playing tug of war!\n\nCherokee has had a few aggressive tendencies that are currently being worked through with a trainer. Because of this he would do best in a home with older children and experienced dog owners. He would do best with owners who are active, and would thrive in a home with other dogs who he can play with. He is crate trained, but prefers to be cozy on the couch and sleep on a dog bed. He has a lot of love to give, and is sure to bring joy to whoever adopts him!\n\nMessage us through the contact page or on Facebook to learn more about Cherokee!",

Apple herself is 2 years old and about 48 pounds full grown. Apples foster family has nothing but wonderful things to share about this gorgeous Hound Mix. She can be timid around new people, but when she gets to know you she is incredibly sweet. She is smart, and picks up new tricks in just a couple of days (as long as you have a treat handy ). While being an excellent mom to her puppies shes worked on her housebreaking, learned sit, and has improved on her recall skills. She is still a bit skittish with sudden noises or movements but is comforted by affection from humans. Apple was very skinny when we pulled her from the shelter so shes still working on filling in her frame! She is extremely athletic and would make a great jogging buddy. She can climb and jump very high with those long legs of her. Apple prefers to be around her humans and does howl and cry when left. She is working on her crate training and separation anxiety, and would prefer a home where people are more around to love on her! Apple is wonderful with other playful dogs and always loves to hang out to play with them. We are currently looking for an adopter or foster to adopt home for Apple with another dog to play with! She is so snuggly and loving and can\u2019t wait to share all her love in a forever home!\n\nWe are currently facilitating safe adoptions with COVID-19 protocols and adopt out to NYC and surrounding states only - NY CT PA & NJ. \n\n**If a dog is listed on petfinder as available then we are still accepting applications for that dog. We urge you to apply as soon as possible to be considered to adopt the dog you\u2019re interested **\n\nThank you for wanting to give one of our adoptables a loving home!

They are doing great in a foster home. They are good with other dogs, use the pet door and love their toys.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please complete an online application at www.cvrr.us\nDue to high demand we anticipate multiple applications for each dog. Our volunteers will review each submitted application, then contact the top 3 most appropriate ones by either email or phone. Calling or emailing us to see if you are being considered will not expedite the process. If you have been selected for an interview we will contact you within 48 hours of submission. Thanks for your patience.\n\nMany of our dogs can be seen at Petsmart in Visalia on Saturdays between 10 and 3.Update: until restrictions are lifted we are unable to take dogs to PetSmart.",

She\nis a 1.5 year old Chihuahua mix who weighs 13.9 pounds and is full grown.\nBecause she was trapped as a stray, Latte will be slow to warm up. She is okay with kids, although she would prefer older, dog savvy children. Once she comes out of her shell, Latte is an incredibly loving and energetic dog! She will need to be in a patient home with a family willing to work with her in several areas. Latte will need help in breaking a bad chewing habit. She loves to play with toys, and would do best in a home with a family who can spend lots of time playing with her. Latte is good with other dogs and would like to be in a home with at least one other energetic canine companion to help keep her occupied. Other than playing with toys and other dogs, Latte likes to nap, and she is more than happy to hang out close to her humans while they're working. Unfortunately, Latte doesn't walk well on a leash, so she will need leash training and a securely fenced in backyard in her forever home.\nShe is spayed, up to date on vaccines, microchipped and vet checked. Her adoption fee of $200 includes a complimentary vet visit. To potentially adopt, please contact her foster mom at\npennig@cox.net",

He is good with other small dogs, cats and kids.\n\nDewey is a 1 yr old, 5 pound female Chihuahua who is very sweet but super fearful until she knows you. She is super snuggly and does well with older children.\n\nMalcolm and Dewey are both housebroken and sleep through the night. They are very loving but a bit stunned by their sudden change in circumstances. They just want to find a home together where they can live out the rest of their days feeling safe and loved. Dewey very much looks to Malcolm for security and protection.\n\nBoth are altered and UTD on shots. They are being fostered in Racine, Wisc and their adoption fee is $650 for both which includes micro-chipping.\n\nIf you feel you could give these two sweethearts the loving hone they so deserve, please fill out an application at https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/BPWI/Dog\n\nDATCP #494550",

I'm housetrained, tolerant of baths and grooming, and crate trained! I am dog choosy, but we can always have a meet and greet to see if things work out! Cats are fun for me to chase and play with, so if you have a skittish kitty I may not be the pupper for you. I\u2019ve been spayed, made up to date on all necessary vaccines, microchipped, and tested negative for heartworm. I weigh 55 lbs and have an adoption fee of $310. We are first come first serve, so if you\u2019re interested, you can visit me at CHS in the Sternburg Dog Run. We are open from 12 to 6 PM, Tuesdays through Saturdays, and process our last adoption at 5:30 PM. If you have any dogs currently, a meet and greet is required to make sure we get along. Please make sure they are up to date on their rabies and distemper vaccine as we require that proof before a meet and greet. See you soon!",

Ace had spend most of his time in his previous home outside and did not get the attention he craves and deserves so he is making up for lost time. He started off so scared and unsure of his new environment and has gained confidence out on his walks, in playgroup and during cuddle time in our enrichment room. He is still a little tentative meeting new people so give this guy time to get to know you and of course good treats help to melt his fear away. He grew up with kids and was a little much for kids under 2, and he may thrive in a home that can focus and devote more time to him. Ace is looking for a devoted family to continue his training and boost his confidence around new people and things and he will reward you by sharing his radiant heart with you!\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about ace, please contact the behavioral team at kheadlee@wenatcheehumane.org with information on your current living situation and a phone number.",

She was surrendered from her home in Lassen County due to the owner being unable to care for her breed type. What we have seen here is that Maggie is very timid at first, often hiding from the people she meets. However, once the leash is in your hand and connected to her, she warms up very quickly and craves affection. She is a high energy dog, as her breeds suggest, so she will do best in a home with someone who is looking to train their dog on all the cool tricks, or possibly even an agility course. She is smart and gets along with everything, so she will fit right into a high energy home who can provide her with the space she and exercise she needs. If you are interested in Maggie, please fill out an application at www.highsierraanimalrescue.org. We do not discuss potential adoptions without an already submitted application.",

I lived in a house before so I know all this cool stuff like only going potty outside, how to sit, stay and shake! I may need a quicker refresher but I am always so eager to learn! I'm definitely an outdoorsy kid, I love to go camping and playing in the water.. maybe we can find a hike with a river, that seems fun doesn't it!? I would love to have a home where I have room to run around, and I wouldnt mind have another pup to share my space with! Sometimes I forget how big I am, so I'd prefer kids slightly older and would love to meet your pups here first so we can see if we're a match. If I sound like the dreamboat doggie for you, please make an appointment with the main shelter to visit me! \n\nAAWL recommends kids ELEMENTARY+\nAAWL thinks I am SOCIAL with dogs\nAAWL thinks I am a WEEKEND ATHLETE \nAAWL does not know how I am with cats at this time \n\nhttps://aawl.org/content/appointment-based-adoptions\n\nI'm Beemer's Buddy!

He is good with other small dogs, cats and kids.\n\nDewey is a 1 yr old, 5 pound female Chihuahua who is very sweet but super fearful until she knows you. She is super snuggly and does well with older children.\n\nMalcolm and Dewey are both housebroken and sleep through the night. They are very loving but a bit stunned by their sudden change in circumstances. They just want to find a home together where they can live out the rest of their days feeling safe and loved. Dewey very much looks to Malcolm for security and protection.\n\nBoth are altered and UTD on shots. They are being fostered in Racine, Wisc and their adoption fee is $650 for both which includes micro-chipping.\n\nIf you feel you could give these two sweethearts the loving hone they so deserve, please fill out an application at https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/BPWI/Dog\n\nDATCP #494550",

The word stranger doesn't exist to me! I like to greet new people with a big ole smile that shows all my teefs, and my adorable underbite! Dogs make me nervous, so I would prefer to be your only love bug! Also, cats really resemble squirrels to me.. and I really love squirrels! Did I mention I'm potty trained and crate trained?? I'm an easy pup! My perfect family would have no dogs, no cats, and kids 5 years and older! I currently live in an apartment with my foster mom, and she says I would be great in an apartment or house!",

Chuck is a very friendly puppy that enjoys playtime and walks great on a leash.  He calms down easily and is learning commands.  He \"sits\" easily and gets very happy when he gets a treat.  He appears to have been around children and doesn't jump on them.  Chuck is a nice pup that deserves a good home where he can continue to prove how smart he is.  His adoption fee is $80.  This will cover his neuter and vaccinations.  Call for an appt to meet Chuck.  972-675-9662.",

Looking for humans willing to rear nothing short of a legend. Big boy in little body. \n\nAnimals can be viewed by appointment only. We ask that you review our adoption information AND fill out an adoption application prior to setting an appointment so we have all your information and you understand our adoption procedures - you can do so online here.     \n\nPlease feel free to email us or call us anytime for additional information on any of our animals - info@mcprescue.org or 312-388-3928. Our typical adoption fee varies based on the age of the dog at the time of rescue: Under the age of 1 years old is $500; 1-5 years old is $400; over the age of 5 is $300. Fees include vaccinations, microchip, deworming and other vetting as needed. Our adoption process includes an application, reference check and home visit.",

Old soul, social gal looking to complete someone\u2019s family. She\u2019s a gem.\n\nAnimals can be viewed by appointment only. We ask that you review our adoption information AND fill out an adoption application prior to setting an appointment so we have all your information and you understand our adoption procedures - you can do so online here.     \n\nPlease feel free to email us or call us anytime for additional information on any of our animals - info@mcprescue.org or 312-388-3928. Our typical adoption fee varies based on the age of the dog at the time of rescue: Under the age of 1 years old is $500; 1-5 years old is $400; over the age of 5 is $300. Fees include vaccinations, microchip, deworming and other vetting as needed. Our adoption process includes an application, reference check and home visit.",

When I say charm, I mean the trail of water that is behind me when I drink and the food crumbs that lead you to me. But, you know, that is what makes me me-Perkunas-the Baltic God of thunder. When I bay when I'm excited, it does sound deep, but I wouldn't quite say thunder. And, believe me, when you come home, I am soooooooooooooooo excited to see you. One of the few times I get super excited is when you let me out of my crate. Other than that, I'm pretty mellow. Though, I want to be your shadow- an 80 plus pound shadow, so I'm a wee bit noticeable. Barely, noticeable - especially when I'm in bed cuddling with you. And boy do I like to cuddle and be loved on. Currently, I live in a home with dogs 13 pounds up to my size. Haven't quite learned how to play with my buddies, even though I'm only about a year and a half. In general, I'm pretty low key and only moderate energy. I do need a bit of training, but nothing too shabby and I'm still learning my toilet manners, but that won't take long. Mostly just love on me, let me chew on my toys, and let me be your very best friend in the whole world! Oh, lastly, I do have those pesky heart,worms, but that is being treated and won't take me long to be back at full health!\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online. http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\nNote: Some apartments and neighborhoods have breed restrictions. Please ensure you understand those restrictions prior to choosing a dog. We verify rental policies and adhere to any restrictions.",

I recently relocated to the Pacific  NW after I got separated from my owners during the California wildfires. I am  very calm and quiet. I don\u2019t have much to say so I hardly bark, although I have  been known to snore. I am fully house trained and have been working on my  crate training, occasionally am even spotted hanging out in there for a quick  snooze. My foster family tells me how polite and smart I am, I always sit when  they ask and we have been learning some cool new tricks during our free time. I  am extremely affectionate and love to sit right at your feet, whether you  are working or watching TV. But I also understand that I can\u2019t always be  near you and will quietly hang out in my own space while you are  tending to other responsibilities. I\u2019ll admit, I do get anxious around other dogs  and cats are much too fun to chase, so I need a home where I\u2019m the only  four-legged pet. My foster home has been working with a trainer to help understand my  discomfort around other dogs, so we are focusing our training within the boundaries of our own backyard so I can give them my full attention. Walks outside of our yard tend to be overwhelming, so I will need an adopter that has a securely fenced yard, preferably not see through, so I can  continue my training and work towards building up my comfort level so that we can  have enjoyable walks through our neighborhood in the future. I am a sensitive gal and  need an understanding adopter who will enjoy our life together at home, as I may  never be an outdoorsy kind of gal. I believe in being kind, polite, and  respectful, and I promise I will stay that way with you! I would be content to just  quietly sit in the same room with you and bonus if there is a comfy place to  sleep. Of course, a good neck scratch or some peanut butter is always welcome too.  And if you\u2019re really feeling generous, I like to stay warm and toasty, so I\u2019d happily strut my stuff in a cozy sweater. I know with patience I\u2019ll find  my perfect home, and my people describe me as very deserving of that. If  you want to see more pictures and videos of me, check out my Instagram  page, @bella_the_lil_piggy \n \nYour future best friend,\nBella\n\nIf you are interested in meeting or learning more about BELLA please email OUR FOSTER TEAM\n\n?9 years old-58lbs. My adoption fee is $180 and includes microchip, spay, reduced-cost training class, 1 month pet health insurance, free veterinary exam, leash/collar, food sample, toy & treat packet.",

            "description": "Rolo. Terrier. 37lbs. 11 months old. Dogs.\n\nRolo is a southern gentleman. He is the most sweet. The most charming. The most handsome. He seems to have experienced some unkind things in his young life as he\u2019s a little head shy and weary of new people. Rolo is the quiet type and -I want to love you so badly- type. He absolutely LOVES dogs and comes to life with other dogs. Rolo is looking for a Forever home with another social dog to run the world with. This kid is a keeper, heart seeker, mind reader. \n\nAnimals can be viewed by appointment only. We ask that you review our adoption information AND fill out an adoption application prior to setting an appointment so we have all your information and you understand our adoption procedures - you can do so online here.     \n\nPlease feel free to email us or call us anytime for additional information on any of our animals - info@mcprescue.org or 312-388-3928. Our typical adoption fee varies based on the age of the dog at the time of rescue: Under the age of 1 years old is $500; 1-5 years old is $400; over the age of 5 is $300. Fees include vaccinations, microchip, deworming and other vetting as needed. Our adoption process includes an application, reference check and home visit.",

He was annoyed if anything that he -had to take it easy for several days- post surgery. If you think this slowed this character down at all, you need to meet him so you understand the depth of healing powers his energy carries and and the infiltration his love has on everything surrounding him. \n\nAnimals can be viewed by appointment only. We ask that you review our adoption information AND fill out an adoption application prior to setting an appointment so we have all your information and you understand our adoption procedures - you can do so online here.     \n\nPlease feel free to email us or call us anytime for additional information on any of our animals - info@mcprescue.org or 312-388-3928. Our typical adoption fee varies based on the age of the dog at the time of rescue: Under the age of 1 years old is $500; 1-5 years old is $400; over the age of 5 is $300. Fees include vaccinations, microchip, deworming and other vetting as needed. Our adoption process includes an application, reference check and home visit.",

He came to us from animal control, skin and bones! Now he is healthy, happy and ready for his forever home! He loves attention and so far has gotten along with every dog he meets! He can be a bit rambunctious and play too rough which might not be good with a dominant dog. He can be aggravating . He is housebroken and so far has done well in the house. He does not like going outside to potty by himself so he will require company on potty breaks to assure he actually goes. All our animals receive professional veterinary attention including spay/neuter, testing, vaccination, deworming, food and shelter.

Luckily, with hospitalization, they\u2019ve all made a great recovery! Talkie is the only female and she is the one in the first photo. Dumpy is the one laying down by a food bowl and is a male. Droopy is the more black puppy and is a male. They are looking for separate homes of their own with owners who will help them grow up to be good canine citizens by enrolling them in obedience classes. We were told they are Boxer/Pitbull mixes. Current animals in the home must be spayed/neutered, vaccinated, and on monthly heartworm prevention. NO EXCEPTIONS. These pups will be spayed/neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, dewormed, and started on preventatives before leaving our care.

He is a\nhappy boy and a true LAP DOG!   He is happy to be your one and only love but\nif you have another dog, he prefers calm female companions.   He enjoys\nwalking on a leash and riding in the car. He does not like to be left alone!\nHis previous owner adopted him from the shelter but brought him to us\nbecause his large dog did not take to Dusty and was afraid he would harm\nhim.   We adopted him out but he was returned after 10 months when his owner\nlost her house. He unfortunately had spent his days outdoors and was only\nallowed to sleep inside at night. This is a NO NO! He is an INDOOR ONLY dog!\nHe does enjoy playing ball! He definitely likes to cuddle with his person.\nPerfect for a family and especially retired folks, someone that can commit\nto him FOREVER!   He puts up with cats but doesn't really like them. He is\nhousetrained and will let you know he needs to go potty. He is neutered,\nmicrochipped and up to date on vaccinations.

She's good with my dogs she gets growly with big dogs. She's good with kids 8 yrs old on up. She is good with cats also but does like to chase them. She struggles with potty issues. Mostly peeing but it on occasion she has had a poopy incident also. It will take lots of patience! But overall she is one of the most affectionate dogs I've had the pleasure to foster \n\nApplication online at our website www.hearts4paws.org",

He has done doggie daycare and made lots of friends, so wants a dog companion near his size and age to live with in his forever home! He is a little shy when meeting new people, but he is friendly and would be okay with older/calm children. He does need people that will respect his space while he is eating, and help to continue socializing and training him. A fenced in yard to explore will be best, Jazz has been a little bit of an escape artist so this is for his safety!\n\nJazz's adoption fee is $250 and includes his neuter, microchip and current vaccinations plus a free obedience class at Cedar Run Pet Boarding & Daycare in Hiawatha. Last Hope requires that all animals be altered, current on their vaccinations and preventatives and be kept as indoor pets only. Our adoption process includes reference and background checks, a vet check and a home visit.",

            "description": "Meet Smeagle!\n\nThis boy just arrived to us from our shelter partner in Arkansas.   \nHe is a friendly social boy that does well with other dogs.   He is a typical low energy easy senior dog.   So if you are looking for calm companionship consider Smeagle\n\nOur vet looked at him and is guess he is between 10 and 13yrs old.\nHe has an old ear hematoma that healed on it's own which is why he has one shriveled ear.  He has some hair loss on his back end that they think is from flea dermatitis from awhile ago.  He is flea free now so she thinks his hair will grow back with good nutrition and consistent flea prevention.  \nHis teeth are pretty worn down and may be causing him some pain.   We have been giving him softened kibble and wet food. \nShe noticed he has some sensitivity in his hips.  \n\nYou can see from this video he likes his ear scratched: https://youtu.be/Va8Fa1J3V1A\n\nHe is up to date on vaccines and rabies.  His neuter is scheduled for next week.\n\nHe is at a foster home in Griffith, IN if you would like to meet him fill out the application below\n\n**We do offer a Senior for Senior program.  If you are 65 and older and adopt a pet 7 years and older the adoption fee is 1/2 price.  $75 for Smeagle\n\n\nAdoption Process:\n\n- please fill out our adoption application: https://www.dayofthedogs.org/adoption-application\n\n- one of our team members will get back to you. \n\n- our dogs can be seen by appointment only after an approved application has been received.\n\n- Adoption fee helps to cover spay/neuter, initial vaccines, rabies, initial worming, and microchip.\n\n-We cannot place holds on our dogs. Please do not contact us until you are prepared to adopt.\n\nNOTE:  We are very good about updating the pet's profiles once adopted.  So no need to write us to ask \"Is he/she still available?\"  If the post is up, the dog is still available. \n\nAbout Us:\nDay of the Dogs is a 501c3 nonprofit that is dedicated to helping shelters increase live release.  We coordinate 2 - 4 transports per month from TX, OK and AR to NW Indiana/Chicagoland area.  We do direct adoptions ourselves out of Dyer, IN area and partner with 12 other rescues and shelters in both IL and IN that are willing to help southern pets in need.   \nWe rely on donations to help fund our ongoing transports.  Please donate if you can.  Every dollar adds up and we are grateful for any help we can get: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/DayoftheDogs\n",

Although he did previously live with another dog, Zero can be a bit selective with certain dogs he meets. He is very friendly towards all people though, and just seems to want constant love and attention! Since Zero is heartworm positive, his activity level would need to be limited for a while. He would make a great companion for an owner that likes to go for walks, but then will cuddle up on the couch at the end of the day.\n\n*Heartworm Positive*\n\nIf interested in adopting Zero, please submit an online adoption application!

These girls came to us in the worst condition, severe mange and skin infection from fleas and overall lack of care. \n\nRoxy's condition had zero affect on her energy level however, as she loves to play and run as long as you let her. You wouldn't know it from her skeptical, side-eye glances at the camera, but you can't keep her from smiling when shes playing or cuddling up to you. As long as you have a Milkbone in your pocket you're her BFF no matter who you are. Roxy's new home will need a nice fenced back yard where she can run and explore. Roxy is crate trained and graduated from basic obedience class where she was a class favorite.",

He loves everyone he meets; humans and pups! He does like to play hard so roommates of any species will need to be sturdy and confident enough to handle him. He loves to wrestle and do zoomies with his dog pals, and would love a large fenced in yard to run in! He would not do well in small homes or apartments; this big boy needs plenty of room to romp around! He still needs some help with basic training, like not jumping to say hello, proper leash walking, and is mastering potty training. Luckily he is food motivated and eager to learn!\n\nKey Notes:\n-2-year old neutered male.\n-Unknown breed mix.\n-70 pounds and a healthy weight.\n-Found as a stray in South Carolina.\n-No apartment style or small homes. A large fenced-in yard is ideal.\n-Has not been around kids yet, but should not live with any younger than 12.\n-Good with sturdy and playful dogs; very playful and a little pushy.\n-No more than 6 hours alone a day; will need a potty and play break.\n-Experience with dogs recommended.\n-Medium-high energy; loves lots of playtime but will snuggle when his energy is burnt.\n-Almost housebroken.\n-Very strong on leash; better with a no-pull harness.\n-Food motivated; knows \"sit\".\n-Jumps on people to greet and playfully.\n-Basic obedience training recommended.\n\n--THE ADOPTION PROCESS--\nIf you are interested in adopting this animal, please submit an online application. Applications will be reviewed as received. If in our opinion a pet is a good candidate for you, an adoption\u00a0counselor will contact you to schedule a zoom chat. If you do not hear from us it simply means either the animal has been adopted or we have not received the right pet for you. The application process is at no charge to you and only needs to be completed once as all applications will be kept on file.\n\nOnline applications can be found here: www.buddydoghs.com/forms\n\nCheck out our FAQ for answers to most questions here: www.buddydoghs.com/faq\n\nAdopters must be at least 21 years of age and a Massachusetts resident.",

The Arkansas shelter staff said she does the \"doggy smile\" \n\nShe is at a foster home in Dyer, IN with 5 other dogs.  Foster mom says \" She gets along great with our tribe, including the cat.  She likes to run like a fool outside, chases toys.  She loves to snuggle too.  A really good girl\"\n\nShe loves loves loves playing with toys.  She will also play fetch.\nShe is really personable.   Foster described her like a puppy because she plays all the time.\n\nShe also knows how to \"sit\"\n\nShe is 4yrs old, 12lbs, up to date on vaccines, rabies, has a microchip.  \n\nAdoption Process:\n\n- please fill out our adoption application: https://www.dayofthedogs.org/adoption-application\n\n- one of our team members will get back to you. \n\n- our dogs can be seen by appointment only after an approved application has been received.\n\n- Adoption fee helps to cover her spay, initial vaccines, rabies, initial worming, and microchip.\n\n-We cannot place holds on our dogs. Please do not contact us until you are prepared to adopt.\n\nNOTE:  We are very good about updating the pet's profiles once adopted.  So no need to write us to ask \"Is he/she still available?\"  If the post is up, the dog is still available. \n\nAbout Us:\nDay of the Dogs is a 501c3 nonprofit that is dedicated to helping shelters increase live release.  We coordinate 2 - 4 transports per month from TX, OK and AR to NW Indiana/Chicagoland area.  We do direct adoptions ourselves out of Dyer, IN area and partner with 12 other rescues and shelters in both IL and IN that are willing to help southern pets in need.   \nWe rely on donations to help fund our ongoing transports.  Please donate if you can.  Every dollar adds up and we are grateful for any help we can get: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/DayoftheDogs\n",

She even gets along great with our 2, 65# shepherds.\n\nInterested in meeting Daphne? \n\nAll Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue dogs are in homes with foster families; we do not have a shelter where dogs are available for daily viewing.\n\nOur process is as follows:\n1.  Review our policies and adoption radius  on our website: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n2.  Submit an application for review and approval;\n3.  MPM Rescue reviews application and checks vet records and references;\n4.  MPM foster contacts approved applicant(s) to arrange a home check and meeting with available dog(s);\n5.   If there is a good fit, adoption is completed with a contract and fees (payable via check or cash).\n\nThe adoption fee is listed here: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n\nDogs from Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Age appropriate vaccinations\n- Heartworm test (for dogs over 6mo) and treatment if positive\n- Microchip\n- Deworming\n- Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\n- Any other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\n*Please note that the identified breed(s) are best guesses. We very rarely have information on our dogs' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays.*",

I've made a couple doggie friends here at the shelter so I'd love to meet your pups here first so I can see if we're a match! I just love getting attention from humans so much that sometimes I forget my manners, so maybe kids a tiny bit older may be best for me! I like to spend my days outside sniffing or going on walks, and I heard going on adventures on the weekends is so much fun.. camping, hiking trails, and discovering sights to see all sound perfect to me! Training will guarantee I become the best pup out there and will even help us build a bond! I can hardly wait to meet you, so if you think we're a match, please make an appointment using the Main location matchmaker to come visit me!\n\nhttps://aawl.org/content/appointment-based-adoptions\n\nAAWL suggests I go home with ELEMENTARY+ kids\nAAWL thinks I am SOCIAL with other dogs\nAAWL thinks I am a WEEKEND ATHLETE\n\nI'm Beemer's Buddy!

Review our policies and adoption radius  on our website: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n2.  Submit an application for review and approval;\n3.  MPM Rescue reviews application and checks vet records and references;\n4.  MPM foster contacts approved applicant(s) to arrange a home check and meeting with available dog(s);\n5.   If there is a good fit, adoption is completed with a contract and fees (payable via check or cash).\n\nThe adoption fee is listed here: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n\nDogs from Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Age appropriate vaccinations\n- Heartworm test (for dogs over 6mo) and treatment if positive\n- Microchip\n- Deworming\n- Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\n- Any other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\n*Please note that the identified breed(s) are best guesses.

She will chase cats but mainly to play.  She will need a person or family that can giver her plenty of exercise and attention.  She will also need a secure fenced yard as she is able to jump/climb easily out of 4 foot chain link fencing.  To adopt call 208-512-3401 and tell them you saw this dog on petfinder.com. Thanks for looking!",

While it takes her a moment to warm up in new situations, once she's settled in, she's as sweet as can be. She is easy to handle on leash and rides well in the car. Jakova is house trained and crated trained in her current foster home. She is kid friendly and, while she isn't a super snuggly dog, she does like attention. She has medium energy and the stamina to go for 3 mile jogs with her foster dad in her foster home. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting Jakova, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application. If you have any questions email us at doginfo@labsandmore.org or call us at 858-273-5386. Thank you for looking to a rescue group to fulfill your dream of adding a new dog to your life!

She is sweet and happy as can be, but is not house trained and will need manners training.  Her foster mom is working on these things and she is showing improvement daily. She is good with kids and other dogs.  She does  have a prey drive and will chase cats and other small animals. To adopt call 208-512-3401 and tell them you saw this dog on petfinder.com.

She came to us with nails so long they curled over, covered in fleas. She has been kept in a cage most of her life and if not in a cage, roaming the neighborhood streets or locked in a garage. She would get reprimanded and hit for peeing and pooping in her cage, yet was never let out to go potty. According to her foster mom, she is fully potty trained and even goes to the door to tell you she needs to go. She has not had one mistake yet! She has some healed wounds on her face, chest and forehead, of unknown origin, but we can only imagine how she got them.\n\nBailey has gotten a taste of the good life, and she loves it! Bailey would love to go to a home with children and another dog(s) - she's even great with cats. She loves family life and free life outside of her cage. Her foster family has chickens and farm animals and she does not chase or go after them at all. Bailey loves car rides and the moment you open your door, she'll hop right in! Her front paws turn out and the vet says that is a common birth defect but that doesn't stop her! We would like Bailey to go to a calm home where there is no yelling and tension, as that makes her very nervous, given her upbringing. She was left alone most of her life and we never want that again for this sweet girl.\n\nIf you are ready to open up your heart to 25lbs of pure love please visit www.MaxxandMe.org to complete an adoption application.\n\nBailey is spayed, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped. Her adoption donation is only $250! As with all puppies adopted through Maxx & Me, her adopter will need to commit to continue working with a positive reinforcement trainer of their choice to help her continue to become a well mannered and confident girl.\n\nMaxx & Me is an all volunteer, all foster home rescue and do not have a shelter. Please allow at least 48 hours for applications to be processed (missing information may slow the process, so please take your time and be thoughtful in your answers). All dogs posted are available (so no need to ask). We place dogs based on best home for each dog and not order of applications received. Email us at maxxandmerescue@gmail.com for updates and questions. Thank you for choosing rescue.",

He\u2019s doing well learning commands of \u201csit\u201d and \u201chere\u201d and easily goes into his crate when directed. He\u2019s learning to play well with other dogs. Loves to sit close to his people. He\u2019s a sweetheart!\n\nInterested in meeting Jordy? \n\nAll Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue dogs are in homes with foster families; we do not have a shelter where dogs are available for daily viewing.\n\nOur process is as follows:\n1.  Review our policies and adoption radius  on our website: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n2.  Submit an application for review and approval;\n3.  MPM Rescue reviews application and checks vet records and references;\n4.  MPM foster contacts approved applicant(s) to arrange a home check and meeting with available dog(s);\n5.   If there is a good fit, adoption is completed with a contract and fees (payable via check or cash).\n\nThe adoption fee is listed here: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n\nDogs from Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Age appropriate vaccinations\n- Heartworm test (for dogs over 6mo) and treatment if positive\n- Microchip\n- Deworming\n- Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\n- Any other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\n*Please note that the identified breed(s) are best guesses. We very rarely have information on our dogs' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays.*",

            "description": "Romy is a one year old white shepherd husky mix.  He loves to be busy and would run for hours with you if you wanted him to. He can be entertained while playing with his Kong or a bone and won\u2019t chew inappropriate things if you give him an ample supply of things he can chew on. He loves a plastic bottle with frozen treats in it that he can open and destroy while he\u2019s outside! He\u2019s still earning his space in the house and isn\u2019t left unattended in a room where there are things he\u2019ll be tempted to chew.  He is not aggressive and is crate trained and house trained. Amazingly loud noises like thunder and fireworks barely take his notice. He does ok with other dogs, but is persistent and needs help learning when to take a play break. Does fairly well on a leash. Cats are a mystery and I wouldn't recommend for families with real little kids as he has no boundaries, but again he's not aggressive. He requires a fully fenced yard and a family with lots of love to offer.  He needs someone to help him learn to be calm and greet people without jumping or mouthing people\u2019s hands. He's up to date on all his shots, heartworm and flea meds, he's neutered.  If you are seriously interested in Romy, please go to www.pawswithpride.org and complete our online application. His adoption fee is $150.00  We will get back to you asap. We DO NOT adopt out of the State of Ohio!",

My ID number is 336798\n\nI am available for adoption; however due to my breed my adoption will have to be facilitated through a rescue organization. Please see the front desk staff or contact the Shelter at (248) 858-1070 for more information.\n\nMeet Daisy! Beautiful Daisy, has had a rough start to 2021. She spent the last 3 months in a home, where she was very cared for. Daisy was so excited to be in her new home, that she would get wiggly and jumpy. She is house trained, does amazing with children, does well with other dogs, and is an exuberant girl. Daisy is deserving of a home where she can learn lots of new things, be included in all the goings on and be loved for her lifetime!\n\nThe following descriptions describe behaviors that were observed during testing and/or veterinary examination: Evaluated for temperament with 336985 (male), and 336940 (female). Did well with both. She was very wiggly with male. She is a previous quarantine dog, bit owner when he was letting her outside. She is very high energy, jumps on people, and can be nippy when overstimulated. Suspect that is what prompted \"bite\" 1/27/2021\n\nAmerican Pit Bulls are a misunderstood breed; for this reason, we implore adopters to these beautiful dogs to be very vigilant in training and socialization. This breed is very energetic and will need daily exercise. Because of their strength and energy, apartment living may not be the best fit. This breed can be loving, loyal and very smart. \n\nThe above behaviors and personality traits have been observed while at the Shelter. If this animal was relinquished, information is gathered from the owner regarding behavior. Our wonderful volunteers spend time with these animals and give input on behaviors and traits. However, this description may not be all inclusive to how this animal will act in a loving forever home. Introduction to established family pets should be slow and monitored always. The same goes for children and other family members. Adopting a pet is a big decision and should be thoughtful. We suggest researching different breeds to match traits and personalities to your lifestyle. When adopting a pet, please know that this pet will be with you for their lifetime; patience and consistency will make for a successful adoption.\n\nThis dog has bitten or scratched in the past. The Shelter staff feel as though it was an accident; the dog was playing and it just got a little out of hand and a bite or scratch happened. In this case the Shelter strongly recommends training and socializing this dog so that an accident will be prevented in the future. Teaching the dog not to jump when excited or playing will go a long way in preventing this from happening again.\n\n Primary Color: Grey Secondary Color: White Weight: 56.6lbs Age: 1yrs 0mths 3wks Animal has been Spayed",

Please see the front desk staff or contact the Shelter for more information. \n\nMeet Roger! Looking for an active new friend? Roger is a fantastic boy, who is excited about life and people! He is a happy boy, and that is evidenced, by his quick, wagging tail. Roger enjoyed meeting his other canine shelter friends, and was playful with them. He is hoping that an active new owner, one dedicated to his continued training, will come forward and swoop him right up. Roger will thrive in a home with adult children. This handsome stud, deserves to be in a loving home where he is secure and well cared for!\n\nThe following descriptions describe behaviors that were observed during testing and/or veterinary examination: Evaluated for temperament with 336798, 336940 (females), and 336619 (male). Did very well with all. He is a very playful/exuberant young dog. He may be too rambunctious for older dogs. Training now would be very beneficial for him 1/27/2021\n\nThis muscular dog needs space and exercise as well as training and socialization. This will help keep their territorial instincts controlled. The adopter of this beautiful breed will need to know that if not trained and socialized, this dog could become too much. In the right forever home, this dog will flourish into a big lap dog who will be loyal to the family and may have quite the personality.\n\nThe above behaviors and personality traits have been observed while at the Shelter.

            "description": "COURTSEY LISTING\nHi friends, my name is Cinnamon. I am a 6 year old Red nose Pitbull (female). I am a huge love bug who enjoys being around adults and kids! I have grown up around children my whole life, and love to snuggle with anyone who will give me love. I am a huge couch potato and have to be around someone to feel safe and loved. I act like a puppy sometimes, full of excitement and love adventures. I enjoy hiking, car rides, sun bathing in the sun, and chew toys! I am highly motivated by food and know a few commands. I try my best not to jump up on to people, but I can't always contain myself. I am a HUGE licker and snuggle bug. \n\nI've lived with the same family my whole life. I love them and they love me but my family has to move to a place that won't allow me to come along. My mom is hoping to find someone that might let me crash with them for a little while (maybe 12-14 months) while she looks for a new home where we can all be together again. I have a 5 year old human sister who I have grown up with and mom just had another baby sister who is less than a month old. My mom is a Marine Veteran so she is dedicated to me and getting me back home with her the future. Mom is hoping to find someone that will help take care of me until we can all be together again someday and our new friends at K9 Kismet have agreed to help.  If you'd like to meet up please reach out to the folks at K9 Kismet and they will make it happen.\nK9 Kismet Adoption Application-https://k9kismet.org/forms/ \n\nMe in a nutshell:\n\nLikes: Chew toys (loves stuffed animals), food/treats, car rides, hiking, and being around people in general.\n\nBehavior: Grew up with a husky and is comfortable around other dogs, but needs to be introduced slowly. She likes to be queen bee and can be dominant. She has been known to bark and react to to other dogs who have lunged or showed aggression toward her. She is most comfortable around calm and older dogs. Has never been introduced to cats, but does extremely well around children especially when they are climbing all over her. \nExtremely scared of fireworks or other loud noises.\n\nSkills: Knows basic commands (sit, stay, come, go lay down), house trained, pulls on walks at first due to excitement but walks by your side once calm, does well with grooming.\n\nMedical: Has sunburn scabs on her nose (has had them since she was about 1 year old), not allergic to anything as far as we know, has a few chipped teeth from chewing toys/bones but that does not seem to cause her any discomfort.\n\nCinnamon is currently living in Victorville, CA. and is looking look for a temporary foster (12-14 months) or forever home in Los Angeles, Orange County, San Bernardino County, Riverside County or surrounding areas. \n",

            "description": "Hello!  Thank you for checking out McMullen's listing.  Please read carefully for details on our adoption process:\n\u2022First, please note that we are unable to receive correspondence through Petfinder\u2019s system.  Any messages sent through Petfinder or any buttons on this listing will unfortunately not reach us. If you\u2019re interested in adopting please visit www.sanctuaryrescue.com and submit an adoption questionnaire under the forms section.\n\u2022 Applications for puppies are open for two to three days in order to give ample opportunity to prospective adopters. At the end of this 48-72 hour period we will change the adoption listing to \u201cApplications Closed\u201d. At this point we will begin reviewing all applications received. Next, foster parents will contact approved applicants to set up a meet and greet. This can take up to 1 to 2 weeks.\n\u2022 Once a dog is officially adopted we will remove its listing from Petfinder. So if this listing is gone, this dog has found its forever family and is no longer available.\n\u2022 Since Covid lockdown orders, we have seen a massive increase in people interested in adopting dogs (yay!). This means each dog, especially puppies, receive multiple applications in the couple of days we have applications open. There is usually several applicants for one puppy. If it doesn\u2019t work out this time, please understand this is not a personal judgement but likely a result of supply and demand. We encourage you to reapply in the future.\n\nThis lucky pup landed in the lap of Sanctuary Rescue with five siblings We are estimating them to be about nine weeks old. We never met mom or dad so breed and size is a pure guess. We estimate they'll be in the 40-50 pound range when full grown. These pups spend their time wrestling with the siblings, lounging around the house, playing tug and just enjoying some good old puppy fun. These pups are well socialized and love everyone they meet. They are young enough to learn about cats.\n\nFoster mom says: \"McMullen loves to carry a toy, enjoys wrestling with his brother and is a big fan of meeting new people.\"\n\nMcMullen's adoption fee is $295, which includes age-appropriate vaccinations, neuter, and microchip. If you would like to make this handsome pup a part of your family, please visit sanctuaryrescue.com and complete an adoption questionnaire under the \u201cForms\u201d tab.",

            "description": "Cassie came to us from a shelter in TJ, where she had been kept in a kennel for more than 6 months, and she wasn't properly socialized as a puppy.  Once Cassie knows you, she is extremely loyal, gentle and sweet.  But, until then, she won't come too close.  She seems to prefer females to males (and that's usually due to past mistreatment), and it's something that can be remedied by the right male.  Cassie is affectionate and enjoys getting attention.  She doesn't have a mean bone in her body.  However, she needs to go to a quiet home (no children under 14), a home that appreciates her incredible disposition and is willing to walk her every day and spend time with her.  Cassie listens well, and hasn't had an accident in the house in days. Because of her gentle nature, she is probably good with cat (but we don't know for sure).  \n\nCassie is 2.5 years old, about 35 pounds, and has recently been spayed (that's why she has the cone on in her picture).  She has received all her shots, has been given deworm and flea medication.  If you would like to meet her in La Mesa, please email me and I'll send you an application (no calls please).",

(If a dog is sponsored or has a waived or lower fee, that info will be provided at the point of adoption to the approved adopter).\nThe first step is to our Adoption Application here: https://elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html .\nIMPORTANT - we respond to your emailed applications and queries via email back to you.

This sweet girl is a bit on the shy and timid side, but she is learning to trust and is doing very well in her foster home. Snuggles is learning to walk on leash, but it is a work in progress. Sweet Snuggles needs another young and confident dog in her forever home to help her to gain her confidence. Since Snuggles is working on her leash training she will need a home with a fenced-in yard. Snuggles forever home should have someone at home a good portion of the day to continue her training, even after COVID. Due to Snuggles being shy and unsure, if there are children in her forever home they should be dog savvy and 10 years and up. Snuggles is not suited to apartment/condo living. Snuggles is doing well with her house training, does well in her crate, will be spayed this week, is up-to-date on vaccines and preventatives and eager to find a family to love!\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $350 which includes routine vetting and spay/neuter.\n\n***Please note that our first step is submitting an application (it does not commit you in any way but allows us to discuss with you if you and the dog are a good fit). In addition, an important step in approving adoption applicants is to complete a vet check. Vetting of current and past pets is very important to us, thus we will be speaking with the vet(s) listed on your application to ensure that your current and previous pet(s) are kept up to date on vaccines (including rabies), spayed or neutered, maintained on appropriate monthly preventatives and examined annually by your vet.***\n\nIf you would like to meet Ally , please fill out our online application by clicking HERE and then email Kim at KLarimerLovepaws@gmail.com\n\n****If you are viewing this on PETFINDER or other venues, please go to our website at www.lovepawspg.org to complete an application****",

I have energy for days and need a fenced in yard so I can run it off! I love to go on adventures in the car too! I haven\u2019t had any issues with other dogs and would do best with older kids. I could live with cats if they are dog savvy and we do slow intros! I have mastered crate training but am still working on house training. Forget winning big with the lottery... I want to win big with my forever home! \n\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

Oscar loves other dogs and is completely house trained and, as all Dachshunds do, loves a comfy couch.  He likes long walks and loves to say hi to everyone he meets.  Oscar\u2019s foster can\u2019t say enough great things about him.  He loves cuddles from his humans.  He is an awesome guy!!  He has had a dental, been neutered, and up to date on all his vaccinations - now all he needs is an amazing home that will love him forever -   If you are that family please fill out an application at\n\nwww.lowridersofthewest.org\n\nOscar is being fostered in Casper, Wyoming.\n",

We are working on getting this kid healthy and feeling good!\n\nWe\u2019ve got you Reggie.  Reggie has already been to the vet and had full bloodwork and x-rays done.  He got a long massaging bath on his first night along with a hair cut and can finally begin to heal.

Raine has low vision and hearing but she can still hear you call her name and she can follow you inside or outside.  She gets along with all humans young and old (but only older respectful kids please, she's just 8 pounds) and she is fine with large and small dogs.  She is not much of a barker and sleeps peacefully in her crate at night. \nRaine has recently been spayed and had a hernia repair and a complete dental.  She has had senior bloodwork which shows she has a strong heart with no murmurs.   Raine doesn't seem to be totally housetrained but x-rays show no underlying issues.  She keeps her crate clean at night.     \nSpecial needs dogs are special indeed and small dogs have many years of love to give.  If this is where your heart lies, apply for Raine at www.pounddogfounddog.org.",

Here at the shelter, Pepper loves going on walks and receiving lots of treats! Pepper's adoption fee is $130. She is spayed and microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. To meet Pepper or to be added to her waitlist, call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the DOG'S NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A GOOD PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org. A scheduler will call you back within 48 hours to confirm your request. If you have other dogs at home, tell the scheduler you would like to bring them along for a Meet n' Greet. SFAS offers a variety of excellent training classes, seminars and Trainer Talks led by animal behavior professionals. These are $50 off for animals adopted from any shelter or rescue group! Due to current COVID-19 restrictions, classes and talks are all presented virtually using Zoom.

This just means he is a dog that needs to be able to get a LOT of exercise and if he doesn't get it he will get himself in trouble like he did chasing cattle. We were told by his previous owner that he is housetrained, crate-trained, good with other dogs, cats and children. He loves to play fetch, loves to RUN and is one big goofball!\nDOG ADOPTION FEE is $100. This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more. (If a dog is sponsored or has a waived or lower fee, that info will be provided at the point of adoption to the approved adopter).\nThe first step is to our Adoption Application here: https://elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html .\nIMPORTANT - we respond to your emailed applications and queries via email back to you.

Crate training is no problem for this guy, he sleeps 3-4 hours quietly in another room when you need to go out. You want to take him on family vacations? No problem, he walks well on a leash, is potty trained, and loves to be carried like a floppy baby. Be prepared for some love nibbles and a warm lap, because he can't get enough human attention. Who needs two eyes anyway! Jerry lives for adventure, confidently bounding through the forest picking up all the sticks, leaves, and pinecones carefully, not a care in the world. His endless energy outwits even the most difficult of walking paths, using his keen sense of smell and awareness to direct you back on the correct trail. He loves to remind you that multiple eyes are overrated anyway, it's more fun to wink good day to everyone you meet. Good with small and large dogs, Jerry has great manners and knows when to respect another dog's space, but playing for hours with willing participants. Don't pick up a toy and expect to put it away without him noticing! His indoor world revolves around nylabones, soft squeaky plushies, frisbees, and anything that you will let him have. Watch in amazement as he pounces on frisbee after frisbee, limbs flailing. He is also self-entertaining, throwing his toys in the air and catching them for his own amusement. To complement his responsible manner with other dogs and on the trails, Jerry is careful not to rip his prized possessions with his exceptionally soft mouth. He has captured many hearts with his incredibly good nature. If you would love a cuddle sesh and a wink, let him capture yours and get your application today!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

Cedrick very much enjoys treats and cuddles, and would be so grateful to find a warm home where he can rest in peace on a soft bed or carpet.\n\nIf you've been thinking about adopting a senior dog that would be so grateful for a chance at living in a home and getting away from the noise and commotion of a shelter, then Cedrick might be the one for you. He's currently in a foster home, so if you'd like to visit him, just let us know so we can arrange for him to meet you!",

He loves, loves affection and is very excited to go for walks. He found himself back at the shelter after he bit a young child for taking a ball away from him. His previous owner said he is very possessive of balls and toys, so Floyd needs a family that understands this and willing to work with him. Because of his bite history with a child, a home with no children is a must. If you think Floyd is a good fit for your home, fill out the online application and call the shelter to schedule a meet at 609-265-5073 ext. 4.",

Rusty came from a home in which he lived with his dog mom and dad as well as his litter mates. Unfortunately, Rusty was the runt of the crew and he was consistently picked on, making it not a safe home for him. Because of that, Rusty does take some time to warm up to people, but after a couple minutes is very accepting of pets. He will do best in a home where he is the only dog due to his past experiences. Other than that, Rusty is fairly easy going, although he does enjoy walks, so he would be very content with a yard, some walks, and some couch time at the end of the day. If you are interested in meeting Rusty, please fill out an application at www.highsierraanimalrescue.org. We do not discuss potential adoptions without an already submitted application.",

            "description": "Woof, woof!  My name is Brandy and I am an adorable beagle-mix puppy that needs to find a new place to live. (I am a mixed-breed girl with maybe a 'hint' of beagle... I don't know for sure.) I was born on November 24, 2020 in a shelter in the Carolinas.  I spent a few weeks in a foster home before making my way up to New Jersey with my mom, Buttermilk, and my 7 siblings.  I have been with Penny Angels Beagle Rescue for more than a month.  All of my siblings have been adopted into their forever homes, and my mom has a home waiting for her after she gets spayed.\n\nI was recently spayed and can now start searching for a family that will love me.  I weigh 9.5 lbs. and will weigh more than 25 lbs. when I am full-grown.  I never met my dad and don\u2019t know anything about him.  I have received 2 sets of puppy vaccinations and will need to receive 1-2 more sets of puppy vaccinations (1 month apart) as per your vet\u2019s recommendations.  When I am old enough, you will need to bring me back to your vet for my rabies vaccination and anything else that I might need.  It is important to keep me up-to-date with my vaccinations and veterinary visits.  Since I am newly spayed, I should wear an e-collar to prevent me from chewing at my sutures.  My activity level will need to be restricted for approx. 7-10 days after my surgery to give my body time to heal.\n\nI will need help with house-training in my new home; using a crate is one way to house-train me.  A crate is also a safe place for me to relax when you are not able to watch me.  At my age, I will need to potty approx. every 2 hours, but that time will increase as I get older and as you work with me.  Don\u2019t leave me outside by myself, (and only take me outside for short periods of time in this cold weather).  If you decide to use pee-pads inside, you will have to teach me how to use them the right way.\n\nSince I am still a puppy, I should be watched at all times when I am not crated so that I don\u2019t get into any trouble.  Most puppies have a curious nature, so please be patient with me as you teach me right from wrong, (in a firm but gentle way).  Safe puppy toys will keep me occupied but I sure do hope that you will want to spend time with me.  I get along well with my siblings and would be fine with other dogs.  I can sometimes be quite vocal but that is just because I have a lot to say.  Do you have room in your heart and home for me?  Adopting a puppy is a lifetime commitment, so please adopt me ONLY IF you are willing to make that commitment!  \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Brandy, please fill out an application and submit it to Penny Angels Beagle Rescue.  Brandy\u2019s adoption fee is $400, cash or check.  The application is available at www.pennyangelsbeaglerescue.com.  If your application is approved, you will be contacted via email or phone and an appointment will be scheduled (on a Saturday) for your adoption at PetSmart in Mays Landing, NJ.  Please wear a mask and follow social distancing guidelines.  If you have any questions, contact beagler534@comcast.net or emnase@aol.com, or call Penny Angels Beagle Rescue at 609-965-9476. Thank you!\n",

            "description": "Hey everyone! My name is Spud and I'm an 8 year old, 14lbs Chihuahua. \n\n- I was brought into the emergency room after getting hit by a car and was going to be euthanized until one of the vet tech's saw me and introduced me to the HIT Living Foundation. I was completely paralyzed from the waist down, and with the help of incredible vets, a very generous medical sponsor and my wonderful foster mama, I was able to regain full mobility in my legs!!! \n\n- That being said, I will need daily PT done by my adopter for about 10-15mins a day, to be able to maintain mobility in my legs. \n\n- I am a happy little gentleman. I am very alert and curious but also a little couch potato. \n\n- Even though I am very independent and enjoy to be on my own bed, I also LOVE cuddles. Especially, ear scratches!!\n\n- My favorite things to do are sun bathing, playing with chew toys (so much so that I like to chew them until they are destroyed...oops), and ear scratches of course!\n\n- Apart from my medical needs (PT and help peeing), I am veryyyy low maintenance. Give me a chew toy and I'll be good for the rest of the day. I am generally low on the energy scale, but definitely love the outdoors and my short walks. \n\n- In my foster home I live with 3 dogs and 2 cats. I was a little cautious and not so sure about the cats for the first couple of days but now I love playing with them. I am great with everyone, and might just take a couple of minutes to warm up to new people :)\n\n- I definitely do not need a huge space but it would be great to have a patio, balcony or any area I can feel the wind and sun in my face!!\n\nIf you see me online I am still available for adoption! If you are interested in adopting me please fill out an application here: www.hitlivingfoundation.org/adoption-application, and email a video walkthrough of your home and yard to BOTH Nicole@hitlivingfoundation.org AND Marta@hitlivingfoundation.org. Your application will not be counted as valid without your video. You will hear back from us within a few days.\n",

All AAA dogs are up to date on all vaccinations, spayed or neutered, on heartworm preventative, and microchipped. \n\nDogs are individuals -- The shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs.

No, really, we want you to meet this derpy dude. \nHe's around a year old and weighs about 70 pounds, but definitely a trim 70. He tries to be in tip top shape! \nDexter is a bit shy when he first meets people, but if you're nice to him and maybe give him some treats (subtle, right?), he'll love you BIG time! Sometimes he thinks men can be particularly scary to meet, but he's really drawn to them once he realizes they are kind. And that they have treats. Treats help a ton. \nDexter really is the sweetest, silliest boy. In fact, despite his size, Dexter strongly believes that your lap is his lap and will happily join you for a big slobbery kiss. \nDo you have another canine family member? Dexter has done great with small dogs and we think he can live with bigger dogs, too, but will need a slow and appropriate introduction to any doggy siblings. \nBecause Dexter can be a bit shy, a low-activity, adult-only home (or a low-activity home with older kids) would be best for him. He'd also like a home without cats. He really just doesn't understand those creatures. \nDexter is an athletic sort of pooch and needs a 6-foot privacy fence because he can be a little bit of an escape artist. He loves to play fetch with a ball, so keeping Dexter and his human(s) entertained is easy peasy. He's super treat motivated, too. (In case you haven't gotten the hint, the way to Dexter's heart is definitely through his stomach. And his stomach likes treats.) \nHow about we get together to see if you're Dexter's forever person/family? Call/text The Pet Connection at 913-671-7387. He's in the Kansas City metro, but transport is available to the right home. Let's do this!",

Uno loves to go for a daily walk, or two! He is extremely friendly and great with people. Uno is more than happy to hang by your side (or in your lap) and nap the day away. Although we\u2019re unsure of his exact age we think he may be around 8-10. He is completely potty trained and knows basic commands. An adult home or one with children 12 and up would be best for Uno and also feline free!\n\nUno prefers to keep his distance from other dogs and would like to be the only pet in a low key household. Ideally with a woman present. A fenced in yard is also preferred.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in Uno, please fill out an online application at Folas.org. Meetings are scheduled with approved applications. Any additional questions can be sent to folasinfo@gmail.com.",

            "description": "Poor Toby was left at a high kill shelter by a family member because his owner was suffering from dementia and could no longer take care of him. As a 12-year old dog with a heart murmur and a serious eye infection, his adoption prospects were bleak. Then The Rescue Train pulled up and Toby hopped on!\n\nHis eye has almost completely healed and his heart condition is stable but due to the severity of his heart murmur, our cardiologist estimates his lifespan may only be 12 to 18 months. He is on heart and eye medication twice a day. Despite his condition, Toby is a happy boy who loves to eat, lay in the sun and curl up on anything soft. He is currently living in a foster home with two small, senior dogs who he gets along with. He can be reactive to other dogs on walks but his foster mom is working to redirect him. He is improving everyday is very responsive to treat training. Toby is housebroken but because he is on a diuretic, he also uses a pee pad.\n\n---\nIf you are interested in adopting TOBY please fill out our adoption application on www.therescuetrain.org.

            "description": "Cuddles was picked up by animal control and turned into the shelter, where we got him.  He is a very friendly, sweet, calm dog  who loves getting attention.  Cuddles, like many of us, is a little overweight (due to eating too much or not getting enough exercise) and needs to lose a few pounds.  Despite that, he is very small and is one of the cutest dogs we've had.  He looks a lot like a gorgeous stuffed animal.  He definitely enjoys going on walks, but probably the walks need to be short at first, so he can build up his strength.\n\nCuddles needs to go to a home where there are no children under 10 (due to his very small size) and one where he will be walked a couple of times each day.  We don't know how he does around cats.  He is a very easy to take care of pup, but does need regular grooming (every 3 months)--otherwise his hair gets matted.  So, that's an expense any new home must consider.  Cuddles is hypo-allergenic, neutered, up to date on all vaccines, has been dewormed, microchipped and given flea medication.  We also got him professionally groomed on 1/26/21.  \n\nIf you want to meet him in La Mesa, email me and I'll send you an application (NO CALLS PLEASE).  Cuddles will get a lot of interest, so be sure to act quickly if you'd like to meet him.",

She would do well in almost any family dynamic and would be great with a couple of outdoorsy youngsters that want an adventure pal.\nThis dog is spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations and current on flea/tick and heartworm preventative.  This dog has tested negative for heartworms.  The adoption fee is $450 if your adoption is prepaid and final prior to your dog's arrival. An additional $50 will be charged on dogs that are picked up from our Southbury CT adoption center, adopted at an event or foster home. This additional fee is necessary in order to comply with CT HB 5368.\nIf you are a MA resident, your new family member is required to go through a mandatory 48 hour quarantine period at our Woburn MA isolation facility.  Your new family member will be dropped off by our transport on Thursday and will be ready for you to pick him/her up on Saturday between 12pm-2pm.  An additional $100 fee will be added for any dogs picked up from the Woburn MA quarantine facility.  This additional fee is necessary in order to comply with MA Order 405-CD-12 and Order 1-AHO-05. \n\nTO APPLY PLEASE GO TO  www.cprdogs.com.  If your application was successfully submitted you will get a confirmation.  \n\nAfter receipt of your application, an adoption counselor will then be in touch to answer your questions about this pup, discuss the adoption process and get the ball rolling!

They quickly took them to the local shelter in Johnson County who reached out to us immediately!\n\nPip has been with a wonderful foster who cared for her and got her all ready for her fur-ever home!\n\nShe is now 11 weeks old and ready for her own family!\n\nPip is happy, friendly, great with other dogs (has had a blast playing with her 2 foster brothers who are slightly larger at around 40lbs and her foster sister who is a little chi girl about her size.)\n\nPips breed is a bit of a mystery -  possible some whippet due to her long legs?   She has the most stunning brindle coloring and is a little thing - kinda delicate looking.   She will most likely remain a little girl - shouldn't be any more than 10-12 lbs at full grown.\n\nPip is a beautiful little thing and some lucky family will get to take her home!!\n\nIf interested, please apply on our website www.alldogscomefromheaven and click on the adoption application link at the top right on the page.\n\nMeet and greet will be scheduled with approved application ONLY\n\nAdoption fee is $325 and includes all age appropriate shots, worming, microchip with a lifetime registration and her spay (covered by us and scheduled with our vets) when she is between 24-26 weeks old!",

            "description": "PLEASE NOTE: Our little rescue has been inundated by inquiries about this puppy. We are thrilled--are responding as fast as we can--but it's slow-going. Until we catch up, we are putting additional inquiries on hold. So, please check back with us the second week in February, after Dora has arrived at which time we will have an even better idea of what would be the perfect adoption match for her. Thank you for understanding.\n_________________\n\nHere\u2019s your chance to be the loving adopter of a very rare and unique dog!\nBora is a real Macedonian Shepherd who\u2014along with her two little sisters\u2014was \u201cdumped\u201d by the side of the road in Macedonia.\nUnfortunately, her sisters came down with parvo (and one of them passed away, in spite of the care being given by the kind-hearted lady who rescued these pups).\n\nBut now Bora\u2014who thankfully has remained healthy\u2014is ready to come to the US, to find a new loving home.\n(Her sister Becca will be coming in another month of two, at which time she\u2014too\u2014will be available for adoption.)\n\nBora is about four months old and is very playful, loving, and good with other dogs. We will need to have her spayed in a couple of months, but\u2014in the meantime\u2014we are looking for a potential adopter for her.\nBora would enjoy another doggie playmate and a fenced yard because she will be a BIG dog (and this breed needs exercise and enjoys being outside). She will need to attend puppy obedience class and she is still working on her housebreaking skills. So an adopter who is home much of the time, works out of his/her home (not just until Covid is resolved)--or who is retired\u2014would be the best fit for Bora. She will grow to be a big girl (possibly between 75-90 pounds), and her adopter will need to do lots of brushing/grooming! Bora will be fully vetted prior to adoption and her adoption fee is $350.\n\nMacedonian Shepherds are very loving and faithful to their family, they make great guard dogs (while not aggressive, their size and big \u201cbark\u201d is enough to scare most burglars away!)\n\nBora will be arriving in the US on February 7, and we welcome inquiries at this time. So if you feel your living situation would be a good fit for Bora, please write to us at: sylvialovesme@gmail.com and tell us about yourself\u2014your daily schedule, about other members of the family, if you have other pets and/or a safely fenced yard (we don\u2019t consider \u201cinvisible fencing\u201d a safe way to contain a dog) etc.. Then, if we feel you would be a good match for Bora (and vice versa) we will send you an adoption application\u2014after which time (if you live near Madison, Wi.) we can schedule a meet-and-greet along with a pre-adoption home visit.\n",

There is a link to our online ADOPTION APPLICATION on our Petfinder home page. You may also request an application via email. Paper copies are available at our shelter.\nWe always recommend a meet and greet with our dogs available for adoption. We are not able to assess dogs with cats since we are set up for dog intakes only. If you have cats, we advise a proper introduction while keeping the dog on leash in your home.\nWe are volunteer-based, so please be patient with our response time.\n\nFOR RESCUES: Taylor County is rescue friendly! If you are a rescue, please contact our Rescue Coordinator, Diana, at deed1123@aol.com\n\nDONATIONS: We are always in need of donations to help care for our dogs. We feed IAMS Adult Mini Chunks (green bag) and IAMS Smart Puppy. If you can assist financially, please mail a check payable to Taylor County Humane Society at PO Box 243, Grafton WV 26354 or visit our website to donate via PayPal. http://www.tchswv.com/donations/",

            "description": "Zoro came to us as a stray no one ever came looking for. Sad really as one look would tell you this is a dog pretty easy to describe. Zoro looks to be 2-3 years old and is about 70 lbs. Yes, his eyes are such a light blue they look almost white and he sees just fine. Zoro is very playful, good with female dogs but not male dogs. He walks well on a leash and seems to have a pretty laid back attitude. While a good dog this is not a dog for a first-time dog owner.\nDOG ADOPTION FEE is $100. This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more. (If a dog is sponsored or has a waived or lower fee, that info will be provided at the point of adoption to the approved adopter).\nThe first step is to our Adoption Application here: https://elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html .\nIMPORTANT - we respond to your emailed applications and queries via email back to you. Please make sure you have either added our email (hselco@bellsouth.net) to your contact list or that you routinely check your SPAM folder for our response just to be safe.

He loves stuffies but will attempt to assassinate them for squeaker removal at the first available opportunity. He gets along with other dogs and kids but is extremely high energy and would do better with kids big enough to handle his exuberant personality.\nThis dog is spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations and current on flea/tick and heartworm preventative.  This dog has tested negative for heartworms.  The adoption fee is $450 if your adoption is prepaid and final prior to your dog's arrival. An additional $50 will be charged on dogs that are picked up from our Southbury CT adoption center, adopted at an event or foster home. This additional fee is necessary in order to comply with CT HB 5368.\nIf you are a MA resident, your new family member is required to go through a mandatory 48 hour quarantine period at our Woburn MA isolation facility.  Your new family member will be dropped off by our transport on Thursday and will be ready for you to pick him/her up on Saturday between 12pm-2pm.  An additional $100 fee will be added for any dogs picked up from the Woburn MA quarantine facility.  This additional fee is necessary in order to comply with MA Order 405-CD-12 and Order 1-AHO-05. \n\nTO APPLY PLEASE GO TO  www.cprdogs.com.  If your application was successfully submitted you will get a confirmation.  \n\nAfter receipt of your application, an adoption counselor will then be in touch to answer your questions about this pup, discuss the adoption process and get the ball rolling!  If you have not heard from one of our volunteers within 5 days of submitting your application, please email mollibo@gmail.com.",

Sebastian is a sweet 5 year old Pit mix that prefers to hangout in our office rather that his kennel! He loves greeting everyone that comes through the lobby! Sebastian can look intimidating to some, but once you meet him he is the biggest baby! Sebastian loves his place toys, but the stuffing doesn't seem to last too long when he's around! He is a big goofball and always has a big smile on his face! Be careful though, he loves kisses! When Sebastian is done with you, you won't need a shower for a week! Sebastian is a strong boy, so he needs someone that can handle him and make sure he knows you are the boss. He would do well with older kid (13+) that can handle his size and strength. Sebastian prefers small dogs and would do okay with the right cat. If you are interested in meeting Sebastian, please fill out a questionnaire (either in person or online at gobroomecounty.com/shelter) and staff will contact those we would like to move forward with. If you have further questions about Sebastian, please call the shelter at (607)778-2493 or email us at muttsrus@broomecounty.us.",

He loves toys, especially the ones that squeak!\nComing in as a stray, we do not know if he is OK with other animals, although we have not seen any aggression from him. If you already have other dogs, bring them in to meet and greet with him.\nHis adoption fee is $150, cash or credit card and his neuter is included.

Sweet and loving but needs some groceries and get to a healthy weight and will be treated for her happy tail she has at the tip of her tail. \nMore information to come as we get to know her better.

            "description": "Prince is a four-year old male, about 6o lbs, and he came to us when his owner moved to an apartment. Prince is a very active boy, plays a bit too rough for young children but would be ok for teens and older. We were told he can jump out of a 4' fence. Exercise will be Prince's best friend so if you are looking for running or hiking buddy he would benefit greatly from that. A tired dog (as in one that gets the exercise it needs) is a more well-mannered dog and also less likely to want to escape to find fun elsewhere.\nDOG ADOPTION FEE is $100. This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more. (If a dog is sponsored or has a waived or lower fee, that info will be provided at the point of adoption to the approved adopter).\nThe first step is to our Adoption Application here: https://elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html .\nIMPORTANT - we respond to your emailed applications and queries via email back to you. Please make sure you have either added our email (hselco@bellsouth.net) to your contact list or that you routinely check your SPAM folder for our response just to be safe.

            "description": "Beaudreau is about three years old, around 80 lbs. He is a most awesome dog but he is, what we call, a LOT of dog. He loves to eat most anything, loves the water, is great with other dogs, cats and children. He lived on a runner previously so is not housetrained but we can promise that he will learn quickly for the opportunity to be able to be INSIDE with his family. Beaudreau is a very vocal boy - loves to talk so not the best for close quarters or an apartment. Will go in a crate for food but not a dog to stay in a crate for very long. We were told he was a Boxer mix so are guessing at his second breed but it could be most anything - just know he is a BIG boy!\nDOG ADOPTION FEE is $100. This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more. (If a dog is sponsored or has a waived or lower fee, that info will be provided at the point of adoption to the approved adopter).\nThe first step is to our Adoption Application here: https://elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html .\nIMPORTANT - we respond to your emailed applications and queries via email back to you. Please make sure you have either added our email (hselco@bellsouth.net) to your contact list or that you routinely check your SPAM folder for our response just to be safe. If we do not receive a timely response we simply move on to another applicant.\nTo learn more about us, visit our Website at: http://www.elmorehumane.org; Phone: (334) 567-3377 Fax: (334) 567-8774 E-mail: hselco@bellsouth.net",

Well then Theodore might just be the dog you didn't realize you needed in your life. Theo had not met very many new people in his previous home, but has been learning here at the shelters that strangers are fun.

He is only about 1 yr old so still has that puppy energy.\n\nIf you are interested, complete the\nAdoption Application\non our website at\nwww.NeedyPaws.org\nand we will contact you.\n\nAdopters must live within an hour's drive of St. Louis, MO.\n\nRegal's adoption fee is $250.00, which includes up-to-date vaccinations, heartworm testing and preventative, spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are a 100% foster-based rescue and all of our dogs live in approved foster homes.

However, she learned to trust and grew into a beautiful soul who was just trying to survive and keep her pups alive and safe.\n\nPlease do NOT submit an application if you do not have a lifestyle that the dog needs to be happy and healthy.\n\nMacey is spayed, rabies, core vaccines, heartworm, tick disease tested, de-wormed, monthly preventatives and microchipped. At the time of her spay surgery on 13 January 2021, she weighed around 38.00 pounds and has an estimated date of birth 11 January 2020.\nWe cannot say for sure what breed she is, so we expect families to do their own research on her look and size and decide what breed you think she is and if you have the lifestyle suitable for her needs.\n\nMacey has been at the rescue with her with her pups in the house and whilst at first she was very protective of her pups and the area she was in she has adjusted great over the months and has learnt to play and run and hang out among the other dogs. She is still VERY attached to her pups and they are all constantly playing together and snuggling up on the dog beds together. When new dogs have come in Macey has got a bit barky with them, but I feel this is just because of what she has gone through and she still has her protective feelings over her pups. She has never been aggressive, just wants everyone to know it is her space.\n\nAt the vets she was great, she was friendly with everyone she met and happily went back with the vet staff for her spay surgery. She is great at alerting to noises and will go to the part of fence where she heard the noise, and does generally come in when called. She is a very sweet girl, who will reach out with her paw for attention. Her hair has started to grown back and although not thick, it will most likely take a few seasons for that to come through as it should.\n\nMacey would benefit from an active family, one that understands she is going to need time and patience to transition, she is going to miss her pups, but she is still young and I am sure will adapt to an active lifestyle and loving home. She is very affectionate and loves to snuggle and does gently jump up for her ears to be scratched but nothing that is imposing.\n\nShe needs a family that will work with her on training and understanding the new rules of her home and family and ensure she gets all the love, structure and routine she needs and deserves.\nShe does use the dog door to go out and play, but if she is inside she will use the pee pads to do her business so house training should be expected and planned.\n\nWe do not know how she will be around cats or livestock so families are expected to be prepared to work through potential problems and provide a safe and happy living environment for all animals, and humans.\n\nMore pictures and possible video's can be found on his page on the rescue website.\n\nYou MUST understand that dogs need time to decompress and adapt to their new environment and home. It is a HUGE transition they make from the kill shelter, being vetted, on transport for 3 days and arriving in Maine where the temperature and such is very different to what they have only known. In rescue there is what is known as the \"3 Point Rule\" Days 1-3 your dog is stressed, anxious, confused as to where they are now. Weeks 1-3 your dog is adjusting, settling in, learning things. At the 3 month point, your dog understands they are home, and have built up a trusting relationship where they feel loved and secure.\n\nAll dogs are fed Rachael Ray Nutrish PEAK Natural Dry Dog Food, Grain Free Western Grasslands Recipe with Bison.

She was saved from the streets, neglected and starving to death. Once she was deemed healthy, Noqrah and her friend Khushi\n\nwere flow into the US where they waited in a boarding facility for transport up to Maine. They arrived at GaDaH on 25th January 2021.\n\nNoqrah is scheduled for spay surgery on 24 February 2021, she has current rabies, core vaccines, de-wormed, heartworm and tick disease tested negative, monthly preventatives and microchipped. At the time of her export/import examination she weighed she weighed around 20.00 pounds and has an estimated date of birth 15 July 2020.\n\nWe cannot say for sure what breed she is, so we expect families to do their own research on her look and size and decide what breed you think she is and if you have the lifestyle suitable for her needs.\n\nFor all that this sweet girl has been through, she is doing amazing, to think just over a week ago she was in Afghanistan, endured 48 hours traveling to US, then in a boarding facility for a few days and then driven for 1.5 days up to Maine and is a happy-go-lucky girl.\n\nNoqrah is all puppy, she is bouncing around so excited she doesn't know what to do. She loves being with all the dogs and is enjoying charging around outside chasing and playing.\n\nShe has not had any training and so housetraining as well as obedience should be expected and planned for. Noqrah can be possessive with her food, toys and treats, this is most likely due to many reasons, the main ones being she had been found starving and she is not used to sharing, so where other animals are concerned supervision should be carried out and feeding not close to each other. She is not aggressive just doesn't want to share and will snap at a dog trying to get what she has. Since she is young, this is easily worked on and whilst here at the rescue she is learning with the other rescue and house pack that this behaviour is not needed.\n\nWe are looking for a family that go on hikes, walks, treks, adventures, to the beach, the lake, anywhere and everywhere that is fun and would give this beauty a wonderful fun filled life. She is going to need training, she is not fully house-trained, but does use pee-pads if they are put down - she just needs to learn to let her family know she needs to go outside. Noqrah\nis going to be a medium/large high energy dog and so she needs an active family who already have an adventurous and active lifestyle they can incorporate her into. She is a smart girl and so training and continued mental stimulation is also very important to make sure she gets the healthy, both physical and mental lifestyle that she needs and deserves.\n\nMore pictures and possible video's can be found on his page on the rescue website.\n\nYou MUST understand that dogs need time to decompress and adapt to their new environment and home. It is a HUGE transition they make from the kill shelter, being vetted, on transport for 3 days and arriving in Maine where the temperature and such is very different to what they have only known. In rescue there is what is known as the \"3 Point Rule\" Days 1-3 your dog is stressed, anxious, confused as to where they are now. Weeks 1-3 your dog is adjusting, settling in, learning things. At the 3 month point, your dog understands they are home, and have built up a trusting relationship where they feel loved and secure.\n\nAll dogs are fed Rachael Ray Nutrish PEAK Natural Dry Dog Food, Grain Free Western Grasslands Recipe with Bison. Rachael Ray Nutrish Peak Dog Food receives the Dog Food Advisor's second-highest tier rating of 4.5 stars.\n\nNoqrah i is available for adoption for an adoption fee of $750, the higher adoption fee is to help cover the costs of her going through all the import/export certifications and the cost of her flight, boarding and transport to the rescue. This fee, obviously doesn't come close to covering these costs, but is a help.\n\nThis fee is not negotiable and is used to cover the rescue costs of pulling, vetting, health certificate, transport from Texas to Maine, monthly preventatives, supplements, food, general day to day cost of running a brick and mortar rescue and anything else that is needed. Canadian adopters need to know that customs charge 15% taxes when entering into Canada.\n\nDue to borders being closed, it is up to families to call the US and Canadian borders to find the current details on border crossing.

Like her, he's on the shy side, but he's definitely the more outgoing of the two, and has showed interest in playing with other small dogs. Dollar is a picky eater, since he's used to being fed table scraps, though he can sometimes be enticed to eat wet dog food. He's also unused to wearing a leash, collar, or harness, due to having always remained at home with his guardian. Despite this, he is tolerant of being outfitted and being on leash so he just needs some guidance. \n\nDollar is suffering from congestive heart failure, and after his guardian passed away, his guardian's family members were unable to afford his medical care. Thankfully POMDR is starting him on meds that can help him live a normal life and we are happy to help this great little guy find a new family to entertain.",

            "description": "Looks like: Poodle\nFemale, 14 years old, 7 pounds\n\nBarbee is such a loving and sweet girl. She loves attention and now that the weather is getting colder, she is pumped to be cuddled. Barbee is hard of hearing and cannot hear verbal commands, taking visual cues instead. Barbee is a sweet, gentle soul that has transitional and separation anxiety. She will whine while riding in the car and is going to have a hard time adjusting to her forever home. She will need weeks to settle in and be very sad and anxious, preventing herself from truly settling in until completely familiar. \n\nShe looks amazing for her age, both with her health and beauty. She has an old leg injury that she favors. Part of it is a luxated knee cap on her left hind leg and while she will stand with weight on all 4 limbs, she usually walks holding that leg up. Despite her leg, Barbee lives for her walks. Even when overwhelmed with anxiety, she cheers up for an explorative walk. Her future person should be able to take her on a couple walks a day. \n\nBarbee comes to us because her guardian could no longer take care of her. She has been with her guardian her entire life, so these changes have been very tough on her. She barks and whines when she is sitting in a new place because she is not happy with change. We are sure she will blossom in a loving and patient home though as she is an absolute doll and after a long adjustment, she will make a perfect companion for the right person.",

He is super food motivated, needs a bit of house training, but loves rope toys and snuggles. Hemi is half couch potato, and half your typical hound with his nose to the ground and irresistible personality. He is friendly to all he meets, is non-destructive in the home and thoroughly enjoys car rides. He is not cat-safe, so he needs a cat-free home. Because he  humps when he\u2019s too excited, we believe he isn\u2019t suited to be around toddlers and young ones as he may create a fall risk. He is quite simply a goofy, affectionate guy just waiting for his new family!\n\nCats: No\n\nKids: 10+\n\nDogs: Maybe",

He is very energetic and loves to run around and play. He would be the perfect partner to take on runs or go for long walks on the beach. He was found as a stray, very thin and weak but he's doing great now. He is a smart boy who knows how to sit on command. He has been dewormed and is UTD on shots. Our minimum adoption age is 23 and our dog adoption fee is $275. Call us at 843-427-4388 if you would like to make an appointment to meet our dogs.\n\nDog adoption fee is $275 and includes spay/neutering and immunizations required based on age prior to adoption. Fees also include other medical and physical care provided while at the shelter.",

            "description": "I'M CURRENTLY ON HOLD, PENDING AN ADOPTION APPOINTMENT! Kevin is a handsome 6-month-old mixed-breed guy who currently weighs about 51 pounds. He came to SFAS as a stray in rough shape but thanks to our veterinary team they were able to help him heal and get him back into good shape. Now he is now ready to find a loving family to call his own. Here at the shelter Kevin has become a staff favorite and has been very affectionate with humans and enjoys going walks. Kevin's adoption fee is $130. He is neutered and microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. To meet Kevin or to be added to his waitlist, call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the DOG'S NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org. A scheduler will call you back within 48 hours to confirm your request. If you have other dogs at home, tell the scheduler you would like to bring them along for a Meet n' Greet. SFAS offers a variety of excellent training classes, seminars and Trainer Talks led by animal behavior professionals. These are $50 off for animals adopted from any shelter or rescue group! Due to current COVID-19 restrictions, classes and talks are all presented virtually using Zoom. For course descriptions, schedules and registration, visit https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/group-training-classes/ for classes and https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/special-seminars-and-workshops/ for seminars and Trainer Talks.",

I can be a pretty typical Chow Chow in that I am aloof at times, especially towards strangers, but I do also have a goofy playful side. I love to play fetch and bounce around making monkey noises. My special talent is making people smile with my silly antics! I'm looking for a low-traffic home without children under 12 and where I can be the only dog. It'd be even better if my future family has Chow experience. If this sounds like you and you're ready for an adorable teddy bear dog like me, look no further! Pooka is a Diamond Dog and will be shown by appointment only. Diamond Dogs are dogs that are currently receiving special training from staff and volunteers through our behavior modification program. If you are interested in learning more about this animal, please fill out an application by clicking here . Be sure to include Pooka A1364604 when filling out the survey. After reviewing your application, we will only be reaching out to you if the animal is a good fit for your home.",

She's never lived with other animals or kids, so we will learn more about that as she's with us longer. She's always had a fenced yard to play in, so she hasn't been on a leash much - you can hardly tell. She's a little rusty (pulls some), but will figure it out in no time! When alone during the day, she was reported to be housebroken and she didn't get into any trouble. Some of her favorite things are spending time with people and playing games like fetch and chase! \n\nSophie has a history of allergic skin disease or atopic dermatitis, which has been successfully treated/managed by her previous owners and veterinarian. Sophie has not displayed any signs of allergic skin disease yet while at HSDC (her coat is beautiful and shiny!) but please be aware that atopic dermatitis is a life-long condition that commonly requires regular therapy with a full service veterinarian. Of course, that's an extra expense to consider (a small price to pay for unconditional love?).",

            "description": "This 3 year old Husky/Malamute is sooooo sweet. He was kept on a tie out in trailer park for his young life and while his owner deeply loved him, they knew that that lifestyle wasn\u2019t fair to Zuma. They admitted that they didn\u2019t know how to train him and as a result Zuma needs some training. He chews inappropriately and is destructive if he is frustrated and unsupervised. He is very dog social and would love a doggy playmate, but will chase cats and livestock. He is scared of thunder, vacuums and loud noises. He is great with kids and loves to play. He will bark/alert at passing cars, people, bikes and livestock.\n\nWe think Zuma will make an amazing family dog for folks who don\u2019t mind putting a little work into some training. He would be fine living in town or in the country.  This big fluffy guy definitely needs some work learning to take food gently and not jumping. When he gets really riled up and wants to play he can get a bit mouthy, but that behavior isn\u2019t persistent and is easily redirected. Zuma is just a chunky guy who needs some structure, enrichment and proper exercise.\n\nIf Zuma sounds like the one you\u2019ve been looking for, don\u2019t hesitate to email us ,or give us a call, and see if you guys have chemistry!\n\nDogs: Yes\n\nCats:No\n\nKids:Yes",

Jackson is such a happy boy despite the rough start he had in life! He came to us as a walking skeleton that was very concerned with where his next meal was coming from. During his time here, he hasn't had to worry about that anymore! He has put on the much needed groceries and looks better than ever! Now, all he needs is forever home! C'mon, how can you say no to that face?  Jackson would do well in a home with respectful kids(6+). He can be selective of the dogs he likes, and could cohabitate with a cat! If you are having a bad day, Jackson will fix it with his magic cuddles and kisses! If you are interested in meeting Jackson, please fill out a questionnaire (either in person or online at gobroomecounty.com/shelter) and staff will contact those we would like to move forward with. If you have further questions about Jackson, please call the shelter at (607)778-2493 or email us at muttsrus@broomecounty.us.",

He is currently living with other dogs but needs to be the only dog.\nChevy is housebroken, great on a leash and a dream in the car! He currently weighs in about 130lbs but needs to lose weight. He's extremely affectionate and loves sitting in your lap. He's quite goofy and will no doubt make you laugh. Please contact\nwaldocrum@gmail.com\nfor adoption information\n\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\n\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\n\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\n\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\n\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\n\nPlease \"like\" our\nFacebook Page\nfor the most current events and new dogs.\n\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

            "description": "Meet our girl Ari aka \u201cWeenie\u201d because frankly she is a completely endearing wimp. Ari is a Shepard/Husky/Bully blend and is as gorgeous as she is intelligent. She is a bit prone to environmental stress and can be a nervous nelly when she feels out of her comfort zone. She tends to tuck herself away and avoid sounds and people that she doesn\u2019t immediately recognize, but she comes around quick and is eager to please. She is all about the appeasing behavior \u2013 she wants you to love her, play with her and be kind to her. She is gentle and fun, with tons of personality that she makes you work a little to discover \u2013 but boy is it worth it!\n\nAri\u2019s life changed when her owners of three years had a baby. Ari was nervous around the baby and tried to avoid it, but as the baby aged Ari wasn\u2019t able to have separate space and it escalated her discomfort. We think that she struggled with having no control over when the child entered her personal bubble. She does excellent with people who give her time to come to them, and obviously that isn\u2019t a baby\u2019s strong suit. It was devastating for her family to have to give her up in the hopes of finding her a situation that was more conducive to her happiness. She came from a home that loved her so very much, but they did what they felt they had to do for her.\n\nAri grew up with cats in the home and played with the dogs of family friends. She would likely love to have an animal buddy or two in her life who were easy going and social. She can be the most nervous around men, but does well as soon as she learns they have a safe and gentle demeanor. Confidence building and exposure to new things in her next home will really help her become more sure-footed. She is ready to get out of here and into a new family.\n\nCats: Yes\n\nDogs: Probably\n\nKids: 10+, dog-savvy",

I am still young and energetic so I will need a home that can help me with training and can give me plenty of exercise- I love playing fetch and going for walks. Everyone here has been keeping an eye on me for awhile because I do have seizures on occasion, no one is sure as to why I have these seizures but they have put me on some medication that will hopefully help manage them. I really love being around my people and have done well with other dogs, I just need to find a home that can help keep me healthy and happy for years to come! I would love to meet you and if you would like to meet me please call LTBHS to see if we might be a good fit :) Lots of love and face kisses- Charli",

He is learning to leash walk. He is rather perplexed by stairs and currently doesn't want to use them. He will figure them out soon though. Tex likes to stick close to you and get attention of all types. You can pretty much pet him anywhere and he will break into a big smile. He is rather a romantic guy at heart and you are going to love him. If you are interested in meeting Tex, please fill out the online pre-adoption form today.",

My best fit would be a confident and experienced human friend that can understand my past and allow me patience as well as help me with confidence building. Unfortunately, I have only ever lived outside in my past, but from now on, I am seeking a home where I can stay safely indoors and become a part of my human's everyday life. It will take me time to warm up in my new home, become accustom to the ways of the house and I would do best in one that is not very busy with visitors or guests, so that I do not become overwhelmed. I think I would very much like as much as benefit from having a confident, friendly, and social dog companion in my new home to help show me the ropes. A relationship of structure, routine and guidance would give me the opportunity to gain my own confidence and help me become the best boy that I can be. Please contact my friends at HALO if you think we would be a good fit and they can set up an appointment for us to meet each other!",

            "description": "A SMART & HANDSOME FRIEND:  5 years old / 70 lbs.\n\nHello!  My name is Chi-Chi!  I had a home, but one of the other dogs in the home was being aggressive toward me without provocation, so it is best that I find another family to love.  Mostly Mutts is helping me do just that!\n\n\u2022 OTHER DOGS/CATS/KIDS:  Though one of the dogs in my previous home did not like me, I got along well with the other dogs and enjoyed playing with them a bit \u2013 though I didn\u2019t snuggle up with them.  There was also an older dog in the home that could be grumpy, so I just gave him his space.  I think I would be fine as an only dog or with another friendly dog in my new home.  So, if you have a nice dog already, let\u2019s meet / I got along with the kitties in my former home, so if you have a dog-friendly kitty, let\u2019s meet / I\u2019ve not met kids at Mostly Mutts, but my previous owner reports I was good with the kids I met while with them, though I\u2019m a big dog and occasionally goofy so I could bump younger kids over, so let\u2019s meet and best no very young kids that I may bump over!\n\n\u2022 PERSONALITY/ENERGY LEVEL:  I am a friendly guy who loves my people. I\u2019m described as sweet, mild-mannered and mostly calm \u2013 though I do get excited when getting ready for a walk and at mealtime, yummy!  I enjoy leisurely hang out on the couch, playing a bit or going for a walk as I\u2019m a go with the flow fellow. I look forward to being someone\u2019s great companion / My energy level is 4-6.\n\n\u2022 SKILLS/CRATE/POTTY:  I completed an obedience class in February of 2020, and reportedly know the following commands: \u2018sit\u2019, \u2018stay\u2019, \u2018down\u2019, \u2018wait\u2019, \u2018look\u2019 and \u2018come\u2019.  My former family had me \u2018sit\u2019 and \u2018wait\u2019 at doors until released so I would not rush out a door.  I did the same before coming in if it\u2019s wet and I need to have my paws cleaned.  I\u2019m a smart guy! / I did not need to be crated in my former home, though I would go in and out of it on my own to take a nap or chew a bone / My former owner reports that I had great potty habits, so hopefully that will be the case in my new home too. \n\n\u2022 LIKES/DISLIKES:  I like leisurely walks sniffing interesting things along the way, spending time with my people, and chewing Nyla bones.  I also enjoy being outside a bit listening to the sounds of the neighborhood and keeping an eye on things / I didn\u2019t like the stress/negative energy from the dog in my former home picking on me.  I can get overheated on hot Georgia days when on walks, so just a short walk when it\u2019s really hot will do.  I would not like it if I did not get the love and attention all doggies deserve!   \n\n\u2022 MEDICAL:   I'm current on vaccinations, micro-chipped and neutered.   I am on prescriptive low-fat dog food for digestive care right now as sometimes I got tummy aches and this type of food is helpful.  I\u2019m gradually transitioning to a non-prescription low-fat food for digestive health \u2013 we have to see how that goes.  \n\nI am looking for a loving family to give me a wonderful home!  My adoption fee is $299.00, and I\u2019m located in Kennesaw, Ga.",

He is a Lab/Shepherd mix with an estimated birth date of 12/16/20. He will be large in size when fully grown and will need a fully fenced in yard to run around and play. Proper socializing and training will be recommended to help him have good house manners. He will need someone who has the time to house train him. Billy is staying in a loving SPCA foster home until he is old enough to be adopted and will need a home that will consider him part of their family. \n\nApply to adopt Billy on our website, www.spcaeasttx.com under the \"adopt a dog\" tab. All animals in the home must be spayed/neutered and up-to-date on vaccinations to be considered. We go by best fit for each animal when finding their forever homes.",

            "description": "Petey oh Petey.. what a sweetheart... He is basically a snuggle bug and is super friendly with all ages. He currently resides with his foster family and aviary friends. He sleeps through the night with his humans and wakes up mid morning. He has had no accidents in the middle of the night, or in the house for that matter -  this sweet boy is fully housebroken. \n\nHis week day job is Supervisor of the House. While his fosters work and school, he visits each one to make sure every thing is in order. He keeps himself busy inside, likes to run around the yard, and take naps when he tires himself out. \n\nDo you like hiking? Walks? Jogging? Meet your outdoor partner here. He's been getting 3-4 mile jogs at the park a day and he loves it. He enjoys playing with other dogs and especially playing fetch with his humans. He is an active dog and would love to join an active family. It would be a bonus if he would have another active fur sibling to live with. \n\nHe is basically all around fun to be with and a well mannered guy. He is deaf but that doesn't hinder him in any way. He can hear very high pitches. We will have him evaluated by a vet and will have more information soon.\n\nWill you give this sweet boy a 2nd chance with a forever home, safe and loved? \nAdoption Fee: $400\nSan Francisco Bay Area adoption only.\nIf you would like to meet Petey, please apply at http://www.lovewoof.org/our-animals: . \n\nAdoption Process:\nOnce an adoption counselor receives and approves your application, they will contact you (only if you match the animal's needs) to set up an appointment to meet the dog you applied for and/or any of the other dogs in the rescue. If the dog you applied for is not a good match for your particular situation, there might be others that are better matches.\n\nAdoption Fees:\nAdoption fees allow WOOF Animal Rescue to continue to provide care and medical treatment (including spay/neuter services) for dogs while we look for their forever homes. The fees also helps cover the ongoing costs of caring for less adoptable dogs that require longer stays in the rescue, or more advanced medical treatment before finding their forever homes.\n\nWOOF Animal Rescue, in Fremont CA, does not have a shelter, all of our dogs are raised in foster homes. Each dog comes spayed or neutered, up to date on vaccinations and rabies shots appropriate for their age, dewormed and microchipped.",

Due to long work hours she doesn't have the time that Luna needs, as she is still a pup and has loads of energy. Luna gets along with other dogs that don't mind her exuberance. She would LOVE to be in an active home that is willing to throw a ball for her and that can match her energy level.\nShe is leashed trained, but pulls, she is house and crate trained. She would benefit from a refresher course in basic obedience. She has lived with kids before and while she is not aggressive towards them she does forget her manners and size so little ones who are not steady on their feet won't be the best fit.\n\nor\n\nPETFINDER VIEWERS: Find our applications at www.midwestanimalrescue.org\n\n*The pet you are viewing is a rescued pet which is most often from an animal control facility and does not come with a pedigree. The breed(s) listed are our best guess and are in no way guaranteed. Sometimes the pets appear to be a particular breed(s) in the pictures we receive from our rescue partners and when they arrive we are surprised to see an entirely different breed(s) in person! If you choose to DNA test your adopted pet, test results may vary from company to company and our breed guess may not be reflected in those results as it is just that, our best guess.

Tramp loves to play fetch and tug, and will happily trade a toy for treats or another toy. This guy loves attention and will wiggle his way right next to you to lean in for pets. He has gotten along well with the other dogs that he has met.\n\nTramp is currently being treated for a doggie cold, but is medically approved to be adopted out and start his next chapter! Tramp is a large sized mixed breed, approximately 3 years young, and is full grown at 51 pounds. He's current on vaccinations, microchipped and neutered.",

Please go to our website, complete an online application (if you haven't already) and indicate which animal(s) you are interested in. Once approved, you will be contacted to schedule an adoption appointment. Kindly call the shelter if you have any questions. \n\n**Please note: puppies will not be adopted into homes without prior puppy experience nor to anyone living outside of New Jersey. No exceptions will be made.**\n\nHi, I'm Watson! I came to SAVE with my siblings all the way from Navajo Nation in Arizona. There, resources are lacking and my litter mates and I went without vet care until arriving at SAVE. If we had not been rescued by a Good Samaritan, we would never have known the safety, security and love that a home can provide. We really aren't sure what mix of breeds me and my siblings are... in fact, one of SAVE's amazing volunteers treated my sister to a DNA test so that we can find out. Where I come from, most dogs are a mix of lots of different breeds, so we are excited to find out! Before arriving at SAVE, I had not had a variety of exposure to new people, sights, or smells. While I've been at SAVE, I've been learning how much fun it is to play with people and experience new things. I'll need a family who has the patience to give me the time to learn to love and trust them. The staff at SAVE consider me a medium energy dog. I do love to explore and would love to be with an active family. I am really smart and food motivated, so with consistency and patience, I should be able to quickly master training and tricks. I would be happy to live with other dogs and maybe even a cat (although I would probably chase them a bit). I would do best in a home with children 14 and older. If you have puppy raising experience and are looking for an awesome, active dog, I'm your guy!\n\nFor more information please call SAVE at 609-309-5214.\n Primary Color: Tan Secondary Color: White Weight: 14.125lbs Age: 0yrs 3mths 3wks Animal has been Neutered",

            "description": "Sweet Lila was brought to us on January 13th after spending over 2 years at a shelter in Arkansas. She is a 5 year old Labrador retriever mix, and after a rough start in Arkansas, is ready to find her forever home. She is spayed, microchipped and up to date on all vaccines. \n\nLila has made such tremendous progress since being here and very much enjoys her newfound luxuries of couches and cuddles. She is a very fast learner and eager to please; Lila came to us not knowing any commands or trainings, and already knows how to sit, walks great on a leash, and is house trained. Because of her history, she has anxiety being home alone and will need to be crated when her humans leave. She loves to be in her crate during the day with the door open, and is working on liking her crate at night too. She is very affectionate towards people but can take time to warm up to other dogs, so Lila is hoping to find a home where she is able to be the only dog -- she's definitely awesome enough to handle that. Lila is a sucker for belly rubs, snuggles, and simply loves to be in presence of her people.\n\nLila is currently being treated for heartworm and is looking for a home where she can relax until she is all better! Costs for the treatment are paid for by Hearts of Hope. Her adopter would need to bring her for her final treatments in February and keep her activity low until her treatment is completed.\n\nInterested? This little girl is so full of love and is ready to be with her forever family. Her adoption fee is $250 and you can apply for her on our website at: https://rescueofhope.com/adoption-application/",

This handsome young guy is still a little shy, and figuring out life at the shelter but is oh so sweet and waiting to form a strong bond with his people.  When he sees his human pals, Pablo's butt wags a mile a minute; it's the cutest thing!  Pablo has been fine with the dogs he has met at the shelter, but might be a little overwhelmed with a really high energy and crazy dog, as he is still trying to find his confidence and place.    As any young dog goes, this blue beauty will need some training, exercise and patience, but Pablo is very eager to please!  \n\nHe is named after a beloved pal Pablo and sponsored with a reduced adoption fee and funds towards training classes in his memory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of the COVID19 situation, the shelter is closed to the general public. If you would like to meet any of the adoptable dogs, please fill out an application online (if you are not already pre-approved) , call the shelter, and leave a message with your name and phone number and the dog you're interested in. Have patience, and they will call you back when they can. From there, a time will be scheduled for you to come and meet the dog. Please be patient, and remember they are very short staffed at the moment.\n\nApplications can be found at https://friendsofcbas.org/adopt",

Once approved you will be called for an appointment to meet your possible new family member, or at that time you can meet the other animals as well. https://petstablished.com/public/search/shelter/301551\n\nAdoption fee is $150 which includes, spay/neuter, vaccines, etc, and a free 1 year membership to our 5 acre ARF Park. For other dog questions please email ARFdogs74006@gmail.com\n\nWe do adopt out of state, but the adopter must travel to ARF to meet the dog they are looking to adopt. They must have an approved application before traveling to meet the dog. We do allow small dogs that are eligible to fly in the cabin of a plane. We DO NOT allow dogs to travel in the cargo area of the plane under any circumstances. Any dog that is adopted can of course go by personal vehicle. We do not allow dogs to be transported \"pony express style\" where they are passed from driver to driver.",

            "description": "Meet Rupert... A Good Samaritan reached out to us for help for this little guy and his siblings. Thankfully, we were finally able to secure fosters after they were kinda just the neighborhood pups their whole lives. We honestly have no idea what their breed is. They have long bodies and short little legs like a dachshund. Some have terrier looking heads and some kinda favor a Bulldog. Whatever the mix it\u2019s a cute one. They were born 8/24/20. Being 5 months old they won\u2019t grow much more we believe. Rupert is now 17.6 lbs. We think he will top out around 20 lbs likely. They are sweet pups but haven\u2019t had much socialization with anyone besides the lady that\u2019s been caring for them until they came into our care. Rupert is the most timid of the litter. He is slowly but surely coming stunned with his foster mom.  He is starting to realize the good life and being indoors isn\u2019t so bad. He\u2019s great with all the animals in his foster home and he is trusting his foster mom more daily. He\u2019s starting to ask for human attention on his own and loving it. He\u2019s been started on house and kennel training and is doing well. He\u2019s learning all about sleeping in the bed and learning to cuddle. He will be timid at first in a new situation and will need a little extra patience at first. Rupert is utd, dewormed and neutered. \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159",

            "description": "Meet Rolo... A Good Samaritan reached out to us for help for this little guy and his siblings. Thankfully, we were finally able to secure fosters after they were kinda just the neighborhood pups their whole lives. We honestly have no idea what their breed is. They have long bodies and short little legs like a dachshund. Some have terrier looking heads and some kinda favor a Bulldog. Whatever the mix it\u2019s a cute one. They were born 8/24/20. Being 5 months old they won\u2019t grow much more we believe. Rolo is now 19 lbs. We think he will top out around 20 lbs likely. They are sweet pups but haven\u2019t had much socialization with anyone besides the lady that\u2019s been caring for them until they came into our care. Rolo is already enjoying the good life and being indoors. He\u2019s great with all the animals in his foster home which is a doggy daycare. He\u2019s getting lots of socialization with both animals and people and he\u2019s doing great. He\u2019s been started on house and kennel training and is doing well. He likely will be a little timid at first in a new situation but will open up quickly. He\u2019s a pretty mellow boy and would love a couch to cuddle with his human. Rolo did have a little cherry eye which was repaired when he was neutered and it\u2019s healing well. We will have new pics once his eyes inflammation from surgery goes down. Rolo is utd, dewormed and neutered. \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159",

            "description": "If you are looking for an extremely loyal, ride or die, best friend in the whole wide world then Liliana is the girl for you. This extremely brilliant, young, vivacious, adorable little girl loves to do many things but she will always be her happiest hanging out with you just doing whatever you're doing. Liliana loves car rides, loves to play with toys and other dogs (no cats). She really loves to play fetch with a ball launcher and she loves to take long walks. She especially loves to go on hikes out in nature where she can contemplate life and get some fresh air. Liliana is also more than happy to help you with your chores. She even likes to help with laundry and is really great at sorting socks. Liliana also really loves to snuggle and doesn't think much about the idea of personal space. She makes the most adorable little grunts and groans like a little piglet when being loved on and has the cutest pink piggy nose. Liliana is a very muscular but small girl and weighs 46 pounds. Liliana does have some food allergies and will need to eat special dog food. She is also very food driven and is one super smart cookie so we are currently working on learning kitchen boundaries to prevent her from getting into something she shouldn't be eating. She's crate trained and potty trained.\n\nAdoption fee of $150 includes spay, microchip, vaccines, deworming, heartworm testing, and heartworm/flea/tick prevention\n\nApply here: http://2pawsup.org/2pawsup_wp/forms/adoption-form/",

He came to us like a wild child Tasmanian devil and has spent the last 4 weeks learning to be a sweet inside dog and that humans can be pretty cool. He is good with other dogs (I have 4 small and large) but I believe he would be best suited with a large mature female dog that would take him under her wing. He is three years old and is plenty playful once he is comfortable in his environment. He even lets me clean his paws when he comes inside! He needs lots of reassurance and wants to be at least within eyesight of his person, if not touching them with a paw. He is crated at night from 10p-5am and will alert if he has to go out before then. He does best with females and seems afraid of big men. He has gained weight since we took him in and is fed 2x a day but is VERY food aggressive with other pets. He is not neutered as he is heartworm positive and on medication so he does mark in the house sometimes and wears a belly band. He has been on car/truck rides and does need a divider up unless you want him to drive . He is going to be the most loving, loyal friend to a lucky person",

Queenie could have been available for adoption already, but knowing what an awesome dog she is, it'll be no time before she has people begging her to choose them and I suppose I just wanted to be selfish and have more time with her. She was in such dire condition when we first got her that she and her brother started having seizures and it did not look good -- but this little lady has never met an obstacle she can't overcome. So she and her brother fought and learned and grew and after a few months, Queenie looked like the royalty she was named for. This dog is funny and fun, she is sweet and so affectionate, she has impeccable dog body language skills. She likes to find her voice sometimes and even her bark is melodic. She loves to play fetch and hide and seek. She loves to cuddle with the other dogs and go on car rides. She prefers a dog bed with a soft blanket to human furniture and her curiosity and excitement about everything is contagious. Even when she is being a total puppy she is a total delight. This dog can do just about anything. While she can find joy in most situations, her dream home would have another dog that wants a companion, people that want to continue her training (this one could rock agility/fast CAT/dock diving), adventures, and a desire to let Queenie's personality shine. She is fully vetted, crate/house/leash trained. She is about 8 months old, 40lbs, a beautiful brindle petite boxer mix (yep, complete with barrel chest and docked tail). She likes everyone and everything but with other pets and people, she expects respect -- she isn't interested in anything \"alpha\" because at this point in evolution, that's just rude. Her adoption fee is $150. After completing the application with references, if we feel you might be a good fit for Q, we will update you on your application and the process. As a small rescue run entirely by volunteers, we thank you in advance for your patience on our response to inquiries.",

Thankfully, we were finally able to secure fosters after they were kinda just the neighborhood pups their whole lives. We honestly have no idea what their breed is. They have long bodies and short little legs like a dachshund. Some have terrier looking heads and some kinda favor a Bulldog. Whatever the mix it\u2019s a cute one. They were born 8/24/20. Being 5 months old they won\u2019t grow much more we believe. Ricky is now 18.8 lbs. We think he will top out around 20 lbs likely. They are sweet pups but haven\u2019t had much socialization with anyone besides the lady that\u2019s been caring for them until they came into our care. Ricky is already enjoying the good life and being indoors. He\u2019s great with all the animals in his foster home and he loves his foster mom. He\u2019s been started on house and kennel training and is doing well. He\u2019s learning all about sleeping in the bed and learning to cuddle. He likely will be a little timid at first in a new situation but will open up quickly. Ricky is utd, dewormed and neutered. \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us .

Luna is an adorable, healthy and sweet puppy, she has had DNA test and is half Siberian Husky (she has a speckle of blue in her right eye) and some German Shepherd also, she is about 6-7 months old and 37 lbs. She is a medium/high energy dog who needs regular exercise. \n\nPlease read all about Luna (below) and if you feel you are a good match for her and want to meet her, please complete an application found on our website, we will be adopting Luna into the Portland area only.\nwww.mywayhomedogrescue.org\n\nLuna had an under socialized beginning but she has gained so much confidence in a very short time. She is smart and learns very quickly. She is crate trained and does well on leash. She is still working on her house-training skills but does follow the other dogs outside. So, if she is let out often she rarely has an accident. Luna loves other dogs and is very playful with her dog friends. She also LOVES snow!\n\nLuna loves car rides but has gotten sick each time she has been in a car. She has not been tested with cats or tested with small dogs. She is shy with new people but is learning quickly that the people who her foster parents introduces her to are ok. No kids please, she is afraid of their energy. \n\nLuna\u2019s perfect home will have an active person or couple with another playful dog(s), and a secure yard. She needs people who have the time and energy to work with her to create amazing dog she is becoming. We are not placing Luna with children or cats. Luna is an amazing little puppy who is looking for an amazing person(s) who wants to work with a smart dog! \n\nLuna has had her vaccinations, heart wormed tested, has been spayed, de-wormed, had flea treatment, and is microchipped. Her adoption fee is $350.",
