Versace gets along well with other dogs but would probably do best with a female dog who is near his size. \n\nIf you are interested in making  Versace a member of your family, please send us a Petfinder inquiry or message Goliad Pet Adoption on FB or fill out an adoption application .on www.goliadpetadoption,com (New and improved website as of September 2019!)Requirements for adoption are listed on our website.\n\nPrior to adoption, all Goliad Pet Adoption dogs are spayed or neutered,  current on vaccinations, have tested negative for heartworms (treated if positive on intake), on heartworm preventative, dewormed  and on flea/tick preventative\n",

My owner passed away tragically and I'm on my own and temporarily staying with friends but their female dog is not accepting me so I have to leave! I'm very sweet, good with all people and I used to live with other dogs but they were all male so I seem to like male dogs more than female dogs.... but it would be best if I was a SOLO DOG. I like to chase cats too much so NO CATS for me and I've never been around young kids so older kids ages 10 yrs + would be best. I walk well on leash, know basic commands and am housebroken. I'm not fond of being crated but I'm not destructive when left alone. I'm young and medium active and still have alot to learn but I'm quick to learn and eager to please. I'm used to living in a home with a large fenced in yard so that would be ideal....but more importantly I need someone that has had previous experience with my breed that will know, understand and & appreciate me!! I'm an ABSOLUTE GEM that will SPARKLE in the right home!\n\nFor more info/application - please email: INFO@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG",

            "description": "She came to the shelter as a stray after being found by a customer down the road from AAP~ Poor little Sierra has had a rough life. She was brought in by a customer coming to adopt a cat after she was found wandering on the highway near the street the shelter is on. Sadly she looked really rough and in bad shape as she was severely malnourished and covered in dirt and fleas. She tested positive for heart worm and has gone through treatment which extended her stay at the shelter. We later discovered that she was previously used for breeding to supplement someone's income. Luckily for her she got away from that life and is now looking for a life of luxury, or at least a comfortable life with lots of love and attention. Despite being mistreated in the past, this sweet girl has nothing to give but LOVE. She loves treats, kisses and most of all cuddles. This sweet little girl is more than ready to go to her forever home to be treated like the princess that she is. She is good with other dogs and great with people. She is older now, more mature and laid back, and would prefer older children as young active children make her a little nervous. She will need some work and reinforcement on house rules and bathroom habits.  Sierra really needs an inside home with a securely fenced yard to play in with her family. She is spayed, vaccinated including rabies, wormed, was treated for heart worm, and micro-chipped. She, like every dog, needs to be on heart worm prevention for life. Come and meet our sweet Sierra!\n\nNote:  To adopt, you must live within approximately 100 miles of one of our adoption sites (Benld, O'Fallon or Springfield IL), and be at least 18 years of age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She listens very well and is such a couch potato... yes we went there lol She loves to go for walks too but she is strong so she needs someone that can handle her strength. Her foster mom is working on her with that and she is doing well. Potatoes needs to be the only pet. She would do ok with older kids but a more low key home is best for her. She is around 7 years old. \n\nPotatoes wasn't dealt the best hand in life. She was found as a stray but we had several people reach out with info about her. We found out she was dumped and that her life was rough and she wasn't treated the best. So this sweet girl is very appreciative of the love she is receiving. We are very excited for her to find her family. Hopefully that will be you.",

            "description": "So sweet!Maria was born around December 1, 2012, and weighs about 20 pounds. Somehow Maria found herself sitting in a high kill shelter in Kentucky. The shelter reached out to us knowing we have a soft spot for older dogs and Joyful happily agreed to bring her to safety. Maria is one incredibly sweet girl! She is all wiggles and kisses when you greet her and just wants to spend time with her humans. Maria does wonderfully with the other dogs and we can't imagine her being an issue with children however with her older age perhaps not teeny tiny children who don't yet know how to be gentle with dogs. Maria appears to have luxating patellas on both hind legs. This is rather common in smaller breed dogs. There is a surgery that can repair the patellas but at Maria's age and seeing that she is not bothered by the condition we are choosing to not do the surgery. Please talk with your vet or do some research to make sure you are comfortable with this if you are thinking about adopting. Maria rode well in the car and walks nicely on a leash. We know you will love her as much as we do!\nfoster mom update!!! She is a joy to have around. Very happy and easy-going. Likes to lounge around with the family. Gets along just fine with all my dogs and cat. She is fully potty trained and has no issues with stairs. We are working on getting her weight down. She is just the sweetest little Chunky Monkey, as I call her.\nThe adoption Fee for this dog is $400.00 Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability.\nIn general, our fees include spay/neuter, all age-appropriate vaccines, Home Again microchipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY. Joyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility. YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES We keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list. If a pet is still showing, it is still available for adoption. Can't Adopt Me? SPONSOR ME Look for the Link 'Special Instructions to Seller' if you want to note a particular pet\nBefore you seek to adopt a pet from Joyful Rescues, please read our Pet Adoption page http://www.joyfulrescues.org/pet_adoption.html.\n\nOnline Application",

            "description": "Charli is quiet and kind. She will just look up and you and wag her tail to let you know she appreciates your help. She can also smile. She warms up to new dogs after a slow introduction. Charli has not been around cats, so we do not know how she would do. She is excellent on leash with a collar and/or harness. She doesn't pull and usually stays by your side. Charli has a low energy level, but we suspect it has more to do with decompressing and symptoms of heartworms. She has spurts of energy and playfulness and is excited to go on walks. But is mostly resting. Thus far we have not encountered too many things that scare her or make her uneasy. She was leery of the garage door, but just viewed it with caution. So far she has taken everything in stride. She is doing excellently with potty training. She goes when we take her out, takes advantage of walks, and has had no accidents in her crate. The past few nights she has slept in the foster's in-home office, out of the crate, and she has done great! We haven't given her the chance to really ask to go out, because we take her out every 2-3 hours. But I think she's smart and would figure it out quickly. Charli would do wonderfully in a quiet home with older kids that can give her the attention she deserves. We think she would be best as an only dog, but can get along with others as she shows no interest in playing with the foster's dog but vies for attention. She really loves people. If local and interested in fostering Charli through her heartworm treatment and then adopting her, please apply.",

All of my young life was on a chain not knowing what a comfy couch was! I am now looking for my forever family after I have learned how to trust new people and how to be in a home. My foster parents would love to meet you as much as I would. If you would like to meet me please email foster@specialpals.org and we will set up a play date.",

            "description": "Hi!! Thank you for checking out my bio. Where do I start? My dame is Dasher. I was found living under an abandon house with my babies right before Christmas. I have never known what a real home is like. I was out here on the streets fending for myself and then I had to protect my babies. This made it hard for me to trust people. On Dec 7th my babies and I were rescued!!! They found their forever homes but I needed more time to learn to trust people. My foster family came and picked me up and they have been wonderful to me. They give me time and space to learn what it is to be a part of a family. Everyday is getting easier and better. As much as I love my foster family I am looking for my forever family. Is that you? I need a family who is patient, kind and caring that will teach me I can trust them. If you feel you could give me that home please email foster@specialpals.org so we can set up a meeting. Thank you!!! P.S. I have a favorite blankie and stuffie that I need to bring with me. I hope you don't mind.",

He is fully vetted and ready to find his forever home.\n\nRambo is very sweet and has typical breed behaviors. He would benefit from a home that will show him boundaries and give him guidance to help him be the best dog possible. Rambo is dog friendly, but is currenlty in a foster that doesnt' have children or cats so we don't know how he is with either.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Rambo please submit an inquiry directly with Greater Charlotte SPCA by visiting charlottespca.org/adopt.\n\n***Because our rescue is composed entirely of volunteers and we require a home check for each of our adoptable pets prior to them going to their new homes, local applications will take precedence. We will accept out of town applications, but any family further than 60 miles from Charlotte is responsible for finding a representative of a rescue local to them that is willing to perform the home check. All out of town applicants will also have to be willing to drive to Charlotte to meet/pick up the pet as soon as the application is approved.***",

            "description": "Layla here- just checking in. Wanted to let y\u2019all know how I\u2019m doing at my new pad.\n\nI am feeling more and more at home each day. This family seems to really like having me around. There\u2019s 2 kids to play with; a little boy and a little girl. It\u2019s so much fun to run around with them in the backyard. We play tag, fetch and hide and seek. There are so many fun smells around... I\u2019ve spotted/smelled at least 12 doggie friends that live right near me. I see them from the deck- sometimes we talk to each other- they all say this is a great place to live.\n\nMom and dad love having me around. I know how to make mom feel better- i snuggle right up to her and sometimes on top of her or dad. They say I am a great snuggler and call me a snuggle-buggle just like the human kids ? \n\nSpeaking of snuggling- they let me sleep on the couch- wow!!! Sometimes, I get lonely so I go upstairs. The little girl loves having me sleep on her bed so I jump up sleep and then surprise her in the morning. Oh and the little boy, asks me to take naps with him. I\u2019ve slept in every comfy spot in the house. \n \nI\u2019ve been a good eater. No new  accidents in the house. I\u2019m pretty good at letting mom and dad know when i need to go out. I do have some stinky toots but they seem to be getting better. \n\nThe whole family has been helping me remember my training. I\u2019m really good at sit, paw, drop it and down; still working on stay and wait- its just that i get so excited to be with my family its hard to stay, but they don\u2019t give up on me. We\u2019ve practiced a little on my leash and mom said I am doing well. I go in the crate when they ask me to. Once I learned that they come back home, I\u2019ve been much better. I just miss them when they leave. \n\nEven though I\u2019ve played with lots of doggy friends at dog daycare, I would really prefer to be the only pet in the home. I would adore having some tiny human siblings to do things with. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting me, please click the link below for an application\nhttps://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/TGD/Dog\n",

            "description": "Sonny\n\nMy name is Sonny and I try hard to live up to my name even though I behave a little more like Eeyore instead. I had a sister who was with me most of my life and since we\u2019ve gotten separated, I can be sad and grumpy because I miss her. I was very protective of her and so I sometimes have trouble around other dogs since I want to be the center of attention and receive the most petting. For this reason I will need to be an only dog.  \n\nI also am not my happiest around young children who can sometimes be unpredictable and startle me.  I have snapped at children in the past and it is important that I go to a home that does not have children or grandchildren.  As far as adults go though, I love to be petted (ears and belly are my favorite), I love taking walks/hikes, and I\u2019ll sit and cuddle during the evening. I\u2019m 8 years old and am a very mellow guy, so\nI\u2019d be a great companion in a quiet, stable, and loving adult-only home. \n\nMy foster parents think I was hit/kicked by a previous owner because I sometimes snap when startled and I have bitten when I\u2019m started too.  They were not bad bites, but I just get so scared when something happens that I am not expecting.  Gentle redirection and assurance that everything is okay are the best ways to correct me, as I really want to please my humans.  I have been evaluated by a trainer, and there are notes and suggestions by the trainer to guide my new owner in the best way to work with me on my behavior, which is for the most part very good!  The trainer even said that I seem to get along with cats!  \n\nMy new owner will need to be committed to helping me work through my issues, and the rescue is willing to pay for a session with the trainer that I saw (Sol Dog) to get my adopter started on the right track. \n\nIf you can deal with a little snoring at night, I am happy to be your new companion during this pandemic and forever!  My adoption fee is $225, and the rescue will pay for the visit with the trainer. \n\nThis dog's adoption fee is a minimum $225.00 donation to help us save more dogs. Southern Arizona Beagle Rescue, SoAZBR is an all-volunteer group. One hundred percent of your donation is used for the care and treatment needy beagles. Your donation is 100% tax deductible, too.\n\nWe URGENTLY need fosters so we can help save more dogs.  If you can help, please contact us.\n\nSouthern Arizona Beagle Rescue Contact Info:\nE-Mail Southern Arizona Beagle Rescue adoption@soazbeaglerescue.com\nSee more of our adoptable at Southern Arizona Beagle Rescue web site http://www.soazbeaglerescue.com \nPhone us at (520) 247-7720",

            "description": "Say hello to our little friend, Colby Jack! CJ or Colby for short. This handsome boy is 15lbs of pure love who enjoys being carried and held. We'd classify him as an ambivert because he enjoys socializing at the dog park and recharges by gnawing on a bone in a corner or sleeping on the nearest blanket. He's very calm, quiet, and low energy. When inside, he will follow you around in hopes of getting in your lap or laying down next to you for a nap. He's house trained and crate trained! \n\nDon't be fooled by his tiny legs. This little guy loves his walks and will go for as long as you let him. He's never met a dog or human he doesn't like, whether kids or adults. He just loves being loved on, and who can resist his precious, bearded face?! \n\nHe will do better when left alone in a crate before giving him free rein so he can get used to his surroundings and used to you coming and going. When encouraged and rewarded with treats (jerky or soft chews are his faves), he will lay down inside and take a nap. This little man is a great car companion as well! He will jump right into his seat and lay down and occasionally prop up to the window to see the view and, if you let him, get some sniffs through the window.\n\n\nColby's been a sweetheart and deserves a fur-ever home that will show him the same unconditional love they will get from him in return.  Interested in adoption? Make sure you have an application filled out on our website at www.austincockerrescue.org and email us at woof@austincockerrescue.org. We are not accepting out of state applications at this time.",

He is playful and loves to run and he he is protective of his family.  He is super smart and house trained - knows sit, lay down, paw, high five, roll over, and speak.

If you meet \n\nThor's checklist, in exchange you will receive the most loving, intelligent dog imaginable. \n\nThor would also benefit from a foster home within a two hour radius of Virginia Beach. \n\nThor loves people, walks, toys and couch time. He is house broken and for the most part respectful of things when you are away. Now and then, there may be a dish towel pulled down or a couple of your possessions on the floor. I have never seen him tear up anything, except on rare occasion, a paper towel. His ideal would be someone working from home or retired, Thor will patiently stay by your feet until your time is his. He is alpha and although he hasn't bitten another dog, he does try to mount them to show his dominance; therefore, he should be an only dog. We recommend no children and a quiet, nurturing home. Thor can be a talker but it is not over-the-top. Thor's back story is his Dad was tragically killed a year ago in a terrible traffic accident. Thor was shutdown for a long time, but now he is embracing the changes in his life and he's ready for his second chance. Overall, Thor corrects easily and is obedient to commands, which he definitely knows, but he is incredibly strong, a true powerhouse. He has a bit record from when he was a pup and still should be closely monitored when meeting people. Thor requires an alpha pack leader (human).He needs a person that is calm, firm and consistent with boundaries. With Thor, you will only win if you are mentally stronger than him and able to withstand his stubborn tendencies, especially in the beginning of your bond. In return, you will get a best friend. I don't say that lightly. Thor is a magnificent dog for the right owner. He has shown his grander to me and several fosters. Thor is incredibly smart and has the biggest heart for his person(s). He needs a smart owner. He wears his heart on his shoulder and he just wants to be with you. He loves to ride shotgun in the car. -don't let his age be a deterrent. Thor is the healthiest dog I know and he can out maneuver dogs a third of his age.",

Potential adopters are responsible for communicating directly with the pet's guardian.\n\nCora would prefer to be the only dog in your house. She has lived with cats and done very well. She has also lived with chickens and horses and done well with them. Cora does very well with kids and smaller dogs. She doesn't really enjoy being around bigger dogs. She had a traumatic experience with an electric fence that has caused her to react poorly to her old dog best friend which is why she will need to be listed.\n\nIf you would like to inquire into adopting this pet please Call \t812-361-2900",

Sweet, loving, friendly, affectionate. Crate trained and housebroken. Understands \u201csit.\u201d   Loves to be with her people.  Good on a leash, rides great in the car.  Healthy and fully vetted, current on shots, spayed, weighs about 60 pounds.  AWESOME young dog will make a wonderful companion (and jogging partner!) for an active family who loves the breed. Here\u2019s a note from Lyric\u2019s owner:  \u201cI rescued Lyric about a year ago when she was just a baby (the last of a litter) because I knew her prospects weren\u2019t good.  She\u2019s been a loving companion to me for the past year, but I now realize Lyric needs a family that\u2019s physically active with more time for her who can continue her training and socialization.  I\u2019ve been unable to introduce Lyric to any kids, cats or other dogs and, although she\u2019s a sweet soul, I\u2019m unsure how she would respond. I just want the best for Lyric.\u201d\n\nTo adopt please fill out an adoption http://www.happydogrescue.org/Application175.html.\n\nContact us at reply@happydogrescue.org \n\nvisit us at http://www.happydogrescue.org",

            "description": "Meet Remi! She's an approx. 5-6 month old, 35 lb girl who we believe is a Dutch Shepherd mix. Due to her breed mix she has a ton of energy and doesn't like to be alone (she vocalizes this very well!), so apartments will be a no-go for Remi. She loves running, playing with toys and other dogs as well as snuggling her people. She does okay with cats right now, but her prey drive is pretty high so we'd prefer no cats in the home, as well as no children under 5 since she is a decent sized puppy and can be nippy when playing. Remi would prefer that her people be home more often than not and have a fenced in yard for her to run and play in! \n\nGo to www.foreverhomedogs.org to submit an application for Remi if you're interested. Her adoption fee will be $250.All adoptions are $200 per dog which include spay/neuter, micro-chipped and up-to-date on required shots. \n\nSenior dogs, at our discretion, are adopted out at $100 per dog because we know they will have less time with your family and may eventually have more needs as they get older. But we feel these dogs deserve to live out the rest of their lives as part of a loving family.",

He was turned into us as a lab and weimaraner mix due to his grey toned body. We actually think he is a lab, possibly weimaraner, with blue pit in him, a \"\"pittador\"\" as they are called. He is a very nice 50 pound boy who does great on a leash and seems to be kennel trained as he does go outside to go potty in his indoor and outdoor kennel. He was owned by a family who had him from 7 weeks and he has had lots of love in his life. He is a very well balanced and friendly boy who loves everyone. He would be a great family pet for an active family. He is now neutered and microchipped and fully vaccinated and ready to go. His adoption fee is $200 which covers his surgery and his medical work.",

She is now spayed and fully vaccinated and will come with a microchip as well. She is ready to go and would love a family to play with and cuddle with. We will be cat testing her soon.

            "description": "Hi yall, My name is Mahib and it means brave. My foster named me this because when I an my litter mates were found we had been out exploring while our mom was looking for food. My foster said that we were all brave puppies ready to explore a strange world, so she decided to give us all names that mean brave. See my mom was a stray dog and she took really good care of us. She had us hid under an old deserted barn so that we would safe and warm. When we were about 6 weeks old mom went out looking for food for her. While she was gone a couple of us decided to go exploring. A lady who lived nearby saw us before we could hide. She sent out the word to her friends and before the day was out we were all rescued. Now we have a warm doghouse and kennel to stay in until we can find our forever homes. Our foster mom has told us all about this place called Wisconsin where she says we will find our forever families. She said that there are wonderful people there who will treat us like family and will love us forever. She also told us that we will get to play in something she called snow. She said it was wet and cold but that she was sure we would love it. I don't know about my littermates, but I am excited, especially about the snow! I can't wait to meet my new family. If you think you need a little brave puppy, then please go to Sandipaws.org and complete the application to adopt. Can't wait to meet you! Licks and love, Mahib.\nThank you for your interest in a Sandi Paws Rescue, Inc.

            "description": "My name is Dot and I'm a goofy, floppy puppy that loves to play non stop. My foster family likes to play the song Baby Shark while I try to puppy-bite their toes. I will need lots of play time, redirection with my puppy antics, and a family who is committed to helping me grow into my best, most well-behaved girl! I currently have foster canine, felines, and human siblings. I get along with all of them swimmingly! I am a true hound and as I grow will show my true natures- chasing, and baying. I will need a family who can help me channel my natural instincts and expose me to all the great parts of being a loved family member- with positive reward. \n\nDots is a Hound puppy. Hounds are adorable and also high-energy. Hounds are typically bred for hunting and will likely have a very high prey drive, be vocal, and will need to have access to resources that will satisfy her energy level. Potential adopters should have a good understanding of the needs that come with having an active puppy and those of a working/hunting breed as well. Positive exposure and reinforcement are a must in her adoptive home, along with a solid plan for training and further socializing with other pets of all ages and sizes. \n\nTo be considered, please start by applying online at caws.org. \nDots's adoption fee is $300 and includes her fist year vaccines, spay and microchip. \n\nPlease note that we carefully select each adoptive home to meet the needs of the animals in our care and not on a first come, first serve basis. Thanks! If you are interested in adopting a CAWS pet, please fill out an online application at https://caws.org/adoption-application",

            "description": "Hello! My name is Ebenezer and I'm sort of a miracle dog myself. I'm an 8 year old, 16 lb shih tzu who had it rough for a while. I love people, I just want to snuggle. I am nearly blind but I get along pretty well. I learn my environment quickly and sometimes you can't even tell I'm blind. I do suffer from chronic dry eye and require daily eye drops and ointments. And I will admit, I'm not the easiest dog to take eye drops. :) I get along with everyone, dogs, cats, bunnies. I will tell you if I'm uncomfortable or surprised, with little nips, so ilI shouldn't be in a home with little kids. I came to CAWS with a large mass that was remofed and biopsy results came back benign. I have some bumps and lumps that are fatty masses but should be monitored. I am housetrained, I do ok in a crate, although I might whine. Overall I'm a sweet, mellow old man who just wants love, a warm doggie bed, and cuddles. \n\nDogs are not placed on a first-come, first-serve basis. We strive to find the perfect home for each animal. Applications may take up to 48 hours to process.\n\nAll CAWS animals are fixed, microchipped, and vaccinated. His adoption fee is $200. If you are interested in adopting a CAWS pet, please fill out an online application at http://caws.org/adoption-application If you are interested in adopting a CAWS pet, please fill out an online application at https://caws.org/adoption-application",

You can find these applications by going to http://humanemorgan.org/index.php?page=adoption \n\nABOUT ADOPTING FROM THE HSMC: \nThe shelter address is 1170 Fairground Rd. Madison, GA 30650. For more information on any of our pets, please feel free to email us at INFO@HUMANEMORGAN.ORG give us a call at 706-343-9977. \nAll dogs are heartworm negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nAll cats are FeLv/FIV negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nWe are open 10am-5pm Monday-Saturday, we schedule our last adoption at 4pm everyday to allow our staff enough time to feed and walk dogs. \nWe are an animal shelter and therefore are not able to individually potty train our residents. Many adult dogs do arrive \"\"house broken\"\" however due to animal behavior any change in environment will make an emotional impact on the animals and therefore initiate unwanted behaviors during the acclamation period. Please keep this in mind. Puppies do not have the biological maturity to maintain absolute bladder or bowel control and will require a certain degree of potty training and house breaking. Please consider the time and commitment it takes to provide the necessary building blocks for these special babies, prior to submitting your application. \nIf you have any questions please email us at info@humanemorgan.org and provide name of the animal you are interested in, in the subject line. \nThank you, HSMC Staff \n\nADOPTION FEES Adoption Fees may change without notice. Always verify the fee when finalizing the adoption. \n~ Cats and Kittens ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $100 \n* 1-5 Years = $75 \n* Over 5 Years = $50 \n** Purebred cats and kittens may be subject to special pricing \n\n~ Mix Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $200 \n* 1 -3 Years = $175 \n* 4-8 Years = $150 \n* Over 8 Years = $100\n\n~ Purebred and Designer Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $375 \n* 1-3 Years = $350 \n* 4-8 Years = $275 \n* Over 8 Years = $150 \n\n~ Medical and Special Needs ~ \nWe have rescued dogs and cats which require additional medical care or that have special needs which are not life threatening. In these cases we may require a higher fee to help recoup the costs of their care while at our rescue.",

He will need somebody who is willing to give him exercise and some basic training. We have been told Bee does well with children, but may knock them over, and cats as well. He loves to play and interact with other dogs. DOb 1/11/2020, weighs almost 70 pounds...All pets have lifetime sanctuary at Haven of the Ozarks. If they cannot remain with their adopter, they must be returned to the Haven.\n\nAdoption fees are as follows: \nPuppies under the age of 6 months - $125\nDogs weighing 30 pounds and less - $125 \nDogs ages 6 months to 5 yrs old - $90\nDogs over the age of 5 yrs old - $75.\nCats under the age of 6 months old - $75\nCats over the age of 6 months old - $65",

She doesn't snap or anything, just ducks and runs away. As she gets used to you, she begins to play - loves to tug and play with toys. Gets very excited.

To arrange a meet and greet with a dog, you MUST fill out the adoption application so that it can be sent to the foster parent for review to determine if your home is a match for the dog. If a dog receives multiple applications, we operate on a best-fit basis, not first come first served.***\n\nPeanut Butter is an extremely intelligent, playful, and energetic - yet well-mannered young man. He does not like being left alone, but, can be taught that it is OK for short periods. He would love to have another playmate though and has done well with everything from small Feist mixes to Great Danes and everything in-between at his foster home. He is a \"\"strong\"\" chewer that would do better with harder chew toys or bones as he may pick the stuffing out of soft toys, but, he is easily corrected if you happen to catch him.\n\nHe sits, shakes, sits before his meals and waits to be told to \"\"go ahead\"\" to eat, comes when he is called, and can be exuberant on a leash, but, again - is easily corrected and with time, should walk like a dream. If left without exercise and mental stimulation though, Peanut Butter could find all kinds of new holes to dig in your yard and/or turn your indoor space into a full-speed race-track.\n\nPeanut Butter is a lover who craves your attention and likes to be near his family, especially cuddling, both human and furry.\n\nHe is up to date on vaccinations, neutered, microchipped, dewormed, and on heartworm and flea/tick prevention. The adoption fee is $300. If you think Peanut Butter could be the one for you, please fill out an adoption application on our website: www.secondchancenc.org. Thank you!",

            "description": "Hey there I'm Doc! I am not quite a doctor yet, but I have enough puppy cuteness that I could heal you from any illness! I am a 7 month old Catahoula mix am a gentle pup who am still growing. I am about 30 lbs now and can likely grow up to 60 lbs. What is unique about me is that, I have catahoula looking markings but am stealthy built with a nubby tail that is non stop wagging. I have a super soft coat that I would love for someone to always be petting. I sometimes forget that I am not tiny and will crawl into your lap like I am a little lap dog! \n\nIf you are interested in learning more about him, contact his foster mom Liz at 214-616-6128.

            "description": "BamBam loves to dance! He has been dancing for his dinner at the shelter - up on his hind legs twirling around. He is about a year old and true to his chihuahua DNA - he is charming, alert with a big-dog attitude. He plays well with dogs his size and the big boys. BamBam has been observed to be good with kids. He is now safe in a foster home out in the country. He could live in the city or country as long as he has a human side-kick. \n\nBamBam will require training to become his best self, as he's little and jumpy - it's best to have manners at any size. Special care should be taken in cold weather since BamBam has never seen snow and he is a southern dog with a short coat. He's the right size to dress up, though it will be a new experience to him. He is affectionate and loves to be held, he can be wiggly when he's ready to play again.\n\nThe adoption fee is $600.00. He is up to date on vaccines according to age, has received proper deworming, and comes with additional dewormer if needed. This pet is microchipped, spayed, comes with 2-6 months of Heartworm preventative, and one month free trial of pet insurance if registered by adopter with insurance company. All animals receive a health certificate (stating that a licensed veterinarian saw the pet and deemed it healthy for travel, but is not a promise of perfect health.) Our transports are USDA certified and the cost of transport is included in adoption fee!\n\n \n\nHe is currently being fostered in Houston, Tx but will be traveling to the PNW on 02-06-2021 and arriving 2-3 days later in Washington. \n\n \n\nDue to the Covid-19 crisis we are experiencing a dramatic influx in inquiries and adoption applications. If you have questions regarding a pup you are interested in please fill out an adoption application. Once received it can take up to a week to complete our review. Be assured we have received your received your application! If you need more information regarding a pup you are interested in, the process of filling out an adoption application is still required prior to answering detailed questions. We value our potential adopters time and appreciate your patience as our staff navigate through the blessing of an overwhelming response for adoptions.\n\n \n\nPlease inquire by submitting an application (Application link here) : https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/30255/generic \n\nQuestions, Adoption Coordinator - leah@threelittlepittiesrescue.org\n\n \n\nPlease go to our website to see more about our rescue and what we do! We are very proud of our hard work in saving as many animals as we can, giving them what they need, and matching them with the right families.",

I originally grew up with my big sister by my side, and now I have a husky foster sister, so I enjoy having dog friends. Youll win me over with neck scritches and belly rubs, so you better expect to give me some love often I would really love a home with a fenced backyard, as Im happiest when I get to explore and play with a doggy and then get some attention from you. Im currently getting used to crate training and will need a family to work on general training (positive reinforcement only). Im also working on potty training, mainly because I sometimes get nervous and a little pee comes out (oopsies!). Cant wait to love a forever family of my own!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org/adopt",

            "description": "Hi, I am Siri, a Lab/Pointer Mix and I am almost 3 months old. I am a bit shy at first but once I get comfortable I am a very energetic puppy that loves to run and play. I love toys and with the help of my sister , Pixel, we find those crazy squeakers and kill them after we play with them some more. I know sit and I am working on my other commands. Im also learning to walk on the leash not so sure about that yet. I will kennel up (especially if treats are involved). Im your typical rambunctious pup that just keeps on going. I really like people and love to get in lots of snuggles and kisses. I enjoy playing and wrestling with Pixel. I have not played with other dogs yet but have met the neighbors bigger dogs and love to visit with them through the fence. I have not been exposed to cats. I will need someone with patience that is willing to work with me on basic commands and potty training as I am not fully potty trained. You will need to teach me where to go and how to ask until I get the hang of it. I kennel at night and when my foster family is away. If you are looking for a puppy that will want LOTS of attention and you have the patience for a puppy, I may be what you are looking for. I will need toys or chew bones to keep me occupied, maybe a playmate and of course lots of snuggles and kisses from you.\n\nI am ready to move into my new home anytime. I am scheduled to be spayed, I have been microchipped, dewormed and received my puppy shots along with rabies. My adoption fee is $400. Apply for me at www.bassetandbeagle.org if you are ready for a forever companion. I am currently fostered in Omaha NE.",

To be honest with you, my foster mom cannot say enough good things about me; I have a golden personality - I'm lovable, friendly to all people, great with other dogs, and I live to please. \n\nI'm kid-friendly, and I have never met a stranger. I have a great energy level and am the perfect balance between playful and a couch potato. I love being pet and spending time with my people, especially cuddling up next to you on the couch. I'm good with other dogs of all sizes and ages - I'm in a foster home with a morkipoo, a golden, a blind senior Boston, and my puppies. I'm very kind, patient, and gentle with my puppies. My foster mom thinks it is so sweet how I will pick up my toys and take it to them so they can play with me. \n\nI'm a smart pup who is highly motivated to be a good girl. I walk well on a leash and know several commands like 'sit', 'down' and 'paw' (and I love getting treats when I do them). You don't need to crate me when I'm home alone either because I'm not destructive. I also come when my name is called - I will come right up to you and put my paws on your lap or rest my head against you. My ideal home would be one with children or another dog to play with or someone who enjoys going on nice walkies every day. I'm a total sweetheart and a such a gem! I know I'll make my future person or people very happy.\n\n\nMy adoption fee is $200. This includes a spay/neuter, up-to-date vaccines, deworming, a microchip, a heartworm test, and, if needed, heartworm treatment.\n\n________________________________________________\n\n\nFor more information email: adopt@animalrescueneworleans.org.\n\nTo complete an application, please visit: https://animalrescueneworleans.org/adoptfoster/.\n\n________________________________________________\n\nFor all animals that have not been spayed or neutered a $100 deposit will be required in addition to the adoption fee. The deposit is refundable upon completion of the spay / neuter surgery.\n\nFor more information email: adopt@animalrescueneworleans.org.\n\nTo complete an application, please visit: https://animalrescueneworleans.org/adoptfoster/.\n\nPlease visit our facebook for more information about adoption specials, and adoption events.

We are no longer answering phone calls and are doing all communications with adopters via email. If you have a dog you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application before sending us emails. When your application has been processed, you will receive an email from us with further instructions on how to adopt. You do not need a new application for every dog that you are interested in adopting. \n\nAt MAMCO we understand that in order to continue rescuing moms and babies, we must stretch our finances as far as we are able. For this reason we use variable adoption pricing. By assigning higher adoption fees to high demand moms and puppies, we are able to rescue more families in need.The money raised through these adoptions acts as a benefactor to moms and puppies in our care who require expensive veterinary treatments, have behavioral issues, or need more time to find a home. We often reduce the adoption fees on these harder-to-place moms and puppies to help them find forever families. Adoption fees vary, but all include spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccinations and deworming, rabies vaccine at the time of spay or neuter, and 30 days of pet insurance. We also cover hernia repair and cherry eye repair at the time of spay or neuter. Applications can be filled out at mamcorescue.org.",

We are thrilled that so many people want to adopt right now, but we are not equipped to handle the large number of calls, applications, and email inquiries we are receiving. We are no longer answering phone calls and are doing all communications with adopters via email. If you have a dog you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application before sending us emails. When your application has been processed, you will receive an email from us with further instructions on how to adopt. You do not need a new application for every dog that you are interested in adopting. \n\nAt MAMCO we understand that in order to continue rescuing moms and babies, we must stretch our finances as far as we are able. For this reason we use variable adoption pricing. By assigning higher adoption fees to high demand moms and puppies, we are able to rescue more families in need.The money raised through these adoptions acts as a benefactor to moms and puppies in our care who require expensive veterinary treatments, have behavioral issues, or need more time to find a home. We often reduce the adoption fees on these harder-to-place moms and puppies to help them find forever families. Adoption fees vary, but all include spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccinations and deworming, rabies vaccine at the time of spay or neuter, and 30 days of pet insurance. We also cover hernia repair and cherry eye repair at the time of spay or neuter. Applications can be filled out at mamcorescue.org.",

We are no longer answering phone calls and are doing all communications with adopters via email. If you have a dog you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application before sending us emails. When your application has been processed, you will receive an email from us with further instructions on how to adopt. You do not need a new application for every dog that you are interested in adopting. \n\nAt MAMCO we understand that in order to continue rescuing moms and babies, we must stretch our finances as far as we are able. For this reason we use variable adoption pricing. By assigning higher adoption fees to high demand moms and puppies, we are able to rescue more families in need.The money raised through these adoptions acts as a benefactor to moms and puppies in our care who require expensive veterinary treatments, have behavioral issues, or need more time to find a home. We often reduce the adoption fees on these harder-to-place moms and puppies to help them find forever families. Adoption fees vary, but all include spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccinations and deworming, rabies vaccine at the time of spay or neuter, and 30 days of pet insurance.

We are thrilled that so many people want to adopt right now, but we are not equipped to handle the large number of calls, applications, and email inquiries we are receiving. We are no longer answering phone calls and are doing all communications with adopters via email. If you have a dog you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application before sending us emails. When your application has been processed, you will receive an email from us with further instructions on how to adopt. You do not need a new application for every dog that you are interested in adopting. \n\nAt MAMCO we understand that in order to continue rescuing moms and babies, we must stretch our finances as far as we are able. For this reason we use variable adoption pricing. By assigning higher adoption fees to high demand moms and puppies, we are able to rescue more families in need.The money raised through these adoptions acts as a benefactor to moms and puppies in our care who require expensive veterinary treatments, have behavioral issues, or need more time to find a home. We often reduce the adoption fees on these harder-to-place moms and puppies to help them find forever families. Adoption fees vary, but all include spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccinations and deworming, rabies vaccine at the time of spay or neuter, and 30 days of pet insurance. We also cover hernia repair and cherry eye repair at the time of spay or neuter. Applications can be filled out at mamcorescue.org.",

            "description": "Remi is the sweetest, most low key puppy ever! She loves to snuggle and take naps (shes a big snorer and will steal your pillow!) Remis incredibly well behaved and loves people. Her favorite part about walks is saying hi to all the humans! Her tail never stops wagging. She also loves to play with other dogs and would be an awesome addition to a growing fur family. Shes an independent pup who loves tagging along with her humans to their adventures in the mountains, heading to the office, or just on the couch! A funny fact about Remi is shes obsessed with mirrors. This girl deserves all the love in the world!\n\n*Due to concerns surrounding COVID-19, we have reformatted the way that we do adoptions in order to follow social distancing protocols. We are thrilled that so many people want to adopt right now, but we are not equipped to handle the large number of calls, applications, and email inquiries we are receiving. We are no longer answering phone calls and are doing all communications with adopters via email. If you have a dog you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application before sending us emails. When your application has been processed, you will receive an email from us with further instructions on how to adopt. You do not need a new application for every dog that you are interested in adopting. \n\nAt MAMCO we understand that in order to continue rescuing moms and babies, we must stretch our finances as far as we are able. For this reason we use variable adoption pricing. By assigning higher adoption fees to high demand moms and puppies, we are able to rescue more families in need.The money raised through these adoptions acts as a benefactor to moms and puppies in our care who require expensive veterinary treatments, have behavioral issues, or need more time to find a home. We often reduce the adoption fees on these harder-to-place moms and puppies to help them find forever families. Adoption fees vary, but all include spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccinations and deworming, rabies vaccine at the time of spay or neuter, and 30 days of pet insurance. We also cover hernia repair and cherry eye repair at the time of spay or neuter. Applications can be filled out at mamcorescue.org.",

Either way, he's ready to find a new forever home who will love him and keep him safe!All animals are altered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, licensed (dogs). Cats tested for FELV/FIV. Dogs tested for Heartworm. All animals are available to the first family that is a good match, and if we have more than one animal who is a good match, there will be a lottery for all matches. Note that families must have come in to our adoption center and spoken with an adoption counselor prior to any lottery (when we have lotteries, they usually occur on Saturday mornings).",

            "description": "Meet our beautiful Sadie. She came to us in distress after her owner died and the family could not keep her. She went to the county pound where she struggled like many dogs do and then on to a home for a few months where an aggressive dog gave her a hard time. Unfortunately, while there she was kept in a room by herself for long periods of time which made her sad. When we got her she was scared and nervous and it's taken her a few weeks with us to decompress. She is still a nervous girl who needs a lot of patience and love. She has trouble meeting people especially men and we are working with the CFP trainers who have taught us how to let her warm to people at her own pace. We introduced her to several other foster dogs, and she did well, but she is not okay with all dogs especially smaller dogs. We think Sadie would do best in an only dog home with a loving experienced owner. We give her free reign in the house, and she has never chewed, is not high energy and is fully house trained. She loves her walks and is learning her leash manners. A home with a fenced yard would be ideal because she blossoms when she is outside running around and is as happy as can be. She is the cutest little girl but does not make a good first impression because she is shy and nervous of new situations. On her walks and in our yard, she loves to sniff and hunt squirrels and is a happy soul. After a few weeks with us she is loving and affectionate and we are sure she will make someone a perfect companion. Her big dark eyes will melt your heart so come see Sadie and give her a chance at a forever home.\n\nIf you are interested in this animal please start by filling out an adoption application at <a href=\"\"http://www.cfp-nc.org/adopt\"\">CFP-NC.org/adopt</a> and we will get in touch with you.",

She loves lots of attention, likes long walks and does well on leash. Sandy has a lot of energy so she needs a place to run around and work out the zoomie, a nice fenced yard would be great for her getting her. She could do well in an apartment as long as she gets her walks and exercise each day.\n\nSandy seems to be dog friendly and it's recommended that she would do better in a setting with older kids. She is learning not to jump and currently is doing well. Most importantly Sandy is house trained and is crate trained which is great! She does well when she is in her crate while alone. Sandy likes toys but she is a chewer, so would do well with durable toys and things to keep her occupied. In the end of the day shell be the first one to lay on the couch and cuddle with you. Sandy is looking for a loving home with her furever family to love her and play with her.\n\nAs part of Sandy's $250 adoption fee, she is spayed, microchipped, up to date on vaccines, and current on her monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventatives. If you have questions about this sweet girl, you can email Dogteam@pawsforlifenc.org. If you wish to adopt Sandy, you can fill in an online application for her under the Adopt a Pet Tab on our website: www.pawsforlifenc.org.",

This beautiful girl was surrendered due to absolutely no fault of her own. Sapphire has had a rough life and was used as a breeding dog. She was skinny and heartworm positive upon intake. She will undergo a full heartworm treatment and be spayed. She is available for preadoption now and will be able to leave after her vetting is completed. She came in with the spice litter and does share a kennel with them. She does tolerate them but weve not put her around adult dogs yet. Sapphire does not like to use the bathroom in her kennel so we believe shed housebreak easily. \n\nKeep up with us, our events, our adoptable animals, etc on our Facebook page under Mollys Mutts Animal Rescue!

            "description": "Sweet momma Milan was rescued from an absuive situation and luckily brought to Muddy Paws in time to comfortably give birth on 1/13/2021. More information will be posted as the babies start to explore the world and show their personalities. They will be ready to go to new homes on 3/10/2021. Please check back for pupdates!\n\nSince this puppy may be too young to be altered at the time of adoption, the adopters will be provided with a voucher to have the puppy altered and microchipped by the time he is 6 months of age. This must be done at Nebraska Humane Society. If you prefer to take the puppy to your own vet, we will pay a PORTION of the cost ($69) to your vet of choice\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for this puppy is $450. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

If interested in adoption submit an adoption application and red the important information below : \n\nAlcovy dogs are spayed/neutered soon, up to date on all vaccines, up to date on heart-worm preventative and flea preventative and micro-chipped.\nIf interested in adoption, please complete an online application on Alcovy Pet Rescue's website at www.alcovypet.com. You must have a vet reference to adopt. We verify the care of past/current pets. Applications without a vet reference will not be approved for adoption.

He loves lounging on his back and getting petting and belly rubs. He's also so excited to go for a walk, and come back home to play with his favorite stuffed squirrel toy. He can entertain himself by tossing around his kongs and lacrosse balls. This polite boy usually walks well on his leash; he pulls when he's excited to see other dogs and new people he wants to meet so he could use some continued training. He will go right up to people for some pets. He also likes hanging out in the backyard, running along the fence to greet the neighbor dogs. As a smartie pants, he understands what 'sit,' 'down' and 'shake' mean, and is learning about other commands. He's also a house-trained pup who's making progress on crate training. This chill, well-behaved boy will be a great fit in a wide variety of homes. He would love to have a doggie housemate, and for sure hopes for love and affection from his humans - and petting and treats. Come meet your future cuddle buddy! He'll follow you home.",

She's a loyal companion who wants to stay by your side. This mature lady has plenty of spunk, and youthful energy to play with her squeaky toys and chomp on bones. A good bone or toy keeps her calm and busy. She also loves to go on short strolls and sniff all those interesting things outside. Mrs. Pickles is smart and keen to learn, and seems to pick up training quickly! She knows how to 'sit' and 'shake,' and is a pretty good listener. She may be a big gal, but she walks well on the leash, doesn't get easily distracted, and will stay by your side. She's very treat-motivated, but needs few treats to make sure she remains at a healthy weight. She's also a house-trained girl who does really well in her crate when she's home alone. She is looking for a cozy place to call home and a forever companion to share snuggles with. Come meet her!",

He loves to gaze at humans with his kind eyes. Edric is a calm, gentle boy who's also encountered dogs on his walks, and even in a coffee shop he visited. He's mildly curious and wags his tail at them, and at new humans he meets. He likes everyone! He walks well on his leash, wagging at silly squirrels. At home, he's happy to lay down next to his people, including his teenage housemate. Plus, he's house-trained and does well in his crate, going in for a snooze. Edric is a patient, quiet boy who would love a home with playful humans. He is heartworm positive, but all that means is that he'll need a couple of months of rest during treatment, at APA!'s expense. Come meet this tail wagger, he'll be so happy to see you.",

            "description": "Nellie Fur-dog-o is like a bird who wants to fly away from the shelter and into your home! This exceptionally sweet lady loves her people -- and the occasional hot dog. She likes to snuggle and snore next to you on the couch or in bed, but also sometimes likes to do her own thing and snooze in the other room. She likes to be petted under her chin and on her chest as she slowly relaxes and falls asleep, as if hypnotized. Although Nellie is older, she is spunky and doesn't show many signs of it - her joints and vision seem as good as new. She can hear pretty well, and she trots along quickly on walks (though she could use someone to help her with her leash skills)! She is heartworm positive, but all that means is that she'll need a couple of months of rest during treatment, at APA!'s expense. Nellie is calmly affectionate and you can see her loving nature in her big brown eyes. She is crate-trained and knows to head in there for bedtime with her stuffed unicorn. She also hangs out in her crate calmly when left home alone. She's house-trained (just show her where to go at first, as with all dogs!) and she is not a barker. In fact, her foster has only heard her bark once! She would prefer a home where people are home a decent amount of time so she can get her pets, and would probably prefer to be the only animal in the house, though she may do fine with another dog. Nellie would love to meet you, show you her wags, get your petting, and head home with you to be your TV binge buddy. Come meet her today!",

            "description": "JETSKI, 5 years old, is 1 of 4 dogs surrendered to CCHS on 1/20/21 for hoarding. He's a solid, 80 lb. hunk of a Terrier who sasses you with plenty of barking when penned. Jetski's most unusual trait is the peculiar goat, or baying, groan that he makes when he's lonely. The first time you hear him make this sound, you'll find yourself stopping dead in your tracks searching for an animal you don't own, then laughing when you realize it's Jetski! That pretty much sums up Jestki. He's goofy, lively, friendly and sweet. Jetski's a good walker, sits immediately when he hears the treat bag and sits on command. He's a leaner and despite his low rider carriage, he occasionally tries to jump up and put his paws on you. Jetski's adoption fee is $150. He is altered, current on shots, wormed, microchipped and treated with monthly heart worm, flea and tick preventive.",

He is crate trained.No longer concerned about his figure he does not require much exercise and is happy to lay next to you on the couch and watch TV or lay at your feet while you check your Facebook status. He was heartworm positive when he came into rescue and has been treated. However he will need another heartworm test before being adopted.LOCATED IN CROSSVILLE, CUMBERLAND COUNTY, TN.

I am already neutered and am crate trained. I love kids and all humans! I get along great with my foster sister I just need slow intros to know everything will be ok! Word on the rescue street is I give the best hugs ever. My foster family says whoever picks me will be the luckiest people ever! That makes my heart feel so good! Im so excited to be in Minnesota so I can finely find my forever family who will love me. Im so excited to share my love and hugs! Please fill out an adoption application and I will share all my doggie hugs with you forever!",

They are a sweet bonded pair who are ready to find their forever home together.\n\nGinger and Tulip were extremely fearful when they first came to us. They've spent some time in a loving foster home and it's really helped them start learning how to trust people. It took them some time to become comfortable in their foster home and we expect the same will happen in their forever home. Because of this, an extremely patient and understanding adopter will be important. It will take time for them to be comfortable with a new person showing them affection. Once they trust you, these girls are the sweetest cuddle bugs. They are loving, low-key, and quiet - they'd prefer a home where their humans are the same. They are crate trained, potty trained, and do well with cats and other dogs.\n\nGinger looks up to Tulip and will follow her lead. Out of the two, Ginger takes longer to open up and trust new people. She is more fearful of the male in her foster home and only recently has started to become comfortable with him. \n\nThe minimum adoption fee for Ginger and Tulip is $375 plus a $12 fee per dog for rabies registration for McLean County residents.\n\nShe has been spayed, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm checked, dewormed, and is on flea and heartworm preventatives.\n\nTo be considered for adoption, you must first submit the application found at: \n http://fs16.formsite.com/WishBoneCanineRescue/adoptionapplication/index.html\n\nFor information about this dog's breed(s), visit: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/abc.htm \n",

Joy would only do well in a home with a non playful and more submissive dog. She also needs a home without cats. If you would like to make Joy a part of your family please go to www.barktownrescue.org and fill out an adoption application.\nJoy's Adoption Fee: $170The shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at the dog's predominant breed or breed mix. We strongly encourage you to select your new pet by looking at each dog's individual personality and pet qualities rather than relying on a breed label that is only our best guess.\n\nOur adoption fees vary from $150 and up. All of our dogs are up to date on vaccines, heart worm preventives, and flea/tick medication, and will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption.

            "description": "This is Tulip! She is a 5 1/2 year old mixed breed pup who weighs 18.2 pounds. Tulip came to us with her sister, Ginger. They are a sweet bonded pair who are ready to find their forever home together.\n\nGinger and Tulip were extremely fearful when they first came to us. They've spent some time in a loving foster home and it's really helped them start learning how to trust people. It took them some time to become comfortable in their foster home and we expect the same will happen in their forever home. Because of this, an extremely patient and understanding adopter will be important. It will take time for them to be comfortable with a new person showing them affection. Once they trust you, these girls are the sweetest cuddle bugs. They are loving, low-key, and quiet - they'd prefer a home where their humans are the same. They are crate trained, potty trained, and do well with cats and other dogs.\n\nTulip is the more confident of the two. In her foster home, she was the first one to start accepting pets and snuggles. She seems to show Ginger the ropes.\n\nThe minimum adoption fee for Ginger and Tulip is $375 plus a $12 fee per dog for rabies registration for McLean County residents.\n\nShe has been spayed, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm checked, dewormed, and is on flea and heartworm preventatives.\n\nTo be considered for adoption, you must first submit the application found at: \n http://fs16.formsite.com/WishBoneCanineRescue/adoptionapplication/index.html\n\nFor information about this dog's breed(s), visit: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/abc.htm \n\n",

            "description": "***Please DO NOT send us inquiries/emails asking if this dog is still available. If a dog/puppy is still listed on Petfinder- we are still accepting applications for them**\n\nFargo is currently in Houston, TX and can transport to the PNW mid February. \n\nFargo, 1.5 years old, Shephard mix, 61 lbs, male. This amazing dog was found wandering around a neighborhood. No one came looking for him so his finders reached out to us to help find him a forever home. \n\nFargo is in a foster home with other dogs and plays really well with his female foster sister. One of the male dogs is not so friendly so Fargo stays clear of him. They are able to be separate in the yard so when Fargo sees him he wags his tail while the other dog just barks at him. Fargo does not charge the fence, but rather walks away. \n\nWe have no history with cats. If you are considering applying for Fargo and have cats please have a way to keep them separate as Fargo settles in. \n\nFargo has not been around young kids, but the foster's adult son has a medical condition and he is very gentle with him, not jumping up and waits to be petted. \n\nHe does have a lot of energy and is a larger dog. He does still want to jump when he first sees the foster but responds to down and sit. Due to his size and energy we recommend a home with children 12 years and older. \n\nFargo could use some practice on leash as he tends to pull and is strong.  He rides in the car really well, mostly sitting up in the seat like a person. \nHe knows a few commands and is housebroken. \nHe has mild separation anxiety and will pant and paces until his foster mom returns home. He has not been destructive during this time. \n\nThe current foster home has a 5 foot fence that he has almost been able to jump over. Fargo will need a 6 foot fence or higher to ensure he doesn't get out. \n\nHe does have some food aggression and should be separate. As we don't know much about his history, we can assume he may have developed some resource guarding from being a stray. He also eats his food extremely fast and would benefit from a slow feeder.  He loves treats, he takes them very gently. He loves peanuts and will eat them gently out of your hand like a horse.\n\nFargo is very loving, he loves giving kisses and getting belly rubs.. He also loves to have between his eyes rubbed sometimes it will put him to sleep.\n\nIF you have prior or current shepherd experience that is a huge benefit. Understanding his breed, personality and quirks will make for a successful journey. \n\nFargo is a young active dog who will need a secure yard or an active home. He will need some support on leash training. Fargo will need time to decompress and settle into a new home.\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time.\n\nThe first step in our process is filling out an application. We will review your application as soon as we are able- there are two of us and we do the best that we can. We review applications on a first come first serve basis and look for the best fit/match for dog and applicant.\n\nhttps://heartoftheunderdog.org/adoption-application\n",

            "description": "***Please DO NOT send us inquiries/emails asking if this dog is still available. If a dog/puppy is still listed on Petfinder- we are still accepting applications for them**\n\nFargo is currently in Houston, TX and can transport to the PNW mid February. \n\nFargo, 1.5 years old, Shephard mix, 61 lbs, male. This amazing dog was found wandering around a neighborhood. No one came looking for him so his finders reached out to us to help find him a forever home. \n\nFargo is in a foster home with other dogs and plays really well with his female foster sister. One of the male dogs is not so friendly so Fargo stays clear of him. They are able to be separate in the yard so when Fargo sees him he wags his tail while the other dog just barks at him. Fargo does not charge the fence, but rather walks away. \n\nWe have no history with cats. If you are considering applying for Fargo and have cats please have a way to keep them separate as Fargo settles in. \n\nFargo has not been around young kids, but the foster's adult son has a medical condition and he is very gentle with him, not jumping up and waits to be petted. \n\nHe does have a lot of energy and is a larger dog. He does still want to jump when he first sees the foster but responds to down and sit. Due to his size and energy we recommend a home with children 12 years and older. \n\nFargo could use some practice on leash as he tends to pull and is strong.  He rides in the car really well, mostly sitting up in the seat like a person. \nHe knows a few commands and is housebroken. \nHe has mild separation anxiety and will pant and paces until his foster mom returns home. He has not been destructive during this time. \n\nThe current foster home has a 5 foot fence that he has almost been able to jump over. Fargo will need a 6 foot fence or higher to ensure he doesn't get out. \n\nHe does have some food aggression and should be separate. As we don't know much about his history, we can assume he may have developed some resource guarding from being a stray. He also eats his food extremely fast and would benefit from a slow feeder.  He loves treats, he takes them very gently. He loves peanuts and will eat them gently out of your hand like a horse.\n\nFargo is very loving, he loves giving kisses and getting belly rubs.. He also loves to have between his eyes rubbed sometimes it will put him to sleep.\n\nIF you have prior or current shepherd experience that is a huge benefit. Understanding his breed, personality and quirks will make for a successful journey. \n\nFargo is a young active dog who will need a secure yard or an active home. He will need some support on leash training. Fargo will need time to decompress and settle into a new home.\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time.\n\nThe first step in our process is filling out an application. We will review your application as soon as we are able- there are two of us and we do the best that we can. We review applications on a first come first serve basis and look for the best fit/match for dog and applicant.\n\nhttps://heartoftheunderdog.org/adoption-application\n",

If a dog/puppy is still listed on Petfinder- we are still accepting applications for them**\n\nFargo is currently in Houston, TX and can transport to the PNW mid February. \n\nFargo, 1.5 years old, Shephard mix, 61 lbs, male. This amazing dog was found wandering around a neighborhood. No one came looking for him so his finders reached out to us to help find him a forever home. \n\nFargo is in a foster home with other dogs and plays really well with his female foster sister. One of the male dogs is not so friendly so Fargo stays clear of him. They are able to be separate in the yard so when Fargo sees him he wags his tail while the other dog just barks at him. Fargo does not charge the fence, but rather walks away. \n\nWe have no history with cats. If you are considering applying for Fargo and have cats please have a way to keep them separate as Fargo settles in. \n\nFargo has not been around young kids, but the foster's adult son has a medical condition and he is very gentle with him, not jumping up and waits to be petted. \n\nHe does have a lot of energy and is a larger dog. He does still want to jump when he first sees the foster but responds to down and sit. Due to his size and energy we recommend a home with children 12 years and older. \n\nFargo could use some practice on leash as he tends to pull and is strong.  He rides in the car really well, mostly sitting up in the seat like a person. \nHe knows a few commands and is housebroken. \nHe has mild separation anxiety and will pant and paces until his foster mom returns home. He has not been destructive during this time. \n\nThe current foster home has a 5 foot fence that he has almost been able to jump over. Fargo will need a 6 foot fence or higher to ensure he doesn't get out. \n\nHe does have some food aggression and should be separate. As we don't know much about his history, we can assume he may have developed some resource guarding from being a stray. He also eats his food extremely fast and would benefit from a slow feeder.  He loves treats, he takes them very gently. He loves peanuts and will eat them gently out of your hand like a horse.\n\nFargo is very loving, he loves giving kisses and getting belly rubs.. He also loves to have between his eyes rubbed sometimes it will put him to sleep.\n\nIF you have prior or current shepherd experience that is a huge benefit. Understanding his breed, personality and quirks will make for a successful journey. \n\nFargo is a young active dog who will need a secure yard or an active home. He will need some support on leash training. Fargo will need time to decompress and settle into a new home.\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time.\n\nThe first step in our process is filling out an application. We will review your application as soon as we are able- there are two of us and we do the best that we can. We review applications on a first come first serve basis and look for the best fit/match for dog and applicant.\n\nhttps://heartoftheunderdog.org/adoption-application\n",

Kids should be 12+ due to his size. Max is trainable, affectionate, full of life, friendly and entertaining. Max requires a fenced in yard. Adopter must have experience with the GSP breed, and agree to enroll in training. A home visit is also required during the adoption process. If you are interested in adopting Max please fill out an adoption application at www.barktownrescue.org\n\nAdoption Fee: $170The shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at the dog's predominant breed or breed mix. We strongly encourage you to select your new pet by looking at each dog's individual personality and pet qualities rather than relying on a breed label that is only our best guess.\n\nOur adoption fees vary from $150 and up. All of our dogs are up to date on vaccines, heart worm preventives, and flea/tick medication, and will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption.

Teddy is fully vetted and around a year old.  He\u2019s great with dogs and cats (But will bark at them), and ADORES children.  I\u2019m struggling with guessing his breed, so I went with long haired chi and terrier.  He\u2019s bursting with personality and wiggles.  Teddy is a door darter, so his new home will need to be vigilant to prevent him from escaping.  He is not hypoallergenic!  Like many small breed dogs, Teddy will still have an occasional accident, but his foster mom is working hard to have him fully housebroken for his new home.\n\n*Edited to add:  Teddy is a high energy small dog syndrome kind of guy - not a purse dog or a home decoration :). No apartments, as he has a piercing bark when playing or complaining!\n\nAgain, please apply using our fillable app link above.  Info requests and emails will not be answered at this time.  Thank you for your interest in adoption, and for your understanding during this crazy time!",

            "description": "Hello world! My name is Cricket, and I am a sweet 3-1/2 year-old coonhound in search of my forever home. \n\nI am a typical hound in many ways: I am laid back and not the in-your-face kissy type. My foster mom describes me as \"pretty chill.\" I follow my nose everywhere, especially if it leads me to yummy treats, and I will sit and shake for them before taking them gently. I am housebroken, but I like privacy when I do my business, so I will need a physical fenced-in yard. My foster mom introduced me to this crate thing, and while I didn't love it at first, I now go in willingly and settle down for the night.\n\nEven though I am a long-legged girl and weigh 70 pounds, I do not like other big dogs. I adore the small dog in my foster home and am uninterested in cats. I don't bother them and they don't bother me. I am good with children, as long as they are not intimidated by my size.  I like to be with my humans as much as possible, and I would love to join a family that doesn't leave me alone for long periods of time. I may seem a little aloof at first when meeting new people, but I get attached quickly. I have so much love to give and will make a great companion.\n\nOur adoption fee is $260 for dogs over 5 months of age and includes all vaccinations, spay/neuter, micro chip implantation and registration/transfer, heartworm test and much more. Puppies up to 5 months of age are $275 and this includes all sets of puppy vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip implantation and registration and more. To adopt, go to www.fosterpetoutreach.org to complete an application.\nPlease note: Foster Pet Outreach tries to limit our adoptions to an area within approximately 60 miles of Peoria, Illinois.",

She's a little apprehensive when being approached by people she doesn't know but seems to warm up quickly to them. She will win you over with her big happy smile! Spirit would do best with a fenced in yard. She has done well with other dogs we have done introductions with. She needs a home without cats.\nIf you would like to make Spirit a part of your family, please fill out an adoption application at www.barktownrescue.org\n\nAdoption Fee: $170The shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at the dog's predominant breed or breed mix. We strongly encourage you to select your new pet by looking at each dog's individual personality and pet qualities rather than relying on a breed label that is only our best guess.\n\nOur adoption fees vary from $150 and up. All of our dogs are up to date on vaccines, heart worm preventives, and flea/tick medication, and will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Portions of your adoption fee also help care for the sick and injured animals that we take in. Thank you for supporting us and considering a rescue dog!",

            "description": "Reba is a very sweet-tempered mountain cur and Labrador mix who on 12/4/20 gave birth to eight healthy puppies. She has just finished weaning them and is enjoying a little independence at her foster home as you can see in the photos. She is excellent with her puppies. She loves other dogs and loves kids! She would not be suitable for a home with cats. Reba is a young adult, weighing sixty-eight pounds, very healthy, and fully vaccinated. We chose not to spay her yet due to her recent litter of five boys and three girls. As of 1/27/21, most of the puppies have been adopted. The 6-week weights of the ones who MAY (not promising) still be available are Elvis at 11 lbs. and Brooks at 11.8 lbs. We will cover Reba\u2019s spay expense once she is settled in her new home with a rescue-friendly veterinarian. At this time, it is possible that one of her puppies may be available to be adopted with her as well depending on when your application is received. To adopt Reba please visit our website www.peace4paws.org and fill out an adoption application. Thanks! \n\n\nDog Size Guidelines:\nSmall: 25 lbs and under (11 kg)\nMedium: 26\u201360 lbs (12 \u2013 27 kg)\nLarge: 61\u2013100 lbs (28 \u2013 45 kg)\nExtra Large: 101 lbs or more (46 kg)",

            "description": "Meet Lucy! She is about 2 years old, 40 pounds, and looks like she has some hound in her mix. Lucy was brought into the shelter with a broken femur and 10 puppies! In addition, she had complications from her spay surgery. Her leg also had trouble healing and ultimately she had to have it amputated. She is now healthy, her puppies are adopted and she is ready for her very own forever home. She is doing great with house training at her foster home, crate trained, and plays well with other dogs. She could go to a home with kids 8+ or other dogs. She needs an active home with lots of short walks/hikes, and needs to be one of the family. She needs someone that will increase her socialization, particularly with new people. She's a very friendly loving girl but can get scared & barky around unfamiliar things.\n\nHer foster says, \"At her vet, they call Lucy the \"miracle girl\". She survived a very serious pyometra surgery. One of the worst they'd seen. She fought very hard post op and has come out a playful, active, happy, loving girl. Because a portion of her bladder had to be removed, we've been using Proin and an herbal supplement. Accidents in the house are basically non existent and she now sits by the door and indicates with a bark when she wants to go out. I classify her as housebroken.\nShortly after that, she was hit by a car and sustained a broken humerous. Lucy is vocal when she plays with our other dog and plays very nicely, never a problem. She's been great around even unfamiliar dogs.\n\nShe is obsessed with her collection of stuffed animals (especially loves the ones that squeak or even better, talk to her). She's a great eater and loves treats and bully sticks. I seat belt her in the back and she seems to really enjoy rides in the car. As mentioned above, she needs continued socialization and confidence with strangers and getting used to walking on leash past moving cars. We've had her almost 2 months and I have never, ever seen one sign of aggression or anger. She will charm you with the genuine love in her eyes and the way she just wants to be with and cuddle with you. We love this girl and am certain her new family will feel the same..\"\n\nShe is available for direct adoption with an approved adopter in North Dartmouth, MA on February 5th. Please fill out an application at www.browndogcoalition.com/adoption.\n\n- Please thoughtfully discuss with your entire household the physical, financial, and emotional responsibilities of a puppy/dog BEFORE applying to adopt.\n- Our adoption process has been adapted for social distancing and may be different for every dog. Please fill out an application, and we will explain that dog's process as needed.\n- Puppies/dogs may not be given as gifts or surprises.\n- More information about our adoption process, application and adoption fee can be found at browndogcoalition.com",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Twyla. I\u2019m approximately 4 years old and 30 lbs. I\u2019m a lab mix, although I\u2019m much smaller than your typical lab. \nI\u2019ve realized as I\u2019m learning to be a lady that I enjoy the finer things in life, such as a nice dog bed for getting my beauty rest throughout the day. \nI prefer a quieter home, and if you have a dog I get along best with friends that are older. I certainly wouldn\u2019t mind at all if I\u2019m the only dog. \nI\u2019ve been through a lot in life so I like that I can now live my best life. (I\u2019m the proud momma to the Schitt\u2019s Creek litter.) Ido get scared in unfamiliar places, especially when there are loud sounds. I recently learned how to walk on a leash and and enjoy taking my foster mom\u2019s lead. \nI am also crate trained, but if I\u2019m in a comfy spot before bed you\u2019ll have to bribe me to get up and go to bed. I\u2019m still learning to potty train, but while learning I know to use puppy pads. I\u2019m heartworm positive, but have already begun treatment. I promise to love you forever and cannot wait to met you!\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

I am a hound mix and very loveable. I love lounging around with my foster mom. I am working on house training and I sleep in the kennel with my sister almost all night. Squeaky toys and naps are my favorite. I love to follow people around and be held. I\u2019m good with other dogs, kids and even cats. I am very laid back and excited to find my forever family. \n\nPlease note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppy\u2019s breed or size potential. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

He was an owner surrender with what appeared to be a dislocated hip. He would not walk on his back right leg. They took him to their vet who was able to pop the hip back into place and placed him in a sling but it was a temporary fix. He's heading to our vet Wednesday 1/27/21 for evaluation. It's possible he will need FHO surgery. He's a sweet little guy who has had a few too many meals. We are placing him on a diet as well as that too is not good for his hips. More info coming soon!\n\nNOT TAKING APPLICATIONS: We are not taking applications yet. We will post when s(he) is ready for adoption. In the interest of fairness, EARLY application submissions will NOT be considered. Please note we cannot respond to messages/emails, etc., on dogs that are NOT yet available for adoption.

She is 24 inches tall and 54 lb, and looks crisp and pretty as if she just came from the Arctic. She has a stunning coat of cream and brown, and her eyes are beautiful. \nShe gets along well with other dogs and is playful with them. She will chase cats but has never harmed them. She will chase chickens. She has been around a 7 month old child and has done fine. She's house trained and will pace at the door to signal. She's crate trained. Meeka has a medium activity level. She spends her time both indoors and outside. She does well on a leash and loves walks. She will obey sit, lay down and shake commands but needs a little work.  She will allow bathing and brushing and that's why she's such a fine looking dog! Meeka is playful. She loves tug of war. She likes playing in sprinklers. She doesn't know how to fetch but will entertain herself and observing humans playing ball by herself.  Meeka would be a nice dog for adopters with a secure yard and some knowledge of Huskies. She needs a little more training, plenty of attention and activities to keep her busy. She's ready for her forever home. Please apply for Meeka at yvpr.org/adoptions!\n\nAn application must be filled out and accepted before a meet can be set up. If accepted, you will hear from us within 72 hours. You will have the opportunity to ask questions before you meet the pet; an adoption may or may not happen at that time. We do adopt outside the Yakima area IF you are able to come to Yakima to pick up your adopted pet.  We do not have a kennel facility; all of our pets are in foster homes. Therefore, meets and adoptions take place at either our office or at a place chosen by the foster.   If a pet has 'pending' beside its name, an adoption is imminent. Please fill out an application anyway because adoptions don't always go through. Your application will be kept on file for 30 days in case you find another pet you'd like to apply for.  Thanks for thinking adoption and Good Luck!",

From there you can find the dog and comment on his or her picture which will notify the foster family of your interest. \n\nWe are a foster-based rescue, so adoptable animals are in private homes in the NW Florida Panhandle. The best way to meet one of our pets is to attend our adoption events on Saturday. To find out where we'll be this week, visit our Facebook page at www.SavingwithSoul.com. \n\nThank you for considering a rescued pet!",

I'm kennel trained and not very vocal. I do love chewing on bones, but not a fan of treats. Not sure what those are I guess. I love to play in a fenced yard and go for walks. I'm learning that snuggles are good. So far I enjoy being part of a family. Love is what I needed and I'm hoping I can find it with my forever family! Also, I love the Minnesota weather! Barley's adoption fee is $400.00 which covers his neuter, vaccinations, microchip and any additional medical care he may have needed while in the rescues care. We are a foster based rescue, we do not house dogs at a facility. Age and breed, are NLR's best guess as we often don't know who or what mom and dad are.

She greets new people with a wagging tail and kisses, and likes to curl up on the couch or get a belly rub.\n\nGertie plays tug of war with her foster's 2-year old dog, and gets along with the 1-year old cat. At age 7, she is quite mellow, but does like to play and take walks, where she is very curious and wags her tail when passing another dog. She has not barked at other dogs while out walking.\nGertie is working on her leash manners, as she pulls a bit, perhaps a little set in her ways at her age, but her foster is working on it! And so far, no accidents in the house! \n\n\nUnfortunately, because Gertie was not spayed until much later in life, she developed a malignant mammary tumor, Grade 1. The mass has been removed and she is doing great! However, she will need an owner that will need to understand that her life will likely be cut shorter than is deserved. But we hope that she can find a wonderful family that can give her the amazing final years she deserves! Given Gertie's condition, her adoption fee will be waived. PCR representatives are happy to address any questions about Gertie's condition. \n\nGertie is spayed and up to date on vaccines and preventatives.\n\nFor more information, please contact France at fbognon@petconnectrescue.org\n\n**If you're viewing this on Petfinder, please visit www.petconnectrescue.org to complete our non-binding application.**",

With Blues it's not uncommon for hair lose and Azul does have thin hair on his back and signs of CDA which is very common in the color. Azul only needs to be microchipped and then will be ready to go to his forever home. \n\nAll animals adopted from us are fully vetted including spay/neuter, vaccines, microchip, heartworm test and deworming. Please email us at HookedOnDobies@gmail.com, visit our Facebook page www.facebook.com/savingdobermankind or webpage https://www.savingdobermankind.org to request an application, inquire about an adoption fee, or to learn more! \n\nWe do require a completed adoption application to be submitted before discussing details of a specific Doberman. \n\nWe DO NOT have a central location, out foster homes are located throughout our geographic region including CO, WY, NM and TX.\n\nWe strive to PROTECT the privacy of out fosters.

We will update when we know if he has an approved application or we are taking more applications.\n\nFound abandoned and freezing, this puppy was saved by a family who then searched to have her rescued rather than to surrender her to a shelter.  Located in South Carolina,  most puppies don't stand a change in shelters.  \n\nWe were glad to step up for this cutie.  Weighing in at 8 lbs and thought to be around 8-9 weeks old, Leroy was taken to our local vet and made ready to head north to New Jersey and his foster family.  There he will wait for his forever family to find him.\n\nIf you've been looking for a sweet, lovable, playful, happy puppy to bring home- look no further.  \n\nYou can find an application to adopt Leroy located on our website at:\nhttp://diamonddogsrescueinc.com",

WE CANNOT ANSWER EMAILS ASKING ABOUT A DOG'S AVAILABILITY. IF IT IS LISTED WITHOUT THE WORD \"PENDING\" IT MEANS IT IS AVAILABLE.\n\nPLEASE COPY AND PASTE THIS LINK TO OUR APPLICATION:\nhttps://tlps.wufoo.com/forms/the-little-pink-shelter-adoption-application/\n\n<b>WE ARE GIVING PREFERENCE TO THOSE ADOPTERS WITH OTHER YOUNG PLAYFUL DOGS IN THE HOME. </b>\nCutie Patootie Alert!!! Seriously, look at this little face! Miss Maggie is one of the cuuuuutest little girls we've ever seen, and one lucky family is going to call her their own!! Maggie was bought by someone who fell in love with her as a tiny puppy but had no idea that puppies are living things that need time and attention. After a few months, they dumped Maggie at a high-kill shelter because she was \"too much responsibility\". And that's when we took responsibility and brought her into our group where she is getting all the time, attention and love she could ever want!\n\nPlease build in extra time on your walks because Miss Maggie is so adorable you are bound to be stopped everywhere you go! Could she possibly be any cuter?!! And she is such a silly girl, running off her puppy crazies like a little lunatic until she's so tired she ends up falling over!! She loves her belly rubbed and flips over to show her belly at the slightest glance her way in hopes of yet another belly rub. She is super social with everyone at her foster home: the kids, their friends, the adults, the foster's dogs and cats. And if you pick her up for cuddles, she'll give you a thousand licks in return!\n\nLittle Miss Maggie is about 7 months old, weighs about 7 - 8 pounds and is a very healthy girl. She's a mix of something small but we'll never know her true mix for certain. All we can be sure of is that she's full of personality and loves to prance! If you can promise Maggie a life of spoiling and love, please visit www.pinkshelter.org for more information about the adoption process. Full vetting, microchip, spay and transport from Arkansas included in her $1500 adoption fee. IF YOU HAVE AOL or YAHOO PLEASE CHECK YOUR SPAM FILE FOR OUR RESPONSE",

She's come to the shelter as a stray and no one claimed her which means she's now available for another lucky family to adopt her and love her forever. She's a great girl, happy and inquisitive and eager to please. She's average energy for her age and size. She gets along well with other dogs and all humans but has not been cat tested. \n\nShe is currently in Fort Worth, TX but will making the trek to Olympia, WA scheduled to arrive on Saturday Feb 6th  IF she is pre-adopted meaning you need to get your app in, approved and pay the adoption fee to secure her.  Her adoption fee is $450 which covers her spay, vaccinations, HW testing, chipping, health certificate and transport fees. All our dogs come with a 30 day, money back, trial period to make sure they are the right fit in your environment.

Some of her favorite things include following her foster mom around, going on walks, squirrel watching and throwing small plush toys to herself. She is still a puppy so she enjoys to sleep. She is house trained and has good leash etiquette. She has learned how to sit, shake and laydown. She is good with other dogs (all sizes) and loves to play. She is very gentle with kids but due to her size we would recommend a home with older children. She would thrive in a home that had a backyard to run around in. Holly has a big personality and a big heart. She will be an amazing addition for some lucky person or family!\n\nPlease visit our website at tmhpr.com for more information.

            "description": "Please go to www.yvpr.org/adoptions for more information and to complete your application.**  \nSol is a German Shepherd mix female that is black and tan colored and she has a medium coat. She is 2 years old, 22 inches tall and 74 lb. Sol gets along with other dogs but would do best in a home without cats because she gets excited when seeing them. She has been around chickens and cattle and ignores them. She has been around children 2 and 3 years old and she has done fine. She will do okay in a crate for 2 hours or so but she has spent most of her time outdoors, therefore, we are uncertain weather she is housetrained. She is doing better on a leash but needs work, and she does not have training in commands. Sol has a medium energy level and she occasionally jumps on people but isn't too persistent in doing so. She is curious, adventurous,  loves to go on walks and loves toys. She likes being brushed. She enjoys being outdoors. Sol is highly intelligent and when she has a family of her own who are willing to consistently and patiently train her and make her secure with them she will be a quite loyal, loving, obedient and fun family member.  If you are interested in this great dog, please apply at yvpr.org/adoptions!\n\n\nAn application must be filled out and accepted before a meet can be set up. If accepted, you will hear from us within 72 hours. You will have the opportunity to ask questions before you meet the pet; an adoption may or may not happen at that time. We do adopt outside the Yakima area IF you are able to come to Yakima to pick up your adopted pet.  We do not have a kennel facility; all of our pets are in foster homes. Therefore, meets and adoptions take place at either our office or at a place chosen by the foster.   If a pet has 'pending' beside its name, an adoption is imminent. Please fill out an application anyway because adoptions don't always go through. Your application will be kept on file for 30 days in case you find another pet you'd like to apply for.  Thanks for thinking adoption and Good Luck!",

He was then taken in by Eleventh Hour Rescue so that he may be adopted to a loving home. He came to us with a broken leg and missing fur. He has since healed after surgery and his fur is growing back.\n\nBlueberry is a very friendly, full of personality but sometimes rambunctious boy that would do best in a home with Pittie experience. He is good with people, dogs and can be with relaxed cats. He would be OK in a home with older and considerate kids. He will need a confident owner who can give him plenty of exercise, structure and reinforce training.\n\nIf you'd like to meet Blueberry, please submit an application at our website, www.ehrdogs.org and be sure to mention his name, BLUEBERRY OS!",

            "description": "Meet Zorro! He is a 9 year old Beagle/Dachshund mix and weighs 17lbs. He is not as swashbuckling as Antonio Banderas, but definitely is just as handsome! Before coming to POA, Zorro was in a home with 7 other dogs. He and Mia, his \"honey,\" had 6 puppies and they all lived together as one big happy family. Unfortunately, one of their owners passed away and POA stepped in to help. Right now, Zorro shares a pen with his daughter, Porsha. They are not a bonded pair, but the two love each other's company. If a family wishes to adopt both sweeties, we would certainly consider that option. Zorro is a super sweet guy who enjoys walks and loves to be petted and brushed. His diet needs to be managed with prescription food, but he is otherwise in good health. Zorro is good with other dogs (not sure about cats). Children over 10 years old may be okay. If you would like to know more about Zorro, please contact Stacey at stacey.doan@poainc.org or better yet, please complete an online application found at www.poainc.org.",

She might have shepherd in her too but is likely a mix of several breeds or more.  She is the tri-color pup in the photos.  She'll need an active home with plenty of time for outside exercise as well as obedience training so she can be the best companion ever!\n\nPlease research before adopting any pup - make sure your type of home and lifestyle is the right fit for the activity level and needs of the particular breeds mentioned as a possible mix in our rescue pups.  Keep in mind though that we can only guess the breed(s) we think we see in the pups we rescue.   Without knowing the background information on them and exactly what breed(s) their parents are, its just an educated guess on our parts.\n\nOur puppy adoption fee is $150.00 each and our pups have been spayed/neutered, wormed, vaccinated for kennel cough and have received their first parvo/distemper shot. We require a fenced yard or if you live in the country safe acreage on your own land for exercise. Our dogs must be allowed in their family home and be allowed to sleep inside of the home at night. At adoption you will be required to complete and sign an adoption contract. \n\nWe are located in Billings, Montana and adopters to travel to our location.\n\nIf you would like to inquire about adopting this pup or have questions, please contact foster mom Sheri Lee at 406-208-3853.",

            "description": "Meet Porsha! She is a 7 year old Pekingese/Dachshund mix and weighs 18lbs. Before coming to POA, Porsha was in a home with 7 other dogs. Zorro and Mia, his \"honey,\" had 6 puppies and they all lived together as one big happy family. Unfortunately, one of their owners passed away and POA stepped in to help. Posha is Zorro and Mia's daughter and she has inherited their good looks and sweet personalities! She is a love bug who enjoys lots of pets, going for walks, and being lavished with affection. Right now, Porsha shares a pen with her dad, Zorro. They are not a bonded pair, but the two love each other's company. If a family wishes to adopt both sweeties, we would certainly consider that option. Porsha has advanced glaucoma in her right eye and after consulting with our veterinarian, the decision was made to remove her eye as the glaucoma will certainly worsen as she ages. Porsha is good with other dogs (not sure about cats). Children over 10 years old may be okay. If you would like to know more about Porsha, please contact Stacey at stacey.doan@poainc.org or better yet, please complete an online application found at www.poainc.org.",

            "description": "Oscar is a fun loving pup born on June 1, 2020. He did not do well with apartment living, and was surrendered to our rescue to find a more appropriate home.  He loves to play with his toys, other dogs, and has lived with young children. Oscar is curious about cats, but does not chase them and behaves appropriately when swatted or hissed at.  He is crate trained, housebroken, and rides well in vehicles.  We require obedience training for all newly adopted pyrs less than a year old, to help you create a special bond with you and your new friend, and so you have a well behaved canine. Great Pyrenees are willing to learn, but are not as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds. They are bred to be independent thinkers. Applicants must be over 25, own their own home and all children in household must be over 6  years old. Your resident pets must be up to date on vaccines, sterilized, you must have a good history of vet care for them, and you must have used heartworm preventative year round for your dogs. \n\n\nOscar will be placed as an inside pet with outside privileges. You MUST have a securely fenced yard accessible from your home. Invisible fencing does not work with this breed and they will take the shock for the freedom.  Great Pyrenees are bred to roam and will create their own territory if not secured, which can led to them being lost, hit by vehicles or shot by people who see them as a threat. The breed is not a good off leash dog, and cannot be trusted to not run away.  A Great Pyrenees off leash is a \" DisAPyr.\" \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please complete the appropriate application on our website, www.igpr.org under the Adopt tab. \n\nAll of our dogs marked as needing foster homes are also available for adoption.  If a dog is listed on this site, it is available.  No need to contact us to see if it is,  We do require you  complete the adoption application prior to meeting a dog.\n\nWe also offer a foster to adopt program. You foster the dog, and have first right of refusal on them if an approved application is submitted for them. \n\nIn fostering a dog, the dog comes to you fully vetted. and groomed. You provide good quality food, grooming, and we provide the heartworm preventative and medical care, if needed* .(*Based on approval from IGPR.)\n\nOscar will come with a neuter agreement to be neutered between the age of 18 - 24 months. Neutering large breed dogs has been linked to joint issues, and osteosarcoma. $100 of the adoption fee will be refunded once proof of neutering is provided. \n\nAdoption fee is $500",

He is a sweet boy who seems to get along well with everyone and is a pretty quiet, well mannered boy. He has a funky old man walk that we think is from arthritic changes due to age. He is approximately 20 lbs. Regal has been neutered, received a dental and had 14 teeth extracted. He has vaccinations up to date as well as routine labwork. Regal's adoption fee is $150 but has incurred around $600 worth of medical bills. We would appreciate and are looking for sponsors for his care. Based on our observations so far, we believe he is house-trained and crate trained. Please email us at alardirector@gmail.com if interested in adopting Regal.",

He's the happiest dog around now, being freed from the horrible life of being chained 27/7\n\nHank is very, VERY playful and even rough at times. He needs another big dog to play with and help him unleash his energy. Smaller children would not be a good fit as he would be too rough with them.\n\nHank needs a experience owner with lots of time to work with him, he's already learned to sit, so he's very eager to learn. He also needs a big fenced in yard to run and exercise.\n\nIf you are interested in big Hank, please put your application in at www.fots.petfinder.com\n\nAdoption fee is $350.00 which includes neuter, vaccinations, heartworm test, 3 month flea/tick treatment, de-wormed and put on monthly heartworm preventive.",

Because of their need for a high level of exercise, both mentally and physically and their need for ongoing training, only applicants with demonstrated owner/handler experience with this breed will be considered.  The vast majority of them are not best suited as family pets, but in homes with experienced handlers knowledgeable of their needs and breed characteristics.  We will not place in homes with small children or small dogs/cats.  \n\nClarabella\n\n\nIf you can give Clarabella an indoor forever home, please fill out our online application on our website at http://www.savingpawsrescueaz.com/adoption-form/  \n\n We will only schedule meet and greets with an approved application. We are an all-volunteer organziation.  It may take a couple of days to process an application and complete reference checks.\n\nThank you for your interest in saving a life!",

            "description": "Meet Walter the dog! \n \nWhile I can't wait to get to know you, here is a little about me. I was dropped off at the pound for being too big... and not just the thick kind of big. I am a 5-year-old yellow lab mix and I have the soul of an old man Walter. I do come with some challenges I hope you are willing to embrace. My name may be Walter but I cannot hear you due to being deaf but that does not stop me from loving you the most and giving you all the kisses and cuddles. I currently do not live with any other animals but I do not mind any other dogs or cats, I just do my own thing. I am potty and crate trained. While with my foster mom we have worked on my leash skills so when you meet me I will be a pro! When I get excited I do use my mighty muscles to try and get a good sniff everywhere so you might have to hold on tight for me. I will admit it, I kind of am a couch potato and not just because I look like a yummy bag of lays chips! I don't play with toys much but if you give me a good bone I will be happy for hours. Outside time is my favorite. My new favorite activity is getting to go for a car ride and flap my cheeks in the wind. So, if you are looking for the sweetest boy with the best attitude then I'm your number one guy! See you soon and I can't wait to meet you!

I survived a very touch and go case of Parvo, because I have too much life and love to give to a family that wants a sweet, loyal, and very loving girl! I get along with EVERYONE! I love to play and rough-house with other dogs, but I am most happy when I am cuddling with a human that loves me. I am working so hard on potty-training because I love the humans that care for me and I LOVE making them happy! I love to be held and loved on, and I snuggle in and give all that love back! I need a home with lots of love and snuggles because I am such a sweetheart!!\n\nPlease apply at eastcoastboxerrescue.org",

Rope toys are my favorite thing at the moment. When I'm done playing can I sit in your lap? I am a little shy at first, but warm up quickly; just be patient and let me come to you. Once I feel settled in I actually can be quite the boss lady. Also, I've had quite a bit of socialization with other adults, and kids.  My foster mom has encouraged visits by neighbors and friends.  Some people say that Shar Peis are not good with kids, but I enjoy them.  They play with me and let me sit in their lap!",

I run all over the place chasing whatever moves, wrestle with my brother and sister, and love to climb on my foster mom's dog. I do love to be held and snuggled, belly rubs are especially nice. I like to explore, have only been outside a couple of times but I like running in the yard. Come see how special I am.",

This gorgeous boy's once happy world was turned upside when his owner passed away at home, leaving Wolfie trapped in the house with his owner's body. Wolfie is safe now, has received some TLC with our vet partner for a skin condition and is looking for a forever home where he can live his best life and be happy again.\nWolfie is very gentle with people, very polite with other dogs and not bothered by cats. He will do best with older children. He\n\nrarely barks, is house trained and rarely pulls on the leash unless he sees a squirrel in close range. He is lower energy, mostly a couch potato, loves to snuggle and is a bit of a Velcro dog - he attaches quickly to his humans and follows them from room to room. He is very food motivated and\n\nloves soft treats, as well as Kongs with peanut butter and puzzle toys. Looking into Wolfie's soulful eyes, you can see he appreciates the love he feels from you.\nIf you can right Wolfie's world and be his return to happiness, please apply online to adopt Wolfie (SC) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

I enjoy sitting in your lap and love to give puppy kisses.  My foster mom taught me to sit, I'm a quick learner.  Also, I've had quite a bit of socialization with other adults, and kids.  My foster mom has encouraged visits by neighbors and friends.  Some people say that Shar Peis are not good with kids, but I enjoy them.  They play with me and let me sit in their lap!

He had a crappy owner who decided it wasn\u2019t worth picking him up. He is a friendly and happy little guy. When he first came to the shelter he was extremely shut down and hiding in the corner. But he quickly made friends. He would make a great companion or be a happy second dog. He loves to go for walks and car rides. He\u2019s also Food motivated and would benefit from basic training\n\nThank you for reading about our awesome dog. All dogs came to us from different situations and we often do not know much about their past, but they are rescue dogs who deserve a second chance and need patience on their journey. All of our dogs our are in foster homes all across the bay area. \n\nThe first step of the process is you must submit an application in order to set up a meet and great or talk with the foster family. Once application is submitted the foster parents will contact you to chat more about the dog and make sure they're a good fit and can answer any further question. The application answers most of all of our questions and can best match you. If you do not get the dog you apply for we can use your same application for 90 days towards another dog in our care and simply forward your app to that foster parent. \nhttp://form.jotform.com/underdogca/dog-adoption-application\n\nAll dogs will be fully vetted (Spay/ Neutered, Micro chipped, DHPP and Rabies Vaccinated) and other possible vet care prior to adoption.\n\nThe adoption fee is $300, which is considered a non refundable donation\n\nvisit us at underdogca.com or follow us on FB and IG @underdogca\nhttps://www.facebook.com/underdogCA",

This is the happiest dog you will ever meet. He is great with dogs.\n\nThe biggest thing with Hopper is that he is disabled. He has peg back legs that are stiff. We are unsure if this is an injury or birth defect. But vets feel he is not a surgical candidate. He doesn't think he is disabled and loves to wrestle with other dogs. He may need a wheelchair later in life.\n\nWe are looking for someone who would be dedicated to keep his legs as limber as they can be for as long as they can be and can deal with a disabled dog down the road. \n\nAlso, he would do best in a home that has no small children or children really at all. \n\nAdoption Fee: $280 plus tax\nAdoption Form: www.campcompanion.org",

Nash is shy with new people, but once he knows you he is quite snuggly. He also enjoys playing with and snuggling with other dogs. (We feel like Nash would thrive in a home with another dog). He knows sit, shake, down, drop and come. Nash would do better in a home with no small children as he is startled with loud noises and very timid. Additionally, he loves to play with bones and toys and can get wound up easily and mouthy. Nash loves being a couch potato and will gladly sleep in your bed (if allowed). He is house trained.\nNash really needs a home with people who don't work all day, he does NOT do well in a crate. \nNash would do best in a home with people who don't work all day. In his foster home, he did fine being left alone for short periods loose. Being crated gives Nash a lot of anxiety, so he needs a home he won't need to be crated. Perhaps a home with a nice fenced yard, or a doggy door or a family who works from home. \nIf you feel like Nash would be a good fit for you and your family, please contact us for an appointment.",

            "description": "Meet Lotus! Lotus is a beautiful, 2 year old girl looking for her furever home! Lotus was found as a lost girl and was brought into the shelter on 1/19. Lotus is very frightened of the shelter and the new, unknown environment. With a little compassion from the volunteers, Lotus has shown her sweet side. She is treat motivated, so her trust can be won over with a few good treats. Lotus knows how to sit on command, and she is eager to learn more tricks for more delicious snacks! Lotus has a beautiful smile, and with a little TLC, bonding, and time to adjust, she will be her bright, beautiful, loving self for her new family! Get to know and fall in love with this 54 pound sweetheart in run 78. Her ID number is 626952. Lotus is up-to-date on vaccines, and she will be spayed, microchipped, and heart worm tested upon adoption. She can't wait to start loving her new family!\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

Please print a hard copy before you press \u201csubmit form\u201d. If you are approved, we will contact you to arrange for a meet and greet. \n******************\n\nShirley is a four to five month old female Golden retriever mix. \n\nShe is up to date on her shots and is going to be quite a large girl. \n\nShirley was recently rescued from a high kill shelter in North Carolina, where she was surrendered by someone who had Shirley dumped at her house along with her sister Laverne. \n\nShirley comes off as quite shy but will warm up to you once you sit next to her and give her a couple of pats on the head. She gets along with cats, kids and other dogs. \n\nShirley would make a great addition to any family.",

He is the sweetest little guy that will make the perfect companion for anyone! He is mostly blind in 1 eye from advanced cataracts, but it doesn't slow him down one bit! He loves exploring the backyard, enjoys the company of other dogs, is fantastic with small kids, and is very social. He is an easy going and low maintenance dog. He is neutered, vaccinated, heartworm negative, recently had a dental, and microchipped. He is $350 plus TX sales tax with an approved application: www.recycledpomsbcs.com/adopt\n\nTexas law requires that all humane organizations (Rescues, SPCA's, Humane Societies, State nonprofit, and charitable 501c3 exempt orgs) collect and remit sales and use tax to the Texas Comptroller on their adoption fees.\n\nWe do not ship or transport our dogs. We require all adopters to meet the dog in person to ensure it is a good fit. We represent the dog to the best of our ability and since they are in rescue, we do not always get their history.\n\nPlease note: We are a non-profit Pomeranian Rescue with dogs in private foster homes. We do not have a facility open to the public. We require an approved application before a potential adopter is introduced to a dog. We contact vet references to ensure animals in the home are current on vaccinations, heart worm prevention, and sterilization. We do not adopt our dogs to homes in which an animal is not spayed or neutered. A home visit may be required.\n\nPlease visit our website for more information and an adoption application. www.recycledpomsbcs.com",

As the photographer approached, Cuddle Bug showed why she was awarded her name as she politely scooted over to provide a welcomed space for her human, silently asking him to be seated and share a moment of contented friendship. While riding in a bus, she would be that chivalrous spirit that would relinquish her seat to a person truly in need. Cuddly Bug\u2019s not-so-secret wish is to be with a loving human who would enjoy an out-of-the-ordinary lap dog companion. Cuddle Bug gently accepts treats, comes running to you when called and is nicely housetrained. She also showed off her canine sense of humor as she stepped up onto the agility platform and performed a proud sit on the stand:)",

We are not sure how long they had been fending for themselves, but they all had terrible flea dermatitis, extremely thinning hair, infected mouths, and other health issues. We have been taking care of all of their medical needs as fast as possible to make sure they are comfortable.\nRudolph is blind, but that doesn't stop him! He is as sweet as can be and doesn't realize he has any disabilities. He does really well finding his way around his foster's house and enjoys walking in the yard when it's warm and his foster Mom is close. Rudolph will do best in a quiet home with no stairs. A patient family that is home most of the time. He cries and howls when left alone. Rudolph's adoption fee is $200.",

Hermes displayed his non-stop energy as he leapt skyward, chased down, cornered, and retrieved every genre of squeaky toy in the Humane Society arsenal.  His intensely bright, blue eyes are always focused on you, asking for just one more toss, one more game and one more challenge. The human obliged by dropping a hotdog treat into the hollow pink ball. Hermes first tried the obvious but couldn\u2019t get his head far enough in to reach the treat. Then, after a moment\u2019s thought, he tilted his head and approached the toy, extended his paw, and gave it a bump sufficient to roll it over so the treat simply fell out. He received his name for adroitly mimicking one of most clever and mischievous of all the ancient Greek hero\u2019s. Hermes also has a passionate devotion to his human family and would be happiest in a home that doesn\u2019t entertain a lot of guests. When asked what he would like to tell the humans who might be interested in his adoption, Hermes replied, \u201cCheck out my tail\u2026.it is a perfect example of a spiral that conforms to the Fibonacci numeric sequence found everywhere in nature.\u201d Quite a creative canine.  \n\n",

He would be fine with or without another dog in the home. He has been around cats and is non-reactive. He is a little skittish, so calmer kids would be best. He knows to sit and is very treat motivated, great on a leash and harness during walks but loves to jump when he wants attention. He will go in the crate but he is not a huge fan. He prefers the wire pen over the crate. He is doing well with potty training and the foster family is using a bell. He seems to prefer cuddle time over playtime but will run around outside! He does hate to be picked up and loud noises or sudden movements tend to scare him. He has some minor separation anxiety and will follow the foster family around the house. His adoption fee is $460.",

He came to TNT after he and 4 other chihuahuas were found in their deceased owners' home. They all had very bad flea dermatitis, ear infections, and just poorly cared for. After coming to us, he has had all medical needs taken care of. Frost has had 11 infected teeth removed, been neutered, received antibiotics for his skin, and is starting to feel and look much healthier!\nHis schedule consists of: Eat, sleep, snuggle, repeat. He's happiest with his human, especially males. He will need slower paced home with a family that will shower him with cuddles and belly rubs. He doesn't wander off but does get lost easily, and with being blind & deaf, a fenced-in yard is required. Having another senior dog in his future home to keep him company when the humans aren't isn't a must, but we are sure he would love it!\n\nHe's just as sweet as can be, even with all his issues. His tail wags as soon as he realized you are near, and can't wait to snuggle. He is a major cuddle bug that deserves a home that will give him all the cuddles he wants!

She\u2019s at a good weight finally, and stands very tall.  She has huge amazing ears, and is a very sweet girl. \nOver 3 months ago, she was found in awful shape, very thin, and giving birth to puppies on a lawn.  Only one puppy survived. \nShe had Heartworm (which she\u2019s been fully treated for) and X-rays revealed hip dysplasia and some arthritis in the spine. The vet feels strongly that it\u2019s from rough breeding. \nShe is not in any pain from either, and all she needs right now is her daily bone and joint supplement. \n\nShe\u2019s friendly to all people. \nShe\u2019s a bit anxious about seeing other dogs she doesn\u2019t know, but we think this is mostly over her only surviving puppy. \nAs of today, her puppy has a new home.  (No guarantees\u2014>) but suspect this will subside quite a bit without her puppy around. \nIt\u2019s best for Nova to go to a home without other dogs. \n(Cats unknown) \n\nShe does very well with good leadership and her new found leash/walking skills. Otherwise, she can be very strong on the leash.  \n\nShe rides well in the car. Crate trained, although she\u2019d rather hang out with her person. \n\nAll around Nova is just sweet, a big love, and of course beautiful.

She does best with another confident dog.  No kids under 12, as she came from a home with 2 small children who hung on her.  She is sensitive to loud yelling, we think because the house she left was very chaotic.  \n\nShe is up to date on vaccinations, spayed, crate trained, microchipped, does well on a leash and has no bad habits.\n\nIf interested in meeting Matilda, please fill out the online application at www.pettalesrescue.com.

I chase cats. I am not keen on male dogs, a calm quiet female would be OK. I would be OK as the only dog. \nCar rides: I'm great in the car.\nCrate/house trained: I may bark at noises, but I am good in the house. I am crate trained but dont need to be. \nLeash walks: I am strong, and I can be reactive when seeing other dogs on a walk. Ideally a quiet setting, and a strong knowledgeable leader would be best. \nVacc/worming/flea: UTD on vaccinations? Flea/tick, worming? Vet checked? Microchipped? \n\nHi, my name is Tyson! I was surrendered to FEF so I could find a better suited home. I wasnt getting along with the other dog in the house. My owner was ill, and it became too much to manage. I needed to find a place that I can live happily. I am a typical big goofy dane. I like to carry my stuffy around. I like to cuddle, and sleep on the couch. I wouldnt mind sharing your bed too. I am a good boy, and I do bark at anything I'm unsure of, maybe a noise or a knock at the door. I have a food allergy, and I thrive best on a raw diet. I love people, and warm up very fast to strangers. I dont like small children. Older children are fine. I love playing with my toys. I would be just fine as the only dog in the home. If you are OK with a little slobber, and a gentle giant taking over your furniture ? maybe I can be your new best friend.

Sometimes she chooses when she will listen.\n\nGrooming Needs: Midori has a standard husky coat which will require frequent brushing. \n\nFence: She would do fine with a fenced yard or a tie-out. She does not seem interested in jumping the fence, but she has resident dogs to play with her.\n\nSolo or Siblings: She would do well as an only dog or with siblings that are willing to stand up to her.\n\nFrom the foster: Hello, my name is Midori but I go by Dori. I am a very energetic but loveable one-year-old. I have some basic training skills, I can sit, lay, and drop but like any husky, sometimes I don't like to listen. I am okay at walking but I like to stop and sniff constantly. I really only pull when I am on walks with my foster furr-sister. When I see people I like to stop and hope that they will come pet me. \n\nI am great with kids, I have a one-year-old human foster sister and we get along great. I let her pet me and sometimes she gives me hugs or lays her head on me, I like that. Sometimes I knock her over but only on accident. I like to give her kisses. I do like her stuffed animals and if you leave me alone with them they might get \"defluffed.\"\n\nI like to play fetch with balls and my toys. I like to play and chase my husky foster sister. Sometimes I can play too rough and can play too much. I would benefit from a dog that could show my boundaries and tell me no. \n\nMy foster home has a fenced-in yard and I like to hang out there and run. I haven't tried to escape but I do have a prey drive so I can't promise I won't try to escape. \n\nI am not a fan of my kennel but I am learning. I usually need some resurgence that my family is still with me when they go to bed so usually they come out of the room and let me know it's bedtime and I settle in for the night. They usually sleep until 7:30 and I don't ever wake them up. My foster family is usually always home so I have not spent much time in the kennel during the day. I would love to be left outside my kennel but you may come home to a mess if you leave toys or blankets out. \n\nOverall my foster family loves me and says I am a great dog. I have not had any big issues and despite my energy level I would make an amazing friend!\n\nAdoption Fee: $400\n\nAll dogs coming into Adopt a Husky Minnesota receive care tailored to their needs, including: Nose-to-tail exam with a partner veterinarian, Vaccinations (Rabies, Distemper, Bordetella), 4DX test to check for heartworm or tick exposure, Fecal Analysis, Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative, Spay/Neuter prior to adoption, Microchip, and are evaluated for temperament and trainability.",

Chihuahua who came to TNT after her along with 4 other senior Chihuahua's, were found alone, starving, and in a terrible condition after it was discovered that their owner was deceased. We are not sure how long they had been fending for themselves, but they all had terrible flea dermatitis, extremely thinning hair, infected mouths, and other health issues. We have been taking care of all of their medical needs as fast as possible to make sure they are comfortable.\nBlanche is a low-key dog who is content to sit beside her foster dad for hours on end. She does prefer men.\nShe has luxating patella (moving knee cap) in her left hind leg and needs medication for pain management. The vet also advised no climbing up or down the stairs and no long walks. So she needs to mainly use pads to do her business and be carried up and down the stairs.\nShe is wary of strangers and gets very nervous when they get close. She seems to be scared of other dogs who want to be friends, so she needs to be the only dog/only pet in her forever home.\nBlanche lost all her teeth after her dental so she needs to be on canned or softened dry dog food. Her adoption fee is $200.",

He can be adopted for $25 with an approved application.  George was surrendered to the Center. The previous owner states that he is good with kids, cats and dogs.  He is also potty trained and walks well on a leash.  George was surrendered due to separation anxiety and being destructive.  They state that George did better as an outdoor dog and hated being crated. George may do best as a mostly outdoor dog that has another dog to play with.  Come meet George at the Center....and see if he might have a place in your home and in your heart.  More information about George was given and available for you to read.",

She joined us at the Canine Rescue because her mom felt she needed a family with some older kiddos to play with.   Although her mom loved her very much and giving up Roxie was very hard decision for her.\n\nRoxie is a happy gal.  She loves to go for car rides and play!  Roxie could definitely use some training, as she is a little mouthy when she gets excited.   Due to this, she should not live with small kiddos.  Roxie would do well with an active family.  Feline members are probably a no no, as she has small prey drive.  If you have a fenced in back yard for the zoomies and squirrel chasing, that would be just dandy!  \n\nIf you are local to the Dillsburg area and interested in Miss Roxie, please visit www.crcpa.org and complete an application!",

Medical records will be provided. \nKids/Cats/Dogs: Not suited for young children. I've briefly met cats, I wanted to chase them. Due to high hormone levels, I cannot be with another female dog. A neutered male dog companion is best, or I would be happy as the only dog too. \nCar rides: I'm great in the car.\nCrate/house trained: I am good in the house. I am crate trained but dont need to be.\nLeash walks: I am good on leash and once I know you well enough, I can be off leash too. \nVacc/worming/flea: UTD on vaccinations? Flea/tick, worming? Vet checked? Microchipped? \n\nHi, my name is Maggie! I was surrendered to FEF to find a better suited home for me. After 2 surgeries the vets say I am an odd mystery. A mix of birth deformed reproductive parts, mixed with possibly trauma that has caused internal scarring and lesions has left me a mess inside. Therefore it's possible I may have ovarian remnants and possible I could still come into heat. Throughout my cycles I have spikes in hormone levels, and I fight with other females. I'm looking the perfect home that can accommodate me and my cycles. \nI'm such a lovebug. I'm shy with new people. I'm uneasy around children. I'd prefer a home without children. I'm sensitive, I like quiet homes with a low traffic lifestyle. I prefer the country rather than a busy city. The city noises make me very nervous. I really just want to be someone's best friend. To cuddle on the couch, and go for walks. That is what I dream of. If you can provide this type of home, and be able to manage my cycles, fill out an application here:\nhttps://form.jotform.co/83008434566862\nEmail my foster mom for more information fureverfriendsadoption@gmail.com \nLove Maggie?",

The staff here takes great care of me and while I'm currently not allowed to romp around, I'm happy going for a walk and then taking all the loving I can get...plus I get tasty treats and a comfy bed at night. All this is great but what would be even greater is to find a home willing to foster me while Save-A-Pet continues to coordinate and pay for my treatment. Then, once I test negative, this special home would then adopt me. What do you say?",

I guess we also have to point out that we do require a lot of work and commitment.

When he came to us he was suffering from separation anxiety, but has made huge strides since being in his foster home. His foster mom reports that with the right set up, his anxiety will be very manageable. He's very snuggly and loving and loves attention and he would be good with other dogs. He really enjoys playing with them, but also likes to just chill out around them too. \n\nPlease fill out an application at www.maggiesmissionrescue.org",

I love going on walks, especially runs with my humans! I have a lot of energy but calm down after a good run outside. I'm fully potty trained and will let you know when I need to go outside. I love making new dog friends at the park and seeing dogs on walks. However in my previous home over the last year and a half I had a lot of anxiety and stress with the other dogs in the home. Due to this I'm not sure how I would react to other resident dogs and may be best as a single dog home. I also love my foster cat siblings but they love me most when I respect their space. I forget how big I am compared to them so I try playing with them but they don't like it very much, but I listen to my foster mom when she says to knock it off. I know how to sit, shake, lay down and even stay! I am working on not pulling mom when we go for a walk but I listen pretty well and won't pull her across the ice. I love snuggles and will probably take up the entire bed, but I sleep all night and wait for you to wake up in the morning. I have never been left in a kennel but do very well when my humans aren't home. I love being around my foster humans and I'm learning to trust men more. I love my foster dad and foster brother but I love foster mom most!\n\nMack's\n\nadoption fee includes: Full veterinary exam, dewormed, Distemper vaccines appropriate to age, Bordetella vaccine, rabies vaccine, alter, 4dx, prepaid microchip frontline and heart guard while in rescue.

            "description": "Meet this sweetheart Nala! She came into the shelter late December 2020 when her owner could no longer keep her. Nala was surrendered to us due to not getting along with the other dogs in the house. She was a walking Skelton but she was give 5 small meals a day for weeks and she looks fantastic. She gobbles her good up so quickly so she will need a \u201cslow feeder bowl\u201d to eat out of to ensure she doesn\u2019t eat too fast causing bloat. She has some areas on her skin that required some medicated baths and she\u2019s on the mend and looking and feeling much better. At first she was very nervous with new people and some times would do a low growl but she is blossoming into such an amazing pup now that\u2019s she\u2019s in better shape &  health.  She will need to be the only animal in her forever home. She loves OMG Surprise Toys and chew-proof toys! Nala loves to play fetch and is an absolute cuddle bug!! If you are interested in Nala and think you can provide her perfect furever home, please contact us at 252-247-7744 or stop by for a visit. \nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting another potential new furry member please bring him or her to the shelter and meet on neutral ground before adopting. No need to shuffle the animals around any more than necessary. Please know that 1 mosquito bite can create heart worms and they can be fatal if not treated. It is VERY important to keep your pets healthy and protected by keeping them on a once a month heart worm and flea/tick prevention. These animals are counting on you as their owner to provide them with lots a love and the proper health care so PLEASE make sure you are aware and prepared before adopting. Owning a pet is an extra expense and responsibility but is so worth every minute and penny you invest in them. They will add lots of joy and unconditional love if given a fair chance.\nThe shelter is open Mon.-Fri. 10-1, 2-5 and Sat. 10-4. Adopt a homeless pet and save a life. If you can not adopt right now come out and volunteer and make a difference in the lives of these animals while they await their FOREVER home.",

He was surrendered to animal control with 7 canine companions when their elderly owner was hospitalized and could no longer care for them.  Bruce is a loving, affectionate, adorable little snuggler who likes to crawl into your lap and be with his person.  He is a low energy boy with awesome leash manners who knows basic commands and likes to take walks around his neighborhood.  He has humongous ears that never go down & tower over his teeny, tiny head! The conditions in Bruce's previous home were very bad and Bruce came to BarkVille with flea dermatitis which caused some hair loss.  However, BarkVille treated that condition and his hair is returning a little more each day.  Bruce is housebroken, crate trained, neutered, fully vaccinated & microchipped.  \n\nFor more information about Bruce, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org. If you would like to adopt this sweet boy, please submit an application for him at https://www.barkvilledogrescue.org/applications",

There is no one sweeter than Peppermint Patty! She is a charmer and wins over everyone she meets. If you have love to give she will be there to receive it. This love bug craves attention and will accept every pet she is offered. Peppermint Patty seems to be pretty well-mannered and eager to please. She's been good with the other dogs she has met and didn't pay attention to the kitties she saw outside. She will follow you around like a little puppy, interested in everything you do. We're not sure what her previous life was like, but we've promised her a bright future! She may have limited vision out of one eye as it is either deformed or suffered an old injury, but it doesn't slow her down. We just adore this sweetheart and cannot wait to find her the perfect forever home... could it be yours??\n\nPS: We've sent Ms. Patty for a pedicure since this photo was taken. \n\nInterested in adopting?

I get along with the dogs in my foster home. But they are older like me and don't play much. I am easy going. I probably would be happiest with an older adopter who likes the company of a dog who enjoys napping. I am a lap dog, but need help getting up to your lap. I would not do well in a house with stairs or a family with fast moving kids. For a little guy he does have a loud bark that may disturb neighbors in condo or apartment living. Come and meet me at the next adoption show.\nEmail: dogs@almosthomefoundation.org\n\nAlmost Home Foundation's adoption requirements:\n\n(1) Be at least 21 years of age;\n(2) Have the consent of all adults living in the household;\n(3) Have approval from the residence owner;\n(4) Have valid ID with current address;\n(5) Be approved by Almost Home Foundation as a suitable adoptive home; and\n(6) Live in the Greater Chicago Land area.\n7) A copy of your lease (pet page) is required, and submitted with your application\n\n*** Please note that Almost Home Foundation accepts only cash or checks for adoption fees; we do not accept debit or credit cards. ***",

His mom is a pitbull and his dad is a hound/mastiff mix.  \n\nAtlas is the more timid of the pups.  He enjoys snuggling.  However, we think once his personality begins to shine, he could be a mischievous little fella!\n\nIf you are LOCAL to the Dillsburg area and have availability on Tuesday mornings to bring Atlas back to the rescue for vaccines, please go to www.crcpa.org and complete an application!  \n\n*You are responsible for the sterilization.

            "description": "Meet this cutie named Abby! She came into the shelter mid January 2021 when her owner could no longer keep her. She is 10 years 5 months old, current on shots, already spayed, and house broken. We were told she could be quirky when rubbing on her if you got around her back end. She has been in a foster home with another pup and has been perfect...no issues. She has played with a few dogs at the shelter and has been great thus far. She is a great sized pup and other than having a little \u201chazy\u201d look in her eyes you would have no idea she is 10 years plus. She\u2019s  happy and full of love to share. Would do best in a home without young children since previous owners said she could be quirky. We like to make sure past info is passed down to those interested but in previous situations with other animals we have learned it may have been something in the home or environment that triggered behaviors that we never see at the shelter.  If you\u2019re interested in Abby please reach out to the shelter and a meet and greet with this cutie can be arranged. \nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting another potential new furry member please bring him or her to the shelter and meet on neutral ground before adopting. No need to shuffle the animals around any more than necessary. Please know that 1 mosquito bite can create heart worms and they can be fatal if not treated. It is VERY important to keep your pets healthy and protected by keeping them on a once a month heart worm and flea/tick prevention. These animals are counting on you as their owner to provide them with lots a love and the proper health care so PLEASE make sure you are aware and prepared before adopting. Owning a pet is an extra expense and responsibility but is so worth every minute and penny you invest in them. They will add lots of joy and unconditional love if given a fair chance.\nThe shelter is open Mon.-Fri. 10-1, 2-5 and Sat. 10-4. Adopt a homeless pet and save a life. If you can not adopt right now come out and volunteer and make a difference in the lives of these animals while they await their FOREVER home.",

We are asked regularly why there are always puppies for adoption in Texas and this litter and the family they came from are a prime example.  These 5 were surrendered as well as 3 puppies from another unplanned breeding from the same family and they have now asked us to take their \"older puppies\" as well.  We have offered to cover the cost of spaying the family dogs in hopes of stopping this vicious cycle.  For now at least we know these 8 will not continue the cyle and will be placed in good, loving homes.  \n\nNames listed from Left to right, Avery being the only female, the red puppy on the far right.\n\nUpdate : Adrian has an adoption pending 2/2/2021",

She loves to run around the yard with her foster siblings and that really IS her happy place. She is an extremely timid little girl around humans and will take lots of patience and love to gain her trust as well as a confident dog brother/sister will be best for her future home. She is crate trained and is making great progress with house training but will have accidents.\n\nFelicia would not do well in an apartment situation and needs a physically fenced yard to run around and burn some energy. She is low-medium energy and will need help with leash training and socialization. She will be best suited with an experienced Aussie owner who will be able to help Felicia to become a confident/happy pup. Although she is okay with the kids in her foster home, we do not recommend a home with kids under the age of 8 years old. \n\nFelicia is approximately 8 months, 25 pounds, UTD on vaccines and spayed. She is being fostered in Orlando, Florida and a meet and greet will be required.\n\nIf you think Felicia is the right fit for you, please fill out our application:\n\nhttps://www.australianshepherdsfurever.org/adoption-application\n\nAll adoption feees are used for future rescue efforts.",

            "description": "Name: Jackson\nAge, Weight Gender: 8- 10 years; 60lbs; Male\nDog friendly/required?: Yes/No\nCat Friendly: Unknown\nFenced yard required?: No\nHousetrained: Yes\nCrate trained: yes\nChildren: yes\nTemperament: Low energy; mellow\n\nJackson is between 8-10 years of age and is 60 lbs. As you can see in the pictures he is a senior who obviously knows how to have a good time:). He is a black lab/hound mix. His face and coloring looks lab, but his conformation has some hound aspects to it. He is typically very quiet (even when other dogs are going nuts due to the UPS man) but on occasion he will bay/howl like a hound.\n\nHe was picked up as a stray several times. His owner had received several warnings about Jackson\u2019s poor condition. If the owner had picked him up this last time, he would have been ticketed\u2026 We pulled him after his \u201cstray hold\u201d time was up.\n\nHe is slightly hard of hearing and has cataracts. He has been accidentally surprised a few times so while he is in a foster home with children ranging from 7 years to college age, he may be best in a quieter household.\n\nJackson is a hard core couch potato. He also has a bladder of steel. This combination would be ideal for someone who works long shifts (like a nurse). He would also be well suited for apartment life. He may need help up and down stairs later in life so a first floor apartment or access to an elevator may *eventually* be necessary.\n\nHe does not want to play with other dogs, but does like roaming through underbrush (following his nose). He does well with other medium to low energy dogs. He gives warning growls when other dogs jump on him wanting to play. He is fine if they want to nap near him, eat near him, or even share a crate. If another dog starts zooming around the yard, he promptly exits the area.\n\nJackson gets fed 2.5 cups of softened senior dog food in the morning and 2.5 cups in the evening. He will beg for pets and generally nag you until you feed him if you forget. He is housebroken. Never had an accident in the house. He whines to go outside to potty. Jackson knows \u201csit\u201d. \u201cGet down\u201d off the sofa or bed. He\u2019s not a fan of dog bones (they\u2019re hard), but does like cheese, and freeze dried chicken.\n\nJackson was neutered and had his front teeth removed due to their poor condition. He eats his food carefully. The foster typically softens the kibble with water about 30 min before being fed(just in case). He started his heartworm treatment on January 4 and should be ready for travel mid-March.\n\nThis boy has won over the hearts of everyone he has met in both Jackson Mississippi and HOH rescues. He is a mellow guy that would make a great companion.",

A friend that lived near him, saw Bella was pregnant once again and very skinny. So she asked him if he would consider rescue for her...and here we are, Bella's pups are gone, she has been spayed and is ready to find her forever home. Bella is hw positive. No complications and on slow kill. He prevention can be provided for her if needed. She is 9 years old but very active and won't disappoint if you are an active family.

However, he chases cats and has never been around small children.  So we are looking for a cat free home and if there are any children in the home they should be over age 10.  We also would prefer a home with a fenced yard and with folks that have had dogs before.  If you live in the Toronto area and would like to learn more about Simpson and our foster to adopt program, please contact our rescue for an application at c4ptoronto@gmail.com.  Thanks so much for your interest.",

Manny has gotten along with the other dogs here at the shelter, but should meet new canine companions one-on-one to ensure they are a good match.

            "description": "Many people shy away from a mature dog, but there is so much joy that can be had from taking an older dog into your family.  While we shy away from calling our IZZY a \"senior dog\", this female Black Lab would qualify for the canine AARP with an estimated DOB of 12/2012.  Izzy came to FOPAS from a not-good situation, in fact she had spent her entire life outside in the heat and cold.  Now that she's inside, with a soft bed in the warmth, she is ready to enjoy these comforts for the rest of her life.  This is a very happy dog!  Izzy is so so affectionate, if she could sit in someone's lap all the time she would.  However, at 57 pounds, she usually only gets her head in the lap, which is plenty for her.  Izzy doesn't like to be left outside by herself (as you can imagine) but if someone is with her, or taking her for a walk, she is a wonderful companion.  Izzy used to live with many other dogs, so she can probably live with other dogs but at FOPAS she has spent her time with her \"sister\" Lenore with whom she came from her former life.  A meet and greet with a potential sibling would be needed.  If you are looking for love and contentment and happiness your dog is IZZY!!\n\nIf you are interested in Izzy, please fill out an application here:\nhttps://www.parkvilleshelter.com/adoption-application",

Molasses weighs 62lbs and is a ball of love!\nMolasses is as sweet as can be! Total love bug and an attention hogger. Solicits attention from everyone she can say hi to. She would do best in a home with older kids and could do well with a mellow, but playful male canine companion. No small animals due to being a bit pushy with them. Would benefit from having a dog to dog done prior to adoption.\nTo learn more about Molasses send us an email at adoptycas@gmail.com\nAll animals are up-to-date on vaccinations (including rabies if over 4 months old), microchipped, and spayed or neutered. All dogs have been been vaccinated with DHPP and Bordatella (kennel cough) and heartworm tested negative (if over 6 months).\n\nAll cats have been vaccinated with FVRCP and current on flea control.

Her adoption fee will include vaccinations, worming, microchipping and spaying. Monica and her siblings were surrendered to the Center through no fault of their own. Monica is friendly and easy going but lacks some basic social skills because she and her siblings were kept in kennels outside and are a little on the timid side with no leash skills. But these sweet dogs are eager for love.....and we hope that someone will take a chance on them. They deserve a chance at love and life because they are sweet and smart....and given the chance, they may become a loyal companion to the person who has a little patience and love to spend on these dogs. They seem to do well with other dogs and they don't seem bothered by the shelter cat. I am betting that they will also be great with kids. Hurry to meet Monica and her siblings and take a chance on them....you won't be disappointed.",

We can not arrange meet & greet without an application.\n\nAdoption fees: $450 for dogs 12 months/younger, $400 for dogs 1-2 Yrs,\n$350 for dogs 3-5yrs, and $300 for 6yrs and older\n\nWelcome Raven to the pack. Raven is a 4 month old Husky/Pitt mix.\nRaven is a friendly, people focused puppy who is a fast learner with a lot of puppy energy.\nHer short hair means she doesnt shed much and shes very cuddly and loves nothing better than sleeping on your lap. But because of her husky background, she loves being active and has a lot of energy that needs to be focused.\nShes great with other dogs and often sleeps on her foster brothers back. She loves playing rough with the other dogs and can hold her own even with a big dog. Shes just learning to walk on a leash because her immunizations were just finalized, but shes fully potty trained as long as she has access to the outdoors and is used to going out with the other dogs at regular intervals.\nShe loves to chew and is very good about chewing on dog toys as long as she has them. Shes going to make someone a wonderful pet although she does tend to like one person in particular. Raven weighs approximately 25lbs and would do best in a home with kids over the age of five.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please review our adoption process and then fill out an online adoption form at https://www.calpaws.org/adopting. Experience with obedience training is definitely required. We are a small rescue and do not have the resources to respond to inquiries. If a dog is our website, it is still available. We can not arrange meet & greet without an application.\n\nWe are always in need of fosters for the amount of dogs we have coming in. Being a foster is such a rewarding experience. If you are interested please review https://www.calpaws.org/fostering",

Sampson does need a family that is willing to put in time to get him exercise everyday, and he needs a secure fenced backyard. He will not stay on farm property without a fence as he wants to wander and play with all the neighbor dogs. He does need a home WITHOUT cats as he will chase them.\n\nFill out an application at the link below. Find the dog/cat you are interested in and click the adopt button. That will take you to an application. Once approved you will be called for an appointment to meet your possible new family member, or at that time you can meet the other animals as well. https://petstablished.com/public/search/shelter/301551\n\nAdoption fee is $150 which includes, spay/neuter, vaccines, etc, and a free 1 year membership to our 5 acre ARF Park. For other dog questions please email ARFdogs74006@gmail.com\n\nWe do adopt out of state, but the adopter must travel to ARF to meet the dog they are looking to adopt. They must have an approved application before traveling to meet the dog. We do allow small dogs that are eligible to fly in the cabin of a plane. We DO NOT allow dogs to travel in the cargo area of the plane under any circumstances. Any dog that is adopted can of course go by personal vehicle. We do not allow dogs to be transported \"pony express style\" where they are passed from driver to driver.",

He came to our shelter with a bad case of demodex and almost no hair poor dude! Luckily the infection has cleared up and now it's just a matter of time till his coat grows back in. In the meantime he's enjoying life in a foster home with other dogs and plenty of snuggle time. He doesn't mind a bit of dress up and is crate trained too. He's a smart, easy going guy that would fit in well with a variety of families.\n\nInterested in adopting? Call us at (916) 687-3042 and Press 3 to leave a voicemail in our Adoption Inbox.

This will help me to learn what is and is not okay. I am good in car rides and I don't mind baths. I would prefer a house without cats. Although I haven't chased my foster's cat I do bark at him so I may have problems in the future. Since I do bark an apartment would nit be the best for me. I love playing with the other dog at my foster's house so another dog or an active human (or more) to play with would be great! I need to exercise so a fenced in yard and/or very active family would be best. Since I have so much energy and don't know yet to not jump or mouth everything, very young children may not be the best for me. I am very treat oriented and I will sit and lay down. I love toys especially ropes. I am very good in my kennel and I am housetrained. I know my perfect family is out there, are you it?",

Riggs came from a situation where he was never socialized, loved on, or played with. He's discovered that he LOVES people. He wants to play and get belly rubs. Riggs is learning about walking on a leash, and not to be scared when we want to leash him up. We've learned that he was abused with chains especially around his neck area. We are seeking paitent, loving owners who will commit to never utilizing a chain collar but willl work with him on a harness and give him the positive reinforcement he needs. He is gentle about taking treats from you and knoes \"sit\"...especially when there's a treat in sight. Riggs is high energy and needs a human partner who is active and ready for outdoor adventures and long walks, daily. If you have an active lifestyle, and are ready to help a young dog learn how to be a valued member of his family, come check out Riggs!",

            "description": "On the outskirts of Houston lies a small outdoor shelter. They do their best out there, but the kennels are fully exposed to the elements except for a few wimpy tarps they put up in a desperate attempt to protect dogs from the winds. They had no idea what they were going to do to keep these dogs safe from the freezing weather, their only solution was to take the dogs to their personal homes. But with only a couple of staff members, there was not enough space in their homes for Portugal. He was going to be left out to freeze if they didn't reach out for help.\n\nIn a last ditch effort to get him safe from the freezing weather, an employee out there reached out to us for help. So hours before temperatures plummeted in Houston, Portugal was brought to us, with no plan except to keep her safe from the weather. Luckily we were able to place him into a foster home, where he has been doing fantasticly! I would try to put it into my own words, but I think it's best to let the foster tell you himself:\n\n\"Portugal is one of the sweetest dogs weve ever had the blessing of fostering. She is very attentive and listens to your commands when you tell her to sit, lie down, or stop whatever she is doing. If you want her to sit down, raise your fist up like youre holding a treat. She likes to snuggle more than play fetch and she LOVES it when you scratch her under her chin or rub her belly. She has a beautiful coat and the biggest pair of brown puppy dog eyes that will melt your heart.\" This is all the information we have currently.\n\n\n\tApproved Applicants may make the adoption fee payment by clicking donate above. Partial adoption fees will not hold a dog.\n\tDogs adopted with our rescue come with FREE training from #GoodPup to help you build strong bonds from the start!\n\tIf upon meeting the dog of your choosing at an adoption event you find that you aren't a good match, your deposit will be refunded minus a 10% administration fee.\n\tAdoption fees include vaccines up until time of adoption, microchip, spay/neuter and 1st 30 days of free Pet insurance. We are not affiliated with Pet First pet insurance. (you have to sign up for the insurance or it will not go into effect). \n\tAdopters can go to our vet for medical issues that may arise in 1st 3 days of adoption. \n\tThe dogs in our care are fostered in Colorado, Texas, and New Mexico. While all dogs are picked up during our scheduled times, sometimes transport dates change due to unforeseen circumstances.",

            "description": "Sweet Dopey is a staff favorite. Dopey is in early stage liver disease but that is easily managed with a good diet and care.The following are staff notes on his behavior in the Texas shelter he was rescued from: Approached kennel and dog was sitting with a neutral body. I offered treats through the gate and dog extended neck out slowly. After sniffing treat, he took treat from my hand with a very soft mouth. After he ate treat he stood up and had a soft swaying body and tail. I got low and opened gate offering more treats and dogs body became wiggly as he approached me and began eating treats out of my hands. \n\nHW+ simply means the dog has tested positive for heart worms in our screening process. We utilize what is called the fast-kill method which means we place the dog on antibiotics for 30 days and then administer 3 injections in increments afterward. The cost to treat heart worms is rather steep. However, thanks to our generous donors, we are able to cover that cost for our adopters so long as they go to our veterinarian, Red Rocks Animal Center in Lakewood.\n\nWe have no back story or update for this dog at this time. When we do, it will be updated here. This is all the information we have currently.\n\n\n\tApproved Applicants may make the adoption fee payment by clicking donate above.

I like humans and other dogs but Im not sure about cats as Ive never had one before. Im willing to give them a try though as I hear they can be great fun! \n\nIm a bit of a ladies man but I will give the guys an equal opportunity as long as they give me a little while to accept them into my circle. I prefer humans that are at least ten years old so they wont interfere with my getting all the attention.\n\nI am potty trained but have something called urethral Sphincter Hypotonus. What's that? My foster mom says thats why is just sometimes leak and dribble when I walk. Doc game me some meds and I am now neutered so we hope that solves things. However, it's too early to tell if this is temporary of permanent but I have adapted quite well to a belly band. I will let you know when I need to go out. I dont like the cold so I just want to do my business and come right back inside. Please dont dawdle! When the weather is warmer I will probably be willing to stay outside and play with you if you like.\n\nI am smart, eager to learn and I am already working on sit, stay, down and come. I am a little insecure and will require some reassurance that I am safe and loved. I like to sit very close to (or directly on) my humans and I love to be held and given gentle pets. Loud sounds and fast movements can make me feel a bit scared but I am learning to be more confident. I spent a lot of time in a crate that was too small for me so I do not yet see the crate as my safe haven.\n\nIf you will help me overcome my little insecurities and fears I promise I will love you with my whole heart! I also promise you will never get to sit alone again!",

Bea loves most everyone & loves to play, but will chase kitties and squirrels mercilessly. Bea is about 35 lbs of muscle & fun, doesn't shed much, is mostly house trained. She is not a big fan of a crate, but doesn't cause any trouble out of the create, unless you leave food on the table. \n\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm tested negative (age 7 months and older) and microchipped. We do not ship or transport. A dog's adoption donation is $200. There is a $5 fee for credit/debit cards.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please fill out an online application here: www.heartlandsmallanimalrescue.org/canine-application.html",

            "description": "Best cuddler for a snowy day!\n\nHey guys! I know it's cold inside and I am here to make it cozy. I am Anna, an 8 months old, 17 lbs, female Yorkshire Terrier mix. I am a young lady from the Imperial County Shelter, and we were un'frozen' and rescued by TAP to find our forever homes. I have been hanging out at my foster home and pick up manners befitting a princess. I am house trained and leash trained, and just polishing up my bathroom habits. A few corrections and positive reinforcements will be great for me! I have spay plans all set for me. Just a point to remember is that my right paw is a hint more delicate than the left one and petting there should be gentle. But nothing too shabby and I am in great health, otherwise!\n\nI have not met a whole lot of dogs or cats to know how we'd be together, but gosh, I adore kids! Little humans and I are thick together and they make me olaf so much! I cuddle hard with my 2 year old baby brother. I do have a tendency to be shy at first, but then I 'let it go' real soon! I enjoy being wrapped in a blanket burrito and nuzzle in laps. I get so happy when my family comes back and I cant help but dance with all the love.\n\nI am a gentle lady and life with me like a cozy cocoa on a white Christmas day! I would love a mellow family with sweet kids who adore me and treat me like the royal princess that I am. If you think we can be besties together, like Anna and Elsa, give me a woof! My adoption fee is $500 and that includes spaying/neutering, shots, and microchip. If you want to take me home, please fill out the form on the website here: https://theanimalpad.org/adoption-application/",

His adoption fee will include vaccinations, worming, microchipping and neutering. Ross and his siblings were surrendered to the Center through no fault of their own. Ross is friendly and easy going but lacks some basic social skills because he and his siblings were kept in kennels outside and are a little on the timid side with no leash skills. But these sweet dogs are eager for love.....and we hope that someone will take a chance on them. They deserve a chance at love and life because they are sweet and smart....and given the chance, they may become a loyal companion to the person who has a little patience and love to spend on these dogs. They seem to do well with other dogs and they don't seem bothered by the shelter cat. I am betting that they will also be great with kids. Hurry to meet Ross and his sibling and take a chance on them....you won't be disappointed.",

We rescued her from a high kill shelter where she was doomed being timid. She is very friendly once she trust you. She loves toys and is truly silly. She is dog friendly and would do great following anothers lead. She is smart and food motivated. So far doing well on both house and crate training. She is a true love! She does have some very weird scarred marking on her head and feet. She is afraid of loud noises so only recommend older kids and patient experienced owner. \n\nThank you for reading about our awesome dog. All dogs came to us from different situations and we often do not know much about their past, but they are rescue dogs who deserve a second chance and need patience on their journey. All of our dogs our are in foster homes all across the bay area. \n\nThe first step of the process is you must submit an application in order to set up a meet and great or talk with the foster family. Once application is submitted the foster parents will contact you to chat more about the dog and make sure they're a good fit and can answer any further question. The application answers most of all of our questions and can best match you. If you do not get the dog you apply for we can use your same application for 90 days towards another dog in our care and simply forward your app to that foster parent. \nhttp://form.jotform.com/underdogca/dog-adoption-application\n\nAll dogs will be fully vetted (Spay/ Neutered, Micro chipped, DHPP and Rabies Vaccinated) and other possible vet care prior to adoption.\n\nThe adoption fee is $300, which is considered a non refundable donation\n\nvisit us at underdogca.com or follow us on FB and IG @underdogca\nhttps://www.facebook.com/underdogCA",

When she first come to us from a not-very-good situation where she was outside all the time she was so frightened of everything that she just crawled along the floor to go outside.  Now, Lenore stands for the leash to be attached and walks right out.  She is still afraid of large trucks but who isn't?  Once in the yard Lenore is a whirlwind.  She loves to play and run and play some more.  Lenore is a female English Coonhound with an estimated DOB of 7/2017.   Like most Coonhounds she is a tolerant and very gentle dog who loves to curl up in the house and relax.  Coonhounds are also very intelligent dogs with good problem solving skills.  Lenore will follow a scent so a yard with a good fence or leash walks are necessary.  This is a very sweet dog who will pay back the love given to her ten fold. Even though she has improved a lot, she will require a confident dog that shows her the ropes and help her with her confidence as well.\n\nIf you are interested in Lenore, please fill out an application here:\nhttps://www.parkvilleshelter.com/adoption-application",

His adoption fee will include vaccinations, worming, microchipping and neutering.  Chandler and his siblings were surrendered to the Center through no fault of their own.  Chandler is friendly and easy going but lacks some basic social skills because he and his siblings were kept in kennels outside and are a little on the timid side with no leash skills.  But these sweet dogs are eager for love.....and  we hope that someone will take a chance on them.  They deserve a chance at love and life because they are sweet and smart....and given the chance, they may become a loyal companion to the person who has a little patience and love to spend on these dogs.  They seem to do well with other dogs and they don't seem bothered by the shelter cat.  I am betting that they will also be great with kids. Hurry to meet Chandler and his sibling and take a chance on them....you won't be disappointed.",

This sweet little girl APPEARS to be a Chihuahua Pug mix, who has been aged to 2 years old, and weighs in at 10 pounds. Emmaline has a slight underbite, that makes her so cute. She is fully vaccinated, spayed, micro chipped and heart worm negative. She is working on her manners, although her crate is always dry, and we do go outside, but occasional accident inside. Good with other dogs and cats, but unknown about behavior around children. She will be best in a home with older children, as she likes to jump on you, a behavior that we are working on to stop.  Super sweet, just wants to be by you...loves to curl up in a ball and sleep on the back of the couch.\n\n**PLEASE NO FIRST TIME DOG OWNERS OR RENTERS, MUST HAVE VET REFERENCE**\n\n**GOOD VET REFERENCE REQUIRED**",

Well, not so for our handsome youngster, Hamlet. He sees a leash and retreats in fear, his body shaking uncontrollably. Eventually, he\u2019ll attack the leash. Never the human. Just the leash. Why he is so afraid of leashes we don\u2019t know. We do know that his owner died, and he landed in the shelter where he stayed for over a month. We also know he is a sweet, gentle soul who wants desperately to love and be loved. He truly enjoys being petted from the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail, a tail that begins wagging ever so slightly as we enter his kennel. Hamlet needs time, patience, and love for his confidence to grow and his fear to subside. He would do best in a home that is calm and predictable. A house with a yard is preferable since he\u2019ll be learning that a leash opens doors to joyful, not frightening, experiences. Hamlet is neutered, microchipped, and current on his vaccines. So, who out there is ready to show Hamlet the happy world that awaits him?\n\nTo see our other dogs, please visit www.perfectpetrescue.com.",

            "description": "Nutter Butter #7620 is a 9-year-old female Chihuahua mix. She is friendly, gentle and calm. She has a low energy level, and her favorite things are soft pillows. Nutter Butter is good with other dogs and kids. She is house trained and knows the commands: sit, stay, down and off. She also walks well on the leash. While Nutter Butter is a little overweight, she doesn\u2019t really care about treats. Ultimately, she is super sweet and likes receiving attention. She especially likes to be held. Due to her docile nature, she would do well in an apartment home. She does have a heart murmur that does not require medication at this time.  She weighs 14 pounds and should lose a little weight. This pup is microchipped. We believe you can always teach an \u2018old\u2019 dog new tricks, so we highly recommend continued obedience training for this smart pup; it stimulates the dog's mind and establishes a good dog/adopter relationship. This pup, like all pups, should be on heartworm preventative; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If you are interested in adopting this dog, and are already approved to adopt through our organization, please contact dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with the pup\u2019s name and ID number in the subject line. OTHERWISE, please submit an adoption application online: http://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.org/adoptus.html E-mail dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with questions.

            "description": "Maggie is a 1 and a half year old spayed female Hound/Black and Tan Coonhound mix (according to the vets). She is extremely smart, curious, athletic, super cute, quick to learn, mid to low energy, loves to nap in the sun, and is super cuddly at night. She is house trained, crate trained, sleeps like a log through the night, and knows her basic commands.\n\nMaggie can be reactive to her environment, out of fear. She obviously has been through a lot, and is very easily frightened. In a calm house with a calm person, she does wonderful! Things like bikes, skateboards, some noises like clicking, and cars make her react fearfully, so she will need someone who has the resources, patience, and time to commit fully and consistently with a trainer to desensitize and re-condition her so she has the skills to be successful. She is a quick and eager learner, so we are confident she will be comfortable in her environment over time. She can be dog selective (she likes some and doesn't like others). Slow introductions with dogs and new people is good. She gets a bit nervous in a car and around some noises (like ticking, so training with a clicker is not a good idea) but is not fearful of most household noises like washing machines and dishwashers. We wish we knew what happened in her past to cause these fears! She often seeks reassurance and comfort, and responds quite well to positive reinforcement. \n\nShe does not have any destructive behaviors at all (no digging, chewing, nibbling, etc.) which is great! Ideally, her adoptive family is energetic and retired or works from home full time and lives in a rural environment or at least has a large back yard for her to run and explore for exercise (she loves to watch and chase squirrels) while she learns to play with toys and to take walks. A 6\u2019 privacy fence is a must. \n\nMaggie comes with her own memory foam bed, crate, harnesses, training gear, sweaters, and enrichment toys if her new family wants them. Maggie is super sweet and loyal to those who care for and love her.\n\nMaggie will be up to date on her vetting/vaccinations to be in line with our commitment to only adopting out healthy dogs. She will also be spayed to support our work for zero population growth in dogs.\n\nMaggie is ready for adoption now! Applications are currently being accepted for this very sweet loving and loyal best friend. An application can be found at http://farfels.com/farfels-rescue/adoption-form/. If interested in our wonderful puppy, please fill out completely and submit.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE** If you're truly interested in adopting from us, please be sure to fill out our Farfel's Rescue adoption application found at the link above or at farfels.com. Adoption site applications such as Petfinder, Rescueme and Adoptapet don't provide enough information and therefore aren't useful. Our Farfel's application is the only initial tool that we have to determine a great match for this very deserving dog. We're sorry, but in most cases, we're unable to get back to those that don't submit our Farfel's Rescue adoption application. Thanks very much for choosing rescue.\n",

            "description": "Cody is a four month old lab possible shep mix about 20 pounds at this time. We really don't know the breed. He came to the shelter as a stray, waited on stray hold and no one came to get him so he's available for a new and forever home. He's young and been on the streets. He's not house trained and doesn't have any basic commands. He will need all that when he gets into his new home. He's good with other dogs and humans at the shelter but has not been around very young children. He's not been cat tested. He has average energy for his age and possible breed and seems to shed moderately. He's happy and playful without being \"too much\" and seems to love attention. \n\n He is currently in Fort Worth, TX but can make the trek to Olympia, WA scheduled to arrive on Saturday Feb 6th\t with a pre-adoption which is the only way to secure that he will for sure go home with you! Pre-Adoption means getting your app in, approved and paying the adoption fee to secure the ride.  His adoption fee is $450 which covers his neuter, vaccinations, HW testing, chipping, health certificate and transport fees. All our dogs come with a 30 day, money back, trial period to make sure they are the right fit in your environment. Tall Tails Rescue has a commitment to these dogs for their lifetime and we hope you do too! If you are interested in pre-adoption you can click the link here or copy/paste and fill out the app to get started: https://form.jotform.com/PNWdogs/ttrt-pnw-ap",

He was surrendered along with his siblings after the owner couldn't take care of them. We believe Peanut is deaf and has eye abnormalities due to Waardenberg syndrome according to a recent visit with a canine ophthalmologist. Peanut currently has good vision and his eye abnormalities are not expected to worsen. None of this gets him down; he's a happy, fun-loving kid. He is a super sweet boy who loves to play with other dogs and people. His foster home is in Drexel, MO.\n\nHe will come with age appropriate vaccinations, deworming, neuter, and microchip. His adoption fee is $200.\n\nTo adopt me, please fill out an adoption application on the Lucky 13 Rescue website www.lucky13rescue.org or use the following link\nhttps://forms.gle/Tc2jvVQ1oYjPSwmeA",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Casper is 2 years old at the time of intake in January 2021. Casper is good with people and other dogs. It's a conflict of emotions when we stare in the face of overwhelming love and fury in the same dog. Love when we look at Casper's sweet face, and fury when we look at the brutal wounds Casper suffered at the hands of the monster who tied him to a car and dragged him almost to his death and then left him on the side of the road to finish dying. But Casper cheated death that day, and he will now go on to a live a life that will far exceed the miserable existence of the savage that did this to Casper. Casper's eyes show a life of sadness and defeat, but we are determined to turn his life around and replace that sadness with a life of love and happiness. If you would like to lead Casper on his journey to a happy life, please appy online to adopt Casper (TX) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

Bentley is sweet, loving, gives kisses and is great with kids, dogs and cats. We rescued this sweet little guy from a kill shelter and whisked him off to our veterinary partner for much needed medical care. Bentley has a heart murmur which requires low-dose meds for life, cataracts which have caused some vision loss and he requires a special diet and x-rays a couple of times a year to try to prevent recurring bladder stones. He is now on his path to a great life and we don't want Bentley to waste one minute of happiness, so if you are that special person who has room in your heart for this little guy, please apply online to adopt Bentley (NY) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

            "description": "Meet amazing Eloise! She is an active senior at 9 1/2 years young. Adorable and a lovely mix of Chihuahua and terrier to make for a cute and compact 40lb. medium-sized doll. Eloise has such a bright spirit and is ready to go anytime. She will get you out for walks, make you laugh, give you love, and cuddle with you! She prefers a calmer household so no kiddo's or other pets please. She is Ok with apt living as long as she gets ample time outdoors with walks. If you have a yard, even better! She will do best with an experienced owner rather than a first-time pup parent. Eloise really wants you to herself and is not into other dogs. She can get overly excited if they get to close but responds to redirection. Eloise walks well on the leash, is house trained, knows a few tricks and has a bright personality that keeps you smiling and on your toes. This cutie pie loves human companionship, will be your best friend, and will take ear scratches and belly rubs as often as you will give them. She will take a little time to settle into your home, and we will give you tips on how to ease her in. Eloise is in great health and shows no signs of slowing down. She is current on all shots, spayed, and micro-chipped. Upon adoption we will provide a transition session! Any questions, email raincityrescue@gmail.com or to complete an application go to, raincityrescue.com/adopt.  This amazing girl can\u2019t wait for her awesome new life with you!",

He is slowly coming out of his shell more and more each day. He seems to do well with other dogs at our shelter and seems as if he would do well around children. Willie will be neutered, utd on age appropriate vaccinations, flea treated, dewormed, rabies vaccinated, heart worm tested, and microchipped prior to adoption. If you are interested in adopting Willie, please stop in and visit with him to make sure he would be the perfect fit for you. For any questions, please call 419.562.9149",

            "description": "Ellie Mae / Female / 3 Years / 60 lbs / Catahoula Leopard Dog / Brampton\n\nMeet Ellie Mae! Ellie comes to us all the way from from Hohenwald, Tennesee! Almost two years ago, Ellie had a litter of puppies who quickly came to Canada and all found loving forever homes. Recently Ellie had her chance and made the long trip to Canada in search of a family to call her own. Ellie has spent the last few weeks decompressing in foster care and learning the joys of being a pet. She is looking for a patient family with some dog experience who can begin to expose her true potential.\n\nEllie Mae takes time to trust people, and is still opening up to her foster parents. Now she will come to the door to greet them and even wag her tail when her foster parents come home. When new people enter the home she may come in view of the door but generally won\u2019t come closer than 10 feet. She will choose not to approach and her space should be respected at all times. Continued socialization and positive experiences with new people will be an ongoing part of her training. She has not been tested with children but we predict their unpredictable movements and energy may be overwhelming for Ellie.\n\nEllie has not been left alone much in foster care but is not a fan of her crate. She has likely had little exposure to them and does not like being confined. She has taken particular liking to her foster Dad and will follow him wherever he goes in the home. She will need adopters willing to introduce some boundaries and encourage structured alone time. She would do best with a puppy proofed space when left alone instead of a crate.\n\nEllie is new to life in the home and is just learning that she needs to use the washroom outside. She still has accidents in the home and will generally choose the same spot. She is very sensitive, so she is only responsive to force-free/positive reinforcement based training. It is difficult to get close enough to put her harness/leash on and it usually takes two people to do so. Once she is outside though, its difficult to get her back inside! Ellie will need a calm and patient family who has a good understanding of the work ahead.\n\nEllie does not know any commands yet but once she is fully comfortable in her new home, she will benefit from obedience and trick training. She is reluctant to walk on leash and is very overwhelmed by everything outside. She is fearful of cars, people, dogs and will usually choose to walk behind her people. She will rarely use the washroom on walks and needs time to adjust to a new environment.\n\nEllie Mae is only looking for homes outside of the city, and preferably in farm/quiet country. She will need a fully secured place to play outside and use the washroom. She is still very anxious about the world around her and will need experienced adopters who are committed to building her confidence. Ellie has only shown fear towards other dogs so would likely prefer to be the only dog in the home. This may change with slow/proper introductions to other calm dogs. She has a very high prey drive so is only looking for homes without cats.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Ellie Mae please apply at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/adoption-info#adoption-form\n\nEllie Mae\u2019s adoption fee is $800.

            "description": "Please meet Spencer!\n\nSpencer is a Terrier mix who is about 6 years old, and weighs in at 25 lbs. \n\nSpencer\u2019s favorite thing in the whole wide world are people but he can be a bit shy when he first meets you. His need for people, love, attention, pets and a nice lap quickly win over his shyness!  He is so very sweet and wants nothing more than to please you. Spencer does well with other dogs his size, after a careful introduction.  He has ignored the cat in his foster home so may do well with a dog savvy cat.  We have not had him around children but believe he would do well with respectful children.  \n\nSpencer is doing well with his potty training and is crate trained.  Spencer enjoys car rides and he is working on his basic commands.\n\nIf you think Spencer may be the one for you, please go to our website at www.wagstorichesanimalrescue.org and fill out an application to adopt.  Please be sure to include a vet reference as regular vet care is important to us for the health of all our adopted dogs. With approval and a $295 adoption donation, he will be ready to accompany you on all of life\u2019s many adventures.  Spencer is neutered, microchipped, fecal tested clean of internal parasites and up to date on all his vaccinations.\n",

My name is Shyla I'm one adorable, cheeky, and happy gal who is ready to find a loving home today that I think I'm more than deserving of. You'll notice I have some rough looking skin that shows I've been through rough times in my past, but I see the good time in my future! Don't let my skin shy you away because it's getting so much better since I've come to Woods to get the care I deserved and needed. I'm a total butterball who just wants love and attention from you humans. When I'm not getting love from you, I enjoy taking afternoon siestas. I have a dream of having a loving, warm home to relax in and a family that plays with me and gives me daily attention. I know the perfect fit is out there and I sure can't wait for you to make my dream a reality! Primary Color: Tan Secondary Color: White Weight: 58lbs Age: 4yrs 0mths 2wks Animal has been Spayed",

Her owners unfortunately had to surrender her to the shelter because she didn\u2019t get along well with their chickens. This is adorable girl is the sweetest dog you will ever meet! She has a very friendly personality and loves every person she meets! She also is great with respectful children. She can be picky about what dogs she likes so we would need to do a meet and greet with your dog(s) to make sure they get along. Because of her high prey drive though, she would do best in a home with no small animals or cats. If you are looking for a super affectionate family pet, than Dolly is the perfect dog for you! Dolly is also housebroken and walks well on a leash.\n\nADOPTION HOURS: \n\nWe are currently adopting out animals by appointment only Tuesday through Sunday 1:00 P.M. through 4:00 P.M. with an approved application. To fill out an application, please go to: https://collierville.com/departments/animal-services/animal-shelter-pet-adoption and email it to: casinfo @colliervilletn.gov\nOnce your application has been approved, we will call you to set up an appointment.\n\n\n\n\n",

She knows \"sit\" and would be happy to learn more with her new family. Krissy came into the shelter on Jan. 20 as a lost dog and her family has not come to find her so she's up for adoption. She is about a year old and weighs 46 pounds.  She is up-to-date on vaccinations, now spayed, heartworm tested negative and will be microchipped upon adoption. Come meet her in Run 859 using ID#626951.\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

            "description": "Tiger Lily #7638 is a 2-year-old female Pit Bull mix. She is a friendly but shy young lady. She is a very mellow girl and has low energy. She is very calm when meeting other dogs, and doesn\u2019t seem to pay attention to them. We recommend a slow introduction to any potential housemates. Tiger Lily should be in a home without cats. She is crate trained and walks well on the leash. She doesn\u2019t seem to care about treats. We encourage her new family to continue socializing her with people and other dogs. Tiger Lily is an LCAR mom and came to us with puppies in tow. Now that they have been weaned, it\u2019s her turn for some R&R and a home of her own. She also came to us with heartworms. We are seeking an adopter that will continue her treatment, provided by LCAR, at no additional cost. This adoption will be considered a foster to adopt. She weighs 55 pounds and should gain a few pounds. This pup is microchipped. We believe you can always teach an \u2018old\u2019 dog new tricks, so we highly recommend continued obedience training for this smart pup; it stimulates the dog's mind and establishes a good dog/adopter relationship. This pup, like all pups, should be on heartworm preventative; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If you are interested in adopting this dog, and are already approved to adopt through our organization, please contact dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with the pup\u2019s name and ID number in the subject line. OTHERWISE, please submit an adoption application online: http://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.org/adoptus.html E-mail dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with questions. Stay tuned to our Facebook page for updates: www.facebook.com/LCARMD #adoptlove #PicMe #petsmartcharities\n",

He is very friendly and happy - just look at his smile!\n\nChester is housetrained and he likes some dogs, but does not tolerate cats.  A proper dog intro is required to ensure a good match.\n\nHe knows \"sit\" and \"roll over,\" and is learning how to walk on the leash. He should go to a home with someone who is experienced with the Heeler breed, as he exhibits some of the common behaviors such as herding and nipping. He may also have some jealous tendencies as he appears to favor one owner, and doesn't do well when other people are around his favorite person. For this reason, he needs to go to a one owner home with few visitors and no children.\n\nHis minimum adoption fee is $275 plus a $12 fee, if 4 months or older, for rabies registration for McLean County residents.\n\nHe has been neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm checked, dewormed, and is on flea and heartworm preventatives.\n\nTo be considered for adoption, you must first submit the application found at: \n http://fs16.formsite.com/WishBoneCanineRescue/adoptionapplication/index.html\n\nFor information about this dog's breed(s), visit: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/abc.htm",

Both were very skinny and Hank was nearly blind, which we later learned was caused by cataracts in both eyes.  After some time, attention, and lots and lots of food, both boys are looking and feeling a whole lot better.  Hank is an energetic dog who loves to roam and explore.  When he\u2019s in a new area he enjoys scouting out every nook and cranny.  Hank doesn\u2019t have much interest in toys, and would rather be pet or walk around.  He is also quite expressive with his paws and often waves them around.  Hank is currently scheduled to have surgery on his eyes, which should remove the cataracts and restore his vision.  Hank is a package deal with his brother Cash.  They are a bonded pair and should be adopted together!  Hanks is incredibly friendly and will lick your face if you let him!  If you want extra points, bring some snacks.",

            "description": "Bolo / Male / 1 Year / 60 lbs / Boxer Mix / Scarborough\n\nMeet Bolo! Bolo was rescued off the streets of Mexico City when he was just a puppy. He was adopted out but then returned when the family felt ill-equipped to handle his energy level and the specific needs of a deaf dog. Lucky for Bolo he ended up in the loving hands of our partner shelter. Once he was cleared to travel, he made the long trip to Canada in search of his forever home!\n\nBolo is a very happy dog and when he meets new people he has the most wiggly bum you\u2019ll ever see. He is described as loving, goofy, playful, social, smart and energetic. His favorite spot in the whole world is to be cuddled up next to his people. He loves to chew bones and stuffed kongs. He also loves stuffy toys but true to the boxer in him, has a tendency to be a bit rough with them. He is starting to learn fetch and has gotten pretty good at returning the ball. He will make the ultimate side-kick to a special family who doesn\u2019t see his deafness as a disability, as it doesn\u2019t slow him down at all!\n\nBolo loves to meet all people, and will be at the first at the door welcoming strangers (or his family) into the home. He is still learning how to play respectfully with humans, and can be mouthy at times. He has already made massive improvements in foster care but is not looking for homes with small children. Although he has never shown signs of aggression, with his play and size would prefer homes with dog savvy children that are ages 10+.\n\nBolo is on the higher side of medium energy and currently getting a long walk in the morning plus lots of time to play in the backyard. He is smart and is learning a \u201cpotty sign\u201d to open the lines of communication. He potty breaks are scheduled but if he is sniffing around a spot more than usual, he will be let outside using the \u201cpotty sign\u201d and lots of praise signing \u201cyes\u201d once he goes in the right place. An adjustment period should be expected when he enters a new environment.\n\nBolo is a great walker on leash and has not expressed any fears. He is being walked on a gentle leader and when he loses focus, it is easy to regain his attention with gentle correction on his harness. The gentle leader is not for pulling but for allowing another form of communication while outside. He is easily walked with a loose leash in heal position.\n\nBolo is a very agile dog and has jumped right on the dining room table before. He will need a 6-8 foot fence in his backyard, anything lower he can likely pounce over. Regardless he can be driven when he wants something, so will alway require supervison while in his backyard. Due to his deafness, he will never be suitable for off leash/unsecured time outdoors.\n\nHe is currently learning hand signals for all basic commands. He is learning sit, stat, potty, yes, no, eating, now, leave it, happy and recall within closed spaces. Bolo is smart and always eager to learn. His foster Mom says his current roster of commands is just for the beginning for him! He is still very much a puppy and will need support with basic house manners. He will try to put anything and everything in his mouth, and may chew things if he is bored and unsupervised. Adopters should be comfortable with consistent redirection as needed.\n\nFor many deaf dogs, they become anxious when separated from their people. It will take time to work through it with Bolo as he can be vocal when left alone. He has never been destructive but has only been left alone for short periods. As a precaution the bars of his crate are sprayed with bitter apple to limit his drive to escape.\n\nBolo\u2019s ideal home would be a detached house, with a fully fenced backyard. He would be fine in city or suburban life, as long as his exercise needs are met. Bolo loves the company of other dogs but can\u2019t hear \u201cback off cues\u201d so will need initial stages of relationships to be managed by his humans. He would also be fine as the only dog in the home, where he can be the centre of attention all day! Bolo has not been tested with cats.\n\nBolo is a Boxer mix with his full tail. He\u2019s a powerful wagger and suffers from \u201cHappy Tail\u201d. He wears a fashionable tail wrap so he can wag to his heart\u2019s content without worries of re-injury. Adopters will need to keep an eye on his tail and ensure he does not re-injure it. A Tractive GPS will be a requirement of Bolo's adoption, because he is deaf.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Bolo please apply at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/adoption-info#adoption-form\n\nBolo\u2019s adoption fee is $700.

Both were very skinny and Cash had a deformed, stunted front leg which he was most likely born with.  After some time, attention, and lots and lots of food, both boys are looking and feeling a whole lot better.  Cash is a happy, friendly dog who loves to meet people.  He doesn\u2019t really understand how to play with toys.  For Cash, just hanging out with his brother and his human friends is enough.  He is currently scheduled to have his deformed leg amputated, which we think will aid with his mobility and overall comfort levels.  Cash is a package deal with his brother Hank.  They are a bonded pair and should be adopted together!  Just look at how happy he is.  How could you resist that face?",

            "description": "Annabelle #7658 is a 4-year-old female Pit Bull mix. She is a calm, sweet girl who is a good listener. She loves to give and receive kisses. She doesn\u2019t seem very interested in other dogs, so for this reason we recommend a slow introduction to any housemates. Annabelle is crate trained. She responds to the commands: sit, stay, and come. Her favorite treats are milk bones. She walks well on the leash. Annabelle has a moderate to high energy level, depending on the situation. She is the most sweet girl who has a lot of love to give. Annabelle is an LCAR mom and came to us with puppies in tow. Now that they have been weaned, it\u2019s her turn for some R&R and a home of her own. She also came to us with heartworms. We are seeking an adopter that will continue her treatment, provided by LCAR, at no additional cost. She weighs 66 pounds and is full grown. This pup is microchipped. We believe you can always teach an \u2018old\u2019 dog new tricks, so we highly recommend continued obedience training for this smart pup; it stimulates the dog's mind and establishes a good dog/adopter relationship. This pup, like all pups, should be on heartworm preventative; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If you are interested in adopting this dog, and are already approved to adopt through our organization, please contact dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with the pup\u2019s name and ID number in the subject line. OTHERWISE, please submit an adoption application online: http://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.org/adoptus.html E-mail dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with questions. Stay tuned to our Facebook page for updates: www.facebook.com/LCARMD #adoptlove #PicMe #petsmartcharities\n",

He had been wandering around the area as a stray for several months. Despite several people in the area trying to see if he has an owner, there was no luck. It was cold and rainy the day we were asked to save him and we were so glad that friendly Jake came right up to our volunteer and happily got into the car. He was taken off to safety, and will be fully vetted. We can't wait to get to know more about him! He is HW positive and will be treated at SSR's expense. Jake is oblivious to my resident male dog, was hesitant at first but now is fine. He's not food aggressive, he goes into his crate without issue and housebroken. First night, I felt confident with him and I did not crate him and all was fine. He's showing to be a quiet, sweet gentlemen. He does not like getting a bath.\nIf you are an approved adopter and are interested in this dog, please let your case worker know. If you are not yet an approved adopter but are interested, please complete an adoption application!\nYou can review our adoption process, www.shenandoahrescue.org/adoption-process if interested. Donations can be made at shenandoahrescue.org/donate or on PayPal to info@shenandoahrescue.org",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Hobbes is 2 years old at the time of intake in January 2021. Hobbes is good with people, other dogs and even cats. This handsome guy was attacked by some type of animal, and he showed up at a kill shelter with those open wounds. The shelter patched him up and then, because Hobbes is so wonderful and sweet, they called Rescue Dogs Rock NYC and asked if we would take Hobbes into our rescue so he would be sure to find a fabulous forever home. And of course we said YES! Hobbes has a silly little nub of a tail that seems to be natural! He is a super friendly guy who will make a terrific 4 legged companion. If you would like Hobbes to join your family, please apply online to adopt Hobbes (SC) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

He came into the shelter as a lost dog with ID on Jan. 20 and his family could not be contacted through is microchip. He will be available for adoption 2/3. He knows \"sit\" and probably more commands. Money is about 2 years old and weighs 55 pounds. He is neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations and will be heartworm tested upon adoption. Come meet him in Run 856 using ID#626958.\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

He is a great companion and loves to go on walks/runs and be outside, but also is a great indoor dog. His ideal home is where he has room to play (and a yard) and is the only animal of the family. He also does best with adults and older children (12+).\nPetey is a little anxious, but adjusts pretty quickly. He is not a fan of fireworks or storms but does not do anything destructive. He just wants to be beside you and comforted.\nPetey is a territorial guy and not great around other animals. He's perfectly content to be the only animal at home.\nAge: 4 years\nWeight: 80 lbs\nVetting: neutered, up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative\nTemperament: Good with teens, older, respectful kids (over 12) and adults\nTraining: Housetrained, crate trained, good on leash, knows commands and tricks\n\nEmail for questions: katy.daher@gmail.com\n\nTo ensure we're meeting both pet and adopters' needs, we ask potential adopters to complete an Adoption Application ( www.bit.ly/DH-Adoption ) for caretakers to review. Once approved, we will bring the adoptable pet to your home for a preliminary visit. We are 100% donation funded; unless otherwise noted above, please expect a minimal adoption fee of $250 to cover each pet's basic vetting.",

            "description": "Animal Profile: Bubba is an adorable heeler mix puppy (possible lab or pittie mix, best guess) that will be joining us from Texas soon. He is 3 months old and weighs around 25 pounds and will be coming with two siblings. He is a typical happy, goofy puppy! We will post more info as we get to know him.\n\nSeattle Foster Update:\nBubba is learning to trust and love people as much as he loves food. He'll let you know he wants attention with a cute little bark. Then he just wants to be spoken to or played with. His favorite things are chew toys, balls, and squeaky toys. Bubba is comfortable in his crate where he sleeps through the night and retires for daytime naps. Bubba has a sorrowful face yet shows his happiness when he wiggles his entire body. Bubba\nwould do best in a home with a securely fenced yard and someone with breed or similar like breed experience.\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $500, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, and heartworm test. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue.\n\nApply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org\n\nAnimal History: This dog was rescued from euthanasia at a high-kill shelter in Texas and is joining us via our TX rescue partner to find a forever home. This dog will be available for adoption in Seattle once evaluated in a foster home.\n\nAbout Foster to Adopt Program:\nFosters provide a safe landing spot for dogs transitioning from the shelter environment and help prepare the dogs for adoption. You provide the love and structure, and we take care of everything else! We cover all vet care, and drive the adoption process. Average length of foster is 2-3 weeks. Fosters do get first consideration for adoption, if desired.\n\nApply to foster online at www.doggoneseattle.org/foster-application",

            "description": "Hara and her brother Zeus came to the rescue after being dumped and it was clear that they received very little human interaction during the very short time they have been alive. they are estimated to be 4-5 months old and they weigh about 25 pounds right now. They are timid and shy but show no form of aggression. They are sweet and want to be loved and show so much interest but just need the right homes that have the time and patience to let these sweet pups know that humans are ok and they are safe and loved for the rest of their lives. A home with a fully fenced back yard is preferred and another dog in the home would be incredible for them to learn what is ok and not ok from. There are no cats at the rescue so we don't know how they would do living with cats at this time. A home with no small/young kids would be best as loud noises and young kids wanting to play when they aren't ready won't help them with their growth and confidence. \n\nShe is currently in Fort Worth, TX but will making the trek to Olympia, WA scheduled to arrive on Saturday Feb 6th  IF she is pre-adopted meaning you need to get your app in, approved and pay the adoption fee to secure her.  Her adoption fee is $450 which covers her spay, vaccinations, HW testing, chipping, health certificate and transport fees. All our dogs come with a 30 day, money back, trial period to make sure they are the right fit in your environment. Tall Tails Rescue has a commitment to these dogs for their lifetime and we hope you do too! If you are thinking of adopting any of our dogs contact us today!

            "description": "Louisiana is being fostered in Chicago.\n\nLouisiana is in search of an experienced adopter. Please read what her foster mom has to say about her below:\n\nLouisiana aka Louise aka Miss Weezie is a very special lady, who came from a previously harder life. She is very fond of her people, but has never been taught how to appropriately show affection. She loves to snuggle and be petted, but is very much a DIVA, and would like it on her terms only. She would love nothing more than to be the center of your world, and loves to be wherever you are. She has a funny walk because of her knees, but no evidence that they are slowing her down!\n\nShe will likely need a more experienced dog owner, as she does have some behavioral tendencies that we are working with her on. She is potty trained and very smart, but is still suffering from some emotional trauma from her previous life.\n\nShe does currently live with dogs and cats, but I believe she would be more comfortable as an only pet who can be spoiled.\n\nShe will need lifelong medication for her eye issues but is very good at receiving her medications.\n\nShe has been settling very nicely into the routine of her foster life, and is looking for someone who may have the patience to help her adjust slowly.\n\nShe has a big heart and is full of love, and has improved so much since coming into our home. She is so spunky and full of life and she's hoping you may have room in your heart to help her really find her place and confidence!\nLouisiana will need a very patient owner, who understands that everything will be on her terms. She does accept her eye medications with no fuss, and she always does well at the vet. She still has inappropriate reactions to certain stimuli, and may never be a warm cuddly, loves to be held/touched type of dog. But having said that, she does want attention, and can be very sweet! \n\nShe is not perfect, and will not be the perfect dog for everyone, but we know there is someone that she would be the perfect dog for. Could that be you? \nBDRA has voted against the use of electrical fencing effective immediately.",

Her adoption fee will include vaccinations, worming, microchipping and spaying.  Phoebe and her siblings were surrendered to the Center through no fault of their own.  Phoebe is friendly and easy going but lacks some basic social skills because she and her siblings were kept in kennels outside and are a little on the timid side with no leash skills.  But these sweet dogs are eager for love.....and hope that someone will take a chance on them.  They deserve a chance at love and life because they are sweet and smart....and given the chance, they may become a loyal companion to the person who has a little patience and love to spend on these dogs.  They seem to do well with other dogs and they don't seem bothered by the shelter cat.  I am betting that they will also be great with kids. Hurry to meet Phoebe and her siblings and take a chance on them....you won't be disappointed.",

Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet him.\n\nNibbles is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~2 years \nWeight: ~33lbs\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate trained: Has done well confined to a small area (kitchen) when his foster has been away for brief periods of time.\nDog sociability: Nibbles is selective with his dog friends and while he is not overtly aggressive/reactive, he will growl/is not interested in interacting with other dogs and should be a solo dog in his forever home.\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Unknown\nIdeal home: Nibble is looking for a loving home in a quiet neighborhood. He will need to remain on restricted activity for the next ~9 months due to his heartworm.\n\nMeet Nibbles! This small guy is so sweet and gentle. He is smart, too! He has mastered 'sit' in foster care and is ready and eager to learn even more tricks. Training will come in handy as this guy will need to be kept chill these next several months as he needs to be kept relatively calm due to his heartworm positive status. Nibbles loves to cuddle and will keep you warm this winter! \n\nNibbles is heartworm positive and will be undergoing treatment at our Ellis Veterinary Clinic. OTAT will cover the cost of her treatment until he is heartworm negative. They will need to remain on exercise restriction for the next ~9 months. For information on the heartworm treatment process, visit: onetail.org/heartworm\n\nNibbles' adoption fee is 300. He is neutered, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm positive. He will require booster vaccines at the adopter's expense. He has a grade 1/4 locating patella which may cause intermittent. If lameness persists may require surgical intervention which will be the adopter's responsibility. Will be predisposed to arthritis in affected knee.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

I love everyone I meet and have even lived with cats in my previous home - ain't nothin' stoppin' me from having a good time, fur-sure! With a happy personality like mine, you'd never know I have any ailments, right? Well, unfortunately the docs here discovered I have something called cancer. I'm not sure what that is, but I've been told it isn't a good thing. But I don't let it get me down. I'm still a happy boy and I'll be grateful to spend the rest of my life being your best friend. If you decide to bring me home, know that you are doing a very noble thing. Whatever length my life ends up being, my time can be joy-filled thanks to you.",

These babies have been socialized with other dogs and children! They have not been around cats. We anticipate they will be medium to large breed dogs. These babies can be a bit shy when first meeting new people, but warm up quickly! They would love homes of their own!\n\nThey are spayed/neutered, microchipped, dewormed, current on flea and heartworm prevention, and have been given age appropriate vaccines. Their adoption fee is $400. \n\nTo be considered for adoption, apply today at farfetcheddogrescue.org. We will be approving applications as a group, and we will work with the adopters during the meet and greet to select the best fit. We will not be accepting applications for a specific puppy based on appearance.",

            "description": "\nUluru came to our rescue back around April 2020.\u00a0 He's aussie/cattle dog. He was bred by a farmer in Kentucky.\u00a0 He was one of eleven in the litter.\u00a0 All the puppies sold except for him and his sister. They got almost no human interaction.\u00a0 At 11 months the farmer dumped them in a shelter.\u00a0 They were so terrified that the shelter put them in a kennel in Kentucky and we didn't open the crate until the transport was in my backyard with the gate closed.\u00a0\u00a0It was another 12 hours before they would venture out of their crate.  They were 99% feral essentially a wild dog .  Ru grew up protecting his sister from the farmer and who knows what.  He was fiercely protective of his sister. He would lung and bark to get me away from the two on them. His sister got adopted.\n\nUluru has made a lot of progress to becoming a companion dog.  He walks very well on a leash.  He sticks close to me outside.  He only barks at me when he wants me to play ball with him. He is very quiet in the house and loves his crate.  He needs a patient person that will let him become a companion at his own pace.\n\nRu's birthday is 3/30/2019. He is neutered, up to date on medical.  He weighs 36 pounds. Everyday he gets closer and closer.  He's gone from sleeping on the back porch to sleeping in the living room. He even sleeps in my bedroom now and then.  Because he is still part feral he must have an above ground fence.  Herding dog experience would be helpful. The adoption fee is $250.  To be considered for adopting Uluru please go to https://apbdogs.org/apply-for-adoption/   For more information email Glenna at Wishandaprayer@aol.com",

Although very much loved, bonded pair Squirt & Bailey were surrendered when their owner could no longer care for them. Bailey is a gentle soul who loves belly rubs and is not your typical \u201cyappy\u201d yorkie. Squirt loves to play with his ball and when he\u2019s had enough, happily with settle down at your feet for a doze. Both love affection and bond closely with their people. They love to play and are happiest when with each other and their favorite humans.\n\nAlthough Bailey can alert bark when new people startle him by knocking at the door, he generally meets people well and likes making new friends. Squirt is just as friendly and easy going with all people. They are both happiest when humans are around and like to follow people around all day. They have not been tested with young children but previous owners explained they don\u2019t love babies or toddlers. They would do best with respectful children (ages 10+) that understand they are small and delicate.\n\nBailey has a tendency to chase after squirrels and can be a bit of an escape artist if left unattended. Backyards should be very firmly secured and they should have supervison at all times. Squirt prefers to stay close and has not shown and desire to escape. They are both fully potty trained granted they received enough opportunities to use the washroom. They may have accidents after stressful experiences (like visits to the vet or changes in environment) so adopters should expect an adjustment period.\n\nSquirt walks on leash very well but he does enjoy stopping to sniff or mark the ground. If Bailey pees somewhere, he has to go exactly where his brother did. Bailey is also a dream to walk on leash and will follow the pace of his humans. Sometimes if the lead is long enough he will walk ahead, but never pulls and will stop if his person stops.\n\nBoth are extremely well mannered in the home and don\u2019t need much training. If they are not allowed on furniture they adapt quickly but do love to cuddle up next to their family. Both know sit and with high value treats have proven to be very trainable. They sleep in a dog bed together in their foster parents bedroom.\n\nSquirt & Bailey are adaptable and can thrive in most living environments. Despite their age they love their walks and will need a family capable of providing 1-2 walks a day. They would prefer if their family is home more often than not, and will include them in daily activities. They have been tested with other small dogs and seem to do fine with everyone they meet. They have not been tested with cats.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Squirt & Bailey please apply at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/adoption-info#adoption-form\n\nSquirt & Bailey\u2019s adoption fee is $600.

He is a super handsome, friendly, high energy young man in need of an active family and some discipline and training. He absolutely has typical traits of both breeds as he is friendly, loves people and other dogs, smart, energetic, and happy! A home and family that is able to harness that energy and utilize his smarts would be the best case scenario for this young man. Clyde loves car rides, playing fetch and learning new tricks. He would make an awesome running, hiking and biking partner. He loves children but may be too big and boisterous for young children. His previous family loved him, but were an older couple and didn't have the time or energy to work with him. Because they want the best possible outcome for Clyde, he comes with an offer to pay for training with a professional dog trainer. Clyde is in a foster home in Missoula. His adoption fee is 150.00 and he is up to date on vaccinations. To meet Clyde please fill out an online application form on our website LSAR.org.",
