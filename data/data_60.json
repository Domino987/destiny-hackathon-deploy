            "description": "Up for adoption in Texas: Duke.\n\nDuke is a six-year-old, 72 lb. black lab mix. \n\nDuke was rescued from a shelter where he was surrendered by his owner who was in the predicted path of Hurricane Laura. \n\nAs it turns out, Duke was one of about 70 total pets in a hoarding situation. He came to Lucky Lab 15-20 lbs. underweight. \n\nWe are pleased to report that Duke has made it through his heartworm treatment and is also now a healthy weight.\n\nDuke is a medium-energy dog who loves to go on brisk walks and smell ALL the smells! He is very strong on a leash and is known to take his walkers for their walks. \n\nHe will require leash training if leash walking is a desired skill. He loves to greet fellow canine walkers with enthusiastic barking. He is not aggressive but is expressing his desire to go say hello.\n\nDuke is also a big fan of sunning in the backyard and rolling in the grass.\n\nDuke loves to be near his humans. He is perfectly content to lay on the kitchen floor while you are making dinner or watch TV with you in the evenings. He is very flexible about hanging out with you. \n\nIn his current foster home, he knows to stay off the furniture. However, he has shown interest in getting on the couch and would be happy to snuggle up once invited. \n\nHe is fully crate trained, and sometimes enjoys going in his crate just for a nap on his orthopedic bed. Duke is crated when no one is home and overnight. He is very curious and LOVES stuffed animals and socks, especially if they belong to his current human siblings.\n\nDuke will do best in a home with other Labs or larger dogs. He has done well in another foster home with Labs and does well meeting new friends his size. Duke is currently in a home with two kids - 11 and 8 years old. While he does well with them, he can get over-excited and want to continue to play even when they are done. He may do best in a home with older children.\n\nDuke is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, and housebroken. He is ready for his furever home. Could that be yours? If so, please apply on our website now: www.luckylabrescue.com",

            "description": "Meet Miss Lacey! This pretty little lady is a 6- year-old spayed female in need of a new home. She was adopted by her current home about 2 months ago and hit it off with everyone except the male head of household. From what we\u2019ve been told she\u2019s wary of him and has growled a few times in a manner that makes him uncomfortable. \n\nLike many Rottweilers, Lacey can be aloof with people she doesn't know, but a snuggle bug once she gets to know you. The owner notes she can be growly and fearful sometimes in new circumstances, but once she becomes more comfortable she\u2019s no longer fearful and is friendly. Like a lot of rescues, she gets her confidence from her handler.\n\nLacey gets along well with the other dogs in the household (male English Setter and a 7-pound Chihuahua mix, mostly just ignoring the latter), and also ignores the geriatric cat that lives in the bedroom down the hall. She\u2019s been around the owner\u2019s goats without issue, and actually helps at feeding time, keeping an eye on her human while the goats are being fed and cared for. \n\nShe rides in the car well and is friendly to those she meets, and is nonreactive to the UPS and mail delivery people. She was sweet and well-behaved for her vet visit, rolling onto her back during the exam. She\u2019s a little chubby right now (no shame!) at 122 pounds, and her owner is working on getting her trimmed down with more activity and feeding regular meals (vs. free feeding). She has good leash manners and walks well on harness or collar, but the no-pull harness is helpful with her large size. \n\nHer owner tells us Lacey is a love bug \u2013 \u201cwhen she's happy her whole body wiggles (not just her tail), I really enjoy interacting with her, she loves to have all of your attention and returns that. She is very appreciative of a kind home and quiet person and makes sure you know how much she appreciates you. I enjoy helping her learn to be more confident of her actions in our household, she's very attentive, smart, thinks things through, she's a very willing and quick learner, retains and follows rules/boundaries very well. She's beautiful (and will be more so as she becomes fitter), has gorgeous movement, and is really eye-catching.\u201d\n\nWe feel Lacey would do best in a quiet home with another dog for a pal, and no children under age 12. Regular exercise will keep her on her weight loss regimen, and she\u2019ll be your best friend forever. \n\nPlease apply to adopt here: https://spdrdogs.org/rescue-referral/how-to-adopt/ \n\nWashington State or Oregon only \u2013 no interstate transports\n\nVisit our Facebook page here: https://www.facebook.com/SPDRRottweilerRescue",

I'm Magic and I'm a 3 year old, 58lbs, Pitbull Terrier mix.\n\n- I was rescued from the shelter the day I was scheduled to be euthanized as I had injuries in both of my left legs; it's believed that I had endured a traumatic injury that wasn\u2019t treated, which caused my untreated front left paw to curl up due to muscle atrophy. Luckily, it didn't cause me any pain, and instead I used it as a tool to prop myself up.\n\n- I am literally great with everyone! All dogs, men and women, kids, OH! but I do wanna chase cats, so no cats for me please!\n\n- I am a goofy, playful, SUPER sweet boy! I love to give kisses, jump all over you when I see you (something that my foster is working with me on), and LOVE to cuddle!!! \n\n- I'm really great on the leash, although I can also pull when I get excited and want to say hi to other people and doggos, so I'm learning to be less excited about all that! \n\n- I already know how to sit and stay, and am fully house trained, because I'm such a smart boy!! \n\n- Because of the hip surgery I just had, I will need daily physical therapy done by my adopter, about 20-30 mins a day of stretching/rotating my joints, massaging the muscles in both my left legs, so that I can hopefully regain full function of it soon! But that won't last forever, just until I've recovered from my recent surgery!\n\n- I will need a home with very limited stairs, and limited daily exercise like short walks (at first), since I am still recovering from my surgery. That being said, I am a very energetic young boy, and I can't wait to be fully back in action so I can do longer walks/runs and hikes when I've recovered!! \n\n- My ideal home would be in a home with a yard, and another big doggo to play with, as I have a lot of energy and am a playful goofy pup! \n\nIf you see me online I am still available for adoption! If you are interested in adopting me please fill out an application here: www.hitlivingfoundation.org/adoption-application, and email a video walkthrough of your home and yard to BOTH Nicole@hitlivingfoundation.org AND Marta@hitlivingfoundation.org. Your application will not be counted as valid without your video. You will hear back from us within a few days.",

Please indicate your awareness in your application and we will send the full incident report for your review. We will not be adopting Arnold to a family with children under the age of 16. Thank you!**\n\nWith a curl in his tail and ears that say the sky's the limit, Arnold is full of possibilities. An independent boy with a mind of his own, Arnold is a playful fellow with a lot of energy. If you're looking for an adventure buddy, or a long walk specialist, Arnold is the guy.\n\nBeing super smart makes Arnold a promising student. Ripe for rules and leadership, this boy is all set to learn the household routine and the proper way to be a dog. Already a super-fan of fetch, Arnold loves his toys. Praise and consistency will only turn Arnold into the superstar he was meant to be.\n\nNot just your average brainy canine, Arnold is very charming. Dishing out kisses and attached to his blankie, Arnold and his soulful brown eyes will melt hearts all around the neighborhood. It won't be long until Arnold is the talk of the town and everyone's favorite dude. He knows how special he is. If you've been waiting for the right guy to come along, Arnold is ready for you.\n\nArnold is 2 years old, 14 lbs, and ready for his forever home!

            "description": "When we first got the call on a dog that was hit by car we were told it was urgent. He was located 45 minutes from Sioux City. When I got there he was crying in pain and literally bleeding to death. The drive home seemed like it took forever. When I got back to Sioux City the Siouxland Animal Hospital was ready when we arrived. We honestly didn\u2019t know if he was going to make it. His pelvis was crushed, his tail was broken in multiple places with the worst break at the base, that\u2019s also where he was losing the most blood from.\nAfter a week in the hospital Dr Saulsbury knew his tail was not savable. The dead tissue was sloughing off. They ended up amputating his tail at the base. After a week an a half of not being able to stand up even on his two front legs he finally started gaining strength. Day 10 he decided that was enough and stood up and took a few steps. After weeks in the hospital he was finally transferred into foster care. There he has remained for rehab.\nSavay is an 8 month old shepherd mix. He is a super sweet playful pup. He\u2019s not quite housebroken yet, but he\u2019s working very hard on it. He\u2019s dog friendly and seems to like everyone he meets. He has made great progress since his run in with the car. He\u2019s getting stronger and walking better every day, but still needs to take it slow for a while longer. He may always have a hitch in his getty up but his charming personality makes up for it.\nAt this point we feel it is time for him to find his forever home. He has been provided with all of the medical attention he needs including neuter and vaccinations. If you feel you could give this guy the best life ever please click on the link below to complete an adoption application. His adoption fee is $135.\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/50308432400137\n",

He rides quietly in the car and has very nice leash manners when walking around his foster's suburban neighborhood. He is completely house trained! His prior owner could no longer afford to care for Rudy, so surrendered him to a local Maryland shelter. Rudy is leash reactive so his ideal forever home is in the suburbs (no city living) with a yard and minimal stairs.\n\nRudy has luxating patellas but he is still able to go for short walks, maneuver his foster home and handle a few stairs daily. Due to the luxating patellas, a forever home with limited stairs is ideal. To help Rudy feel is best, he will have his patella surgically repaired on March 3. He is still available for adoption and OBG will cover all medical expenses. Rudy has a mild heart murmur that just needs to be monitored without medication and a completely excised lump was a low grade sarcoma. Good news with the complete removal, no additional treatment is needed! Rudy is a happy guy looking for a home in 2021!\n\nTo learn more, please send an email to his foster at the link below. 2/2/21 4:21 PM",

            "description": "Bella ACCT-A-80046\n\nIntake: Owner Surrender\nSex: Female\nAge: 2Y\nAltered: Yes\n\nMeet Bella! This brindle beauty is about 2 years old and full of love. She's the tug-o-war queen and happily entertains herself with her rope and Kong toys. She indulges in long naps in her kennel or bed throughout the day, while coming over every once in a while for a nice rub.\n\nShe enjoys walks around the neighborhood and is great on the leash. Bella's a little timid of loud noises and busy intersections but is getting more comfortable on each walk. She will need to be the only pet in the home, as she is reactive to other dogs. Bella will need time to warm up, but will be extremely loyal to her new family.\n\nBella is crate trained and working on house training. She loves working for treats and has already learned \"sit.\n\n**VIDEOS**\nBella Outside: https://youtu.be/TFxoTa8bpGs\nBella Walking https://youtu.be/Y_px1LdzqHQ\nBella knows sit https://youtu.be/amB6XMf27l0\nBella in Run https://youtu.be/G8o2bqLZROk\n\nMedical Observation:\n1/24 (Vet Check)-- Initially calm and quiet in kennel when approached, but became quickly overstimulated and jumping barking at cage door. Will start trazodone at low dose with room to increase if necessary.\n1/5 (Vet Check) -- Patient has had a reported limp since 12/3 that appears responsive to medical management but has not resolved. Patient seems uncomfortable in the left tarsus and hip joints and has some muscle atrophy in the left leg. Recommend further work up at full service hospital with radiographs and sedated orthopedic examination.\n1/1 (Per Clinic) -- Unable to examine due to behavior. Came in for right hind leg limping, seen limping out side, recommend x-rays.\n12/3 (Vet Check) -- The patient is a young adult large breed dog with a reported history of dragging one of her back legs. On orthopedic exam today, she appeared to be comfortable on all four limbs and no dragging was observed.\n11/29 (Physical Exam) -- Red eyes, hair loss, BAR\n\nBehavior Observation:\n1/24 (Per Staff)-- Kennel Presentation: Easy to leash/social. On approach, barking with front paws on kennel door. Sat for treat and held sit while being leashed. No issues returning to kennel or removing leash. Started barking once kennel door was closed.\nLeash Skills: Pulls Moderately On Leash\nHandleability: Loose/Allows all handling. Allows handling all over with loose body. In yard, frequently returns to handler for pets.\nTag: No interest. Would run up to handler when called but would not follow when tag was initiated.\nToys: Interest but does not take possession. Chased tennis balls when tossed but lost interest when she got there.\nColor Level: Blue. Previously eval'd as Blue. This eval would be Gold but other behavior notes indicate reactivity when returning to kennel for some handlers so leaving as Blue.\n1/12 (Per Vet)-- unable to handle awake, sedated exam\n1/5 (Per Volunteer) -- Volunteer mentioned that she had Bella out and while outside Bella was affectionate, social, and soliciting pets. On return to kennels Bella's demeanor changed and she began to growl and snap (not sure if she snapped at handler or at leash).\n1/5 (Per Volunteer)-- Kennel Presentation---Easy to leash/social---Easy to leash and remove from kennel. Began hard barking once back in kennel. Jumping on kennel door and barked at me. Tired to escape.\nLeash Skills---Pulls Moderately On Leash---Eager to explore and go for a walk. Pulls on leash but manageable due to her size\nHandleability---Loose/Allows all handling---Very sweet and allowed all handling. He did not solicit much attention on walk but once in run stayed close to me.\nTag--No interest---Not interested in playing. Preferred sniffing\nToys---No interest--Chased a ball but did not retrieve or show interest. \nKnows Sit and is housetrained. We passed one dog and Bella showed no interest\n1/5 (Per Previous Foster) -- Bella loves cheese and peanut butter, knows \"sit and was starting to understand \"shake and \"stay. She is crate-trained, and not fully housebroken but had been taking outside about every 2-3 hours during the day and rewarding all outdoor bathroom breaks; started to bark when she needed to go out (most of the time). Bella was reactive to other dogs and young children, would probably do best as the only pet. She's a super chewer, but only on her toys!\n1/4 (Intake) -- Returned from foster due to continued reactivity towards strangers, dogs, and children that has not improved over duration of foster care.\n1/4 (Per Previous Foster) -- She barks at all people and dogs when approached, and tends to pull towards them. She'll bark at some people/dogs that are further away (across the street or down the block), especially if they speak or acknowledge her. We've had some friends throw her cheese from a distance and she does calm down for a bit. Once they stop giving her treats, she'll start barking until we walk away from them. Yesterday an Amazon delivery person opened our front door, she was barking and tried to get to him. In all of the excitement, she somehow jumped up and bit my hand. It didn't break the skin.\n12/3 (Per Staff) -- Standing at front of kennel with tail tucked and shaking, but when handler approached wagged tail slightly - remained tense and shaking. When kennel door opened Becca retreated to the back of the kennel and was avoidant of handling. Handler kneeled down in kennel and was able to loop Becca, as soon as loop went over her head she turned around and exited kennel. Pulled hard on leash through kennels, and remained tense on leash at times flashing around, but then would settle down. Once in run stayed close to handlers soliciting attention and leaning in for pets with wagging tail and loose body, but would yawn, whimper and pant simultaneously. Handler had to step back into kennel and Becca followed behind, no issues removing leash. \n12/2 (Per Staff) -- Attempted to remove from kennel but Becca is very nervous. At front of kennel when handler approached and would sniff hand but retreat. Would return to front of kennel for cheese and stayed at front when kennel door was opened and leash presented. Easily leashed but then retreated to back of kennel. Would come back to handler when lured with cheese. Would take cheese gently from hand and allowed handler to slowly pet but would not exit kennel despite coaxing and cheese. Spent a few minutes in kennel with Becca and she would allow petting and solicit attention from handler but could not get her to exit. Leash easily removed.\n11/29 (Per Vet Staff) -- Unable to get weight or examine teeth due to behavior, Fractious.",

There was unfortunately 13 dogs that were already deceased in the Uhaul when the rest were rescues. All the babies have been through the ringer.\n\nWe were able to get all animals relinquished to us and won the case! He is the last of the \"Uhaul Dogs\" in the shelter.  He is very sweet and playful.  Charlie is right around a year old and quite the wild child. He will need a very patient home willing to work with him to become the best dog he can be. He knows how to sit. He needs work on walking on a leash without pulling.. he will need a 6 ft fence. He appears to be potty training for the most part in his kennel but WILL need potty trained because he still has accidents when in a house. He is great with dogs around his size (no small dogs) but needs a dog in the house with a lot of tolerance for a dog that has no means of personal space (HE NEEDS WORK ON NOT JUST BITING AND IMMEDIATELY PLAYING WITH OTHER DOGS). Charlie has no respect of personal space with dogs. \nHe really is a sweet boy and just needs training and love. If you are interested please let us know!",

            "description": "Meet Meg!\n\n15-year-old Meg was brought to the Long Beach Shelter as a stray and arrived at Frosted Faces on January 5th. We took her to College Animal Hospital where we learned she has severe dental disease and cannot see due to cataracts. We are waiting to get to know her to determine whether she can handle dental surgery. In her first few days here, Meg was quiet and often napping, if not being held by volunteers. Understandable for a 15 year old, 6 lb. blind little girl who has been through a lot in the past weeks!\n\nFortunately, Meg went on an extended 3-week Frosted Fling with who gave Meg a loving, safe place to decompress and recover from dental surgery. Meg settled in nicely and got along well with the six other small dogs there. Here's what else we've learned:\n\nAlthough Meg is blind, she gets around well and found her way to the water bowl and dog beds on on the first day! She even found her way up the ramp, through the door, and into the house! Meg has a great appetite, and seems to be potty trained. Meg enjoys exploring the yard, being held, going on stroller rides. and taking naps in cozy beds.\n\nHer Fling Mom shares, \"Meg is a sweet, old lady, She lays quietly in your arms, totters around on stiff legs, and sleeps soundly. She loves her routine of food, naps, outdoor time, and snuggles.\n\nMeg is ready for her forever family!\"\n\nMeg is back onsite at Frosted Faces Foundation. Stop by to meet here during an upcoming Open House!\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption\n\nfees, and we help with medical costs!\n\nApply here to become a family:\nwww.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated 1/29/21 KG",

I like the outdoors, but I'm also happy just snuggling up on the couch watching some good ol' reality TV. I don't mind sharing my space with other pups if I'm not your one and only. As long as I get some belly rubs, I'm good to go! I was with my last family since I was a puppy, they told me I had to goand I don't know why! I loved them very much! I'm a little nervous now that my world has changed and need a home that will have a lot of patience while I warm up. Do you think you're my Furever Match?!",

I'm pretty chill in the house but outside I can get super playful.\n\nLucky Tales thinks I may be a Pointer mixed with some Pit, all I know is that I love playing with other dogs and I'm learning to overcome my shyness with people.\n\nMy new family should have at least one other playful dog, a securely fenced yard, and an abundance of love and patience.\n\nNow that I can run around and play, I've even lost a few pounds. I'm a solid fella weighing in around 75 lbs. I've been around older kids (11 and 14) and they're pretty cool. I just need a little time to get used to new people.\n\nI'm up to date on vaccinations, heartworm negative, microchipped, and neutered.\n\nMy adoption fee is $200\n\n",

He is active, loves to play and is always looking for his next adventure. He can get protective of his family/people/ though he is not aggressive or mean. Just very loyal and dedicated. \n\nHe does well with dogs after proper introductions. \n\nGiven his age and active nature he is looking for a home that knows how to set boundaries and teach him the ins and out of being a pet. \n\nHe was found roaming the streets of Mexico and while he learns and adjusts quickly he does need good direction. An experienced home or willingness to work with a trainer will help Rocco be his best doggo self! \n\nFlagstaff adopters preferred\n\nWE DO NOT ADOPT OUT OF STATE\n\nPLEASE NO PHONE CALLS\nOur rescue is run 100% by volunteers, so the best way to contact us is via email:  mgrarizona@gmail.com",

So sad that no one there would step up for this guy! We have no idea what type of mix he is but Terrier and Chi are possible.\nWhen we first saw Cody he was a whopping 40lbs!!!!! He could barely walk a few steps, had sores and scrapes from his tummy dragging on the ground and was in all around bad shape. We quickly found a temporary local foster and got him to safety. He was seen by the vet there and waited two weeks to be cleared for transport. While with his foster mom he lost 7lbs!!!!! I wish I could lose weight like that! He enjoyed walks and play time and discovered his coveted toys, which he never had before ? \nOnce Cody arrived in the Big Apple he went to his new foster home and settled in very quickly. He get his dinner of kibbles and green beans and his snacks are apples, carrots, berries and other fruits and veggies. \nHe\u2019s continuing to lose weight and loves being allowed to run around in the yard. He does get along with other dogs but can be a little humpy with one of the cute girls there and his favorite blanket. Other than that, he is simply pawfect! And he has a few extra toes on his back feet too! Those have to weigh something ?\nCody is currently around 29lbs, is about 7 or 8 from best guesstimate and just a love cuddler. \nCody is located in Bellmore NY\nHis adoption fee is $425\n",

            "description": "This beautiful boy goes by the name of Sarge!  Sarge may not have been given the right conditions in those first important weeks of his life where puppies learn how to behave and be social dogs.  He has not yet learned that mouthing and nipping (as puppies do) is not acceptable behavior for a young dog like him.\n\nHowever, we strongly feel that given the right conditions and training Sarge will make someone a great dog.  Someone with experience in working with German Shepherds will be necessary for Sarge to succeed.  \n\nSarge wants so badly to be loved, and once he gets to know you, he doesn\u2019t want you to leave him behind.  He will cry and whine \u2013 because he just wants to be with people. There will be a need to work on his separation anxiety issues and have some patience.  He will also need a quiet and slow decompression period once he is adopted into a home.  Due to this initial display of separation anxiety, we don't believe Sarge would do well in an apartment/condo/townhome setting.  \n\nSarge doesn\u2019t like raised voices and any form of training can only be done with positive reinforcement methods, no aversive training as this will definitely not give the desired result with a dog like Sarge.  He is sensitive, but so lovable!  \n\nSarge enjoys toys and treats so there is plenty of room for motivation during training. When Sarge gets over stimulated, he may exhibit some naughty grabbing/mouthing behaviors. He does respond to a \u201csit\u201d and a treat though so he can calm down that way.\n\nFor you to consider adopting Sarge we would like you to visit him a few times at the rescue so he can get to know you.  We are only accepting applications from local folks with German Shepherd experience.  If you are interesting in making Sarge a part of your family, please visit www.crcpa.org, and complete an application!",

Very sweet and friendly. All age appropriate shots are completed.  He was not able to have his neuter surgery due to being cryptorchid.  In other words, his testicles are not where they need to be yet for surgery.  Usually by 6 months or so everything falls into place.  He can to go his new home with the agreement that when he is neutered,  and we are sent proof, we will refund $100 of his adoption fee back to you.\nHe is a sweet boy and the last pup we have! Don't miss out on this handsome boy.\n\nAdoption fee $350",

This cutie was saved from euthanasia back in 2014 but she hasn't had the best luck. Haley was adopted a while back but was returned to our rescue since her mom was having financial issues and couldn't keep her anymore. This cutie is what you call a fun dog who loves to give kisses. Haley is very affectionate and loves to be around humans. This cutie is a little over 8 years old but you would never think She\u2019s that old because she still has the heart of a 3 year old dog. Haley loves nature, loves going for adventures, jogging and hiking are definitely things she loves to do. \nHaley is housebroken, kennel trained, spayed, microchipped, HW negative, walks good on a leash, fully vetted, know Basic Commands like Sit, lay and stay, and she is always Eager to Learn More! Haley doesn\u2019t really like for people to mess with her food while she is eating so she would do better in a home with kids over the age of 7. Haley prefers to be the only dog at home so she can get all the attention to herself and give her family all the love.  Haley is very smart so the ideal family for her is one who is confident, will give me structure, take her for some fun adventures, and give her lots of love ?? \n\nFollow Haley\u2019s instagram page so you can see all her cool adventures and if interested in making her part of your family please visit www.bravebullyrescue.org and fill out an adoption application. \n \nIG account: bravebully_haley",

It\u2019s the cutest thing to watch him waddling around playing ball. He is just the type of boy that you want to come home to after a rough day at the office or to hang by your side while you telework. Lucky does tire out quickly so you will find him lounging around with a toy. This boy will look you in the eyes and just melt your heart. Lucky is already becoming the volunteer favorite but sshhhh don\u2019t tell the other pups. His perfect home would be with adults only and as the only pet. He would be fine with older kids. \n\nApply at pittiesandpals.com!",

She is getting spayed 1/9, microchipped, up to date on vaccines and prevention and heartworm negative. Her adoption fee is $150. Sadie Mae does suffer from possible IVDD and may have flare up back issues ongoing throughout the rest of her life but it doesn't stop her from living her best life! From Sadie's foster mom: Hi, I'm Sadie! I am a distinguished lady who would never admit her age, although I'm 12. I may have arthritis but am doing well on my feet. I like friends of all sizes, genders, and play energies if they are not feline. I do not like to share my food with other of the 4-legged variety. However, I don't mind it when mom takes or moves my bowl and I love pets while I eat. A little about me: FOOD FOOD FOOD!! I chase squirrels and small animals with glee; I LOVE bones, soft snuggle beds, pettings, and adventurous walks. I make the best class/office mate because I just want to sit and watch. I have arthritis but have been getting along great (with minor accommodations) and rebuilding my muscles while supporting my joints. What accommodations do you ask? I watch my weight and have a higher fat/calcium diet. I also need a small steroid, every other day, until cleared by the vet. Stairs can be a little tough but I'm ok with a small step up or a ramp.\n\nSadie will be ready to meet her forever family after her spay on 1/9. Please fill out this link for the application if you'd like to be approved to meet her https://toolkit.rescuegroups.org/of/f?c=SGVJMGQY",

He is house trained and gets along with other dogs and cats. He needs work on leash skills. We know from reported sightings that Jack was on his own for a while and traveled some distance before he was trapped. He can be skittish at times, but when he relaxes, he loves attention. He needs a family that has time, patience, and can make him feel safe. He does like to be with other dogs once he gets to know them. \n\nJack is a work in progress. He is very skittish, easily spooked. He shies from the leash but is being worked with on this as well as taking walks in the neighborhood. Jack needs hard chew toys as he loves to chew. He will sit nicely when asked and is not a jumper. He is very loyal and will stick close to his family member and loves to be given pets and lovins. He needs someone with time and patience to work with him. Training would be great. Jack has lots of love to give the right family!\n\nCurrent pets must be up to date on vaccines, dogs on heartworm prevention with a good history. We are requiring that Jack has an above ground fence as he is a flight risk. \n\nIf your home/family has time for this sweet guy, please fill out an application at: \n\nhttps://www.pawsofadamscounty.com/adoption-foster-app",

MESSAGES RECEIVED THROUGH PETFINDER WILL GO UNANSWERED.\nCopy and paste this URL link to learn everything you need to know about the adoption process and to fill out the application.\nhttps://www.grandstrandhumanesociety.com/adopt/\n\nSnowball and Tucker are a male and female bonded pair that we will be looking to find a home together. Tucker was adopted as a puppy from GSHS seven years ago. We were contacted when he and his playmate, Snowball, ended up in another shelter. So, we brought both of them back to Myrtle Beach.\nWhen you watch them play, you know it would be great if they could be adopted together. \nSnowball is fairly young and Tucker loves treats. They are the perfect size at around 25 to 30 pounds. Tucker is the larger of the two and is very outgoing. Snowball is a little bit more reserved and has the most adorable face. Tucker has a \u2018boo boo\u2019 on his nose that we are treating and Snowball has terrier like fur.",

Sally will make the perfect sidekick....she's great in social situations, very sweet and loving with every person she meets, and has no problems making friends with other pups. Some of Sallys favorite things are lounging, playing, snuggling, and eating yummy treats! Sally is also a smart cookie who is very eager to learn, walks great on a leash, and she's house trained!\n\nUnfortunately Sally did test positive for heartworms and will need treatment in about a month. This will require her to be on low activity 'rest' for about 4-5 weeks. Sally can still be part of the family during that time, just no running or high energy activities.\n\nSally is about 1 1/2 year old, 55 pounds, up to date on vaccinations, spayed, and microchipped.

This makes her all the more devoted to her owner and will hand out kisses non-stop! Maya was quick to learn her commands of sit, down, and stay. Maya even has a shake command where she will shake paws with you. She does like to play with a ball and will carry it around for a while and even spend some time chewing on it. Making her most happy is when she gets to play fetch. Maya loves going for car rides. She likes people over other animals, so might be best as the only pet in the house. She appears to be housetrained and does pretty well on leash. She does love going on long walks. She also likes to cuddle. If playing fetch, getting kisses, cuddling, and going on long walks in the park appeal to you . . . then you need to fetch this dog for yourself! I'm available for a 30 day adoption trial through the Foster to Adopt program. If you are interested in giving me a test adoption run in your home, please sign up for an adoption consultation. Learn more about our virtual adoption process .",

In order to set Cheer up for success we are requiring a video of the potential adopter\u2019s home (interior & exterior including backyard), once more, to set Cheer up long term with a loving, forever home. Only completed applications with an attached video will be considered. \n\nCheer\u2019s adoption fee is $400 which includes his neuter, microchip, fecal exam, and shots up to date. \n\nPlease consider opening your heart and loving home to this amazing boy.\n\nNote:\n\nAll dogs require a $100 training deposit. Once confirmation of the completion of a training class has been sent to the rescue, you will receive your deposit back in full.\n\nAs we are a rescue all of our adult dogs/puppies for adoption must be spayed or neutered. Although we make every attempt to have this done before finding their adoptive families, this is not always possible. Please speak with your adoption coordinator to see of this service has already been performed or they will explain to you if your new dog/puppy will need this service while in your care at no cost to you.\n\nWhen emailing please include your phone number to help speed up the adoption process.   Also, for the safety of our dogs we only adopt within a 2 hour radius of Joliet, Illinois to allow our volunteers to do home checks if necessary.",

            "description": "Lily is living in a foster home. Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet her.\n\nLily is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~3.5 years\nWeight: ~79lbs\nHousebroken: No, Lily will need work on this through a strict schedule and positive reinforcement training. Her pottying accidents typically stem from anxiety of being left alone.\nCrate trained: No, Lily doesn't love the crate and has instead been left with free roam to a sectioned off area when her fosters have left her alone. She does have some separation anxiety and will take time to settle. She will need an adopter that doesn't have shared walls and can continue to work on training for this.\nDog sociability: Selective with her dog friends. May be a match for some, but not all. She is protective over resources and would prefer not to live in a home with another dog. While on walks, Lily is leash frustrated and eager to meet other dogs. She will howl and pulls strongly towards other dogs\nCat sociability: Not a match\nKids: Not a match\nIdeal home: Lily is looking for a calm, adult-only home that is home often (during normal times, not just COVID) as she has separation anxiety. She prefers a quiet neighborhood and is not a match for a high-rise/elevator building. \n\nCalling all malamute lovers. Lily is one majestic pup looking for her forever home! She's smart, stoic, and sometimes sassy... your typical malamute. She's very calm and relaxed inside, and just loves being in the comfort of the same room as her humans. If she cuddles up next to you, consider yourself the lucky one! This girl needs patience, but she'll warm up in no time... the fastest way to her heart is through belly rubs and hot dogs. She loves learning new tricks to keep her mind sharp. She knows sit, shake, down, and is working on play dead (bang). Her fosters have a lot of fun working on a new trick each week, she's very smart and will do anything for a treat! She's working on potty training. Like clockwork, she starts her day at 7:30am. Her signals are very subtle, and she's very polite. If this girl sits for you, it's go-time. She loves long walks and is great on a leash. This girl would LOVE a backyard to zoom around off leash in. She'll chase after a tennis ball but don't expect her to bring it back. She'd rather run circles in the snow, and sniff out hidden treats. She hasn't quite learned the second half of fetch yet. Overall this girl is a very loving and loyal companion. There's nothing like the love of a malamute.\n\nLily's adoption fee is 300. She is spayed, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

Ella and her sister, Bellevue once had a family to call their own. A change in circumstance, however, left them in the care of a family member, who while they gave Ella and Belivue a space outside on their property, they were then virtually forgotten and neglected. The tips of their ears are missing due to fly bites, and their skinny frames indicated their meals were infrequent. To add insult to injury, Ella also tested positive for Heartworms. This, however, is where you come in.\n\nElla is looking for a loving home that can show her she is worthy of love and care, a home where she can be confident she will be fed each day and have a warm and cozy place to lay her head. In fact, she is loving her recent discovery of the sofa, although she may need a little help getting up. She is sweet and affectionate, and she is learning the nuances of living in a home more and more every day. Ella is looking for a family who can show her the true meaning of golden years and make sure the rest of her days are filled with comfort and love.\n\nThings to know about Ella:\n- Surrendered to the shelter with Belivue when the owner could no longer care for them\n- Sweet senior looking for a home to live out her golden years\n- Ella is a hospice dog who is Heartworm Positive and unable to go through treatment due to age \n- Loves people of all ages\n- Sweet and affectionate\n- Low / Medium energy\n- Will play with foster dad here and there, but mostly calm\n- Loves walks on the long lead\n- Enjoys sniffing outside\n- Likes car rides\n- Enjoys the couch \n- Loves treats\n- Dog Friendly - Coexists with other dogs - Prefers people over other dogs\n- No cats please\n- Working on house training \n- Crate Trained -  will whine, but calms down\n- Would make a good companion dog in a calm household\n\nLearn how to make Ella a member of your family at TLCrescuePA.com/adopt",

We immediately tagged her and after the holidays she made her way to us. She is hyper and wild and really needs another playful dog in the home, she's not a single dog for sure! She is spunky and hilarious and has the longest eyelashes we've ever seen! She will need work on manners with kids so please keep that in mind. We are sure she's going to have a ton of interest so please get your apps in ASAP if interested. \n\n $200.00 Adoption Fee \n\n(Which is considered a non refundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible. The fee itself is not negotiable, our vets don't negotiate and thus neither do we.)\n\nTo Contact Us\n\nMessage us through our website http://www.highplainspaw.org\n\nMessage the Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/HighPlainsPAW\n\nFill out our Adoption Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/adoption-application\n\nFill out our Foster Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/foster-application\n\nEmail us at highplainspaw@gmail.com\n\nCall our voicemail at (402)957-1578",

I'm working on leash manners as well.\n\nI weigh about 55 lbs and would love to find my perfect home. I live for the day, the hour and even the moment and would love to go on adventures with you!\n\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm tested negative (age 7 months and older) and microchipped. We do not ship or transport. A dog's adoption donation is $200.

She was unable to handle him well and did not provide consistent training.  He became fearful when approached in hallways and elevators by strangers, many with adaptive devices.  Dusty has nipped when afraid.\n\nSpecial Considerations:  Dusty would thrive in a home with an experienced owner.  He is VERY sweet and good with other dogs his size.  An experienced owner could help him navigate when afraid and teach him to be confident.  \n\nAdoption information at www.carerva.com",

There\u2019s not a mean bone in his body, and he\u2019s very calm and well behaved.  He is comfortable in the crate but prefers to just hang out in a room with tile or carpet.  Loves to snuggle up with his person, or observe what\u2019s going on in the house from his bed.  \n\nVander is Heartworm positive, and his treatment is covered by the rescue.  He needs a home where he can be kept calm and crated for 4 weeks after his procedure in 2 months. \n\nTo add Vander to your family, apply below! \n\nhttps://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/HRMD/Dog\n\n#beahero #theherorescue",

ZACH and LUCY are a bonded pair and must be adopted together. Both are very sweet & loving dogs, LUCY is outgoing while ZACH can be shy.\n\nMore photos of them can be found on their individual bios:\n\nZACH's Bio: https://www.petfinder.com/dog/zach-49286574/nj/lambertville/animal-alliance-nj290/\n\nLUCY's Bio: https://www.petfinder.com/dog/lucy-49286542/nj/lambertville/animal-alliance-nj290/\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIf you would like to meet, foster or adopt this pet, please fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser. EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

You see, everything was fine until one day they decided to divorce and then I went to live in different places. I was just left behind and I don't know why. I thought they loved me.  I am happy here at my foster home and my foster mom tells me not to worry and that my forever family will soon find me. You see, she wants to make sure that they are perfect for so that I am never get left behind again.\n\n I love to play with all the other dogs in my foster home. My favorite thing is to chase a tennis ball.  Man, I can do that for hours without getting bored.  I also like all the toys that squeak but my foster mom tells me that I should stop chewing them.  She says they are all in toy heaven.  I just love, love my toys but mostly playing fetch with my human.  I am a bit of an escape artist so my foster mom says that I would do best in a fenced yard. \nI am a gentleman and I know to tell you when I have to go outside to do my business.  I also know my crate but I don't need it.  I know that I have to get some training walking on leash because no one thought me that I can't pull my human. Don't worry, I am a smart guy and I'll figure that out.  Just get me some training ok? \n\nAnother one of my favorite things is to sit on your lap and shower you with kisses!  What did you say? that I can't be a lap dog because I am 68 lbs?  Watch me! I will distract you with kisses and smiles while I sit on your lap. We will both be very comfortable. Let's meet and you will fall in love with me. I now you won't leave me behind. \n\nLove\nSparky\n\n\nTo meet Sparky please complete an adoption application at www.treasuredanimalrescueinc.org.   Due to the large number of applications we might not be able to get back to you so please check our website for updates on Sparky's adoption status.  www.treasuredanimalrescueinc.org \n\nWe cannot adopt out of the state of IL \n\nSparky's home is located in the city of Chicago/Galewood area",

An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please download and complete an Adoption Questionnaire from our website and email Dena at DenaE@k-9lifesavers.org\nYou can learn about the adoption process and find a Word, PDF and ONLINE version of the questionnaire by visiting: http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/howtoadopt/.\nDog's Name: Toby\nEstimated Breed : Australian Shepherd Mix\nApproximate Age: 1 year\nApproximate Weight: approx. 37 lbs\nCurrently Living at: Boarding\nAdoption Fee: $300\nDOG'S DESCRIPTION\nMeet Toby! He is a gorgeous boy who is looking for a loving forever home...but not just any home will do! This guy has some special requirements in order to succeed in his forever home. He is a very sweet guy, but does have some food resource guarding that will need special attention. Because this food resource guarding has to do with humans (and probably dogs as well) we can't adopt to a family with children as this guy is likely to snap that food right out of the little ones fingers as they walk by with a snack. Because of the resource guarding, and we don't know exactly to what extent since he is in boarding, we do require a family with prior dog experience; no first timers...sorry!! He is an Aussie, and this breed is well known for being high energy and smart...this gorgeous guy is no exception! Because he is high energy and smart, we are looking for a family with a large fenced back yard for him to be able to expend his energy safely and someone willing to work with him on training and playing games to also keep him mentally stimulated. He may not be housebroken, but it's hard to tell when they are in boarding, but I suspect that would be fixed in short order with focused attention. If you can accommodate this guys needs, please apply! Once we have an approved adopter he will be removed from the website.\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

            "description": "Rory is an itty bitty guy who was saved just hours before euthanasia. He's leary of people at first but you just have to let him love you at his own pace and once he trusts you that love comes so easy. He prefers not to have anyone near his food bowl when he's eating, but other than that he really doesn't ask for much. Rory would prefer a quiet household with no small children. He's ok on a leash but also likes to stroll around the yard, so a fenced yard would be a bonus for him. He gets along with the other dogs in his foster home, but slow introductions work best for him. We think Rory is at least 5-6 years old. He's up to date on vaccines, microchipped and neutered.\n\nInterested in adopting me? To fill out an application visit 3 Hearts 4 Paws. Please note: we do not adopt out of state unless it is within 1-2 hours of us.",

He is crate trained, and just about fool proof when it comes to potty training (although if he is left alone in the crate for too long he may have an accident.) Rudy would really love a family who spends most of their time at home, or who can bring him along on adventures! He is still a bit insecure at times which can cause overstimulation, and absolutely needs an experienced owner who will set boundaries, give him direction and reassure him while building confidence. Rudy must also have an active family willing to take him on daily structured walks - he\u2019s amazing on leash!\n\nHe does enjoy the company of other dogs, especially those around his size. He would be best in a home without small dogs or cats, as he wants to wrestle with his furry friends! Another medium sized dog who is extremely social, tolerant, and confident would be the best match. Rudy is extremely attentive and smart \u2013 he already knows sit, and wait, and is learning other commands. He would benefit from additional obedience training with a professional. The key to Rudy\u2019s happiness is a lap to snuggle on! We prefer that Rudy goes to a home with kids age 13 or older, or adults only.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Rudy, please go to our website and fill out an adoption application!\n\n",

He prefers to spend his days laying in the sun outside or curled up in his favorite chair. He makes time to run with the six-month-old puppy at his fosters and doesn\u2019t mind extra energy and will let the pup know when playtime is over.\n\nHe has lots of people trust issues & is not a \u2018cuddle me\u2019 dog...yet. He doesn\u2019t like to be left alone and would do best with a pup mate to curb separation anxiety. He hasn\u2019t found a love for dog toys or treats yet but cheese is wonderful!\n\nAsh is neutered, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, and is in the beginning stages of heartworm treatment, as he is positive for heartworms. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Ash, fill out an application at https://www.eunoiarescue.org/adopt.",

She is the sweetest dog ever, she has accepted everything we have done with no protest. She is a bit older maybe as old as 7 or maybe not that old and just road aged having to care for her self for so long. She is the gentlest dog ever and has been a phenomenal mother. Her duties are over, she has gained weight while caring for her pups, she has been wormed several times and had her shots and been spayed so she will never have to search for food so she can feed a litter. She is a delight but not sure she would appreciate a very busy home with lots of kids. I think she would be fine with them but maybe not be happy?

He loves to go on walks/runs and playing with our dogs in the backyard. Just keep an eye on him or have a very high fence, because the boy can jump!\n\nSeamus is still getting used to being kept indoors. He seems to be very comfortable outside, but being kept in the house is new for him. We are working with him on not getting on the furniture and getting all the snuggles that we can! He\u2019s not sure what all this love stuff is about, lol!\n\nSeamus is neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccines and heartworm negative.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Seamus, fill out an application at https://www.eunoiarescue.org/adopt.\n",

Weighing in at 70 lb and missing half her tail and all her bottom front teeth is Charlie, German Shepherd extraordinaire.\n\nGets along well with all humans big and small. She does show stalking behavior towards smaller dogs and cats so she would probably fit best in a one dog household or with a male companion of comparable to slightly smaller size. \n\nAt 6.5 years old she's still energetic but can focus on favorite activities such as chewing on Bones and treat-filled Kongs. She is potty trained, knows sit and lay but she does pull a little on walks. It's just because she's excited sniffing out her furrever home!",

Nugget is also trained to use a puppy pad, if need be. When it's dinner white, she will be sure to let you know and push you to her food bowl. She is extremely playful and can be mouthy at times, per the cattle dog mentality. Nugget is dog friendly and has lived with cats, but the cats have always been afraid to interact with her. Nugget loves to snuggle and sleep as close as possible to her person.\n\nShe is spayed, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, and heartworm negative. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Nugget, fill out an application at https://www.eunoiarescue.org/adopt.",

He is an energetic goofball who loves going on long walks, tracking new smells, and meeting new friends (canine or human). He is an incredibly social dog, and loves being around other dogs, so he would do best if he went to a household with siblings. He is a great pup to take on adventures because he\u2019s so friendly, curious, and athletic. He\u2019s high energy and leggy, so would do best in a house with a yard where he can stretch his legs (or with somebody committed to taking him to the dog park).\n\nWe do think this is his first time living in a household, so he\u2019d do best with a family willing to put in a little bit of time to train him. He\u2019s a very good boy and has never shown any aggression whatsoever, but he still needs to learn how to conduct himself in a home that isn\u2019t fully puppy-proofed. He can be vocal, but would probably settle down if he had a buddy to play with. Boone is crate trained and sleeps quietly in his crate all night. He is currently learning how to walk on a leash (most of his pulling happens when he spots a potential new friend and can\u2019t wait to get over there and meet them). He has had no accidents in the house, but he hasn\u2019t been left unattended for any length of time to truly test that. We have not tested him with cats or children. \n\nBoone is neutered, up to date on vaccines, microchips and went through heartworm treatment. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Boone, fill out an application at https://www.eunoiarescue.org/adopt.",

Simone is much more less trusting.  We believe with a calm family that can give them the time they need to trust and feel safe they will be a great addition for that family.  Both would probably do better if there was another dog their size and calmness.  It's just going to take some time.  They probably are between 2-3 years old.   My adoption fee is $125 which includes my spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations,  heartworm disease test,  microchip/registration fee and collar .  ADOPT ME TODAY and find a friend for life!

No bite no problems we have come so far and she is happy now! She is learning to be a puppy herself and learning to play and enjoy life rather than just exist and fight for everything she needed. To give Jewel a home would be a real save, she needs a hero. Secure fence she does not jump, climb or dig but if she got out may be gone for good? Someone to love her unconditionally and forever! She has been spayed, wormed, shots, and HW neg. Will you be Jewel's hero? She may not be a dog you can take for walks every day and to the dog park just yet but will be as she learns to trust you.

She does not want to sit alone all day while you work so someone who is home, she is quite needy so needs all your time and attention, so no other female dogs or they will fight for attention. I only see heeler in her but no one knows what she is, she was the runt and is tiny I don't see her growing too much. She does have a pretty big overbite not that it hurts her in any way. She could not be more loving so we need to make sure and do right by her and get her a very loving home who has plenty of time for her.

She will need more shots and of course monthly worm prevention. needs a family that can give her plenty of attention as she was a shy girl and could revert back to being very shy. She would shrivel if kept alone or crated all day, she wants a warm body not a cold crate. Loves other dogs, would be good with kind older kids as long as you know puppies, use kids as chew toys, scratches and bites should be expected they are babies too and need someone willing to train them gently. Shouting at this pup would be a disaster for her. These pups have been clean in their heated dog building with doggy door of course you will need to follow through by going out with them to teach them to potty not watching through the window or shoving them out the door and closing it out leaving them alone they are babies!

Her mother is about 45lbs No idea who the dad was, she is very loving and seeks us out for love and cuddles. She will need to be only with very gentle dogs as she has no way to tell when trouble might start. Dogs often start fights through sight and she cannot see when there are issues. She is very attentive and comes right to you even if there are several obstacles in the way she figures it right out. She will be spayed and ready to go on the 22nd. Jan. Born 11-28-20 2 sets of vacs and ready for love. they are in a building with heat and a doggy door they have kept it clean inside since they were 4 weeks old. A perfect scenario would be if someone adopted Sylvia and her mother, they love each other to the moon and of course mom takes care of her and watches out for herhttps://form.jotform.com/193595080362159\n\nPLEASE!

The fee is usually less than the vet work they have had.\n\nThank You for considering adoption. Once approved and an appointment set, I will send directions\nSORRY I DO NOT SHIP DOGS\nFOR THE SAFETY AND COMFORT OF MY DOGS I DO REQUIRE ALL DOGS IN THE HOME BE\nSPAYED AND NEUTERED!",

I'm beautiful and smart and athletic and I will do just about anything to jump in your lap and lick your whole face once I love you. The thing is, I've been through a lot in my couple of years here on Earth, and because of that I can be pretty anxious and terrified of people I don't know. Men and kids are particularly scary, but even women I don't know can take me a second to warm up to. I've come a long way in my foster home, but I need someone who is patient and willing to continue to work with me. I'm currently on anxiety medication, and I will mostly likely need to continue taking them to feel a little safer and calmer wherever I end up. I get along with all doggies, but I want to chase and pounce on kitties and they don't seem to like that. My foster momma says I'm part kangaroo because I can jump 5 ft straight up in the air from a sit. I would love someone who lives a quiet lifestyle who can devote lots of time to me and teach me how to do fun tricks. I know my person is out there and that it's going to take a while to find them... But I'm willing to wait. If you're interested in meeting me, put in an application with\n\nPawsitive Tails Dog Rescue\n\ntoday! I can't wait to meet you!! Love, Vivi\n\nVivica's adoption fee is $75 and she is up to date on vaccines, dewormed, current on flea and heartworm prevention, heartworm negative, spayed and microchipped.",

She has thoroughly taken on personality traits of her namesake and insists on wearing neckscarfs, and we think she looks very fetching <3 Of course, Amelia's housebroken, loves belly rubs, and works for her kibble by discouraging the moles from setting up camp in your backyard. Amelia likes to have her food served on a snuffle mat instead of in a plain ol' bowl. She is a fan of stuffies with squeaker and playing fetch with a tennis ball. When it's warm outside she likes playing in a kiddie pool. Amelia loves going on walks and does pretty darned good on leash. Amelia would prefer to be the only dog in her new home, if you don't mind. She really is all the pooch you'll ever need! For more information on Amelia, call or text The Pet Connection at 913-671-7387. Amelia is staying in the Kansas City metro but transport is available to the right home. She's spayed, vaccinated, and eligible for a no-cost adoption with an encouraged donation. What are you waiting for?? Call us about Amelia!",

I thrive on a schedule and knowing my surroundings. I definitely need a family who is understanding of my personal space. I do ok on a leash for a short while but need a fenced in yard I can run and play in with no worries. I am not a fan of walks or new places. I am a homebody that likes to chill with my people!!",

            "description": "This dreamy dog is Dolly and, lucky for you, she's looking for a forever home. Dolly is about a year old and weighs around 40 pounds. She's snuggly, sweet, affectionate, and leans into you for pets. Dolly is already housetrained, good on leash, and is learning to love her kennel. She's also an excellent napper, in case you were wondering! She loooooooves other dogs and would benefit from having a canine pal in her new home. Dolly is shy and fearful around new people and things, which is understandable, given that she lived in a garage with no contact with the outside world. So, she needs a home with patient people who don't have a lot of visitors. She also needs a fenced yard and can't live in an apartment because all those noises are way too scary for this girl. Call or text The Pet Connection at 913-671-7387 for more info on Dolly! She's spayed, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, and ready to roll. Dolly's staying in Beloit, Kansas, at the moment, but transport is available to the right home. She's also eligible for a no-cost adoption with an encouraged donation to The Pet Connection!",

She came to us after being neglected for a long time but after a bath and lots of love from her foster and a vet visit, she's doing great! We are treating her for heartworms and she's doing well. \n\nShe's an easy senior who loves eating, snuggling with her blanket, napping, short walks, and being pampered. She gets along with kids, cats, and other dogs. She's a very sweet and smiling happy girl. She's crate trained. Homes with stairs are not ideal for her as she has a bit of a limp.\n\nNeva is a lovely dog who will make her forever family so very happy.\n\nSend us your application for Neva today!",

He loves chasing balls (doesn't return them yet!), chewing on Kongs filled with treats, and lazing around the house. His athleticism, especially his vertical leap and running, definitely qualifies him to play for the Spurs. He is house trained and good with other dogs and kids. \n\nAtticus is a four-year-old yellow Lab Pit mix who weighs 50 lbs. \n\nSend us your application for Atticus today!\n\nhttps://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/FBF/Dog",

He is 4.5 years old and has some health issues that have prevented him from being neutered. He does like to leave his mark around the house. He takes 4 medications each day. He knows pill time also means a yummy treat and he makes sure you don't forget them. Peanut loves to nap and swears he doesn't snore, but he does. He gets along with other dogs and cats. His doggy dna shows he is 75% Chihuahua, 12.5% Maltese and12.5% terrier group. We think he is 100% lovable.\n\nIf you'd like to meet Peanut, just fill out an application at www.pawsitivetailskc.org and his foster will contact you to set that up. Peanut's adoption fee has been waived as he does have a heart issue that will require lifetime medication.",

I'm a very smart girl! I'm potty trained, I know \"sit and I'm working on other tricks! I do well in a kennel, and even go in on command! But I don't like it when I can't see my people and I cry sometimes. I'm working on that though! I'm friendly with other dogs, but I prefer they be relaxed like me and that I have a proper introduction when meeting them. I'm super sweet with people, but sometimes I'm nervous when I just meet them so please be patient with me! I'm also great on the leash and I LOVE car rides! Just because I'm 7 doesn't mean I can't keep up with you! I enjoy walks and playtime, I'm really good at fetch! Do you think you could be my new forever? Please say yes! If you'd like to learn more about me, please reach out to foster momma!",

            "description": "Just when you think you've already had the most perfect dogs, along comes a pooch that is so amiable and a joy to have around - easy and almost carefree. Joey loves to curl up and sleep all day.  The secure sleep of a rescued street dog. Joey is a 4 yr old male blue heeler mix that weighs 39# . His right front leg needed to be removed as it was damaged beyond repair before coming into the rescue group. The wound has totally healed, and Joey has good mobility. He gets around just fine with 3 legs.  Although he shouldn\u2019t go jogging, he can go for long walks, can easily go up/down a flight of stairs, and he can jump up on the sofa and bed (so he can sleep with his foster at night). It is important for you to provide regular exercise to keep his muscles toned and his remaining 3 legs strong, and keep him at his ideal weight. Joey chases squirrels in the yard, and runs and plays with the resident dogs. He is housebroken reliably for at least 7 hours. He loves having a back yard to roam but he's good at squeezing through small spaces. He's escaped a few times out of the fenced back yard, looking for his person working in the front yard. If he can\u2019t find his person, he might wander around the block looking for him, otherwise he will come when you call him. He gets very attached to the person feeding and walking him. He must have some hound dog in him because he howls when he's looking for his attached person because they are out of his sight. Even if someone else is home. Because of this, he would not be good in shared wall housing. He is not destructive. He may have a bit of separation anxiety but he doesn't act out other than cry a little and search the house. This dog would love to go with you on trips and car rides as long as it's not too hot, and is able to jump into the vehicle.  Joey gets along with people and dogs. No cat experience. \nHis food drive is very strong, making him easier to train with a little treat.  Since he is food driven, young kids might not be appropriate with Joey since he will grab food given the opportunity. Joey will countersurf, so you can\u2019t leave food within his reach. However, he is gentle and otherwise safe.  The fosters have yet to see any display of aggression. \nHe really likes his dog housemates. Joey is smart and learns quickly. His favorite things are sleeping, eating, walking (he hails from a warmer state and doesn\u2019t like the cold, so wears a jacket outside) and chewing on butcher bones. He is very sweet, but not overly affectionate \u2013 just needs to be near his person. He must be by your side at all times when you are home. Joey will adopt you, and tends to favor one person in the home \u2013 he would be perfect for a single person. \nJoey thrives on routine \u2013 he needs to be able to anticipate what happens and when. So establish your routine from the first day he comes into your home. Feed him at the same times. If it will be an expectation to crate him, the put him in the kennel when you leave the house. The fosters did not crate him because he doesn\u2019t have accidents and is not destructive. If you work outside the home, or do volunteer work, he will learn how long you will be gone. Likes to know when it\u2019s time to go for a walk. Joey just likes structure. \nHe was previously neutered, and is current on distemper, rabies and bordetella vaccinations. On October 2 he had a dental cleaning, and 3 cracked/broken teeth were extracted. Amputation of the right front leg was done on October 16. His microchip is registered to Second Chance.  Even though his mobility is good now, there may come a time in his old age that he will sometimes need to be lifted into the vehicle, or onto the bed \u2013 it would be best if his adopter would physically be able to do this. The adopter should be home much of the time. We will not adopt him into an apartment. His adoption fee is $350 . Call 651-771-5662 if you would like to meet Joey.\n",

            "description": "Meet Boscoe!!\n\nHe arrived to NW Indiana from one of our shelter partners in the Houston, TX area.  His foster mom in Schererville, IN says that he is really sweet and gentle.  He loves to play with other dogs and to walk on a leash.  He doesn't pull, but does like to try to chase birds.  \n\nHe loves to cuddle and give kisses, but he also doesn't mind laying down in his crate and taking a nap.  \n\nHere is a video of him with his foster sibling: \nhttps://youtu.be/0C47-NryvQA\n\nIf you are interested in this beautiful, fun dog who would love to cuddle with you, apply today!  \n\nHere is another video of him from right off transport: https://youtu.be/55cvNy3AGhA\n\nHe is 1 yr old, neutered, up to date on vaccines, rabies and has a microchip.\n\nAdoption Process:\n\n- please fill out our adoption application: https://www.dayofthedogs.org/adoption-application\n\n- one of our team members will get back to you. \n\n- our dogs can be seen by appointment only after an approved application has been received.\n\n- Adoption fee is $460. This helps to cover her spay(which will be scheduled in a month due to age), initial vaccines, rabies, initial worming, and microchip.\n\n-We cannot place holds on our dogs. Please do not contact us until you are prepared to adopt.\n\nNOTE:  We are very good about updating the pet's profiles once adopted.  So no need to write us to ask \"Is he/she still available?\"  If the post is up, the dog is still available. \n\nAbout Us:\nDay of the Dogs is a 501c3 nonprofit that is dedicated to helping shelters increase live release.  We coordinate 2 - 4 transports per month from TX, OK and AR to NW Indiana/Chicagoland area.  We do direct adoptions ourselves out of Dyer, IN area and partner with 12 other rescues and shelters in both IL and IN that are willing to help southern pets in need.   \nWe rely on donations to help fund our ongoing transports.  Please donate if you can.  Every dollar adds up and we are grateful for any help we can get: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/DayoftheDogs",

A neighbor saw her one day and took her to the shelter for help. That\u2019s when Emma\u2019s life took a turn for the better. Emma was only 11 lbs when Cypress Lucky Mutt Rescue picked her up from the shelter. She is now over 40 and just BEAUTIFUL! Emma needs a home with someone who has time to exercise  with her. She LOVES everything! All dogs, cats and humans... She will do best in a home with a big yard and another dog. She is timid at first but warms up easily. Emma is fully vetted, 1.5 year old, 42 lbs and a goof ball! Please give Emma a chance, she really deserves a loving home!",

She knows how to sit and wait patiently for her breakfast and dinner.\n\nHer personality will shine best with:\n-An active family\n-Fenced in yard (A MUST)\n\n**A note from her foster: \"Dee Dee or Big D is the sweetest little piggie she loves exploring and being around her people.

Maureen, one of our dedicated Blackhat Humane Society's foster providers, happened to be in Shiprock at that time and was able to rescue all 8 of these beings!\n\nThis sweetie loves to play, is curious and is working on house training. Quinnie loves to be outside as well. This girl needs a loving home in 2021!\n\nQuinnie is being fostered near Newcomb, NM, and her adoption fee is $150.\n\nFor more info about this friendly pup, or to set up a meet and greet, contact her foster mom maureen.bohler@yahoo.com or blackhathumane@gmail.com.\n\nPlease fill out an adoption application online from the web site blackhathumanesociety.org.",

            "description": "Oggie is a big ball of love! \n\nOgden was dumped in a small community close to Texarkana, TX. Oggie is being fostered by the family where he was dumped. He is a bit too active for this family's senior dogs so he is looking for a new home. \n\nOggie loves getting out of his kennel to run and play with another large neighborhood female stray. When foster mom is home from work, she and Oggie play fetch, a game she says he really enjoys. Oggie is a sweet boy who would love being part of an active family. He is too energetic for families with small children or elderly members because he has a habit of jumping up on people. Foster mom is working on breaking that habit, but further training will likely be required in his new family. \n\nFoster mom says Oggie is very sweet and loving and sometimes he will howl \"\"I love you\"\". Oggie is working on leash training but has a bad habit of pulling on leash especially when he first comes out of his kennel. Oggie would love a fenced yard where he could run and play and expend some energy or maybe a family who runs on a regular schedule.\n\n\n\nName: Ogden Oggie\nBreed: Rottweiler mix\nSex: Male\nAge: 1 1/2 years old\nWeight: 61 pounds\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\nVaccinations: Up to date\nHeartworm: Negative \nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nBASED ON OUR OBSERVATIONS: \nGood with Children: Over 12\nGood with Dogs: Yes- has not lived with other dogs but does well with them outside. \nGood with Cats: Unknown\n\nAdoption Fee: $475.00\n\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION:\nInterested in a specific dog, please fill out an application if you are interested in a dog. The number of individual inquiries is overwhelming and we are finding it difficult to respond to each one. We cannot guarantee you will receive a timely response.\n\nPaws New England is a rescue, not a shelter, and as such we do not have our dogs housed in one location - they are in foster homes both in New England and in our southern foster homes. If you're interested in a specific dog, please complete a short online application and you will receive a reply within 48 hours so you can ask questions.\n\nAt present, if a dog is listed on our website, the dog is considered still available HOWEVER, may have applications that have come in before yours but it's still too early to know if any are a good match; therefore we encourage you to apply.\n\n\nNOTICE WITH REGARD TO LOCATION OF DOGS: Please note: Paws New England is a foster-based rescue. We do not have a brick and mortar building to house the dogs we rescue. We have found that dogs in foster homes are much more adoptable because they have been observed in a home setting. Dogs listed with Paws New England typically reside in various locations throughout the south (primarily Tennessee, Texas, and Arkansas) and New England (not necessarily in the state of Rhode Island). You will be notified by the adoption coordinator of the location of the dog you are interested in so you have the ability to decide whether to pursue adoption or not.\n\nDogs transported to New England are done so at a fee of $150.00 paid directly to the transporting company by Paws New England; no additional transport costs are responsibility of adopter. This fee is included in the adoption donation.\n\nAdoption donations cover pre-adoption vet costs (including vaccinations, spay/neuter when age appropriate, and heartworm testing/treatment when necessary), a microchip, and transportation to New England if necessary.\n\nDonations for our young, healthy puppies and dogs support their fellow canines of advanced age or suffering from injuries and abuse whose donations are reduced but whose veterinary costs are typically much higher. We appreciate your understanding that your dog will help others in need.\n\nAll known information about the animal is listed above. We do our best to give accurate information, but most of our dogs are rescues and do not come with a known history.\n\nPaws New England abides by the dog importation regulations set forth in the states of MA, CT, NH and RI.",

            "description": "Leelou is a growing young pup, about 4 months old, spayed and up-to-date on vaccinations, and is probably a cattle do/lab mix.\n\nLeelou is one of eight pups that were given away very young in Shiprock, in northwestern NM, on the Navajo Nation. Maureen, one of our dedicated Blackhat Humane Society's foster providers, happened to be in Shiprock at that time and was able to rescue all 8 of these beings!\n\nThis sweetie loves to play, is curious and is working on house training. Leelou loves to be outside as well. Will she join your family in 2021?\n\nLeelou is being fostered near Newcomb, NM, and her adoption fee is $150.\n\nFor more info about this friendly pup, or to set up a meet and greet, contact her foster mom maureen.bohler@yahoo.com or blackhathumane@gmail.com.\n\nPlease fill out an adoption application online from the web site blackhathumanesociety.org.",

This super star BT came into rescue after he and his Japanese Chin sister were relinquished to a Japanese Chin Rescue group. Their previous owner who could no longer care for them didn't want to separate them since they had been together their whole lives. After several months in foster care, his foster Mom noticed the two were not really bonded. She also realized Louie had some medical issues that she was unable to address. She reached out to Boston Buddies for help. Upon taking him into rescue he was taken in for initial vetting and bloodwork. After some follow up testing it was determined that Louie has Cushing's Disease. Louie has been started on medication to control the Cushing's - they cost about $50 a month and he will need to be on the medication for his lifetime. Louie is 13 years old and weighs in at 25 pounds. Don't let his diagnosis and age discourage you. Louie 2.0 is an awesome guy! He loves other dogs, mealtime and stuffed toys! He uses the doggie door to take care of his business, is a dream on leash and never barks. Just look at those earsare they amazing or what??? Louie is neutered, up to date on all vaccines and microchipped. If you are looking to make a difference and possibly set a goal to \"give back\" in the new year - then pay it forward and make Louie 2.0 a member of your family. You will be rewarded 10-fold with snuggles and unconditional love! Why don't you head on over to our website and complete an adoption application\nhttps://www.bostonbuddies.org/adoption-application/\n\nLouie's Adoption Donation is $200.00\n\nView more photos of Louie on our facebook page www.facebook.com/BostonBuddiesInc",

            "description": "Bluebelle is a shy girl when you first meet her. She loves to be loved on - a back scratch or belly rub will make her melt into you. Once she figures out that you're a \"dog person\" then she'll warm up to you. A patient owner is a must to allow her to build her confidence. So many things are still new to her so she needs a person to introduce her to all the fun things in life.\n\nShe loves to ride shotgun in the car and sits there like a patient passenger asking \"where are we going?\". Mostly she just wants to be with her humans. She enjoys a hike in the woods and will try to smell every single blade of grass along the way. She's a strong walker for such a little dog so a harness works best to keep her comfy and nearby.\n\nHer favorite spots in the house are either on the couch or sitting on the rug in front of the 'treat room'. She's loving the good life! When she's not sleeping her little feet are in constant motion because she's just so excited about all the possibilities for fun things to happen.\n\nShe hasn't had a single accident in the house, has mastered the doggie door, and can be crated overnight or while you are out. When left alone in the house she might drag something around the house (a box, your socks, a leash) but hasn't shown any destructive nature at all. Bluebelle has a big bark but she only barks with purpose to sound the alarm. She won't be bothering the neighbors!\n\nShe loves bones but hasn't shown a lot of interest in toys yet. She will also carry her food bowl around - even if it's full - so you might end up with kibble on the couch. She can be a silly girl!\n\nA securely fenced yard is a must because she is a fast runner and could chase a squirrel into the next county before you know it. She's shown no sign of trying to jump or dig her way out, but given the opportunity of an open gate she would take it.\n\nBecause of her limited vision, she will pull away if you approach her quickly from her blind side so be patient with her. It's important that she be introduced slowly to new people. She'll go at her own pace and having her trusted human alongside her will make it easier. Some sniffs and a scratch behind the ears are a great introduction.\n\nShe isn't suitable for a home with young children or with a super-playful dog, but she lives in her foster home with two older and larger dogs and has been fine once they got to know each other. Upon meeting cats she notices them but hasn't otherwise interacted. She would do fine as an only pet but would need to meet any other family pets to make sure they are a match.\n\nThis little girl will be so loyal to her forever human and is a happy and loving companion ready to join you on any adventure. Bluebelle is ready to see the world with you!",

            "description": "Noel is a very, very sweet 3 to 4 year old purebred, 26 pound chocolate tri Beagle girl but was very timid and afraid when she first came into rescue, in large part because she had to be humanely trapped in order to be caught. Very thin when we got her with ribs showing, Noel obviously has suffered neglect for some time.  She is making great progress thanks to her loving caregivers, but hugely because of our Lily Beagle, also posted on our Petfinder page, who has been such a blessing to Noel. Playful, friendly, and loving Lily has befriended Noel and has helped her make great strides in her socialization and trust of others. We would love to find a loving home for Noel where she would have a doggie sibling. \n\nDr. Ginny did confirm that Noel is heartworm positive, but the good news is that Noel tested negative for the tickbourne diseases and does not have a fever. She received heartworm preventative and  a dose of flea and tick prevention, and best of all, her bloodwork looked great! \n\nHer ears are very, very infected, also from neglect, but we are all over that, cleaned them and packed them with medication, and will recheck with another ear cytology in a couple of weeks and see what else may be needed for her ear care. And true to her Beagle breed, she eats every single bite of her meals. She even was given some home cooked chicken treats for Christmas, as you can see in her video. What more could a Beagle girl want for Christmas! \n\nI was able to spend time with Noel recently, and she is already filling out well and looking amazingly well in spite of all the former neglect. The clinic staff absolutely love her. As soon as Dr. Ginny feels Noel is healthy enough to withstand surgery, she will be spayed, and a plan for heartworm treatment will be put into place. Noel is a gem of a Beagle girl and deserves only the very best. We intend to see that she gets just that.\n\nThe only applications we are accepting for Noel at the present time are from families who are interested in fostering-to-adopt. Our Hayley is presently in such a home and doing great with her heartworm treatment. Her foster family tells us what a great bonding experience it is to be such an integral part of her journey to wellness. They LOVE her! We want the same for Noel\u2014to be able to go into a loving home, just as soon as her doctors think she is ready, and who would like to be a part of Noel\u2019s  journey to wellness and eventually be her forever home. If you think you are the right family for Noel and are willing to be a part of her journey to wellness, please contact Diana at dmoore2003@bellsouth.net. We are very interested in talking to you and meeting you.\n\nPlease visit also our rescue Facebook page where we post updates, pictures, and videos of all of our dogs, including Noel. Petfinder limits us on the number of pictures and videos we can post, but Facebook does not.\n\nWe should tell you that our Beagles are highly sought and adopted quickly after vetting. Fostering to adopt Noel would give you as her foster through heartworm treatment the very first to have the option of adopting her. Fostering would put you at the top of the adoption list for her.",

Todd was brought in as a stray, so unfortunately we do not know much about his history.\nTodd needs a family who is prepared for his energy, and ready to help him with some obedience. Todd has a lot of energy, and will need to be exercised daily. He enjoys running, and playing with his toys outside. \nDue to the cattle dog in Todd, he does have some tendency to nip. We have been working with Todd on this, and rewarding him when he is calm and focused.\nTodd will need some assistance learning manners, but he is definitely a people pleaser. Todd loves snuggles, and is treat motivated, which will help his training. Todd does not do well with cats, and we aren't quite sure how he will get along with other dogs. We will require a dog introduction at HSoP if you have another dog in your home. All adoptions come with a seven-day foster period, to ensure the adoption is a good fit for all.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Todd, please call us at (208)883-1166 to schedule an appointment.",

He wants to please and is otherwise ok just gets anxious due to the conflict with his GSD housemate.\n\nBuddy is ready for a new forever home where he can chill. He is good with other dogs in general, NO CATS, likes people and NO SMALL CHILDREN. Ideally he needs a home with a confident owner, laid back canine housemates, or where he could be the sole canine family member and where his anxiety can be a non starter.  \n\nHe's neutered, chipped, up to date.\nHe's a beautiful blue merle with many good years ahead of him!

I don't really like other dogs too much and the same goes for cats as I'm not really too fond of them so I would need to be the only animal in the house. Also, I would do best in a house with kids over the age of 12 due to my energy and tendencies to want to hug my family. I could defiantly use some manners and training and also don't like to be bothered when eating. If you would like the chance to meet me and see a dog with a great smile fill out an online application today!

They think I am about 6 years old and I weigh about 90 pounds. I am a smart dog that knows a few commands already. I can be a little shy, but I have gotten along with everyone that visits me, and do well on car rides. You won't believe how handsome I am until you see me in person!\n\nFee $150\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit petsaversshreveport.org and find our adoption application under the 'Dogs' tab. Completed applications can be emailed to our Adoption Team at petsavers@petsaversshreveport.org - all adoptions require a vet reference. Please let us know if you have any questions or if you would like to set up a meet and greet with a specific dog.",

            "description": "Ginger is a beautiful and loving 7-8 year old, 60lb shepherd mix who loves chasing balls, tugging on ropes and slowly chewing the squeakers out of every toy she\u2019s ever had!  She knows how to sit, but is still working on sitting calmly for any time. She loves walks, is learning to heel, and to stop when her human stops. She\u2019s crate trained, and views her crate as a \u201chappy place\u201d for sleeping or relaxing.\n\nGinger needs to be the only pet in her new home, as she doesn\u2019t get along with other dogs or small animals.  And because she can sometimes react out of fear when startled, and is protective of her food, we\u2019re also recommending no small children in her home.\n\nThis girl has a loving heart, and in the right home with people who understand that both patience and gentle discipline are needed, she will continue to blossom.\n\nIf you feel your home might be the right place for such a great dog - the place to start is with the adoption application found at www.dfwrescueme.org/adopt.  Once submitted, the foster will contact you promptly to tell you more and to arrange a time to meet!\n\nThe adoption fee for all of our dogs is $250.00, which includes their vaccinations and spay/neuter.\n\nGinger is participating in the DFW Rescue Me Guest Dog Program, so ongoing care and custody are provided by their foster, not by DFWRM.",

Please email the completed application to newleashrescue2018@gmail.com\n\nThis pup and his siblings came to us back in early October from a reservation in South Dakota. The pups were scared and hadn't received a lot of human socialization, but they have had some good time to warm up to things in their foster home to change that.\n\nThe pups will be medium sized dogs, and are around 30 pounds currently. They are estimated to be around six months old. Their breed is completely an estimate based off appearance.  Maybe some lab, or husky in there (the blue eyes on some.)\n\nThe pups will do best in a home with older kids age 9 and up, as they will be a little shy. They will do best with families who are willing to give them the time and patience to warm up to a new home, and slowly continue to expose them to new people and situations to continue improving their socialization.  Jack Skeleton will hide when first meeting new people and will need to warm up.  He's such a sweet boy. \n\nThese pups have lived with other dogs and cats to this point, and they do not live with small children. The pups will need refreshers on house training, and will need to continue to work on obedience and leash training.

The pups were very scared and hadn't received a lot of human socialization, but they have had some good time to warm up to things in their foster home.

They will do best with families who are willing to give them the time and patience to warm up to a new home, and slowly continue to expose them to new people and situations to continue improving their socialization.  Coraline will hide when first meeting new people, but will warm up if given the time.

She was obviously nursing puppies, and though officers searched for the pups, they were not found. She is calm and quiet, and sits when told. Belle is about 3 years old and weighs 48 pounds. She is up-to-date on vaccinations, now spayed and will be microchipped upon adoption. Come meet her in Run 848 using ID#626658. Sadly she has tested positive for heartworms but with treatment, she should be good as new in no time. Please speak to your veterinarian regarding treatment options.\n\nBelle meets Draco - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J1NpMHQfpU&feature=youtu.be\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nBelle meets Drago - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J1NpMHQfpU&feature=youtu.be\n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information.

With her loving, affectionate demeanor she quickly became a staff and volunteer favorite. \n\nBERTHA LOUISE had a recent weekend sleepover and is described as \"Low Maintenance and Loyal\".  An easy-going  gal who enjoys a couple of short walks and likes to follow her human around. She walks well on leash and doesn't bat an eye at little dogs barking at her and was cool as a cucumber on her cat test. BERTHA LOUISE  LOVES belly rubs and can be playful with calm dogs. We recommend a home with no kids or middle-age school or above.\n\nShe currently weighs about 99lbs and is on a new year weigh loss plan to lose about 10lbs.\n\nSee more video of BERTHA LOUISE here: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CJtoerlHq6b/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17858192288310154/\n\nBERTHA LOUISE is spayed, current on shots, micro-chipped, crate-trained and house-trained.

Please email the completed application to newleashrescue2018@gmail.com\n\nThis pup and her siblings came to us back in October from a reservation in South Dakota.  The pups were very scared and hadn't received a lot of human socialization, but they have had some good time to warm up to things in their foster home.  \n\nPumpkin is the most shy and timid pup of her litter.  She can be protective of food and toys around her siblings.   She is very cuddly and loving with her foster mom, but she is scared of men.  She would need men who are super patient and willing to go slow with her to earn her trust.   Pumpkin will prefer the women in her home.   Pumpkin will hide when people first meet her and she needs time to warm up. \n\nThe pups will be medium sized dogs, and are around 30 pounds currently.  They are estimated to be around six months old.  Their breed is completely an estimate based off appearance.   \n\nThe pups will do best in a home with older kids age 9 and up, as they will be a little shy.  They will do best with families who are willing to give them the time and patience to warm up to a new home, and slowly continue to expose them to new people and situations to continue improving their socialization.    \n\nThese pups have lived with other dogs and cats to this point, and they do not live with small children.   The pups will need refreshers on house training, and will need to continue to work on obedience and leash training.  \n\nApplications are reviewed in the order received looking for a right fit home.  \n\nAdoption fee is $400 + tax (no checks) \n\nFoster to contact:  Darla - foliagepeeps@yahoo.com or 612.202.5243\n\nPlease contact the foster if you are interested in learning more about this pup.  An approved adoption application is needed for any meet and greets.  \n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home. An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home. \n\nSometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home and truly become comfortable. There are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption, discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months. We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.",

            "description": "Beautiful Bella, a Catahoula leopard dog mix, is currently being fostered in Clearwater, FL (Pinellas County). Bella was surrendered by her owner at 6 months of age and was rescued from a Tennessee shelter in December at 8 months. She still has a lot of puppy in her and will not fully mature until 2 years of age. In spite of being surrendered so young, she knows her name and some basic commands (sit, off, lie down), and she is potty trained.\n\nBella is a busy bee and requires a lot of exercise and stimulation. If left unattended or crated for extended periods, Bella becomes distressed and nervous, which manifests in destructive chewing indoors and hole-digging outdoors. Bella will do best in a home with a high level of activity, with at least 2-3 hours of exercise and play each day. Crate time should be 4 hours or less, daily.\n\nBella never met a stranger - she is very social with other dogs and people, even when on leash. She loves to run in open spaces and will enjoy the companionship of another active dog who likes to play chase and wrestle. Her herding tendencies do come out in play, so if overexcited she can nip or get \"mouthy,\" but responds to an appropriate reprimand to settle down. Bella is friendly to kids ages 5+ and will fetch a ball and play tug o' war. She loves her chew toys and puzzle toys with food rewards. While she hasn't had an opportunity to go swimming during her foster stay, she does seem interested in the pool and enjoys walking on the beach and looking for interesting things to chew.\n\nObedience training will help Bella learn her boundaries. She loves to take walks on the leash but her strong prey drive can make her unruly when she spots squirrels or rabbits. She is responding to positive reinforcement training on the leash but consistency and additional training will really help her develop. With work, she could become a great running buddy.\n\nBella is spayed, with no known medical issues, and is current with all shots for her age. She requires a home with a fenced-in yard and another active dog to play with.",

He is strong and does pull on his leash when out walking, so a harness might be best moving forward to teach him some leash manners. He loves running around in off-leash areas and does calm down after a few minutes of fetch before he lays down to chew on a toy. Boone loves to play and is very happy, he was rolling around in the snow during the photoshoot and won us all over. He really is a silly, outgoing boy who would love a family to call his own.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet please fill out an adoption questionnaire at www.yakimahumane.org. A Yakima Humane Society staff member will contact you once your questionnaire has been received.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this pet you can fill out an online adoption form at www.yakimahumane.org. Please give the name and ID number for the animal you wish to adopt.\nIf you are thinking about adding a pet to your family, be a hero, please consider adopting a shelter pet and if you already have pets \u2013 for life\u2019s sake \u2013 spay and neuter. Spaying and neutering your pets is the single most important thing you can do to help decrease our nations severe pet overpopulation.\n*NOTE: Nearly 90% of the animals that come into our shelter are abandoned, neglected, traumatized, injured, or ill. We attempt to give our best assessment of the animal\u2019s welfare and temperament. Unfortunately, due to lack of funding, volunteers, and resources our physical and mental assessment of the animal is not always 100% correct.",

            "description": "American Bulldog/Pitty Mix |  Male | 3 years | 70 lbs | Adoption Fee $250\n\nRequirements: Previous Large Breed Experience\n\nRudy is a giant sweetie with a big heart. He found himself in a Chicago shelter without the words to explain the history behind the scars on his chest and tears in his ear. Rudy shows his gratitude for the home life by exchanging kisses for pets and being eager to please. He loves to play with all sorts of toys - stuffed, rope, food dispensing, or chew toys. He loves to be near his humans and is content to lay on a dog bed near you, however, he is also just fine being alone.\n\nRudy has a medium - high energy level. He needs mental enrichment and decent exercise if he is to lounge the rest of the day. When he's excited, he likes to sloppily spin in circles and throw play bows. It's quite entertaining, however, he could potentially knock over or step on small kids or pets. He rarely jumps on humans or furniture, but he will occasionally jump up if very excited. He responds immediately to any sort of vocal no marker (\"eh-h\" or \"uh-uh\"). Rudy enjoys walks and does well walking in a front clip harness / martingale collar combo.\n\nRudy is crate trained (he even tries to squeeze into any small crate where a door is left open) and is working on potty training. He is doing very well not pottying in the house as long as he is taken outside frequently while loose in the house.\n\nRudy has many scars on his ears and legs from scuffles with other dogs; however, he's been happy to see every dog he's met so far in rescue. He is a big, strong boy, so he intimidates some dogs and needs to be reminded to play gently at times. He has not been introduced to cats yet, but he does ignore the small caged pets in his foster home.\n\nIf you are looking for a strong, large best friend to go on adventures with, then apply today to learn more!\n\n** As a member of the WGR Pitty Posse - all Pittys will be sent home with their very own Pitty Package!!\n\n***Please inquire ONLY online through our website at www.woofgangrescue.com***\n\nDATCP 402490",

            "description": "The application is the first step in the adoption process, so if you are interested in adopting please fill out the online adoption application first by visiting our website at www.dachshundpaws.org\n\n****Special Needs**** Luna is a 3 year old, tweenie sized Dachshund. Luna is a beautiful girl. Luna weighs about 16 pounds. Luna is a special girl! Luna came to us from South Korea. She is a double dapple, which is very bad breeding practice. Most double dapples have some sort of health impairments. Luna is blind. Don't tell Luna though, she gets along very well. She uses her little nose to help guide her.\nLuna came in from South Korea completely fearful and scared. I am sure being blind and all the changes she went through, was very hard on her. Once she calmed down and decompressed, her true personality emerged. Luna is a love bug!!! She loves to play with toys, loves attention and even gives wonderful kisses. Luna gets along great with other dogs and would probably do best with a friendly dog in the home to help her get along. Luna enjoys her little yard. She likes to sunbathe and explore. She is good with walks and is all around a happy girl.\nLuna does need a couple days when in her new home to adjust. She will be very fearful and timid. Her reaction to fear is fear biting, so she does need a patient family that will allow her to come out of her shell on her own. Luna's ideal home would be someone not gone long hours, has a friendly/playful doggie sibling and absolutely no children. Luna is extremely special and is looking for an equally as special family to call her own.\nLuna came to us from South Korea and is ready to start his new life with a wonderful family. All of the dogs but 1 were positive for heart worm in South Korea when we started this process. We mentioned it multiple times. They all received aggressive treatment in South Korea. The vets there treat heart worm daily, so this is a normal treatment to them. It is standard procedure to retest for heart worm in 3 months just to be on the safe side.\nHeart worm is not only common in South Korea but also in many states in the U.S. We are just fortunate to live in a climate here in California where heart worm is not prominent.\nThe organization in South Korea that we worked with on this project has brought over 400 dogs to the states and none have re tested positive for heart worm. They are very successful treating it.\nWe stand behind our dogs and should someone adopt one of the South Korea rescues from us, retest in 3 months, and by some chance the dog comes up positive for heart worm, we will pay to have the dog treated. But, we are very confident this will not be the case.\nLuna's adoption fee: $200We do not have a kennel or facility to visit, all dogs are kept in foster homes until their forever homes are found.Adoption Process: Once an approved application is on file, we will then set up a home visit. At that time we will bring the dog to the home in which you will all be sharing. We ask the entire family to be there that day. If we all agree on the placement, then the dog will stay with you that day. Please visit our website at www.dachshundpaws.org",

Odin and his sibling were seen being dumped from a vehicle and a good samaritan helped to catch the pups and get them to safety.

They do fine with people taking things away from them.  This is common when pups come from conditions where they weren't getting everything they need, and they need families committed to helping them along with this.   They currently live with children and are doing well, but would be recommended with dog savvy children. \n\nThe pups are curious and love to explore.  They live with other dogs and are doing well.  They are working on house training and will continue to need training including obedience and leash training.   The pups are active and playful but also love to be with their people and snuggle.    They have not been exposed to cats in their foster home.  \n\nOdin is currently being treated for an ear infection, and his adopter will need to be willing to take on the followup for that, as well as the remaining vetting he will need as a pup to finish his series.  \n\nAdoption applications are reviewed in the order received looking for the a good fit home.      \n\nAdoption fee is $475.00 + tax (no checks) \n\nFoster to contact: Amanda at tuszynski24@gmail.com\n\nPlease contact the foster to learn more about this pup. \n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home. An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home. \n\nSometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home and truly become comfortable.

Toby is well mannered and is such a good boy about not jumping all over people, even when he's very happy to see you! He enjoys playing fetch and is eager to learn new tricks! He is working on \"sit,\" \"stay,\" kennel training, and coming when his name is called. His fosters report he seems to be good with other dogs and is just an all around good boy! Toby would do best in a home with supervised yard time or a privacy fence because this agile, social butterfly will jump 4ft fences to find himself some friends if left alone too long!\n\nToby is about a year old and has been neutered, vaccinated, heart worm tested (negative), microchipped, and is current on parasite prevention. His adoption donation is $100. \n\nHOW TO ADOPT TOBY:\nThe Tulsa SPCA is currently operating on an appointment-only basis.\n- Click on the orange \"Interested in this animal? Click here!\" button to apply to adopt.\n- If you're approved, we'll contact you to finalize the paperwork, collect payment and arrange an appointment for your drive-thru adoption.\n- Please stay home if you feel unwell, especially if you are experiencing symptoms of fever, cough or sore throat.\n\nThank you for your patience and understanding during this time. These policies may change as the Tulsa SPCA makes adjustments in response to the ongoing situation.",

Gloria absolutely loves to play but she can be serious when she needs to be -- look at that laser focus in her eyes! She takes cues well and is quick to pick up on what's requested of her. She would do best in a family with older children (8+) who want to include her in their active lifestyle. \n \nGloria has been spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, and is current on parasite prevention. \n\nHOW TO ADOPT\nThe Tulsa SPCA is currently operating on an appointment-only basis.\n- Click on the orange \"Interested in this animal? Click here!\" button to apply to adopt.\n- If you're approved, we'll contact you to finalize the paperwork, collect payment and arrange an appointment for your drive-thru adoption.\n- Please stay home if you feel unwell, especially if you are experiencing symptoms of fever, cough or sore throat.\nThank you for your patience and understanding during this time. These policies may change as the Tulsa SPCA makes adjustments in response to the ongoing situation.",

If you have any questions regarding one of our Mastiffs, please read their bio and if you still have questions- drop us an email at info@greatplainsmastiffrescue.org . If you have questions about our adoption procedures, please go to our Pages of Interest on the left hand column under 'Adoption Info.' We answer email inquiries almost immediately-usually always within a few hours and phone calls are returned with 24-36 hours.\n\nGPMR does not have a shelter. All of our dogs are kept in loving foster homes. We must have a completed adoption\napplication on file before meeting any of our mastiffs.\n\nGPMR adopts to the states of Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana and parts of Colorado.\n!!!Any mastiffs being adopted out of the state of Oklahoma require a health certificate to be paid for by the adopter!!!\n\nMeet Ruth! She is a 4.5 year old fawn Mastiff and truly a gentle lady. Sadly she came to rescue when her owner passed away. Ruth really loves being with people. She is doing well on a leash and is currently undergoing some training to be even better!! She loves nothing more than to get lovings and lounge about. Ruth currently is fostered with small children and is doing very well (despite one of them using her as an roadway for cars). She is crate-trained and potty trained. She tolerates most other dogs and it is currently unknown if she is good with cats. Other than needing to lose some weight, she is in good health.Please give this very sweet loving girl a relaxing home of her own!Ruth is being fostered in Broken Arrow, OK.Save a Mastiff...Adopt, Foster, Volunteer!",

            "description": "This toy-loving handsome hunk is Titus, a 13 year old Pit mix in need of a new home through no fault of his own. Although he weighs about 80 lbs, Titus as a delicious mush of a pup that simply wants to be loved up on. As you can see from his photos, Titus LOVES toys - the more, the merrier. Most of the time this boy is walking around with a toy in his mouth. Now he just needs to find someone to play with him.\n\nTitus was surrendered to K9 Resorts in Fairfield, NJ, due to a family member's allergies. While K9 Resorts is a clean, beautiful, loving facility, it is not meant to be a permanent home for dogs, especially a senior dog that deserves all the love and attention one can offer. Whether this is with a \"foster\" family, an adoptive parent, or a senior sanctuary, we would love to find a caring home for this sweet boy.\n\nIn his former home, Titus lived with another dog years ago. In recent years he has had no contact with other dogs so if a prospective adopter has a dog, a meet & greet between the dogs will be necessary. Cats are an unknown. He walks well on a leash & we haven't witnessed him reacting to other dogs when he is on leash.\n\nTitus is good with everyone he meets & has lived with a child for years but he'd probably do best with kids older than toddler age because of his size. He is up to date on his vaccines and has no bite history - he's just an all-around great guy! Titus does not have as much energy as he once did and behaves well with the staff at K9 Resorts. He does have some arthritis in his hind legs which makes him a little unsteady on wet, slippery surfaces. Otherwise, he seems to be in perfect health.\n\nTitus walks very nicely on a leash. He is rather goofy in the car & needs a seat belt. He doesn't quite \"get\" what being in a car is. Toys? Titus LOVES toys... he's super good with toys! The more, the better!\n\nTitus is NOT with Eleventh Hour Rescue but we are helping to network him for placement. If you are interested in helping Titus find a wonderful retirement home, please contact Anna of K9 Resorts directly at 201-982-4309 (cell) or 973-244-7387 (office). If you prefer email please write to fairfield@k9resorts.com.\n\nThank you for your consideration of Titus' situation - those of us that know & love this guy just want him happy & safe & settled!",

I'd be a great fit in tons of different households!\n\nI am dog-friendly and I get along great with kids. I'd do best with kids five and older who love to play! I don't really like to share my toys, but I will if you make me.\n\nMy foster says I'm a Velcro dog. I can't help that I love to snuggle! I also enjoy playing fetch or staying by your feet while you work.\n\nI may only have three legs, but I live life to its fullest. I even sometimes get zoomies! My perfecf day would include a short walk, a long game of fetch, and then lying right next to you. Hurry up and apply for me! I'm ready to be your best friend forever.",

His friendliness towards people helped us catch his skittish friend. Thanks, Frankie! He was never claimed by a previous owner and is now available for adoption and foster! \nFrankie is 55lbs and loves to be outside, whether it\u2019s on a walk, sniffing around a yard or just sunning his cute belly! He\u2019s got the best big smile and likes to show off his long tongue. Even with such a wide grin, he still has the softest mouth when he takes treats from your hand.\n\nFrankie is a little over a year old, and has been neutered. microchipped, vaccinated, and is current on parasite prevention. He is unfortunately heartworm positive and will need treatment that the Tulsa SPCA will perform at no cost to his adopters! Frankie's ideal home does not include children under 12 years.\n  \nHOW TO ADOPT FRANKIE\nThe Tulsa SPCA is currently operating on an appointment-only basis.\n- Click on the orange \"Interested in this animal? Click here!\" button to apply to adopt.\n- If you're approved, we'll contact you to finalize the paperwork, collect payment and arrange an appointment for your drive-thru adoption.\n- Please stay home if you feel unwell, especially if you are experiencing symptoms of fever, cough or sore throat.\n\nThank you for your patience and understanding during this time. These policies may change as the Tulsa SPCA makes adjustments in response to the ongoing situation.",

I would love to live in a home with a doggy friend! I can be a little shy when I meet someone for the first time, but once I get to know you I'll always come to say hi. Strangers can be a little scary though, so I'd like to have personal space in the house where I can hide when new people are over. Ideally, I'd love to go to a quiet home where I can get a lot of attention! Having a dog savvy owner will help me a lot too! I can't wait to find my furrever home!\n\nTo find out more about me you can fill out a pre-adoption survey on our website, then email it to us. Then, call (816) 325-7207 and ask to make an appointment for a digital meeting! I can't wait to meet you!\n\nhttps://www.ci.independence.mo.us/AnimalServices/AdoptableAnimals",

His name is very appropriate.\nHe is one and half years old, male Lab mix. He's been great with my dogs.\nIs kennel trained, house broken. Knows sit, shake and down. Loves to do zoomies in yard with one of my dogs. No cats they are too fun to chase.\n\nShadow loves daily walks, even if something scares him on a walk, he still continues to love going on walks.\nSo if you are looking for a sweet, handsome, loving boy and are willing help him continue to learn to trust. Don't mind having a constant Shadow, he might be the boy for you! Shadow is available for adoption in Texas.\n\nAs a small organization, we cannot answer emails about each of our pets.

She is a very sweet social girl, she occasionally does need a reminder that she can't jump on people but after one or two verbal reminders she settles down and just wants to sit in your lap and give kisses. She is spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, and is currently on her heart worm treatment. Domino had marks on her when she was found that were consistent with either being thrown from a moving vehicle or falling out of one. She has some issues with men that are fear based and may have something to do with her injuries; we are doing our best to help her work through those problems. She would be great as an only dog.",

I came to the Senior Dog Sanctuary from another shelter where I'd been found as a stray.\n\nI'm a very sweet boy who has been getting some well-deserved TLC here at the sanctuary. I adore leash walks with all the staff and volunteers - I like to sniff everything (as a good beagle should)! I love love love mealtime, the good folks here are even giving me lunch since I'm a bit underweight. I would do well in a home with other pups and children. \n\nIf interested in meeting me please email adoption@sdsanctuary.com.",

They're calling me a polar bear cause I'm so big and fluffy!\n\nLet's see, what else has changed between then and now... Oh yeah, I have so much more energy now. I still love to cuddle but gotta say I really enjoy romping around most of the day! I love to wrestle with my foster brothers but I also love one on one attention from my foster parents through playtime and runs. Having a doggie sibling would be nice but as long as I'm taken to doggie daycare or on play dates I will be just fine as the only dog in the household.\n\nThings I love: fetch, squeaky toys, petting my humans to ask for more pets in return, wrestling, running, and everything else that is fun!\n\nI'm a big strong girl and I need a family that can handle me with ease. Don't let my size completely fool you though, I'm still a puppy learning a lot of things and it's hard for me not to just goof off sometimes. I'm very smart and know basic commands, I am also potty- and crate-trained. Regular exercise and play will be a necessity for me as I love being active.

He will wrap his front legs around you and bury his head in your armpit, making you feel very loved ? This quality makes him very special. In addition, Sonny is fully trained on and off-leash. He is a healthy, happy boy who deserves to be loved and cared for in a home. Sonny was raised in a home and is house trained and crate trained. We are looking to place him in a home where he can be the center of attention and get as much love as he gives. Being part of a busy kennel means that he doesn\u2019t get the time and attention he deserves and we are looking for better for him. That being said he is still a Malinois and would do best in a home that has no other dogs and no young children. Sonny would love an active home that would take him on adventures, play fetch with him, and utilize his awesome training skills!\u00a0\n\nPlease reach out to us at ipodogsport@gmail.com if you are interested in Sonny!\n\nhttp://www.absolutek-9.com/available-dogs",

            "description": "Floki is a 1-2 year old, 70 pound, Walker Coonhound who was brought to us by animal control. He was previously an outdoor dog so he will need quite a bit of training and time to acclimate to living in a house. He is a very energetic and vocal dog who loves to run. He needs some leash training as his nose is always to the ground, searching for animals in the woods - like a typical hunting dog!\nFloki is very friendly but may have had some previous, negative interactions with other dogs, so he does like getting too close. He also seems to want to chase cats so he will need to be an only pet for a while until he has had some socialization. He does have a tendency to get mouthy, grabbing on to shirt sleeves when he is frustrated and not 'working.'\nWith some time, exercise, and training, we think that Floki will be a great addition to an active family.Please visit the following link on our website to learn about Second Chance's adoption process. http://www.2ndchanceanimalcenter.org/adoption.html",

            "description": "Amari is a beautiful 3-year old pocket Belgian Malinois located in California. Amari is a tri-pod having landed in a shelter with severe injuries to her right front leg. Unable to save it, the leg was amputated, but that hasn't slowed Amari down one bit! \n\nAmari is a shy gal that warms up with happy talk and yummy treats. Once comfortable she runs laps around you, even though she's missing a leg! Amari has your typical Belgian Malinois traits: she has high energy, high prey drive, is very active, and wants a job to do. She loves going for walks, chewing on bones and playing with puzzle toys, anything to keep her occupied! When done she loves to curl up and get cozy with her favorite people.\n\nShe can be nervous when by herself in a new environment where she's shown some mild destructive behavior (mainly chewing) but this subsides when getting comfortable in a home. She's also an escape artist, so proper enclosures are a must. It's recommended that she is given time to transition into a new home and given plenty of physical exercises and mental enrichment, as well as crate and obedience training. As a tripod, she would do best with exercises that strengthen her legs - minimal jumping, lots of swimming, short walks to slowly build stamina. She's getting stronger every week! Ideally, her home consisted of few stairs.\n\nAmari can be pushy with some dogs and will need proper introductions. She resource guards food and toys with other dogs but not with her humans. She does better with mellow male dogs. She doesn't quite understand when another dog doesn't want to play and takes what she wants (toys, food).\n\nThis little gal has been through a lot and needs a home that will give her time to adjust and help her work through the transition. She really dislikes furry balls aka cats. Ideally she'll go to a home where she's the only pet, but she can live harmoniously with other dogs.\n\nAmari is a true Velcro dog and would love to go wherever you go! \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering this pet, please complete an application at this link https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/24689/generic . \n\nWe are an official 501C3 organziation that does not have a physical location. Our home address is in Michigan, however, the majority of our dogs are not located in Michigan. The physical location of each of our dogs is posted with the name of the pet or in the title area. If you are within 4 hours of the pet, please be prepared to pick the pet up. We do provide transport assistance, however, the applicant must drive 50% of the total distance of the transport. \n\nThe information that we have available is in our posting. If you would like to discuss this animal additionally please fill out this application. Applications that are completed in our process and being considered as a match will speak to the foster home to gain more information about our adoptable dog. \n\nIf you have questions about this pet please contact us at info@MADrescueinc.org. \n\nYou may also call our toll free number at 844-MAD-RESQ or 844-623-7377. \n\nAdditional information about all of our dogs for adoption can be located at our website MAD Rescue Inc",

He has been friendly with the staff and volunteers he's met at the shelter, and enjoys going on walks and spending time exploring the outdoor play yards. Ace enjoys affection and scratches, and hates being left behind in his kennel when it's time to say goodbye. He may do best in a home without young children- they can be a bit overwhelming for a little fella like him! Ask about Ace today!",

She's done well sharing a kennel with another pup while at PACC, so if you're looking for a new roommate, Duce has glowing references! Duce enjoys long walks on the beach, sunset cocktails (well, maybe mocktails since she's underage) and light jazz. Her favorite snack is chicken. Ask about this lovely lady today!",

He has short legs and a chunky little body. He walks nicely on a leash and loves tummy rubs. Visit this nice boy at the Rockbridge Spca or email manager@rockbridgespca.net or houndlady1@comcast.net.\nnote: Layne has one cherry eye that can be corrected when neutered. \nvisit our fb page: dogs of rockbridge and rockbridge spca\nphoto by: Emily\nNOTE: all animals adopted are taken straight to a local veterinarian for spay/neuter.

When Toby arrived from KY, he was scared and unsure of all the hustle and bustle at our shelter. He has now started to relax with all his new friends at DAWS and to show us just what a sweetheart he is. We know he is going to do great in a loving home with patience and kindness toward Toby. He is going to repay that person with endless devotion. We think Toby would do best in an adult-only home with someone who has previous dog experience. If you would like to meet Toby and see if he is the one for you, please email dogs@daws.org to arrange. Submitting an application online is helpful.

Loves the water & could give anyone a run for their money in a race whether on land or in water. Needs a home with a fenced in yard or on a farm so she can be outside & run to her hearts desire. \n\nLazy is not in her DNA, literally. Mainly Mountain Cur in makeup she is a working dog & thrives on giving her a job. Great treeing instincts and would love being on a farm or hunting. Very smart & picks up new skills quickly- she was treadmill trained in minutes. Yes, you read that right... She runs on the treadmill! :)\n\nHighly food motivated & hasn't met a toy she didn't like. She loves food & her toys so much she tends to guard them & needs to be only dog in the home. Active dog by day, but cuddler by night... When 8pm hits she is ready to lay with you on the couch & cuddle until it's time to go to bed in her cage. \n\nPotty and crate trained. Spayed, chipped & up to date on all shots. Embark DNA test results done so you know her exact breed make up. \n\nApply www.fourleggedranch.com",

She would make the perfect hiking companion for weekends out on the trails, and enjoys frequent jogs around the neighborhood park. Her gregarious, friendly personality ensures she makes new friends everywhere she goes! \n\nAbby enjoys the company of other dogs as well, and happily romps around with her canine friends in playgroups at the shelter. She is currently living in a foster home with another dog, and gets along famously with her. She would love to have a doggie friend in her forever home to romp around with each day. Her foster also takes her on frequent field trips to the dog park where she has a blast socializing with everyone she meets! \n\nAbby is a wonderful companion in the house, and has great house manners. She sleeps loose in her foster's home overnight, and is quiet until morning. She is already potty trained, and is crate trained. Abby rides very well in the car, but she is still working a bit on her leash manners. She has met younger children previously, and is gentle and kind with them. \n\nAfter a long day of fun in the great outdoors, Abby happily spends her nights snuggled up with her humans on the couch watching Netflix. This sweet girl will make a fantastic companion for whichever family is lucky enough to adopt her. If Abby sounds like a good fit for your household, schedule an adoption appointment today!",

He\u2019s a active boy with lots of energy so he would benefit off a active home he can get daily exercise. He need someone who can work with him and continue his training. When we rescued him from the shelter he was scared of everything and he has come a long way! Comet is very playful and loves his toys! He tends to stay to himself most of the time and rather be around his dog friends than people.\nHe\u2019s not a dog that really wants to cuddle up on the couch. Comet loves other dogs but can be a bit awkward so a compatible friend would be best! \n\nComet is a 3 year old pit bull mix around 60 lbs. Beautiful white come with black spots! He is a sweet boy that deserves the best home. He\u2019s been neutered, chipped, fully vaccinated, and current on flea meds. We do prefer a home without small animals and small children. If you are interested in meeting Comet please send us a detailed email and request a application to fill out. \n\nWe do require home owners only with a fully fenced in yard at least 6 feet. Bully breed experience is a must. We are located in Northern California and adopt out locally. We need to be close enough for a home checks and meets. \nSimbaspawdogrescue@yahoo.com\n",

Even when left alone he won\u2019t try to jump or climb the fence, he doesn\u2019t dig or jump at the fence.  He does like to bark at distractions and also scratches the ground when excited but easy around people, doesn\u2019t jump up on people.  \n- He is leery of being pet directly on top of the head but likes ear & neck rubs and will be your best friend for hours if you scratch his butt !!  :)    \n- He doesn\u2019t seem to be in to fetch but loves tug-of-war with people.  \n- He is very gentle taking treats.\n- He knows SIT very well and catching on to DOWN quickly.  \n- He walks fairly well on a leash when no distractions. \n - He seems perfectly happy to be outside (even alone) but might have separation anxiety when left alone inside.",

Their owner thought they deserved a better situation where they could be house dogs and surrendered them to the rescue.  Sadly, they were not kept on heartworm prevention and both are heartworm positive.  We have started them both on the slow-kill heartworm protocol.  We have also gotten them up-to-date on vaccinations and spayed and neutered.  \n\nDudley is estimated to be 12 months old and he weighs 10 pounds.  He is more outgoing than Deena and is more social and interactive with people.  He has the cutest little underbite and airplane ears!  He has gotten along well with other dogs and cats at the rescue.",

He has recently been neutered so we will be monitoring his interactions with other dogs to see how he interacts. Prior to his neuter, we found him to be rather aggressive with other male dogs. In general though, he loves to play and we think with time, he would enjoy the company of a non-combative playmate. Due to Zeus being such a dynamo, we are saying that he shouldn't go to a home with children under 10.\n\nWe're still getting to know this boy but he is loved by everyone he meets!

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Tikaani is a very special boy - he came to us at GPRM but went straight to the wonderful fosters who have worked with him from day one. He has made remarkable progress - but he still has more to learn and will only be adopted to a very Pyr savvy adopter willing to put in the time and effort. This is what the foster mom says:\n\nTikaani (Kaani) is a 2-year-old pocket pyr\" at only 65 pounds, but he makes up for his lack of size with his extra-large personality. He is very in tune with his people, extremely intelligent, and needs to be challenged.\n\nTikaani had a very rough start to life, and will require and deserves an extra special home. He came in to rescue at only 8 months old, and we were given little to no information about what to expect. We immediately found out he is extremely nervous around new people, and it takes a lot of time and patience to earn his trust.\n\nHe bonds hard to the people he trusts, and like a typical pyr, he can be very protective. He does not like new people in the home, but he does warm up after frequent, repeat visits-and very slow introductions. He has the most expressive, captivating eyes, and if you pay attention, you can always tell what he needs.\n\nHis front right leg is shorter than the others due to previous mistreatment. He has been through testing and therapy and it doesn't seem to cause him any pain, but it is a constant, visual reminder of why he fears humans.\n\nHe loves car rides, walks, puzzle toys, and spending time with his humans. Kaani is a goofy, playful, silly boy who never fails to make me laugh. He likes to \"jaw snap\" (make a barking motion without any noise) when he's excited or just wants to talk back-we often have conversations back and forth. While he's not much of a snuggler, he always likes to be close and makes me feel so incredibly loved. I've spent time with a lot of dogs over the years, and none have given me the sweet, devoted feeling he does.\n\nTikaani requires an experienced pyr owner with a lot of patience, love, and understanding. His ideal home would be a quiet home with no children, few visitors, and with adults who can meet him where he is and work at his pace. He's the pyrfect dog for any introvert! He would do best with a female dog around the same age, and he is great with cats/kittens. 1/31/21 2:42 PM",

He is lively, outgoing, and has lots of energy for playing, running, and hiking. He would prefer an active home that stays busy (and has plenty of room for him to bark and play on). While Timber really enjoys the company of dogs outside the home (parks, walks, you name it), he loves to be king of the castle and would be happiest as an only dog child.**\n\nIn his previous home, Timber lived with toddlers and found them to be very irritating. He would prefer mature kiddos in his future home.\n\nThis boy has TONS of love to give and will make a great companion for his future family. Please fill out an application today!\n\n*Timber is on Zignature Pork dog food\n\n**Timber is not good in a house full of dogs (4 others) - he was OK with just one in the home with him",

He is looking for a home that will respect his LGD instincts. He is extremely protective and has to have careful introductions with anyone entering his property.\n\nKoda is currently at Old Farm Kennel in Florence awaiting a new home. He nipped a visitor in his last home (the person was not introduced by his owners) and he felt he was doing his job. His new family should have experience with the breed and be ready to help introduce him safely to the new household.\n\nKoda is great with people at the kennel and in general, likes people. His new home should allow him to be the only male dog. Interested? Let us know!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.As is the usual, Anubis was brought to us through no real fault of his own.\n\nNubis (Noobis)\n\nNoobis is more of a person than a dog. He responds to conversation and talking more than he responds to commands. Some wonderful qualities of Noobis are his intelligence, his loyalty, and his regal dignity.\n\nHe is somewhat socially awkward with other dogs, as he doesn't seem to have been raised around any other animals, in addition raised in a somewhat controlled environment (not a lot of early socialization.) So, when he plays he opens his mouth, but then never closes it, and he doesn't really know how to \"play.\" He can tell that you are excited, and you would like to play with him, however, he looks at you as if you are just doing a funny dance. It can look a little awkward, and that is the many things we love about him. He is being fostered with another large dog, cats, rabbits, and ducks. He initially was interested if they wanted to challenge him to a staring contest, and once that was off the table, he was not interested anymore. He is fine with the other animals, but don't expect him to interact with them. He is kind of a stay at home and read a book with his family next to the fire dog person.\n\nHe is a light eater, and loves to have his tummy rubbed. He does protect his home to an extent, but he will obey you if he feels like it. Often I have had to walk to him to ask him to come inside. He knows I am talking to him, again, that intelligence thing, and beautiful Pyrenees thing.\n\nI think a home that is fairly calm with lower expectations of needing a \"get excited and run around dog\" would be a great home. A home that is willing to laugh at his quirks, honor his intelligence, and uphold his dignity. He loves car rides, walks with his human. He is very expressive with his body, and is always curious in a gentle way.\n\nNoobis would ultimately like a quiet home with very little stimulation (preferably not right in town). He has no interest in other dogs or animals and prefers the company of his humans.\n\nNoobis has not been previously socialized and is very scared and reactive to new situations, people at the door, and barks at people when in the car. He responds according to his scared feelings with reactive barking and lunging at other people and dogs when on a walk. As he gains more exposure and confidence, these behaviors are subsiding. However, he will need continued training, positive reinforcement, confidence building and a calm voice at all times to continue his rapid improvement. Previous Pyr experience is required\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about this boy, please reach out. We are anxious to find him the Pyrfect forever home.",

He is a beautiful dog, quite large, with a lot to learn yet - will definitely need to go to someone willing to continue his training.\n\nThis is what his foster mom just told us:\n\nThis guy, Banjo has come so far in the last few months. He was terribly insecure and would go after our dogs. He broke a choke chain, chewed through so much stuff and had no manners at 100lbs and only 10 months. I truly didn't know if we could help him.\n\nBanjo is a COMPLETELY different dog now. Still a puppy at almost 12 months so he needs constant reminders that the rules are still in place. He is an amazingly sweet boy who loves people and especially kids. I thought once he was unadoptable, but with a few months of hard work on our and his part he is ready to adopted. This is why we foster. It's hard work, lots of tears, and some incredibly difficult and exhausting days, but watching Banjo just become a dog is the best thing ever.\n\nHe will need an owner that is familiar and confident with the Great Pyrenees breed.\n\n*********************\n\nThese comments are directly from the foster mom and great information for potential adopters:\n\nCrate-Trained: ABSOLUTELY NOT, he panics in the crate\n\nCar: he is great in the car and loves to go for rides\n\nSwim: we have no idea\n\nFetch: he tries but loves to get stuff to chew on\n\nToys: yes he loves toys\n\nLap: if we let him\n\nProtective: of his people, pretty normal for the LGD's we have had\n\nEscape: if the gate is open he will roam\n\nPredatory: we haven't seen any of that\n\nObedient: he has great recall and will do almost anything for a treat. Much better than most LGD's\n\nPlayful: very, he is really rough with the other dogs but that's how they are\n\nTimid: only with new experiences and not aggressive, he runs away\n\nSkittish: when scared\n\nIndependent: he's a lot needier than most LGD's because of his history\n\nAffectionate: very\n\nEager to please: he tries but is better with treats\n\nEven-tempered and gentle: he is incredibly gentle with young kids we babysat for a 3, 5, 7-year-old last night and he was really good but his size scared the older boy so they were locked in the laundry room. Banjo was super upset and was way better than Sadie about the personal space and being gentle with the young kids. He does way better than a young dog should with kids.\n\nGoofy: he is really silly and we laugh at his puppy antics\n\nOkay with cats: Yes but will chase if they run\n\nGreat with all people may let strangers in the house if they aren't threatening\n\nOkay with dogs: I would suggest another young LGD. He loves to play with our other 2 LGD's and they all play incredibly rough. Really it's training and it looks terrible but they are all having a great time.\n\nLGD Experience: A must. He is entering his teen years and will need someone who knows how to continue to help him learn to be a good citizen. He does have some abandonment issues and doesn't like to be alone\n\nKids: He adores kids and a family would be best for him. He was around a 3-year-old and showed incredible restraint in his excitement especially for a puppy. He was not jumping on them but was so excited to be near them. Kids are a must for Banjo.\n\nFarm animals: he is great with my geese, ducks, and goats but would need an introduction to anything else he will be homed with.\n\nApartment: I don't think he would be happy in an apartment setting, he loves to run and explore and play.\n\nI would suggest Banjo go to a home with another big dog. He has shown a lot of anxiety at being alone especially outside at night. This has been lessened with the other dogs.",

Unfortunately she has been diagnosed with severe dilated cardiomyopathy. The vet has given her approximately one to two years to live, but that could be shorter or longer. Hard to say.  Starka is such a sweet soul with so much love to give.  We just want to give her a chance. We are working closely with the specialist and she is on medication and the food he recommended.  The biggest issue is she cannot be put under to be spayed. When she comes into heat she is a BEAR with other female dogs, but fine with males.  It would be great to have her in a home with another male dog as she loves to play, although she has some limitations on the type and length of exercise. We understand it will be difficult to find someone to take her on knowing these issues.  If you foster her, the rescue pays all her medical bills and can provide dog food for her as well.  Boise, Idaho area preferred as that is where the specialist is located.  If interested in helping Starka, please apply at www.saintrescue.org.  All other dogs MUST be fixed. No exceptions.",

He's walked the neighborhoods around the shelter countless times, has been out for pup cups and soft serves, and has relaxed in foster homes. He's played with other dogs in play groups and worked on his skills in the decompression room. He's welcomed new volunteers and taken long car rides. He's even begged for a Bloody Mary on a restaurant patio and was turned into a meme.\nThe one place Tally hasn't been since he's been in our care for the last 14 months is an adopter's home. If you can believe it, this sweet boy with elusive ears has never been adopted.\nAll of these adventures with numerous volunteers show how beloved Tally is. He just needs one of you to recognize what an amazing dog he is. Could it be you?\n3.7 y/o, 45 pounds, W A I T I N G \nDogs: friendly\nCats: no\nKids: adult-only home\nPotty- and crate-trained\nFill out an application today!",

This American Staffordshire Terrier x Lab mix is around a year old and is bursting full of energy, just like the goof that he is. If you\u2019re looking for an active pup who loves to play and can keep up no problem, Silas is your dude.  He's a friendly, happy, energetic young dog. Since he's been out of the shelter, he's really come out of his shell. He's great with people and enjoys making new friends. He loves to play and is social with other dogs. Active energy. We have not seen Silas with children. Loves other dogs and is always eager to say hello and play. He has a very active play style and does particularly well with dogs who can match his energy. We would not recommend him for a home with cats.\n\nApply to foster or adopt at bit.ly/badassadopt",

In his short life he has been bounced around quite a bit, originally coming all the way from Mississippi! Due to some pain in his hips, he enjoys short walks, but mostly his favorite thing to do is sit quietly by your feet as you read or watch tv. Gatsby would also love to show you his tricks like sit and paw! You'll know you have become his favorite when he looks up at you with his big brown eyes leaning in to say \"pet me please\". His ideal home would be a calm laid back place preferably without too many stairs as he has some trouble going up and down. Does he sound like he could be your new best friend? \n\nGatsby is being shown by appointment only so please email Vicky Pape at vpape@lollypop.org",

I am a very sweet little fellow. I am so sweet that sometimes I allow my brother and some of the other dogs to pick on me. But I love to play with other dogs, regardless of their size and I think that I may even be able to live happily in a home with a feline friend. I would be a perfect fit for a first time owner with a young family looking for a forever companion. While I would love to have a big yard to play in, I think I could be comfortable in any range of living environments, including an apartment. I would prefer to live in a busy home where there are lots of things going on that I can be involved in. I love to meet new people and will always be friendly when greeting your guests. I would benefit from continued training, as I am not quite potty-trained or leash-trained yet. One of my favorite activities is playing fetch but I think the thing that I would love the most would be getting to cuddle up on the couch next to my new family forever!",

            "description": "****Please do not message the rescue asking if this dog is still available; if a dog/puppy is still listed on Petfinder, we are still accepting applications for them. PLEASE READ ENTIRE BIO BEFORE EMAILING****\nApplicants MUST BE a minimum of 25 yrs old to ADOPT.\n\n*Name: Esme\n*Age: 1 year\n*Current Weight: 48 pounds\n*Rescued from: Texas\n*Adoption fee: $375 (plus $125 spay/neuter deposit, which is refundable when spay/neuter agreement is fulfilled)\n*Health: up to date on required vaccines\n\n\nEsme is a darling dog,  She is super friendly, she has been great with all dogs that she meets and with her foster's young son.  Of course, being a year old, she is very playful and loves her toys and chasing the tennis ball in the yard.  She will need a home that currently has a fenced yard to run and explore and home with lots of love.  Esme was pulled from a high kill shelter in east Texas and is a blessed little girl to have an opportunity to find her furever home in the northeast.  If you are looking for a loving, kind, friendly girl to spoil rotten, Esme is perfect for you.\n\nEsme was rescued from an area where there is an abundance of homeless dogs, and not a lot of shelter space for them to go while they wait for their forever homes. She will be arriving at SNARR's Adoption Center in Brewster, NY on January 23rd ready for adoption! To apply to adopt Esme, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n**Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an approved application.**\n\nIMPORTANT: This dog has not yet been altered. For any dog or puppy that is not able to be spayed/neutered prior to adoption, SNARR requires a $125 deposit in addition to your adoption fee, as well as a strictly-enforced signed Spay/Neuter Contract stating you will have this dog altered within 6 months of adoption. The $125 deposit will be returned once the contract has been fulfilled. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n-------------------------------------------------------\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

If Banjo is still listed and not marked as pending then he is still available.***  \n\nBanjo came to us recently and was picked up as a stray on a reservation in ND.   He is neutered, UTD on vaccines, rabies, been dewormed and microchipped.   Appears to be younger, maybe 1-1/2 yrs old.  Very sweet boy!    He does tend to try to be more dominant with other dogs and can be a little nippy with them.  Not overly playful with other dogs.    Has not been tested with children or cats and we don't have any history on him.    \n\nBanjo is fairly petite and leggy, about 30 lbs.    Nice medium energy,  Needs more training and proper socializing and will need daily exercise.    He will make someone a wonderful adventure buddy!     He is not the typical hyper heeler.  \n\nWe require a completed application and home visit.  Adoption fee is $450.

She most likely had never seen the inside of a home,  wasn\u2019t sure of what a leash was \u2013 hesitated to show any affection,   and has a paralyzing fear of ceiling fixtures.        Sweet Precious Finn arrived with multiple Tick borne illnesses that were to severe for antibiotics to cure on it\u2019s own.   She must have been in so much pain,  but you would  never have known \u2013 cause thur it all Finn\u2019s gentle and sweet spirit is unwavering.\nToday \u2013 Finn has BLOSSOMED into such a wonderful companion.    Her very favorite activities are snuggling,   Bum Scratches, Playing in the snow,  eating treats and going for walks.   SERIOUSLY \u2013 Don\u2019t even think about putting your shoes on for any other reason unless you\u2019re ready to disappoint a tail-wagging polar bear.   \n Finley gets along with everyone,  no matter the age or species.   She rarely barks,  she walks PYRfectly on a leash,  is fully house trained,  and is just the sweetest girl EVER\u2026   She is honestly such a terrific dog  \nA few things that a forever home will need to be award of:    Because of her past,   Finn will likely need to stay on an anti anxiety medication long term (don\u2019t worry \u2013 you can easily sneak the pills into her food) the cost is about $30.00 a month.    She requires special food to keep her bladder infections away \u2013 but it isn\u2019t much more costly than typical premium food.   She also has a lingering fear of hard shiny floors which may resolve in time.      This was solved in her foster home with small washable throw rugs and strategically placed doggie beds/blankets.    (She has really made so MUCH progress \u2013 such an awesome girl).\n. If interested in meeting Finley, please contact Sandy  or respond by e-mail -- Finley will LOVE you for it! We will also need you to fill out our adoption survey Finley will need an above ground fence for safe play and exercise. We are looking for homes in the surrounding Pittsburgh area. For more information please contact Great Pyrenees Club of Western Pennsylvania Rescue, Inc., a 501(c)(3) nonprofit rescue organization or visit our web page http://www.papyr.org for more information. Thank you for supporting animal rescue!\n\n\n",

            "description": "Luna is a 4 year old Dachshund/Lab Mix with a beautiful coat and a unique look.  She is long like a dachshund but has the face of a lab. Cute! Luna LOVES to be around people! She is about 40 pounds, and could stand to lose a few (we are working on it)!\n\nLuna is a little weary of men at first, but is quick to become their best friend after making sure they are not a threat. She has yet to meet a person she is not fond of!! Although she is a lover of people she requires a home without small children \n\nLuna currently is being fostered with 3 other dogs of all sizes. She would do best in a home with a laid back dog or even being the only dog. Luna walks well on a leash and is getting used to being crated when her foster is not home. She is possessive of toys and food, so she is fed in her kennel as we work with her. \n\nLuna loves to run around outside, but is also a huge snuggler. She loves to sleep in bed with her foster at night and does so without any issues! Luna is potty trained and likes to ride in the car. A fenced in yard would be ideal for Luna. \n\n**INTERESTED IN LUNA APPLY HERE:** https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/1HKTvdnEz3Iip3IG866Yx8IJZusZrchi-0VHUe2gElVM/edit?usp=forms_home&ths=true",

She hasn't quite learned all her manners yet, so she's looking for a family who is interested in taking her to training classes and working on obedience to help her become the best canine citizen she can be. She is full of wild energy just like her namesake! You could have a lot of fun with this girl if you like to be kept on your toes!\n\nFrom: Stray\nWeight: 53 lbs\nExercise: High Energy\nLarge/Small dogs: I can be overwhelming for some dogs with my play style. Please bring in your dog(s) to visit with me.\nChildren: I am a lot of dog with little manners- I may be better suited for older children. Please bring the whole family in to visit. \nCats/other small animals: Unknown, ask an adoption counselor about doing a cat test with me.\n\n*HHHS Behavior Team will consult with you about my high energy and manners.* Primary Color: Black W/white Weight: 53lbs Age: 2yrs 1mths 3wks Animal has been Spayed",

            "description": "3 year old Papa Bear is one of our special boys, and he's just so handsome! Short and stocky at 40lbs, he is a corgi golden retriever mix with a thick golden coat and a perfect white blaze on his face. He is vocal when happy, cuddles like a pro, loves toys, and gives the best kisses.\n\nHe has some behavioral challenges that we are confident he can overcome with the right guidance, but for this reason we will only approve applicants who are experienced with difficult dogs and who will agree to professional behavioral training. We also require a home with a fenced yard, and one without children. Please do not apply if you cannot commit to these requirements.\n\nPapa Bear gets along with some dogs and not others, and has shown some resource guarding of toys, food, and people. We have not tested him with cats.\n\nWith people he is very wiggly, happy, and sweet 95% of the time, but will challenge and snap at his humans when he doesn't want to follow directions. He also has some car ride and leash issues that he has been working on. He will need to be sedated for vet trips and bathing, although he has learned to accept being brushed recently. \n\nWe know the right home is out there for Papa Bear, and we are confident someone will see the good boy he is and help him become a once in a lifetime dog in his forever home.\n\nPlease fill out an application and we will call you once approved to set up a meet and greet. If you have any questions, email jessica.canineestates@gmail.com or call 908-305-9155",

            "description": "\"Itchy\" Echeva is a spunky, 9 year old, 14lb red chihuahua who loves food, attention, and life! He came to us from Lake County, shut down and weary of his previous life. He has mild cataracts and had severe dental disease that was treated and a large lipoma which we removed. His skin was also badly irritated from a long term flea infestation, and after some allergy injections and a few baths, it is looking much better already.\n\nAs soon as he started feeling better, this boy's personality began to shine and he really defies his age with energy and gusto. He loves affection, treats, walks well on a leash, and gets along with most dogs. He is a little grumpy and adorably confused when being picked up - he \"swims\" in the air with his legs! - but with practice he will be just fine. Echeva is mostly healed and will likely need some bathing and itch medication before being 100% healthy. He is ready now to find his fur-ever home, full of love, treats, and massages!\n\nPlease fill out an application and we will call you once approved to set up a meet and greet.

            "description": "Our very own 10 year old, 13lb, blond wire-haired dachshund mix Mick is a sweet happy boy who has been through an incredible transformation since joining the Canine Estates family two months ago.\n\nHe came to us as a stray, emaciated and unable to eat properly due to his severe dental disease. His skin and ears were so infected and raw that he was mostly bald, and his eyes were nearly glued shut. If all that wasn't enough, his bloodwork showed age-related kidney disease. Now we are two months down his road of recovery, and he is a different dog! His skin, coat, and eyes look absolutely wonderful! Though he is still taking weekly baths and some medication, he nearly done and 100% better. He eats happily after his dental with extractions, and has gained a good 3 pounds!\n\nHis kidney disease is age-related and progressive, but stable and manageable with a good vet relationship and proper diet. Due to his kidney disease, he will drink a lot and has some incontinence issues which will easily be managed with the use of belly bands and diapers.\n\nThrough all his obstacles in life, Mick has been a sweet, loving dog from day one, equally willing to amble along on an easy walk or cuddle up with his favorite humans. He gets along with other dogs, and would likely be fine with cats and respectful children as well. Mick is ready to win his way into his forever home, and we think his new family will be the real winners with this sweet boy!\n\nPlease fill out an application and we will call you once approved to set up a meet and greet. If you have any questions, email director@canineestates.com or call 727-412-0558",

Han\u2019s life has taken a turn for the better since being rescued by SWESR. He\u2019s now living in a loving foster home, getting along well with his foster dog companions, and even patrolling his new yard looking for birds and squirrels. \n\nHan needs a fenced yard that he can explore at his leisure and he will let you know when he is ready to come inside. He has a low prey drive and no interest in challenging a 4-foot fence. So far, Han has shown little prey drive, so he may be a candidate for a home with inside cats. \n\nHan is a quiet boy who may have some hearing loss, but that doesn\u2019t keep him from being a wonderful companion. We have not had him in a home with children and we think he would prefer a quieter home with adults and possibly older children that would be gentle and not expect him to play and entertain them. He loves human attention and is a seriously \u201chands on\u201d kind of Setter who enjoys lots of petting, lap time and massages. He has very few demands other than lots of love and a warm bed.\n\nHan is house trained, crate trained, fully vetted, and currently in a foster home in Dallas TX. He is a candidate to adopt or furever foster where SWESR provides for his ongoing medical needs. He is not a candidate for flying or a volunteer transport that is more than a days drive away.\n\nFor an application to adopt or for more information about Southwest English Setter Rescue including our adoption requirements and transport availability, please go to http://www.swesr.org/. Please call us at 214-997-3885 if you have any questions.",

            "description": "Please help us change Holly's life. This poor girl had been in a boarding facility since Christmas when her owner moved and was not able to take her along. The owner hoped to get her back, but unfortunately was not able to do so. So she was officially surrendered to our rescue partners down South and transported up to us so we can find her second chance. Holly needs a fenced in yard, she will escape if given the chance. She is 3 years old and 42lbs. She knows \"sit\" and \"paw\". She is very active. She LOVES to be with people and does not want them to leave....understandably. Please open your heart to Holly, she deserves a forever home.\n   \nThis is a courtesy post for Jersey Shore Animal Center.

This fella has had zero training, so an obedience class is totally necessary to teach him some basic manners; like no jumping, walking on the leash etc. He is very receptive to learning and correction. This poor guy was found as a stray down in TN. He was rescued from the shelter down there, transported up to NJ, and is now looking for someone to give him the love and training he needs. He is a big boy (55lbs but needs to gain some weight) with a bigger heart! Loves his squeaky toys and just wants to be by your side. He is 2 1/2 years old and would love a nice home with a fenced yard to romp around in. His girlfriend is Millie! They have such fun together. \n\nThis is a courtesy post for Jersey Shore Animal Center.

We are still working to get to know him, but he is a very sweet boy that definitely loves attention. As far as we can tell so far, he would do decent with other dogs as well as cats; but we have noticed a small urge to chase the smaller animals that could be easily trained out and not an issue if you kept on top of it. Dexter is not potty trained, but we are working on that with him. His family said that they didn't have time for him, so it is no fault to his own that he is here with us. Dexter will be neutered before he leaves and is up to date on vaccinations. If you would like to be Dexter's forever home please contact us at 308-352-2630 or pcanimalshelter@live.com.",

She loves to play with other dogs, but not cats, please, as she will chase them!  She loves her people!!  If you would like it learn more about Viola, please complete an application and then reach out to Roxy@bigfluffydogs.com\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

Lucky for me, I have a whole crew of staff and volunteers dedicated to working with me to address them. Hooray! As the adopter of a dog with specific training needs, the Austin Animal Center will provide you with some extra resources just for choosing me to be a part of your family. How awesome is that?!

            "description": "Meet Guiness!  Guiness is a two year old lab/Mastiff mix.  He spent his first few months petrified in a shelter in South Carolina after being brought in as a stray.  Slowly but surely Guiness began to come out of his shell and was sent to live with a foster family with kids and other dogs.  Although Guiness did well there, we believe he would do best in a more quiet home either as an only dog or with a confident female that he can feel secure with.\nBecause of his hard start in life he is shy and will need someone to show him that the world is not a scary place.  Guiness would just love to go on walks and hikes and come home to snuggle and be wrapped in a cozy blanket.  Although Guiness is a big boy, he seems to think he is a lap dog and wants to be as close as possible to his people.  Guiness is the perfect mix of active and chill.\n\n**PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING**\n\nIf you are interested in adopting any of the puppies, our adoption fee is $495 ( puppies) $375 (adults) which includes transportation from the South and we do suggest putting a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several littermates.\n\n**Please understand that we are a volunteer based organization. While our volunteers try to answer all emails/questions as quickly as possible, below please find answers to some of our most frequently asked questions. We ask that you please read these FAQ's to see if your question has already been answered before emailing additional questions:\n\n- If a dog or puppy is listed on Petfinder, they are still available. Please do not email asking if they are still available. If a dog or puppy is still listed, then we are still accepting applications :-) We do not go on a first come first serve basis, but on best fit for the family and most importantly, the puppy or dog.\n\n- We are taking our best guess on breed and size when fully-grown (or already an adult), based on the puppy's/dog\u2019s physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. We rarely are able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. \n\n- Our dogs/puppies are either at our Adoption Center in Brewster, NY, in foster care, or are adopted straight from transport. An application is necessary to meet any dog/puppy. Often, dogs and puppies are spoken for before they arrive. Many people feel more comfortable with a meet and greet which we completely understand and respect, however please know you are taking a chance of that puppy/dog getting adopted by someone else before hand.\n\n- The way to start the process for any dog or puppy is by filling out an application. Applications for foster or adoption can be found at www.snarrnortheast.org and by clicking either adopt or foster from the main menu. If you fill out an application, please make sure you answer all the questions in as much detail as possible and that you receive a confirmation email, otherwise we did NOT receive it.",

Miracle is a 1 year old blue and white female pit who was released to the shelter through Oak Grove animal control because she did not like the boyfriend in the home. Miracle is very timid when meeting new people and takes a while to warm up to you and get comfortable in new surroundings. Miracle does great with the shelter staff now that she has warmed up to us although we recommend a home without children due to her history. Miracle is very selective when meeting new potential housemates and would do better in a home without other animals. Miracle is a sweet girl once given the chance and would make a great companion for any female! She is HEARTWORM NEGATIVE as of 12-18-20 and weighs about 41 pounds.\n\nHer adoption fee is $36.50 and she can be microchipped for $8.25. Due to the outbreak of Covid-19 our adoption policies have changed. All adoptions are by appointment only. Call to set up an appointment to meet the animal. Dogs are $61.50 and puppies are $59 unless otherwise noted. All cats and kittens are $44 unless otherwise noted. Our system automatically updates petfinders every two hours. Feel free to email us with any questions you may have.",

So far we know that she is about 8 years old and weighs 67 lbs and has been good around people and other dogs.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Dollop, please visit our website to learn about our adoption process and to fill out an application, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs and cats will be micro-chipped, spayed or neutered, and up-to-date on vaccinations at the time of adoption. For more photos of Dollop, follow us on Facebook Gateway Pet Guardians and Instagram @gatewaypets ... #gpgDollop. \n\nTo view other adoptable pets from our shelter, please visit, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nGateway Pet Guardians is proud to offer a variety of mixed breed dogs available for adoption. However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

He is highly intelligent and is learning commands much faster than he should at his age.  He currently weighs 21 lbs, already.\nHe has had three boosters and has just received the rest of his vetting which is his  rabies, micro chip, fecal, health check and neuter.\nHe is crate trained and doing well with potty training but still has a few accidents.  He does play very rough for his tiny self, so a stern sibling would be a good idea for him as he is dominate during play time and needs guidance.  He will chew if not supervised, of course supervising a puppy is always a must.  He is in a foster home with a cat, other dogs and horses.  A fence for outdoor supervised playtime is also required for this active baby.\nHis location is Chattanooga, N GA. \n",

Just be sure to supervise him outside until you're confident your yard is totally secure, because he will follow his nose to wherever it may take him, and before he knows it, he won't know how to get back to his people.\n\nHe would love to find a new family in which any children are at least 16 years-old, and that understands Coonhounds like to talk, which a neighbor in an apartment, for example, may not always appreciate.\n\nCome meet Hunter today, he'll be so excited to see you!",

She is a happy, active, friendly girl who still has a lot of puppy ways! She has worked hard on housetraining and almost has it down. Everest has a ton of energy and would be happiest in a home with a yard and at least one other dog to play with. She also needs basic training and a structure as she can be overwhelming when she gets too excited. Therefore, we do not think she would be great around small kids. She lives for games and toys and is super smart! She would be an excellent hiking partner and is always up for adventure! \n\nAugusta Dog Adoptions is an all- volunteer, foster- based rescue. We take applications online and are scheduling individual adoptions in the Waynesboro, VA area during the pandemic.  A $175.00 adoption fee ($300 for puppies under 6 months old) helps us take care of all the dogs we rescue. All dogs are spayed/neutered, tested for heartworm and tick borne diseases (if old enough), microchipped, and vaccinated for rabies (if old enough), distemper/parvo and bordetella. They are also treated for internal and external parasites. Many dogs also receive extensive medical care such as dental work and major surgeries.

Rocky is a two year old, sweet, reserved boy, who is a bit on the shy side. He has never lived inside but we know he will learn fast! He has lived with lots of other dogs and is great with them. \n\nAugusta Dog Adoptions is an all- volunteer, foster- based rescue. We take applications online and are scheduling individual adoptions in the Waynesboro, VA area during the pandemic.  A $175.00 adoption fee ($300 for puppies under 6 months old) helps us take care of all the dogs we rescue. All dogs are spayed/neutered, tested for heartworm and tick borne diseases (if old enough), microchipped, and vaccinated for rabies (if old enough), distemper/parvo and bordetella. They are also treated for internal and external parasites. Many dogs also receive extensive medical care such as dental work and major surgeries.

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

            "description": "Hi, I\u2019m Carter! I am a one year old goofy, full-of-love Black Lab and Hound mix who arrived from South Carolina just in time to celebrate the holidays with my foster family. I was a stray and very thin when I got here, but I am healthy and have been putting on weight like a champ!  I am fully housebroken, I\u2019m doing well with crate training, and am eager to learn commands.  I am very treat motivated and my foster family has taught me off, sit, down, leave it, take it, wait, and other useful commands that help me have good behavior.  My foster family gives me lots of treats during training and I am getting really good at listening! \n \nI hope my forever home will be with an active family who has dog experience, one who gets my excitement and is eager to play with me, train me, and take me places.  I live with three boys (14,12,10) in my foster home and we have a great time together!  I hope my new home has children, but I can certainly live without children as long as I get to see them now and then when I am out.  I have played well with younger children and could probably live in a home with younger children as long as my new parents have experience managing a big confident puppy like me and my tendencies to get mouthy and sometimes treat children as my playmates.\n\nI live with an older dog in my foster home and we do okay together, but I think I would do better with a young, active and confident canine housemate who will play with me, give me the mental stimulation I really need, and show me the ropes in my forever home.  I could also be an only dog for the right family, as long as they are committed to getting me exercise and social time with other dogs because I LOVE to play with other dogs!  I am on my best behavior at home when I get lots of  physical and mental exercise.  I haven\u2019t been around cats so I am not sure what I think of them.\n\nI should probably have a taller physical fence (at least 4 feet), but it's not a requirement since the backyard probably won't be my main source of exercise.  I get very excited to see people, dogs, squirrels, deer, and foxes - remember I am part Hound! - and I don\u2019t have good recall so a fenced in yard will keep me safe.  I like to go on walks A LOT.  I do pretty well on my walks but I will pull at times when I see people, dogs, and smell other animals.  I am very friendly and want to say hi to everyone and I haven't met a dog or human I didn't like.   I am also a HUGE fan of dog parks where I can run around in big circles and have other dogs chase me.  My foster family also takes me to doggie daycare once or twice a week since my canine foster brother doesn't play with me a whole lot.  I am also a typical puppy when it comes to chewing so I need supervision to learn to chew the right things.  \n\nI have been working so hard since I got here to be a great puppy and I can't wait to get to my forever home!\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  While this Lab may not be available for adoption by the time you complete the adoption process, other great Labs are always finding their way into our Rescue. \n\nFor more information on this Lab, please contact INFO@BROOKLINELABRESCUE.ORG.  \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this Lab or any other Lab from our Rescue, please visit our Web site, www.brooklinelabrescue.org, for more information on our adoption process.

When they never came, Pie decided he would begin his search for a new home to call his own. He loves to learn new tricks and is perfecting his manners here at the shelter. He can often be found zooming around the play yard, tugging on his rope toys or chasing down a tennis ball. Pie has done well with dogs we have introduced him to here at the shelter but can be a bit too forward with other dogs so a meet and greet with any potential dog housemates would be a great idea. He is neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccinations. If you are interested in adopting Pie, please visit our website nafcanimalshelter.org to fill out an application!",

            "description": "Meet Daisy\n\nDaisy is a gorgeous young shepherd mix at nine months old. We rescued Daisy from a high-kill shelter. We don\u2019t know what trauma Daisy suffered, but it\u2019s apparent that she carries some emotional baggage that we\u2019re working to unwind. \n\nSince coming to us, our trainer and staff have been working with Daisy to build her confidence. She\u2019s a gentle and timid soul. She\u2019s not aggressive, but reticent to engage. Once she lets her guard down, she is an absolute love bug. She\u2019s eager to belong. Per her trainer, Daisy may make a great therapy or helper dog. Because Daisy suffered some past issues, she\u2019s intuitive to others who may be suffering or hurt. She wants to help make them feel better and will turn her full attention to that person in an effort to give them comfort. She gives and loves with her whole heart, but her heart and trust must be earned. Daisy will benefit from some gentle training. She\u2019s learning to walk on a leash and some basic commands, which in turn builds her confidence. \n\nDaisy loves belly rubs, she loves chasing a ball and will give her paw to those she trusts. She loves playing with other dogs and when she does, you can see fully her wonderful personality. Dogs give her confidence and she is often seen playing with Faith, another dog that we rescued with her.    \n\nDaisy is terrific young dog. She is going to be a wonderful companion to the person or family willing to go slow with her, gain her trust and help her forget her past. She longs to be a loyal companion. If you\u2019re able to give Daisy a forever home filled with consistency, love and patience, you will be richly rewarded. She is a gem. \n\nIf interested in Daisy, please submit an application online at: https://www.charlessmithgallhumanesociety.org/page/dog-adoption-application \nOnce an application is submitted online, you will receive an email saying your application has been successfully submitted.  If you don\u2019t receive this email within 24 hours, please check to make sure all application fields were completed or please call our shelter at 706-865-4135. All adopters must complete an approval process which involves a reference check with current/recent vet and a brief home visit if located in the immediate area. We do permit out of state adoptions. Adopters MUST come to the shelter to transport their new family member home. We do not ship nor do we transport them to their new homes. Adoption policies and application procedures are detailed at the shelter website: http://smithgallhumanesociety.org/ under tab All Adoptable Animals.\nCharles Smithgall Humane Society (CSHS) is a No kill shelter. Animals in our care remain safe with us until adopted. Resident animals are primarily owner relinquished and also accepted from local Animal Control. The facility usually is operating at capacity with a list of animals waiting for space to open.\nAdoptions and meet and greets are being scheduled by appointment only. Please call our office, email us or complete an application and someone will be in touch just as soon as they can. \nLocation: 4823 Helen Hwy., Sautee, GA 30571, Phone: 706-865-4135\nEmail: smithgallhumanesociety@windstream.net\nOur shelter in Sautee GA is located about 3 miles south of the alpine town of Helen in northeast GA.\n\n\n",

He is selective about his dog friends so he would need a slow introduction to another friendly, patient dog in the home but could also be an only pet. We will require that he meet all family members before going home with a potential adopter as he can be intimidated by new people and new situations. He 1-2 years old and about 55 lbs. He is active and fond of toys and rubs. House-trained doesn\u2019t need to be kenneled. He will need a home with a yard.\n\nHeart-worm negative, current on vaccines.

            "description": "Meet Topper\nTopper is a stunning young dog at nine months. We think he\u2019s a Catahoula/Terrier mix weighing 46 lbs. He was rescued from a high-kill shelter, along with Faith and Daisy. Topper is settling into the safety of our shelter where his personality comes out more every day. \nTopper is on the quiet side, chewing on a bone or his toys, until someone engages him to play or go for a walk. He LOVES attention and is very affectionate. He\u2019s also a silly boy, loves to chase balls and will drag his blanket around with him. He\u2019s learning some commands, but is often more interested in watching the goings on around him. He enjoys his walks and being outside. He has good energy and will do best with an active family or person. We haven\u2019t yet tested Topper with other dogs or cats, but will do so for potential adopters. Topper will make for a wonderful companion. He longs to be someone\u2019s special doggo and will be very loyal in return. \nHe is quick to capture your heart and not let go. If you\u2019re looking for an amazingly wonderful dog to welcome to your life, Topper may just be who you\u2019re looking for. \nIf interested in Topper, please submit an application online at: https://www.charlessmithgallhumanesociety.org/page/dog-adoption-application \nOnce an application is submitted online, you will receive an email saying your application has been successfully submitted.  If you don\u2019t receive this email within 24 hours, please check to make sure all application fields were completed or please call our shelter at 706-865-4135. All adopters must complete an approval process which involves a reference check with current/recent vet and a brief home visit if located in the immediate area. We do permit out of state adoptions. Adopters MUST come to the shelter to transport their new family member home. We do not ship nor do we transport them to their new homes. Adoption policies and application procedures are detailed at the shelter website: http://smithgallhumanesociety.org/ under tab All Adoptable Animals.\nCharles Smithgall Humane Society (CSHS) is a No kill shelter. Animals in our care remain safe with us until adopted. Resident animals are primarily owner relinquished and also accepted from local Animal Control. The facility usually is operating at capacity with a list of animals waiting for space to open.\nAdoptions and meet and greets are being scheduled by appointment only. Please call our office, email us or complete an application and someone will be in touch just as soon as they can. \nLocation: 4823 Helen Hwy., Sautee, GA 30571, Phone: 706-865-4135\nEmail: smithgallhumanesociety@windstream.net\nOur shelter in Sautee GA is located about 3 miles south of the alpine town of Helen in northeast GA.",

When Cassiopeia isn't chewing on her toys or watching squirrels out the window, she loves snuggling up to watch a movie. Cassie is potty trained and crate trained. At night, she sleeps in her foster mom's room. Cassiopeia would do best in a home with no small dogs or cats. Cassie would also prefer an adult-only home or a family with teenage children. Cassie would love a family that is willing to give her the time and space to let her get comfortable so she can show off her amazing personality! Cassiopeia is incredibly smart and eager to please and has shown great affinity for learning new tricks. We can't wait to find Cassie a forever family who will give her the time, love, and patience to be the amazing dog that she is. Check out this video of her being a good girl! https://youtu.be/4sak8iiaGdg\n\nWe believe Cassiopeia is an American Staffordshire Terrier mix and was born around 6/1/2019. She weighs 40 lbs. She is is fostered in a private home in Lincoln. The adoption fee is $300 which covers vaccines, a microchip, and a spay/neuter(when old enough). The adoption fee helps cover the cost of these vetting procedures. Unless the bio is marked adoption pending, s/he is still available for adoption. If youre interested in adopting this puppy, please submit an inquiry or email BraveAnimalRescue@gmail.com to ask about our adoption process (please check your spam or junk email if you do not hear back from us within a few business days). We are 100% volunteer staffed and will respond to your email as soon as possible. After you have submitted an application and been approved, we will set up a meet and greet between you and the puppy. Preference is given to applicants with a verifiable vetting history, fenced yard, and homeownership. Please be sure to follow us on Facebook and Instagram to learn more about Brave Animal Rescue and our mission.",

She was a ball of fear when we took her in.  She is slowly but surely finding her confidence in the care of one of our dog trainers.   She will need to be adopted to a home owner with a fenced yard and no other dogs as she appears terrified by them.   A cat-less home is also required.  Adoption fee 125.00.

We thank you for your patience as we work to keep saving lives during this difficult time. \n\nPLEASE VISIT THIS WEBSITE TO FIND THE ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE: http://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-forms/\n\nBolin, a MD native, is looking for his forever home! He is very social with people and other dogs but would do best in an adult only home. He can get over excited, jumpy and mouthy. He also needs a calmer type home environement where he will not be overwhelmed with too many people in his space. He would do best in a single family home/townhouse or condo that has direct access to the outside as opposed to apartment-style living. He has a strong prey drive and is not recommended to live with cats. He is part of the Go Fetch Program! \n\nAdoption Coordinator: Homeward Trails Adoption Center\nLocation: Adoption Center\nThe adoption fee for this dog is waived. This fee includes spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\nWe also provide free online workshop with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria/Falls Church/DC area. Start your new dog out on the right foot with this valuable, expert guidance FREE!\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program",

If you look in her eyes they seem sad and she bears the scars from a lifetime of neglect.  She must have had chronic ear infections to the point that her ear feels like leather, she has a dermal growth or cyst on the side of her face, her teeth are worn and she is stiff in her hips.  Delila arrived with her son Crane who is a nice guy but completely overwhelmed as he has probably never left that one back yard.  Despite her age and wear, Delilah as pep in her step.  She loves to go for walks and is happy to meet new people.  She is calm, appreciative of attention and loves a soft bed.  We hope that Delilah can find a home for the rest of her days to show her how wonderful people, soft beds and a loving touch can be. \n\nWhile Delilah loved being with her son Crane - she seems to be reactive to other dogs at this point. \n\nPlease note:\n\nAt this time, our dog kennels are open for general visitation without a prior appointment. We will, however, be limiting the number of persons in the kennel area at one time, and we appreciate your patience.\n\nVisits with cats and/or critters still require that an appointment be made in advance. To schedule your appointment, please call us at (703) 792-6465, or email us at animalshelter@pwcgov.org.\n\nAll persons will be required to wear a face mask when visiting the PWC Animal Shelter. This requirement complies with Governor Ralph Northam's Executive Order No.63 (https://bit.ly/2AnqGXd).",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Please contact Kelly (kellymbetz1@gmail.com) for more information about this pet.Bailey has special needs. Please read the complete listing before applying.Bailey has problems with food. She needs to be on a special diet, and she requires multiple small meals per day. She presents with issues similar to megaesophegus, but her barium swallow test was clear. When she came into rescue, she was emaciated from being unable to keep down her food. Her homemade diet and very small meals every 2 hours during the day are working well. She is gaining weight and keeping her food down.She also had skin and ear infections when she came to rescue. Dietary changes and a Cytopoint shot have made a huge difference for her, but in typical Frenchie fashion, it will be a lifetime battle.Bailey spent her first 4 years in a situation where she was over bred and neglected. She is now spayed, so that will never be an issue again.Bailey's inner diva is coming out. She needs to be the only dog as she is reactive to other dogs over food, toys, and even affection from her people.When it comes to personality, Bailey is all Frenchie. She loves people. She's a smart girl, but she views many commands as suggestions from her minions rather than requirements. She loves to ride in the car, and she won't miss out on a good snuggle.Bailey's ideal home will have someone around to provide her with small meals throughout the day. An adopter with brachycephalic experience is also highly desirable.\nHer adoption donation includes spaying, vaccinations, implanting of a microchip, application of flea meds and worming.\nBailey is in foster care so please complete an application at our website (www.castawaycritters.org) before meeting her. Completing an application does not obligate you to adopt; however, it is required. Applications are processed in the order received in an effort to find the best match possible for both the dog and the adopter.",

Upon his arrival, Linus was extremely thin.  We have been loving him into his full being and keeping him well-fed.  As you can see, Linus is looking good with all of that special TLC.  The boy is full of energy and will need an active lifestyle with plenty of exercise.\n\nLinus will be available to go home just as soon as he is neutered.  His mother is also available to join a new family once she has her spay.  You can see her listing here on PetFinder.\n\nThe first step in our adoption process is to request a pre-adoption questionnaire.  Email us: woof@slvaws.org\n\nOnce you are approved for adoption, you may schedule an appointment to meet Linus and Lucy at our shelter near San Luis, CO.\n\nWe practice safe COVID-19 protocols.\n\n",

            "description": "Meet Jasper! Jasper is a Pure Breed approx., 80-90-pounds, AKC yellow Labrador born January 13, 2018. He will be 3 years old mid-January. Jasper comes to us to be rehomed due to his fathers heavy traveling schedule. Jasper is a good boy that will require a home with a stay-at-home or work-from-home family member that can give Jasper the attention and time he deserves since he does experience some separation anxiety. We also require he goes to a home that has a large fenced in yard, so when he is not inside, he has a place to go lay in the sun, play or potty.\nJasper is fine around other dogs, very obedient and understand basic cues (sit, shake, paw, laydown, come). He has taken obedience classes. He LOVES people and water! He is not used to children, but appears to be fine around them but older kids or teens would be ideal if going to a family home. Jasper would also do well in a home without children and just another dog his size he can hang out with and play.\nJasper lets you take toys away, isn\u2019t afraid of storms and can be a bit stubborn; so, he will require continuous obedience training and equally important a Labbie leader that can keep well-balanced.\nJasper is full of energy so he will need a home that can give him plenty of attention; exercise routinely and another dog his size and energy level to pal around with. Jasper is housebroken and crate trained.\nIf you are interested in this boy you would be required to be the right fit and must complete our online pre-adoption application http://www.southernskiesrescue.org/adoption-application",

If you have a question or inquiry please email us at tlrapplications@gmail.com\nGOT TOYS?? Donovan was found as a stray at the tender age of 5 months. Being a black pittie mix and not a \"baby, baby\", Donovan sat in the shelter for 3 months. Unable to exercise, Donovan began to become overly frustrated. We had met and worked with Donovan on a trip to GA and knew he had tremendous amounts of potential... so... Donovan became a TLR dog. Donovan is living with our resident trainer, and spent a week at the esteemed Peaceable Paws basic manners training academy. He knows his cues well. Sit, down, targeting, he walks well on a leash. Donovan is toy and treat motivated. He is still working on his impulse control and will need a human dedicated to continuing his force free training. (His foster mom and our resident trainer will provide sessions at no charge!) Due to his exuberance Donovan will be best right now in an adult home, and likely as an only child. Please know that Donovan is EVERYTHING friendly, he just needs to continue to work on himself!! Donovan would love a friendly, high energy person to call his own. He would play, hike, run, whatever all day with his person. Or just hang out on the couch and watch TV!!!! He is still a young guy at just a year old, and hasn't had the opportunity to develop into the dog we know he can be. So, if you are looking for a special dog, who loves all things, and you don't mind squeaky toys... come meet Donovan!!!!",

She now seems interested to know everybody and past emotional concerns seem to have disappeared.\nWe have pictures and videos but have not had time to upload. Wanted to get her listed for her forever home in the new year!\nShe is her own personality, silly, funny, and we are learning the new girl she has become. Funny is the key word. She is a good watch dog and is very observant of all things in the world.\n SHE WOULD MAKE A GREAT COMPANION FOR A  VERY ACTIVE PERSON TO GO RUNNING, HIKING, CAMPING and TO THE  BEACH. She is up to date on vaccines, micro-chipped and spayed.\nWe recommend experienced handlers that can show her the world and have a great companion. She is very strong when she wants to be with a burst of zooming, playful energy.\nIf you are interested in adopting her please fill out an application today and tell us all about your family and what you wish to share with her as her new forever family. \nApplications can be found on our website www.LindaBlairWorldheart.org. Southern, CA. adoptions only due to home checks. \nView all of our dogs available for adoptions at www.LindaBlairWorldheart.org \nFollow us on Social Media\nFacebook/LindaBlairWorldheartFoundation\nTwitter & Instagram @LindaBlairWF\n",

She seems to be mostly deaf and is approximately two years old and weighs 45 pounds. She would benefit greatly having a fenced in yard and a dog companion to help with her energy and hearing needs.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Mariko, please fill out an adoption application at www.northstarpets.org & be sure to ask for MARIKO TX!",

            "description": "This beautiful jewel of a dog is Jewel! Around 10 months old, Jewel is a Lab mix, but definitely has something smaller in her breed mix because she's a pocket sized Lab at only 40 lbs. It's possible she also has some Hound in her because she talks like a Hound dog. A little skittish around new people and in new situations, once she warms up, it doesn't take long for her to find your lap. She is housetrained when she has access to a yard and would likely be happiest in a home with a yard to run around in. She loves to play with tennis balls and rope toys and enjoys playing fetch. She would love a dog sibling in her forever home to play with, but the dog sibling should be tolerant of dogs that will get up in your face like a puppy. We are also told Jewel has done okay around cats. She is smart and knows a few basic commands but is still brushing up on her manners such as puppy nibbling and her leash skills. She would prefer a family that works from home and/or is home more often that not. She is working on learning it's ok for her family to leave her home alone for short periods and will need a family dedicated to continuing that training with her. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting Jewel, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue.

He will do awesome in fun obedience classes and loves cookies and treat motivated. You will be able to go anywhere with him after training to learn all his puppy manners..

A couple weeks before Christmas, a Good Samaritan found me inside a garbage bag abandoned near the side of a road. I would have died in a bag if it wasn't for that hero. I'm so friendly and super sweet. I still have a lot of puppy in me, but can be dog selective. I'm not sure how I would do with children, so maybe older kids would be best for me. I would love to have a fenced in yard to play ball. I'm looking forward to finding my forever home!",

            "description": "Maple and her buddy, Teak, were rescued up in Riverside as strays. Shortly after being scooped up, Maple gave birth to a litter of pups, who were quickly adopted out. Since she was a shy and scared girl, Maple didn't quite have the same luck...making her the ideal candidate for foster. After a few short weeks, Maple has completely transformed - she went from cowering in the corner with her tail perpetually tucked to happily approaching her foster mama for pets and enjoying a game of chase with her foster siblings. Though still a bit nervous, she now comfortably settles in for snuggles on the couch, doling out sweet little licks to request pets. Clocking in at about 11lbs, this quiet girl will do fine with any living situation. She is crate-trained and (mostly) house-trained, with only a few accidents that are easily avoidable with a quick jaunt outside after naptime and playtime. Maple will need a doggy companion, so she can continue to learn how to be a confident pup.To initiate the adoption process for this dog, please complete our online application by clicking below.

Teak is a liiiiittle bit naughty, but in the cutest sense of the word - that's what gives him his charm! His favorite activity is darting around the house, casually moving his foster mama's house slipper when she's not looking. Teak's leash-walking skills are improving by the day, though he is still nervous when cars drive by. With his small size of 8lbs, he doesn't need a ton of exercise and would do great with apartment living. His foster mama has only ever heard him bark once. He sleeps well in the comfort of a crate and is slowly getting the hang of housetraining. Teak would do best with another dog in the home, so that he can continue to build his confidence and have a buddy to goof off with.To initiate the adoption process for this dog, please complete our online application by clicking below.

If a dog receives multiple applications, we operate on a best-fit basis, not first come first served.***\n\n**Needs a home with another dog, or people that are essentially around all the time.**\n\nJordy is a curious and rambunctious middle aged (6 yrs old) man, who has had a hard life prior to coming to his foster home. While we don't know much, we know he and his brother (Ben Lee) ended up in the shelter after his owner died. He loves his morning under his chin rubs, and a slow stroll. While he was initially very nervous when coming to his foster home, he has quickly warmed to the house's dog and people. A fully potty trained pup, Jordy also loves his crate and soft places to sleep. He can be a vocal dog when left alone or when other dogs aren't paying attention to him, so his future forever home should have another dog or a family that's home often. He loves being pet and scratched, as long as you don't start with the top of his head!\n\nJordy is neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, microchipped, has been dewormed, and is current on his monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventatives. His adoption fee is $300. If you think he could be the one for you, please fill out and adoption application on our website: www.secondchancenc.org. Thank you!",

Luna is looking for a home as an only dog for the time being. She seems to do well with other dogs that match her energy and are submissive, but doesn't mesh well with cranky/dominant dogs because she cannot hear their warnings and continues to try to play, which escalates at times.**\n\nLuna is a 16 month old, mixed breed dog of about 50 pounds. Despite being a Deaf dog she doesn't let that hold her back from tackling life. She is full of energy, curiosity, and has lots of love to give. Luna would do best with an experienced owner with skills of training a deaf dog to help channel her energy. Luna loves her backyard where she chases squirrels, digs holes and runs up and down the fence talking to next door dogs. Luna is house trained, crate trained and settles in each night with her treat ball in the crate. Luna has learned several hand commands and wears a training collar to which she responds to vibration instructions. Luna loves new human friends. She is a big supporter of snuggles and loves belly rubs.\n\nLuna is spayed, up-to-date on vaccinations, microchipped, has been dewormed, and is current on her monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventatives.

To arrange a meet and greet with a dog, you MUST fill out the adoption application so that it can be sent to the foster parent for review to determine if your home is a match for the dog. If a dog receives multiple applications, we operate on a best-fit basis, not first come first served.***\n\n**Must have another dog in his forever home.**\n\nBen Lee is truly the definition of \"\"chill old dude\"\" despite having a pretty hard life before entering the foster program. While we don't know much, we know he and his brother (Jordy) ended up in the shelter after his owner died. He loves his morning under his chin rubs, and a slow stroll. While he was initially very nervous when coming to his foster home, he has been slowly warming up to the house's dog and people. A fully potty trained pup, Ben Lee also loves his crate and soft places to sleep. He must have another dog in the house, as he's lived his whole 10 years with his brother and has never been alone. He is a shy eater and apprehensive about doors and people touching the top of his head or body, so he will need a patient family. While he's still working on being social around men, Ben Lee has shyly taken to any woman he meets. He will eventually need to live on the ground floor, as stairs are beginning to become tricky, but he will perfectly adjust to any kind family.\n\nBen Lee is neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, microchipped, has been dewormed, and is current on his monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventatives. His adoption fee is $300. If you think he could be the one for you, please fill out and adoption application on our website: www.secondchancenc.org. Thank you!",

            "description": "Marilyn's heartbreaking story :( \n\nLast summer Marilyn was found unconscious on a dirt road. She was severely under weight. Her skin and coat was very unhealthy from lack of nutrition and suspected filthy living conditons. Based on the horrific condition of her breast she was likely used for breeding. She had a serious wound on her head that indicates she was hit very hard, probably with intentions of hurting her. She was heartworm positive. Depressed, scarred and scared, you could see fear, betrayal and uncertainty in her eyes. Discouraged but not defeated. This girl is a survivor!\n\nToday Marilyn is healthy and thriving in her foster home. She completed HW treatment and has been spayed. Also housebroken, leash & crate trained. Marilyn is a super sweet, friendly, outgoing, loving \"strong\" playful girl. Craves love and attention, thinks she's a lap dog, and wants to be included in everything. Marilyn has such an adorable personality and likes to \"help\" when you take the blanket out of her kennel to fluff it up. She grabs it, pulls it back in, and fluffs it up herself. If any sweet soul deserves comfort, peace and a lifetime of love, it is Marilyn. \n\nMarilyn will make an ideal companion. She loves to snuggle on a couch and be close to her human. She gets very excited around cats so we feel that's not ideal for her forever home. Her foster family introduces her on a leash to new dogs and puppies so she is not startled. Mari-lynn as we call her, longs for a family of her own.",

She doesnt have the crazy energy of some of her Aussie foster siblings, but will watch and join in the fun when they are finally slowing down. She likes to wrestle with them and play tug-of-war or snuggle with her stuffed animals.\n\nMeredith sleeps quietly all night in her crate, is learning to walk on a leash, and is working on potty training. She has learned to sit and will hop into her crate on command.\n\nLike most puppies, Meredith can be a little nippy. She also can get possessive of her food around other dogs. Shed do best in a home where someone has time to work on puppy training and who has lots of snuggles for a sweet girl.\n\nMeredith is up to date on vaccinations, spayed, microchipped, and current on heartworm/flea and tick prevention. Also included in her adoption is a Fi GPS collar and one year of GPS service subscription. If she were to escape, as soon as she leaves the safe zone you set around your home, you are alerted\nso that you can find Meredith's whereabouts. Youll also be able to see how many steps per day she takes to ensure she gets the right amount of exercise, alongside many other features to explore in the Fi mobile app.",

            "description": "Roo is a sweet girl that was found wandering the streets in San Bernadino. It is obvious that she has not experienced positive human interaction and we believe she has been a stray her whole life. She is friendly but shy when meeting new people. She loves to be held, but is very nervous on a leash and sometimes acts like she will snap. We are sure she will be a great pet once she learns to trust again but she will need a quiet home without small children. She came in with Cody and seems very bonded to him so if you are looking for two dogs they could be a perfect pair. Please email Lauren- laurenforeverrescue@gmail.com for an application.\n\n---\n\nCome meet our dogs Saturdays and Sundays at Petsmart in Costa Mesa from 11:30-2:30. All A Home 4 Ever Rescue dogs receive a wellness exam by our veterinarian and are up to date with vaccinations. They are spayed or neutered and microchipped before they go to their adoptive families. If you would like more information please email the adoption Director muellenbergerin@gmail.com",

Although estimated to be 10-12 yrs old, he is a playful and easygoing boy who gets along great with the 4 other dogs, 3 cats and a young child in his foster home. Oliver is currently working on potty training and is doing well! However, he is a marker so a belly band is recommended for him. He does great in his kennel while his foster parents are at work and overnight to help with potty training. \n\nOliver has a few health challenges. He tested weak positive for heartworms which he is currently being treated for and he also has a significant heart murmur (grade 5/6) for which he'll need to take lifelong medication (Enalapril). He definitely doesn't let these conditions get him down though! He's all love and looking for the perfect home to share it with.\n\nDoes well with other dogs, kids, and cats.\n\nOliver will come with age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, deworming, heartworm medication, heart medication, and neutered. His adoption fee is $0, sponsored by a dog-loving family.\n\nApply to adopt at https://forms.gle/Tc2jvVQ1oYjPSwmeA.\n\nVisit our website at www.lucky13rescue.org.",

Give her a bed and she is happy. She will just stay on it unless she wants something (a drink, potty, etc.)\nShe is potty trained, she will go to the door\nShe is VERY smart. She learned how to use a dog door quickly\nShe likes car rides and does well on them\n\nIn short, for somebody that wants an indoor companion animal she is perfect. All she requires is a potty area that she has access to or can get access to with the help of a family member. Her preference would be somebody that wants to get a little exercise and take her walking but again, she is also content just laying around and playing with her tennis ball. She is pretty easy! <3",

This pretty girl was owner surrendered to a local overcrowded shelter when her family could no longer care for her. We believe Kinley is a Lab Mix. She\u2019s 14 weeks old and 15.8 lbs. She is such a pretty girl. She\u2019s your typical labby mix baby, she\u2019s playful and goofy. She is as sweet as they come and great with other animals. She will make the perfect buddy for just about any household. Kinley does great in the house and in the crate. She is utd, dewormed and spayed. \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159\n\nFOSTER APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/71694695237167\n",

            "description": "This sweet girl, Coni, came to us all the way from Mexico! Things are bad everywhere but Mexico sees some of the worst. We assist a local rescue there in getting pups from there to South Carolina so they have a better chance of finding their forever homes.\n\nConi is a great mix of play and chill. She is approximately 2 yrs old and 24 lbs. She is a short girl, perfect size! She isn't timid at all & loves to play with others.  She has good manners when it comes to waiting her turn for a treat and sharing her toys. She does seem a little territorial with her food with other dogs but that's to be expected given the situation she came from. This can be corrected or can be controlled easily. \n\nShe absolutely loves to cuddle with her person. She is doing pretty well with house training but isn't 100% yet. She is crate trained and walks fine on a leash. \nGood with other dogs but she was pretty wound up when she saw a cat. She was on leash though so it's hard to tell if she was wanting to play or chase. Not been kid tested but given her personality,  we can't imagine her not being good with kids as long as they are old enough to be respectful. \n\nIf you are interested in Coni, please email us at tskadoptions@gmail.com to ask any questions or to request an application. \n\nWe do adopt out of state as long as the adopter is willing to pick up their new baby if approved. \n\nHer adoption fee is $250 which includes:\n\n* up to date on all vaccines\n* rabies\n* deworming \n* microchip \n* spay \n* on flea and heartworm prevention \n* matching martingale collar and leash\n",

Angel has lived her whole life on a chain up until now, where she is ready to find her forever home indoors with her people. Angel is heartworm positive and will be receiving treatment, but will still be able to live a long and healthy life once she is done! Angel is very sweet and gentle and keeps a clean kennel. She is housebroken and loves to go for walks and car rides. She loves treats, laying in the sun, and being loved on! Angel would do best in a home with older kids and gets along great with other pets in the house. She is perfect for any family wanting a low activity pet that loves to be spoiled and loved on!  She is very well behaved and can be trusted to be out in the house when you\u2019re gone without having an accident or getting into anything. She loves the couch potato life and is 60lbs of love. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting Angel, please fill out an application via our website at https://therescueproject.net/adoption-application and we will get back to you via email once your application has been reviewed.  If you have further questions please feel free to reach out to us at adoptionstrp@gmail.com\n\nAngel\u2019s adoption fee is $100 and includes age appropriate vaccines, spay/neuter, microchip, deworm, heartworm testing.",

She is looking for someone or a family she go with on adventures hiking, walking or any outdoor activity.  Millie is good with kids, other dogs, and was raised in a home with cats when she was younger. She loves attention and to play fetch with anything all day long.  She is a very smart girl and is picking up the new routines in her foster home very quickly and is learning to be part of the pack after being an only dog for most of her life.  She wants to please and loves to be with her person. She is potty trained, but she needs some work on her leash manners.  She would need a home that can provide the proper exercise and mental stimulation for an active dog like her. \n\nAll of our dogs are cared for in foster homes and are spayed or neutered prior to adoption. They are also vaccinated for distemper/parvo and wormed. Dogs are shown by appointment with their foster home.  Before traveling PLEASE call for availability.

I AM NOT VERY FRIENDLY BECAUSE I WAS NOT TREATED WELL IN THE PAST. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO MY HOME OR MY FAMILY. WITH TIME I CAN GROW TO TRUST AGAIN. I AM FAIRLY SMART AND KNOW WHEN I CAN TRUST THE PEOPLE CARING FOR ME. I WOULD LIKE TO GO TO A CALM QUIET HOME WHERE I CAN TAKE ALL OF THE TIME I NEED TO RECOVER.\n\nhttp://www.wagsandwhiskerspetrescue.com/adopt.html\nThank you so much for looking into wags and whiskers for your next family member.\nAll of our pets are up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, heartworm tested if over 6 months old and will be spayed or neutered before being allowed to go home.\nUnfortunately, we don't always know the background of each dog. Some were dumped, abandoned in an empty house, left tied to a tree, picked up by animal control as strays, or simply unwanted by their owners. We ask that only serious and committed adopters apply as these dogs have suffered enough.\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet please apply to adopt at http://www.wagsandwhiskerspetrescue.com/adopt.html if the pet is still available for adoption and you are approved to adopt we will contact you to set up a meet and greet appointment.",

Autumn does well with other dogs.\nShe has heartworms and will be treated in early February. She will then be on 30 days of crate rest to recover from the treatment. Once she's successfully recovered, she will be available for adoption. Autumn will not be able to have any meet-and-greets until March. If you're interested in meeting her then, please fill out our adoption application. Autumn's cherry eye has been treated.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: www.tinyurl.com/IADRAdoptionApp\n\nIf you'd like to help Autumn while she searches for her very own family, you can sponsor her for only $19/month here: https://petbucks.org/pet/6213982126056763127/sponsor/create\n\n\n***IMPORTANT- PLEASE READ***\nThe State of Texas requires rescues to collect sales tax on any adoption fees. Our adoption fee is $175. Texas State Sales Tax will be added to that amount.\n\nDue to the nature of our adoption process, our fosters are usually only able to consider forever families within a reasonable driving distance of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. A vet reference is required, and a trial period will be completed before finalizing the adoption. Thank you for your understanding.",

Not someone  who deserves the love of sweet dogs like these 2.  Thankfully, the landlord was a caring family and also already a Lifehouse foster so they took them home.  Ike and Tina need to go together other are very dependent on each other..  They are about a year old as of Jan 1, are very sweet and loving.  They get along with other dogs, small and large, and pretty much ignore cats.  They would make a great family pet.\nOne adoption fee is sponsored so that would help to adopt out together. \nIke's adoption fee is $350.   This covers his vetting cost.  He will be neutered, microchipped, updated on vaccines, heartworm tested and dewormed.  She will also be kept on flea and heartworm prevention until adopted.\n\nTo apply for Ike go to www.lifehouse.petfinder.com and click on the link to apply online.

True to their breed, their noses are always on the ground searching for the next interesting smell. If you are looking for a cutie with ears for days to join your family, apply today. Misty's adoption fee is $400.\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

My name is Gadot, and if you bring the toys and snuggles, I will bring the smiles and love! I'm a silly and sweet lady with a medium energy level: I enjoy playing with toys but will calm down quickly when I can get a cuddle session in: nothing makes me happier than curling up in your lap for some quality snuggles! Since I love attention from my people the most, I would be very happy as your one-and-only furry friend (no other dogs or cats, please!) I am so gentle with people that I think I would do fine in a home with kids. I have lovely manners, as well: I am potty and crate trained; I will be your shadow when you are home, but I am fine relaxing during the day with my favorite antler or kong to keep myself entertained. I also adore blankets and will tuck myself in for a nap. I am eager to learn even more and would thrive with a family that will take me to training classes - I think it will be a lot of fun for both of us, and I am all about fun with my fam! Fill out that adoption application soon, OK? We have a lot of snuggling to do and I can't wait to get started!\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS, NO EXCEPTIONS:\n*ADOPTION FEE: $300\n*Be at least 21 years of age\n*Live in a 50-mile radius of Itasca, within the Illinois border\n*Have the knowledge and agreement of all adults living in the household\n*Have approval from owner of residence (written in lease)\n*Have a valid ID with current address (please provide proof of address if ID address is not up-to-date)\n*Be approved as a suitable adoptive home by Fetching Tails Foundation\n*Be prepared to make a lifetime commitment\n\nIf interested please fill out an application on our website at www.fetchingtailsfoundation.org; please make sure you fill in every required field/question or your submission will not go through. Please note that we take time to learn as much as we can about each dog in our care and our bios are our current observations; we are unable to make any guarantees on the future health or temperament of your adopted dog. Most dogs in our care come with unknown pre-rescue history and as such breed and age estimates are an educated guess.",

If he were a human, Vincent would be a food tester; he loves food above all things and would be the best judge of which is tastiest!\n\nVincent is a social butterfly who loves meeting people of all ages. He does well in public places and will typically ignore people and other dogs unless approached. Vincent rarely wants to interact with other dogs. He tolerates the other dog in his foster home but does not engage in play. Due to his high prey drive, he cannot share his forever home with small animals, including cats, or small children. Vincent rides well in the car if he is confined in a crate, has done well at the veterinarian\u2019s office, and is unfazed by loud noises, including fireworks. He has mastered basic obedience and is currently working on being away from his preferred person. Vincent does well in the crate in his foster home but is still working on staying in it calmly when left alone.\n\nVincent would thrive in a home where his person would spend most of their time with him. He would love to go on regular walks and hikes, and would also need someone willing to play daily (or moreso!) fetch games with him. Vincent would do great a high-speed sports such as agility or Fast Cat, if his new family might be interested. Vincent is a work of art and is ready to \u201cVan Gogh\u201d for you!\n\nWEST COAST ADOPTIONS ONLY\n\nMust have previous or current, purebred Malinois experience OR other high drive working breed experience\n\nOur adoption process includes- completion of an application, followed by a telephone interview.

If he were smaller and had his way, he\u2019d spend all his time in someone\u2019s lap! If he were a human, he would be that BFF everyone wants; he will do anything he can to be around you, but if you need to be away, he waits patiently for you to come back.\n\nStoli has a very sweet nature and does best with gentle handling and guidance. He loves to meet people and has done well around small dogs that share his foster home. He also plays well with larger dogs, however, does not interact well with intact males of any size. Stoli rides well in the car, has done well at the veterinarian\u2019s office, and isn\u2019t bothered by loud noises. He will sometimes react to other dogs when out on leash, especially when around another reactive dog. However, he is easy to redirect. Stoli does not like to be crated/contained when indoors, however has done well loose in the house when his foster family has been away. He will need continued work on enforcing these boundaries to ensure he is successful at maintaining respect when unattended in the home. Stoli is currently working on mastering basic obedience.\n\nStoli would do best in a home that would allow him to spend the maximum amount of time with his handler. He is quiet and respectful and does well in almost any environment. He would be fine sharing his home with other dogs, but would also do well as an only pet. Stoli\u2019s dream is to be a house/office dog, as he tires easily due to the arthritis in his rear limbs. He will jog around the yard on occasion but only if his person accompanies him. Looking for the best candidate for your team? This quiet gentleman can\u2019t wait to be your favorite new work-from-home coworker!\n\nWEST COAST ADOPTIONS ONLY\n\nMust have previous or current, purebred Malinois experience OR other high drive working breed experience\n\nOur adoption process includes- completion of an application, followed by a telephone interview. If that goes well, we will arrange for a home visit.\nAdoption Fee: $500.00. Transport along Interstate 5 (Bakersfield, CA to Bellingham, WA) is available but cost not included in adoption fee. \n\nPlease visit www.woofproject.org and fill out an adoption application located here https://www.woofproject.org/application",

The shelter was way too much for this guy, and he went into survival mode. He's has decompressed a ton since we got him, but he needs a home that will give him space and time. He needs an adult only home with no other pets. He may be okay with other dogs in the future, once he's settled, but for now he needs to be the only pet. He's house trained and loves to play fetch! He's about 65# and 4 years old. He prefers women to men, but could settle in with the right guy. \nHave questions? Send us an email: info@northcountrypetadoption.org Don't send a message through Petfinder because we don't see those. \nThe adoption application is at www.northcountrypetadoption.org",

We have never ever had a good life. We\u2019ve always lived on a chain and we were so very sad. We were taken from our owners and now we have the chance at getting the best lives. We were told we would never be adopted but the pals team thinks differently. We know there\u2019s a home out there for us we just have to find it. \n\nThe adoption donation fee is $300 which is tax-deductible and goes towards the care of homeless pets with Pals for Paws. \n\nTo expedite the adoption process you can fill out an application online at www.palsforpawsinc.com/adopt. Please note the adoption application doesn\u2019t bind you to anything. Pals for Paws reserves the right to refuse any adoption application for any reason and at any point in the adoption process. \n\nTo view our other wonderful Homeless Pets visit www.palsforpawsinc.com/pet-list ALSO be sure to LIKE Pals for Paws on Facebook at www.facebook.com/palsforpaws.inc \n\nAll Pals for Paws Rescue animals are fully vetted:\n*Spayed/Neutered\n*Groomed\n*Shots updated plus Leptospirosis \n*Micro-chipped\n*Dewormed \n*On Heart-worm prevention\n*On Flea and Tick Prevention\n* Dentals are done if needed \n\nYou only need to see your vet for a \u201cmeet n greet\u201d of your new family member and to turn in their medical records.\n\nPals for Paws is a 501(c)3 animal rescue. Every penny donated and every penny received through adoption fees goes right back into the organization. There are times when the volunteers have to dip into their pockets to help the animals. We do not euthanize because a pet is sick, heart-worm positive, or has a broken leg; we fix it all, big and small. We strive to go above and beyond when caring for and socializing our animals. We understand the importance of getting to know each and every animal available for adoption in an effort to place them in the most perfect home possible. \nIf you are looking for a particular type of dog or have special needs, We can help!

Our application process includes landlord approval and vet checks. Please make sure all of your information is current and accurate, including a valid email address and phone numbers. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and/or cancel your application. We strive to process all applications in a timely manner, but with the high volume of applications we are receiving, it is taking anywhere from 1-3 weeks.  You may be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions.  Once all of your information is reviewed and if your application is approved, you will be notified via email.  Submitting an application and receiving an approval does not guarantee you will be adopting the dog you applied for.  Once you move to the meet and greet process, you will be contacted by the foster family to further discuss the dog, and answer questions you may have, and if applicable, a meet and greet will be set up at our adoption center.   Meet and greets are only set up with approved applicants, and we require all members in the household to be present, as well as any current dogs in the home. \nCurrent Adoption Fees Are:$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nBonded pairs vary\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test, (if over 6  months) and a certified veterinary inspection. Please be aware, listed dog breeds are based on information provided and cannot be guaranteed.  Submitting an application for a particular dog does not guarantee that you will be the applicant chosen, we receive several applications for each dog. Our adopters are picked based on the needs of the dog, and the home we feel with best fit based on your responses to our application, vet information and landlord requirements.   Approved applicants not chosen for the dog you applied for, will be in active status for a period of six months.  We encourage you to watch Petfinder, Facebook and our website for upcoming dogs.
