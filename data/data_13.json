            "description": "Danny Boy is a handsome pure bred German 80 lbs. dog that is just 3 years old and a total sweetheart. He's come from a rough time his first 3 years of life, being chained to a tree with minimal human interaction. He is about 85% housebroken(likes to mark) and completely crate trained, although protective of his crate because it is his safe place. He is seriously lacking confidence in himself, but he is getting better by the day. Because of his old way of living, Danny is learning to be touched around the neck/collar area to attach a leash. He is uneasy and will grumble and growl to let you know it, but will not act on it. I've given him ample opportunities to see what he is capable of, but has never lunged at a hand. When he's free to roam, he is sweet as pie and will sit nicely when asked. He's good with kids, since he doesn't seem to see them as a threat, but I'd still say older kids would be best for him. He's simply learning to be a pet rather than a lawn ornament, so he has some kinks to work out. This boy must go to a fenced yard home and a GSD knowledgeable home. He is not to adopted as a guard dog. He will fail. Contact us at ccrtennessee@gmail.com\n\nADOPTION FEE REQUIRED. Contact ccrtennessee@gmail.com.",

I recently joined the adoptable doggy crew at Providence Animal Center's lifesaving facility from an overcrowded shelter in Florida. I am hoping you will stop by soon to meet me in person!  \n\nMy name is Shelley, and I'm around 2 years old and about 40 pounds. I'm all set to join my new family - already spayed, microchipped and up to date on vaccinations.  \n\nDon't tell the other doggos here, but I have quickly become a staff and volunteer favorite. They say that I am very sweet, gorgeous and just simply the best...aww shucks! They are still learning more about me, but the adoption center has scenic and serene grounds where you can walk me around and get to know me in person.\n\nSo, if you are interested in meeting me, please schedule an appointment here: ProvidenceAC.org/AdoptADog. My paws are crossed I will see you very soon! XOXO Shelley\"\n\n-------\nDuring your appointment, you will be able to meet a selection of pets in the Kennels or Cattery that day. New pets are arriving daily!\n-------\n\nProvidence Animal Center relies on adoption fees and donations to save pets! Adoption fees vary per pet. To find out this pet\u2019s adoption fee or for more information, please call the Adoption Center with this pet\u2019s ID number.\n\nCan\u2019t adopt? Consider fostering or donating! Visit https://providenceac.org/support-us/ for more information on how you can support the lifesaving mission!",

Chicken & Macaroni, Chillin\u2019 with my Homies! \n\nThese 2 month old lab chihuahua mixes are ready to move on from their life of fame and settle into a forever home! These guys weigh between 3-8 lbs and will be small dogs when fully grown. They have typical puppy energy, enjoying wrestling matches with each other and chewing on bones, before settling in for a nap. Chillin & Homie are the smallest of the litter. They\u2019re sweet pups who are ready for their forever family! Their adoption fee is $400.00.\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

Not exactly sure what she is but sweet, on slightly shy side, and great w/ other pups.  So, who wants to help her learn about snow?  Please apply as these pups are getting scooped up quite quickly!  \n.\nFacebook: Zani's Furry Friends ZFF (weekly adoption event info posted there)\nTwitter: zanisff \nInstagram: zanisfurryfriends\n \nDogs are spayed/neutered, UTD on age appropriate vaccines, Rabies vaxed, and microchipped (not Lyme vaxed but we seriously recommend it!)  All are in the NY/NJ area but we will adopt out of state to the purrfect home and in some cases, we can arrange transport.  Please go to our site zanisfurryfriends.org  and fill out an application \n\nMany of us (cats/dogs) will be on display on Saturdays or Sundays, weather dependent--please ask by writing us at info@zanisfurryfriends.org and following us on FB. If you are seriously interested in adopting one of us in particular, please fill out an application early Friday so that we can be sure to be there. Otherwise we decide based on other variables. Usually we are in our foster homes so this is a bit more stressful and a slightly artificial environment but we do want to be seen and find our furever homes too.\n \nPlease consider providing a home for more than one dog, especially if you are considering adopting a puppy. Dogs are pack animals and very much enjoy as well as need other dog company to learn to play, socialize and be good companion animals to people. The upside to this is that you won't feel as guilty leaving them alone and you get twice the love. Please come! And if you can't adopt, maybe you can foster or volunteer, and you can always donate!",

Chicken & Macaroni, Chillin\u2019 with my Homies! \n\nThese 2 month old lab chihuahua mixes are ready to move on from their life of fame and settle into a forever home! These guys weigh between 3-8 lbs and will be small dogs when fully grown. They have typical puppy energy, enjoying wrestling matches with each other and chewing on bones, before settling in for a nap. Chillin & Homie are the smallest of the litter. They\u2019re sweet pups who are ready for their forever family! Their adoption fee is $400.00.\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

He is working on potty training and kennel training and seems to be figuring out the dog door in his foster home. According to his foster, he is sweet, intelligent, handsome, and playful. He is good with kids, cats (but he does try to play with them, so dog savvy cats would be best) and other dogs. \n\n If you would like to meet Dipper please fill out an application at scroungydogs.com.\n\n**WOULD DO BEST IN A HOME WITH ANOTHER DOG**",

Chicken & Macaroni, Chillin\u2019 with my Homies! \n\nThese 2 month old lab chihuahua mixes are ready to move on from their life of fame and settle into a forever home! These guys weigh between 3-8 lbs and will be small dogs when fully grown. They have typical puppy energy, enjoying wrestling matches with each other and chewing on bones, before settling in for a nap. Chillin & Homie are the smallest of the litter. They\u2019re sweet pups who are ready for their forever family! Their adoption fee is $400.00.\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

Their adoption fee is $400.00.\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

You can see how hopeless he is in his eyes. He is 11LBS and is 7 years old. He was a stray and the shelter discovered he has a collapsed trachea. It is a congenital condition where there is a weakness in the tracheal rings limiting the amount of air that goes through. His exercise should be limited and we would recommend a harness always. Some clinical symptoms that can be seen with this condition are coughing/honking and fainting if too excited. Especially in the florida climate, daily walks should be extremely limited. It is highly recommended that animals with this condition are taken for routine annual wellness checks.\nIf you can help Mr. Bean and give him a great home please email us ASAP at pets@findahomegiveahome.com \n",

We are currently working on house training and crate training. She is a playful girl who is looking for a family of her own and a home full of toys. \n\nOur adoption fee includes the spay/neuter, up to date vaccines, microchip, Interstate Health Certificate, and the transport service to get the new family pet to you. \n\n Note: All dogs are located in foster homes in ALABAMA and will be transported NORTH AFTER ADOPTION. This means there is no way for a meet and greet before adoption. We try our best to give you honest personalities of the pup for you. We are more than happy to send videos, pictures, and even video chat so that you may have the connection with your pup before adoption. \n\n All pets are delivered by a licensed transporter. \nThe transportation company that we use is PETSLLC. They are well known and very professional. The link is listed, you are more than welcome to look and see what the closest drop off location is for you. \n\nhttp://www.petsllc.net/stops.php?route=9\n\n COMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES! If you are interested in adopting, the FIRST step is to complete an application!\n\n Please copy and paste the following URL for our adoption application:\n\n https://fs29.formsite.com/pickenscountypartnersforpets/form1/index.html\n\n Please be advised that our volunteers are busy rescuing, transporting, and caring for our animals. We will respond to your application as soon as possible. Upon review of your application, the rescue in Alabama will contact you, so you can ask any specific questions that you may have. \n\n If there is more than one decision maker in the home, all of them should be in agreement.\n\n We do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.",

Chicken & Macaroni, Chillin\u2019 with my Homies! \n\nThese 2 month old lab chihuahua mixes are ready to move on from their life of fame and settle into a forever home! These guys weigh between 3-8 lbs and will be small dogs when fully grown. They have typical puppy energy, enjoying wrestling matches with each other and chewing on bones, before settling in for a nap. Chillin & Homie are the smallest of the litter. They\u2019re sweet pups who are ready for their forever family! Their adoption fee is $400.00.\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

We are currently working on house training and crate training. She is a playful girl who is looking for a family of her own and a home full of toys. \n\nOur adoption fee includes the spay/neuter, up to date vaccines, microchip, Interstate Health Certificate, and the transport service to get the new family pet to you. \n\n Note: All dogs are located in foster homes in ALABAMA and will be transported NORTH AFTER ADOPTION. This means there is no way for a meet and greet before adoption. We try our best to give you honest personalities of the pup for you. We are more than happy to send videos, pictures, and even video chat so that you may have the connection with your pup before adoption. \n\n All pets are delivered by a licensed transporter. \nThe transportation company that we use is PETSLLC.

I am extremely sweet and love to play, but can be very calm as well. I don\u2019t really love to be left alone so I would do best in a home where my human is home most of the time or where there is another dog. I am working on crate training as well as walking on a leash, but my leash skills have really improved.

She loves to play with toys, sit by her humans while they cook, and curl up for a great movie on the couch. Coco is fully house trained and sleeps in her crate all night. Coco can sit on command and also walks well on a leash. She is around 2 years old and dog friendly with dogs her size though we do suggest a meet and greet. \n\nTo set up a meet and greet or inquire about a dog, please first fill out an application at https://savinghoperescue.org/contact. It doesn't obligate you, but it is the first step. We don't get to all of the inquiries but respond to all applications. Thank you for choosing to rescue!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Are you looking for a super smart female that absolutely absorbs good training sessions and really loves working to please you? Then Coco is your girl!!!\n\nCoco is a 8 month old Malinois x German Shepherd spayed female. She is just the sweetest thing, petite, moderate energy level. Like all young working dogs she needs to stay busy day to day in order to keep her mind working. This can be in the form of simple training around your house, having her as a running partner, or training her for bigger things. She already knows sit, down, shake (right and left). If you don't keep her busy you may find her trying to take a shoe or something else lying around (although she has not damaged anything while she's been with us). She loves her rope toys but to keep her busy and also to play with her brothers.\n\nWhile she has a nice off-switch in the house, she is active and loves to play and hike and run. She is great on a leash. She's also house trained (has not had one accident during the few weeks she has been with us) and learned the dog door within the first 36 hours.\n\nAs with all young dogs she is still learning her way around other dogs. She gets along well with her two foster brothers one of which is happy to wrestle with her during zoomie time and the other has taught her that not all dogs love puppies picking on them and she handles that instruction from her foster brothers well. It's doubtful that she would be good with cats. She has a lot of interest in squirrels during our runs so her prey drive may be too much for cats.\n\nCoco is crate trained and actually loves being in her wire crate. When she is ready for down time she wonders right into the crate and takes a nap. At bedtime she will head there as well (even when we try to spoil her and have her stay in the human bed).\n\nCoco hasn't been around children but would probably be fine with dog savvy kids. She may not be the best if there are really young children. She is protective of her people but with proper introductions to both other dogs and people she seems to do just fine. If you are interested in making Coco a member of your family, please reach out to your adoption coordinator. If you do not have an adoption coordinator, please complete an adoption application at www.freedomgermanshepherdrescue.org.",

Although a bit smaller she can hold her own with her big brother.\n\nMaya has a sad story; despite that she is very sweet and just wants affection. She was found on an abandoned property fending for her and her 8 puppies. We named them after shades of blue.\n\nA Mother's Love\n\nMom scared and traveling 1-2 miles to a gas station for food to bring back to her puppies. So many wanted to catch her, but she had puppies somewhere and was not having it. \n\nTracked to a horrible property, she warned her puppies and they scattered and hid. When food was left for her, she gently carried the bowls back to her puppies. She seemed to know the property, every in and out, every fence hole she navigated with ease. \n\nSlowly one to two at a time the puppies were found and brought to safety, but no chance of catching mom. \n\nEventually when the rescuers thought they had all the puppies, they tried again for mom, but it wasn't happening. Why? Because there was still a puppy on the property. \n\nWhen the final puppy was captured, she followed the rescuers to their cars and with a little patience and time, she surrendered herself by bowing her head to the savior who had been feeding her for the past 9 months.",

We are currently working on house training and crate training. She is a playful girl who is looking for a family of her own and a home full of toys. \n\nOur adoption fee includes the spay/neuter, up to date vaccines, microchip, Interstate Health Certificate, and the transport service to get the new family pet to you. \n\n Note: All dogs are located in foster homes in ALABAMA and will be transported NORTH AFTER ADOPTION. This means there is no way for a meet and greet before adoption. We try our best to give you honest personalities of the pup for you. We are more than happy to send videos, pictures, and even video chat so that you may have the connection with your pup before adoption. \n\n All pets are delivered by a licensed transporter. \nThe transportation company that we use is PETSLLC. They are well known and very professional. The link is listed, you are more than welcome to look and see what the closest drop off location is for you. \n\nhttp://www.petsllc.net/stops.php?route=9\n\n COMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES! If you are interested in adopting, the FIRST step is to complete an application!\n\n Please copy and paste the following URL for our adoption application:\n\n https://fs29.formsite.com/pickenscountypartnersforpets/form1/index.html\n\n Please be advised that our volunteers are busy rescuing, transporting, and caring for our animals. We will respond to your application as soon as possible. Upon review of your application, the rescue in Alabama will contact you, so you can ask any specific questions that you may have. \n\n If there is more than one decision maker in the home, all of them should be in agreement.\n\n We do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.",

            "description": "Born 4-23-2015, Fern is a beautiful female Miniature Poodle who has recently lost her eye sight. She will need a special family to take the time to work with her and make her home safe. Fern\u2019s ideal home would be with people who are home most of the time due to her severe anxiety. She would also do best in an only dog home with adults or adults and children 12 or older. Here is what her foster mom says about Fern, \u201cShe has learned \u201cstep\u201d to climb stairs and we are working on her ringing the bell to go outside. Fern would love a family who would take her with them on their outings and she loves car rides! Other favorite things are: belly rubs, snuggles and exploring. She will need a home where her food and water remain in the same spot, lots of consistency and a person or people who would enjoy having a little shadow. Fern\u2019s least favorite things are being left alone or put into a crate. Fern\u2019s forever home must have a very securely fenced yard. Could your home be Fern\u2019s best fit home? If so, please fill out an application at www.mikeyschance.com\n\nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter. Applications can take up to 3 weeks to process. Application submission DOES NOT guarantee approval for adoption.",

Different policies and fees may apply.\n\nMEET SNOW WHITE!!\n\nIt's me Snow White I'm approx 2 years old, and I'm a shy/timid girl who was never socialized around many humans. It takes me a bit to warm up, but once I do I love you!! I want to share with you my special day I had with a very nice volunteer.\n\nShe came to pick me up and take me out for the day to give me a break. She said I was easy to leash up, but once we got to her car I was scared, I pancaked to the ground, I really have never been in a car much, she ended up picking me up and placing me in her car, and once I was in there I was fine, she said I ride very nice in the car. I liked sitting in the middle watching out the window.\n\nWe made it to our first stop which was Papago Park, we met up with 2 other nice volunteers that brought dogs as well . I jumped out of the car I was a bit scared I didn't know what was going on, my friend said let's go on our walk and I started walking very nice on the leash, I don't pull, she says I'm so good on the leash. I enjoyed the smells all around. We passed by other people walking dogs, I never reacted to dogs or ducks. Sometimes people on the bikes would scare me when they rode up fast on their bikes behind us. I walked very well with the other dog buddies who came along, we met people. I walked up to them slowly, and sniffed them, and then I got lots of love from the humans, it was amazing!! we came across water I wasn't too sure about it, I put my paws in it and that's about it. After our 4.5 mile hike/walk we headed out to our next stop.\n\nMy friend took me to a nice place where I got a plain burger and ice cream cone. It was so yummy, check out my video. I never had one of those before. I had the best day ever! I really hope I have lots more with my new family!\n\nSnow White needs a quite family, older kids 13 and over would be best for her. Someone who has some patience to help her know she is loved and be well taken care of and spoiled. She is a very sweet girl.\n\nAll dog adoptions include the following:\n\n--Spay/neuter surgery\n\n--All current vaccinations\n\n--Microchip\n\n--Wellness exam through VCA Animal Hospitals\n\n--Access to our Behavior Helpline for the lifetime of the pet",

I'm between 1-3 years old and a chocolate lab mix-- probably mixed with pittie or Staffordshire terrier. Only a DNA test would tell!\n\nI am super sweet and good with other dogs and children. Cats? Well-- mostly likely not as I desperately want to chase them.\n\nI am VERY food motivated and know how to sit. I love to snuggle in blankets and really like my cage. Sometimes if other dogs are rough playing it will cause me to bark and get anxious. I LOVE to play ball-- especially with red balls.\n\nI can get very excited when let out of my crate but calm down quickly once I have space.\n\nMight I be your new family member?",

She is a bit vocal so she cannot be in an apartment. She comes from a rural area, so she would not do well in a busy city living.\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

            "description": "Nola is a female Shih Tzu born November 12, 2019. She is a fun puppy who loves attention. The best thing is to be with her person at all times including bed time. She gets very possessive of her person and sometimes her toys so she would be best as the only dog or possibly a large submissive dog. She is great with children but still nips and jumps for play fun so older children would be best. She knows the doggie door but still likes when you take her outside so she can keep a close watch on you. She is so great to snuggle with and watch her play with her stuffed babies. Her forever home will require a securely fenced yard with adults or adults and children over 5. Applications can be accessed at www.mikeyschance.com\n\nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter. Applications can take up to 3 weeks to process. Application submission DOES NOT guarantee approval for adoption.",

He has eyes that tell a story, one that wasn\u2019t the greatest before he became a Lucky Mutt. Elliott is a year old lab mix and weighs about 80lbs. He would do best with another large, playful pup and a home with older kiddos due to his size and strength. He\u2019s a very loving boy that would make the most loyal of companions to the right family! Looking to take a chance on love with a pup that so desperately dreams of his very own family? Please choose Elliot! You won\u2019t regret it. \n\nhttps://www.jotform.com/luckymutts/adoption-application",

            "description": "Born May 19, 2020, Coco Channel is a female Bull Terrier mix. According to her foster mom, Coco loves to spend her days next to her friends and family. She enjoys life to the fullest! Coco is very curious of her surroundings and is incredibly smart. Though, she is still learning social etiquette and how to read other dogs, she LOVES people and is good with kids. Coco enjoys chewing on any toy you give her and plays tug and fetch with pleasure. Coco is crate trained, but is still working on her potty training outside the crate. She also very much likes her walks and does pretty well on a leash for her age. We love this baby girl and are excited to see her go to a wonderful, active family! Coco Channel's forever home will require a secure 6 foot fence with adults or adults and children over 5. Applications can be accessed at www.mikeyschance.com\n\nAll large and/or active dogs will require a full fenced (6ft) secure yard. \nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter. Applications can take up to 3 weeks to process. Application submission DOES NOT guarantee approval for adoption.",

She will wrestle with a dog and immediately turn to play tug of war with another. She's working on potty training. She is a total sweetheart, and loves belly rubs. She gives sweet kisses and nuzzles in to be snuggled when she's tired. She will require a secure 6 foot fence with adult or adults and children over 5. Applications can be accessed at www.mikeyschance.com \n\nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter. Applications can take up to 3 weeks to process. Application submission DOES NOT guarantee approval for adoption.",

The racing stripe down my back is a non-itching variety of Alopecia most likely caused by a nervous condition. Some say it makes me look edgy. I get so nervous about things that my whole body trembles. But, with some TLC, I'll be your biggest protector and BFF.\n\nLet's get this straight right from the start I'm a house dog and I don't walk on a leash! I enjoy backyard excursions and would love to keep you company out there. I'm working through some insecurity issues. New environments, car rides, socializing with people and other animals is all terrifying for me, but with a little practice every day, I think I might actually learn to like all of those things.\n\nI'm kind of potty trained as long as you take me outside every few hours, but I expect you to read my mind. I can get inside using the doggy door, but haven't quite got the confidence, YET, to go outside on my own. I prefer to go outside together.\n\nMy favorite place to sleep is next to you. As long as I go potty before bed, I will sleep through the night. I would like to make friends with a cat, but they're super moody so I tend to keep my distance. I know some commands, but I don't follow them. How can I \"come\" and \"sit,\" if I don't trust you, yet. With some patience, kindness, and understanding, eventually, I will do as you wish. Except for the leash thing - that freaks me out!",

She likes attention but also seems to enjoy some alone time.  Her favorite place is the couch, maybe because it\u2019s near the fireplace and toasty!\n\nInitially she was very scared but she\u2019s calmed down a lot once she adjusted to her new envrioment. (It\u2019s probably pretty hard being a stray when you only weigh 9 lbs!) She is still frightened by loud noises and seems leery of men.\n\nWe believe she was someone\u2019s pet at some point, since she is spayed and trained to use the pee pad. It only took her a week to get back to being fully house trained.\n\nBitsy is NOT a barker. She has an unusual little bark that you won\u2019t hear very often. She is OK with other dogs, even if they\u2019re large. She has been very interested in the outdoor cat; I think she\u2019s happy to finally meet someone who\u2019s more her size!\n\nThis sweet girl just needs some kindness so she knows she\u2019s safe.  She\u2019ll be a loving addition to someone\u2019s home!",

He loves people and plays nice with the dogs he has been paired with. We always recommend a meet and greet if you have other pets. He does need some more leash time as he was never really taught how to be a dog. He\u2019s very mellow and easy going and would make a great addition to any family.  HE IS JUST A BIG BABY!!! Buddy had a terrible start to life and we would love to see him have his happy ever after.\n\n If interested please fill out this adoption application and we will get back with you. \nhttps://form.jotform.com/202108953737155",

Older kids as he is a puppy, so children who understand puppy antics!  If you are interested in learning more about Sparky, please complete an application and then reach out to Roxy@bigfluffydogs.com\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

            "description": "\"Have you ever seen a dog as adorable as me?! Can you believe I\u2019m homeless and am waiting for a wonderful person or family to adopt me? Great dogs like me end up in animal shelters every day- I know, it\u2019s so hard to believe but it\u2019s true!\n\nMy name is Ripley, and I just joined the adoptable doggy crew at Providence Animal Center from an overcrowded shelter in Florida. I'm around 4 months old and 28 pounds (& still growing). I'm all set to move right into your heart & home today - already neutered, microchipped & have age appropriate vaccinations. \n\nThe staff would love to match you with your new best friend forever - and hopefully that's me! If you are interested in meeting me in person, please schedule an appointment here: ProvidenceAC.org/AdoptADog. My paws are crossed I will see you very soon! XOXO\"\n\n-------\nDuring your appointment, you will be able to meet a selection of pets in the Kennels or Cattery that day. New pets are arriving daily!\n-------\n\nProvidence Animal Center relies on adoption fees and donations to save pets! Adoption fees vary per pet. To find out this pet\u2019s adoption fee or for more information, please call the Adoption Center with this pet\u2019s ID number.\n\nCan\u2019t adopt? Consider fostering or donating! Visit https://providenceac.org/support-us/ for more information on how you can support the lifesaving mission!",

A dog who is outgoing and confident and can be a great mentor to Dorothy.\n\nCATS: TBD\n\nCHILDREN: No\n\nADOPTION DONATION: $475.00\n\nHEALTH: Dorothy is spayed, microchipped, flea treated, dewormed, and is current on vaccines.\n\nYour adoption donation goes toward offsetting the cost of this vet care as well as other incidental costs of care.\n\nHISTORY: Dorothy and her sister was saved by our friends at Go Rescue Korea from a dog meat farm. They flew to the US to find a better life!\n\nNOTES FROM FOSTER HOME: DOROTHY is a wonderful and sweet girl. She can be initially a little shy at first but loves people. One of her favorite things is jumping up for hugs. So many hugs!\n\nShe likes to cuddle and loves to sit by you and be in your company.\n\nShe is quiet and confident and independent but also likes friends and gets along well with fur friends.\n\nSHE CAN JUMP! She is a great jumper so if the fence is easily scaled, she can climb up and get out. She's not one to trust to leave unattended in your yard, as these dogs can be escape artists.\n\nAll dogs adopted from Motley Zoo come with a leash and Martingale collar (or a harness, if necessary), depending on each dog's particular needs. Each dog also receives a \"Tour Gear Bag\" full of brochures, coupons, and supplies for your new pup!\n\nABOUT MOTLEY ZOO:\n\nWelcome to Motley Zoo Animal Rescue! We are a rock and roll themed, volunteer-run, foster based, 501(c)(3) non-profit animal rescue organization based in Redmond, WA.\n\nMotley Zoo is a FOSTER BASED organization, which means our rescue animals are cared for in private foster homes (or partnering pet stores) where the animals receive one-on-one care and attention in a home environment until permanent placement is found. We do not have animals available for casual viewing and same day adoption. Due to the volunteer run structure and decentralized/ virtual nature of a foster based group, an approved application is required to make an adoption appointment for any of our animals.\n\nIf you are interested in one of our Adoptable Roadies, please email adopt@motleyzoo.org and request an adoption application (the auto-responder also has a link to our application). We will work toward getting you approved as an adopter so that we can set a time for you to meet your new best friend!\n\nMotley Zoo also runs \"Rock Star Treatment Dog Daycare\" in Redmond, WA where proceeds from this service, help support our rescue's vet budget- however, this is NOT a shelter. For more information about daycare or training, check out www.rockstartreatment.org.\n\nPlease visit our website www.motleyzoo.org for more information!\n\nThanks for considering adoption- we look forward to helping you find your best match in a furry friend.\n\nRock on-\n\nThe Motley Zoo Crew",

I'm a sweet girl and I currently weigh around 63 lbs. \n\nClick here and here to see me in action!\n\n- Housebroken\n- Will go in her crate at night to sleep, but is fearful of her crate any other time. We have done some work on this, but right now she only stays and goes in her crate to sleep overnight. She destroyed a wire crate due to the separation anxiety and needs to relearn it's safe space at all times of day.\n- Knows sit, down, shake, focus (eye contact), sit from a down, and we are currently training sit-stay, down-stay, place, and her recall. Coco has also done some training about loose leash walking but that is still a work in progress. She does wear a front clip harness on current walks.\n- Good with other dogs especially off leash. She has some barrier frustration at not being able to get to or play with dogs on a leash.\n- Best in a home without cats\n- Loves stuffed and frozen Kongs as well as any digestible bones/ beef braids\nTo adopt this dog, or any OPH dog, fill out the simple online application at https://ophrescue.org \nOperation Paws for Homes, Inc. (OPH) rescues dogs of all breeds and ages from high-kill shelters in NC, VA, MD, and SC, reducing the numbers being euthanized. With limited resources, the shelters are forced to put down 50-90% of the animals that come in the front door. OPH provides pet adoption services to families located in VA, DC, MD, PA and neighboring states. OPH is a 501(c)(3) organization and is 100% donor funded. OPH does not operate a shelter or have a physical location. We rely on foster families who open their homes to give love and attention to each dog before finding a forever home.",

He is a handsome little guy who is into everything. Mando was born to a litter of 12, we were made aware they needed rescue and 5 came to us (unsure what happened to the other 7). They have not had a mother for some time from our understanding (around 4 weeks of age) so there is some vital socializing missing. We are working to get the mother fixed as this is her second litter and she is a tripod and really doesn't need to be bred repeatedly every year. Mando is a young puppy that came to rescue very small for his age. He will need a lot of socializing and exposure to make up for lost time. An adopter needs to ensure he is provided with a healthy environment to grow up in so that he is a well adjusted adult! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If interested in meeting and potentially adopting, please read the adoption requirements and complete the adoption application located at forbellessake.org. Once processed and approved a meet and greet can be scheduled and if a match an adoption can be finalized at that time. FBS standard adoption fee is $175. All residents are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped, and treated for any known medical needs. Breeds are best guess. Housetraining is not guaranteed but crate training is worked on with all residents. A secure physically fenced yard is required.",

And here is a list of things I NEED: LOTS of walks, which means leash training, LOTS of toys, so I can chew my own stuff, LOTS of socializing with people and other animals, that way we can both have lots of friends, LOTS of training, which requires LOTS of patience, but pays off when you realize it makes me so much easier to live with and last but not least, LOTS of Love.   Yeah, I admit it, I'm a lot of work at first, but trust me, we'll both find it to be worth the effort.  Only those who can handle all of the above and intend to keep me with them no matter what life may bring need apply.  \n\nAnimals in our program are housed in Foster homes. Please contact us @ 208-232-0371, leave a message and a Volunteer will get back with you as soon as possible, with the Foster Parent's contact information.\n\nVisit with this animal and our other fosters during our Adoption day, the second Saturday of each month @ our building, located @ 850 Barton Rd., Pocatello, ID 83204",

What a gorgeous girl she is, friendly, playful, goofy and affectionate, she's ready to become your new best friend.\n\nDinah is a smart girl, who is very treat motivated and keen to impress her people. She knows her commands very well, Iike sit, down, paw, and will to go to her bed when told. She lives for affection and praise, and you can see her little mind working away to make you proud.\n\nShe's a playful girl, and although she enjoys playing with toys on her own she is so much happier having a friend to play with her. She has a good amount of energy and will happily play fetch for as long as you can keep up!\n\nDinah is house-trained and happy to spend time in her crate, but she does need some work on her leash skills. Or lack of skills! She does pull on the leash and can be a little excitable when she sees other dogs out and about. We think directing her focus on treats, combined with ongoing training, Dinah is smart enough to learn fast and improve her manners. She has interacted well with other large dogs. \n\nIn the home she's very quiet, well behaved and snuggly. She will come over and put one paw up on you to request some extra love. She loves to lay around and relax with one eye open, watching you around the house. \n\nOverall Dinah is a very sweet, affectionate, well behaved girl who just needs a little training to make her an even better and happier, well rounded dog. This includes slow introductions to new environments, people, and animals - she can get overwhelmed if presented with too much stimulation all at once! Dinah will thrive in an adult-only home (no children under 16), with or without other large dogs, and *may* be able to integrate with a confident cat (although we aren't certain on this). \n\nDinah is 1 year old, 50 lbs, and ready for her forever home! Please visit www.liveloveanimalrescue.org to fill out an adoption application.",

She is a dream to walk on leash and could easily be walked by an elderly person. Mia has good house manners, is a low energy dog, and would do well living with cats. She is house broken, rides well in the car, and knows basic commands. Mia is a loving dog that bonds quickly with her person and would do best with a companion who can be with her most of the time. Given Mia's quiet, low energy demeanor, a quiet home would be ideal for her. Mia must meet other dogs in the home prior to adoption. Please contact foster mom Michelle Fox at 510-589-7341 for more information. Adoption fee is $150, plus $25 for an annual dog license, if you live in Jackson County.",

Please watch your spam folders as an application will be attached and this sometimes places it in there. \n\nShe is missing a hind leg, but it's not slowing her down. \n\nShe is REQUIRED to be the only dog in the home due to resource guarding. She does fine outside of the home in dog parks and walks but in the home, it is hers. Training could fix this but we just require her to be alone with her humans. Also no small children that could reach for food or toys. \n\nFoster is ready to speak to the adopter and make sure it is 100% good fit. \n\nHIS/HER adoption fee is $550 USD and that will pay for TRANSPORT, all his/her shots up to date, neutered/spayed, microchip and rabies.\n\nPlease e-mail MuttsAndMeows@Mail.com for an adoption application. \n\nThis dog is currently in the Houston Texas area.  Once the application is approved and adoption fee paid, transport will be arranged.\n\nBecause this adoption will be without meeting the dog first, we will need to try to be extra careful that everyone (including you) think this will be a good fit.  We will try to give you as much information about the dog as we can.  Unfortunately, many are fresh from the shelter and we don't know much about them yet. \n\nLike us on Facebook - search Mutts & Meows - and help even more pets find loving homes.",

Prospective adopters must be able to travel to San Antonio to complete the adoption process. Please apply online at http://texasgreatdane.org/adoption-application/ **\nChilo is a handsome 8-month-old Hound blend. He was found as a stray in a small town in Mexico where he faced a sad life of starvation and abuse. A Good Samaritan in that area stepped in to change his fate and contacted our rescue for assistance. Chilo was immediately transported to Texas and hospitalized because he had contracted both distemper and parvo. He beat the odds by surviving two deadly diseases. As a result of the distemper, Chilo does have a minor neurological twitch that does not impact his daily activity level. Chilo also did test positive for ehrlichia which is a bacteria infection caused by a tick bite and he is completing a 30-day course of doxycycline. Chilo is initially shy but once you offer him treats, he quickly displays his affectionate and loyal nature. He is an active and playful boy but will need leash training. His ideal owner would lead an active lifestyle and include Chilo in daily walks, hikes, etc.\nPlease understand you are committing to providing a good home for his entire life (up to 15+ years or more.)\nYou must be committed to housebreaking, age-appropriate enrichment and exercise, leash training, grooming needs, and positive socialization.\nHis adoption fee is $175. This includes his neuter surgery, rabies vaccination, Nobivac Canine 1-DAPP vaccination, Nobivac Intra-Trac 3 vaccination, Drontal Plus, IDEXX SNAP 4Dx Plus Test, Tri-Heart Plus chewable tablet, 24PetWatch microchip, leash and collar, and a trial offer for 24PetWatch Pet Insurance.\nPlease be aware that puppies and small breed dogs do get adopted quickly so interested parties are encouraged to apply online at www.saspca.org.\nPlease ensure your application is complete before submitting. We do verify property ownership, landlord references, apartment/HOA restrictions, veterinary references, and criminal histories.\nOur adoption events are held each Saturday at Petco located in the Northwoods Shopping Center at 18138 San Pedro Ave, San Antonio TX 78232. Event hours are 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.\nAdditional questions may be directed to sagdinfo@gmail.com.\n** This dog is in a foster home in San Antonio, TX.

Secure fenced yard ideal.  \n\n?\n\nLollie is an eight old Shih Tzu mix. She came to CHR in rough shape but has made a complete turnaround in 2 months. \nShe is housetrained but needs a potty break every 4 hours during the day. She is also pee pad trained. Lollie loves to please her pet parents. She\u2019s really a great little girl. Very loving and sweet. \n\nLollie loves to play with other dogs but can start fights over guarding her foster mom. We think it\u2019s better to play it safe and place her in a home without other dogs.  \nLollie has dry eye in her right eye, which requires daily drops.  Also, she has a cherry eye. She is scheduled to have surgery to fix the cherry eye in March.  \n\nLollie came to CHR with a really bad skin infection. She will still need a bath every week. \nAlso, Lollie is on a special diet for her skin.  We are asking that her new owner to continue her on the high-end diet($90 a month) or a home-cooked diet, which cost much less. We can discuss all of this on a call once you apply to adopt her. \n\nLastly, Lollie came to CHR very \u201cmouthy\u201d when being handled.  She has made amazing progress, but she still may be nervous once she is moved to a new home. CHR will provide training to you while she adjusts to her new home. \n\nBecause of this, Lollie must go to an all adult home. Watch this video, and you will see how cute and sweet Lollie is.   https://youtu.be/s0d6CVbPaz0",

She hopes to find a loving family to share some fun adventures! Will you cuddle up with this girl by the fireside in her new home?\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

            "description": "~Good news for those of you looking for your one true love, Cupid's arrow struck early this year! Meet Ferris, a four month old southern gentleman. With a big doe eyes, super soft fur, and the most perfectly adorable ears! Perfect for your Valentine's Day snuggles, he's obsessed with kisses and hugs, and has the perfect wiggle butt dance moves for all your Valentine's Day dance parties. He's learning to have good boy manners, and sleep like a lamb overnight in his crate. Ferris is already a fan of the ladies, getting along with his two foster doggy sisters, one big and one small, and his three foster human sisters. he's already stolen the show and the hearts of everyone he's met since arriving in PA.\n\nPlease email us at AlmostHome4Dogs@yahoo.com to find out if Ferris is the right pup for you! (Local adoptions preferred - Philadelphia and tri-state area [South Jersey and northern Delaware] only.)\n\nNOTE: Most puppies do best in the company of an older dog who can teach them \"doggy manners,\" so homes with at least one other dog usually will be given preference in puppy adoptions. Please read Suzanne Clothier's wonderful article, \"It Takes a Pack to Raise a Puppy!\"\n\nPLEASE READ BEFORE CONTACTING US! We are NOT a shelter: All of our dogs live in private homes with foster families. Come and meet the Almost Home dogs and their fosters at our Meet & Greet events, where you can learn more about our wonderful dogs from the people who live with them, find out which dogs are on their way and when they'll arrive, and fill out an application to adopt or foster.\n\nWe cannot adopt to homes where electric-shock fencing systems or training collars are used. For more information on the dangers of electric-shock collars, please visit banshockcollars.ca/studies.php and http://www.hollysden.com/say_no_to_shock.htm (scroll down and click on the \"Invisible Fencing Systems\" link).\n\nWe do not have an online adoption application; to request an application, e-mail us atAlmostHome4Dogs@yahoo.com. To speed e-mail processing time, be sure to note the name of the dog you are inquiring about in the Subject line. For Meet & Greet times and locations, visit our home page, where you also will find information on our adoption process and fees.\n\nFOSTER FAMILIES ARE LIFESAVERS!! Can you open your heart and home for a few weeks to homeless shelter dog? Remember, by fostering a dog, you save TWO lives - that of your foster dog, and that of the dog who takes his place in the shelter! Come to a Meet & Greet and find out if fostering is for you - there's no reward quite like the feeling that you've saved a life ... or two!",

She's got shorter legs and size like a beagle but a face of another...boxer possibly? She's a great, energetic, playful, happy girl who needs to find a home of her very own. She came to us as a stray so we don't know much about her beginnings. We are just going to assume she's not lived in a home and isn't house trained but who knows! She's smart and can surprise us =)\n\nShe is currently in Fort Worth, TX but will making the trek to Olympia, WA scheduled to arrive on Saturday Feb 6th  IF she is pre-adopted meaning you need to get your app in, approved and pay the adoption fee to secure her.  Her adoption fee is $450 which covers her spay, vaccinations, HW testing, chipping, health certificate and transport fees. All our dogs come with a 30 day, money back, trial period to make sure they are the right fit in your environment. Tall Tails Rescue has a commitment to these dogs for their lifetime and we hope you do too! If you are thinking of adopting any of our dogs contact us today!

She is a beautiful little girl. Omera was born to a litter of 12, we were made aware they needed rescue and 5 came to us (unsure what happened to the other 7). They have not had a mother for some time from our understanding (around 4 weeks of age) so there is some vital socializing missing. We are working to get the mother fixed as this is her second litter and she is a tripod and really doesn't need to be bred repeatedly every year. Omera is a young puppy that came to rescue very small for her age. She will need a lot of socializing and exposure to make up for lost time. An adopter needs to ensure she is provided with a healthy environment to grow up in so that she is a well adjusted adult! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If interested in meeting and potentially adopting, please read the adoption requirements and complete the adoption application located at forbellessake.org. Once processed and approved a meet and greet can be scheduled and if a match an adoption can be finalized at that time. FBS standard adoption fee is $175. All residents are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped, and treated for any known medical needs. Breeds are best guess. Housetraining is not guaranteed but crate training is worked on with all residents. A secure physically fenced yard is required.",

She is very thin and at full weight will be a big girl. She is a total doll baby, she would make a great addition to any family. She has proven friendly with male and female dogs but we always recommend a meet and greet if you have other pets. She is very loving and affectionate. She could use a little more leash time as she was never actually trained, other than that she is perfect. She is a precious girl who just needs a loving family to show her not all people are bad. \n\nIf interested in adoption Hazel please fill this out and someone will get back with you. \nhttps://form.jotform.com/202108953737155\n",

            "description": "Meet Jackson! Jackson is a 40lb terrier mix and approximately 2 years old. He is super sweet and his favorite thing to do is snuggle with his people. \n\nJackson is great with the kids and dog in his foster home. He has loved on every guest that enters his house and greets them all with a wagging tail. He loves to play outside in the yard and run with his foster dog sister. He would stay out there for hours if allowed! He walks great on a leash and is always ready for a nice walk. \n\nJackson is working super hard on his potty training and is almost there. He sleeps very soundly through the night in his crate and does well in his crate when his foster family is not home. His foster family likes to tell him that his heart is as big as his head. Kids or another dog would be a bonus in his forever home, so he has someone to play with. Jackson is very eager to please and would do great in any home.\n\nOur standard adoption fee is $375 cash or check and $385 credit card ($10 processing fee). .  It includes spay/neuter when age appropriate at our participating vets, age appropriate core vaccinations, fecal testing, deworming, flea and tick preventative,1st vet visit at one of our participating vets, and micro-chipping. \n\n\nWe must have an application, conduct a phone interview, and meet your entire family to approve an adoption. Please email adopt@safehavendogsIL.org for an application or additional details.\n\nPlease note that the breeds and sizes posted in this biography are educated best guesses and are not guaranteed.\n\nPlease consider becoming a foster home while you search for your new best friend. We need foster homes - pounds are overflowing with puppies and adult dogs that are at-risk and need help. We can only rescue as many as we have foster home commitments. Fostering is a rewarding experience for your family.",

Here are a few things about me: \n\n-I'm COMPLETELY potty trained, I've never had an accident! \n-Oh my goodness, my foster mom thinks I deserve a PhD in walking on leashes! I never pull and always walk by your side. It's easier to handle me than my 13lb foster fur-brother! \n-I can be intimidated by stranger dogs, especially those bigger than me, but once I learn they are friendly I open up. \n-I have the perfect amount of playfulness in me. I'm not too energetic, but when my 13lb foster fur-brother wants to wrestle, I will entertain him. Despite being trippled his size, I know to be nice and gentle when I wrestle with him, and let him jump all over me. \n-My absolute favorite thing to do is sunbathing, but sometimes I can't decide whether I want to be inside with the humans or out under the sun, but I'll scratch the door to let you know. \n-Crates are not my favorite, but I settle down quickly. \n\nOverall, I'm a really smart, loving, and nice girl. My ideal family would be one that has a yard for me to sunbath in, and has another dog for me to wrestle with. I am my foster family's first large foster, and they joke about how I'm the perfect 'gateway big-foster' dog. My foster family doesn't have cats nor children, so they are not sure how I will do, but based on my temperament they think I will be ok.\n\nLaila is a Female Pit Bull Mix that we estimate to be around 3 years old and weighs 45 lbs.",

She is housebroken and gets along with dogs she meets at the dog park, which she enjoys, as well as walks through the neighborhood. She has not been tested with cats while in our care. She likes relaxing with her foster family while inside and just chilling. I guess she might even be a couch potato! Sassy had a tooth removed and has not been eating well food due to that. She seems to prefer wet food. Sassy has one blue eye and one that is not blue, but rather interesting. Do you have room in your heart and home for a girl like her?\n\nEstimated DOB: 6/1/15\n\nAdoption fee: $200 (6% KY sales tax included)\n\nWe would love to hear from you! To inquire about this dog, please contact us via this site, visit our website sc4paws.org to see a full bio, or visit sc4paws.rescuegroups.org/forms/ to fill out our adoption application.\n\nImportant: Our dogs reside in foster homes. Please fill out our adoption application if you would like to meet one of these special dogs!\n\nSCHS Veterinary Care and Services for Dogs (5 months of age and older): Prior to being placed for adoption, all dogs, at a minimum, receive a veterinary exam, are neutered/spayed,\ntested for heartworms and Lyme disease, and treated for internal parasites, flea/tick preventative\n, current on booster(s), bordetella and rabies vaccinations.\n\nSCHS Veterinary Care and Services for Puppies (under 5 months of age):\nPrior to being placed for adoption, all dogs\n\n, at a minimum, receive a veterinary exam, are neutered/spayed\n\n, and treated for internal parasites, flea/tick preventative\n\n, current on booster(s),\n\nand rabies vaccinations.

He adores any kind of attention, enjoys snuggling with his fosters, and gets along easily with children and other dogs, large and small. Always friendly, always joyful, he's also exceedingly playful and is always ready for the next great adventure. Enthusiastic and energetic, he loves long, brisk walks, games of fetch and tug-o-war, rope and stuffed toys and Nylabones. Highly food and praise motivated, he loves all treats, accepting them gently, and being eager to please, is now learning \"sit\", \"stay\" and \"come\", and is both leash and housetrained. Possibly the best hiking partner around, Blitzen will thrive in a loving and active home committed to completing his education and keeping him physically satisfied fur-ever.\n\nAnimal Rescue of the Rockies believes that every pet should find a wonderful, caring home. To ensure each pet finds the best possible home, we ask that you fill out our Adoption Application so we can learn more about you and your household.

            "description": "Check out this handsome boy! Meet Kodiak! ?\n\n\"Kodiak is our little observer. He tends to hang back and watch everything that is going on. Once he has deemed everything good to go, he will happily pounce on one of his siblings and play. You can tell that this boy is smart and I swear he seems to have a \"thinking face\" on sometimes. He does have a more laid-back temperament compared to his siblings. He also seems to be a bit more independent.\"\n\nKodiak is a 6 week old male Great Pyrenees mix. He currently weighs about 10lbs. Our best guess is he will top out somewhere in the 80-90lb range.\n\n-Kodiak has been with us since birth. His mom Varity came to us heavily pregnant. We are unsure of who his dad was. Varity's former owner believes it was a male Pyr mix who visits sometimes but doesn't know for sure.\n\n-Kodiak is still a baby. This means his new family needs to be ready to potty train him, work with him on basic manners, and have a lot of time on their hands to help raise him.\n\n-Kodiak will need proper socialization. His new family will need to expose him to a little bit of everything. Such as walks, car rides, public outings, visitors, other dogs, etc.\n\n-Kodiak will not be ready to go home until February 22, give or take a couple of days. Anyone applying to adopt him needs to be able to bring him home close to that date.\n\n-Kodiak is being fostered in Kiowa, OK. We do not send our dogs on transports or ship them. This means his new family needs to pick him up, even if they are out of state.\n\nWell, you made it this far. Time for the big question? Will Kodiak be your newest family member? If so, you can apply to adopt him at https://www.pyrpawsandfluffytailsrescue.com/adoption-app\n\nHis adoption fee is $275. That includes two sets of puppy shots, bordetella, and rabies. He will be micro-chipped, have a fecal done, be de-wormed, be spayed/neutered, and will be current on my heart-worm and flea/tick prevention.",

            "description": "Nemo is an incredibly sweet but timid boy. He weighs about 12 lbs. He is a terrier mix. Nemo lived his entire life in a backyard with none of his basic needs met. We also believe he was abused -- he is extremely fearful of leashes, and has a fear of certain men (not all). Once settled in, Nemo is very playful and affectionate--it takes him time to get to that point--his forever home will need to understand that and have patience with him. Nemo is a gentle boy. He deserves a phenomenal family that will give him love, attention and guidance. Nemo is good with kids and love to have a confident dog in his forever home to help lead the way. If you are interested in this handsome sweetie please fill out an adoption application at www.casadeloveanimalrescue.org \n***Adoption fee $350\n***We are unable to answer inquiries asking if he is still available",

He loves to receive and and give big hugs to everyone he meets. Scooby is a high energy dog and would love to solve mysteries with you and all your friends. He plays well with other dogs and likes to tumble around with them if he can! Scooby walks well on a leash but can be curious to things he sees and will try to get a whiff of the thing he sees, how can he not?! Scooby also likes to sing, and will give a good \"aaoooo which is on perfect pitch but maybe might not be appreciated by neighbors that share walls with you. Scooby hasn't been tested with kids or cats yet. Since he's still very young, Scooby still has a puppy tendency of holding his person's hand in his mouth when cuddling-and if your hand is sweaty, even better!!\n\n He's solid muscle and would love to stay toned with someone who's help him burn off his energy and give him the attention he asks for!

Mom was listed as a shiba inu mix, although we do not know for sure what she is. A pure mutt! Dad is unknown.

Dante originally came to the shelter as a lost boy in March of 2020 and thought he had found his forever home when he was adopted in May 2020. That home even treated him for heart worms. Sadly his person had to move and could not find a place they could both go and Dante was returned to the shelter 01/31/2021.  Dante is said the be house trained. He will sit when told and is great on leash. He hopes he can turn his frown upside down and find a new home very soon. It would be best if Dante was an only pet and he has not been around kids. He is current on vaccines, neutered, micro-chipped and tested negative for heart worms. Dante is waiting to meet you in run 827 and his ID# is 627121. \n Please note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

And do they say \"Amora\" on them? That's MY name! (scrunches eyes tight) Please don't let this be a dream...please don't let this be a dream...\n\nI recently joined the adoptable doggy crew at Providence Animal Center's lifesaving facility from an overcrowded shelter in Arkansas. I am hoping you will stop by soon to meet me in person!  \n\nI'm around 5 years old and about 58 pounds. I'm all set to join my new family - already spayed, microchipped and up to date on vaccinations.  \n\nThe staff & volunteers are still learning about me, but Providence Animal Center's adoption center has scenic and serene grounds where you can walk me around and get to know me in person.\n\nSo, if you are interested in meeting me, please schedule an appointment here: ProvidenceAC.org/AdoptADog. I hope to see you very soon! XOXO\"\n\n-------\nDuring your appointment, you will be able to meet a selection of pets in the Kennels or Cattery that day. New pets are arriving daily!\n-------\n\nProvidence Animal Center relies on adoption fees and donations to save pets! Adoption fees vary per pet. To find out this pet\u2019s adoption fee or for more information, please call the Adoption Center with this pet\u2019s ID number.\n\nCan\u2019t adopt? Consider fostering or donating! Visit https://providenceac.org/support-us/ for more information on how you can support the lifesaving mission!",

Kid test went really well.Thank you for your interest in adopting a pet from Guardians of the Green Mile Inc. We are a group of individuals that have come together to save the lives of animals that are in danger of being euthanized. We raise funds to fully vet the animals and to provide them with a stable home until they are adopted. All of the dogs in our Rescue are in Foster homes while they are looking for their forever family. The only time we put a dog in boarding is for a Foster to go on vacation if another Foster is not able to care for them. We appreciate your taking the time to fill out the application to adopt one of our Guardians of the Green Mile pets. The questions that we ask are to only find the right fit for all of our dogs and the families that will be adopting them. Adoption donation is $300.00 for dogs over 1 year old and $350 with a $50.00 spay / neuter deposit for puppies/dogs under 1 year old.\n\nClick on this link to access the online form, https://www.jotform.us/form/43196636952162",

He's part Lab, part Pittie, and part German Shepherd, with the best qualities of all three breeds.\nHousebroken, walks great on a leash, loves going for rides. Would do great in a home with kids over 6 years, as he is a big dog (70 pounds) with a lot of happy energy.\nHe does okay with other dogs when introduced in a calm situation but we don't recommend him for the dog park, where there are a lot of loose dogs. NO cats, please. All of our dogs are available for a $200 donation. This includes them being spayed/neutered, micro-chipped, and fully vaccinated.\nTo adopt a dog, we require an approved pre-application, as well as a securely fenced yard. This means an actual, physical, fence. 'Invisible' fences are not acceptable, sorry. If you live in an apartment and do not have a yard, we are not able to adopt to you.\nPlease contact us at: dogtownmutts@gmail.com for details.\nPlease note: we typically do not do 'out of the area' adoptions. This would be any location more than 60 miles away from the Reno/Carson City area.",

            "description": "Roses are red, my eyes are blue, getting adopted will be a dream come true! I am about 35 pounds and I just turned one on January 22nd! I was rescued from Cleveland, TX where I was living in an outdoor kennel. I am catching onto house manners very quickly. I really enjoy being outside. Minus ten degrees? No problem! Ive had a few accidents but never in my kennel, I dont mark in the house, and Im always excited to go outside to potty and sniff around. My foster mom said Ill be neutered soon. I dont know what that is, but it sounds like fun! Speaking of fun, plush toys, rope toys, and balls are my favorite, and I especially like playing with my resident dog sister. We play hard and nap harder. I even have resident chihuahua brothers, but theyre not as fun and we ignore each other. I love to be pet and am good with older kids. I havent been tested with younger children yet, but my foster mom thinks I will be just fine with the proper introduction. She says I dont have a mean bone in my body. If you have room in your heart and home for me, please fill out an adoption application ASAP! I cant wait to meet you! Brocks adoption fee is $375 which covers his neuter, vaccinations, microchip and any additional medical care he may have needed while in the rescues care. We are a foster based rescue, we do not house dogs at a facility. Age and breed, are NLR's best guess as we often don't know who or what mom and dad are. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website www.northernlakesrescue.org",

            "description": "Hello my name is Duke also known as Dukers from my foster mama. This cold weather thing is still new to me, but I love all the new scents when we go outside! Im around 2 years old and a big boy at 72 pounds and could stand to gain a few My foster family consists of another dog who is a little bigger than me who I'm really starting to like, I'm trying to win her over with my charm. There are also 2 cats, who I've been very good with so far; however, I am curious of the one when he moves fast. And they have this tiny human who is loud and moves a lot. He's great to give kisses to, and I really don't mind him, he gives good hugs and pets. My favorite thing is to be loved and get pets and attention! I'm a really good kisser and give you my paw so I can pet you back. Overall, I'm a very calm, content guy who's looking for my furever family so I can show them how much love I have to give. I know how to sit, shake and haven't had any inside accidents yet! I really don't like slippery laminate floors, the ones here scare me at times, but if I walk on them I get to spend time next to my foster family which is where I like to be. I'm ok alone at times with music playing softly and a nice blanket to curl up on, that way I can relax and nap until I join my foster family again in the mornings or when they get home from work. I'm not much of a barker so far unless I'm scared and don't wanna be alone. I get nervous in new areas and freeze at times, but with reassurance I can do anything. Dukes's adoption fee is $375 which covers his neuter, vaccinations, microchip and any additional medical care he may have needed while in the rescues care.

I am a Yorkie (with maybe a little Maltese mixed in!) and I have the softest white fur. \n  You may have noticed my eyes are a bit cloudy, I am mostly blind but it doesn\u2019t slow me down! I have done a pretty good job of learning my way around my foster house. I also do a great job of using my puppy pads since I prefer to use those instead of going outside in the cold! \n  Sudden movements tend to startle me but I\u2019m friends with everyone! I\u2019m fostered with other small dogs as well as children and we get along just fine. \n  My favorite thing in the world is snuggling with my foster family on the couch under a soft blanket. \n  If you have a quiet spot in your home for a sweet older girl like me, I\u2019d love to meet you!! My adoption fee is $150.00.\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

            "description": "Daisy is available to adopt in the Chicagoland area, and is being fostered in a home. Appointments to visit her will be set up for approved adopters only. Adoption fee is $350 which includes all age appropriate vaccines and she is already microchipped. Her adoptive family will be required to spay her by the age of 6 months. Please visit our website at http://newstartdogrescue.org and fill out an application if you are interested.\n\nDaisy is a high energy shepherd catahoula mix puppy 17 weeks old, 22 lbs.  She is a very sweet and loving puppy that loves to play in the snow and chase her toys.  She already likes to bring them back as well.  Daisy loves to snuggle too! She is still working on potty training, and getting better every day!  She is wonderful with kids but should be watched as she has a lot of puppy energy.  She is probably going to grow to at least 50 - 70 lbs judging by her giant paws. She sleeps through most of the night so long as you give her one quick potty break outside half way through.  \n\nDaisy\u2019s forever home should:\n-Have a full, physical fenced yard\n-a single family home (no apartments, please)\n-No young children under 8. \n-Working breed experience. Both Shepherd\u2019s and Catahoulas are protective breeds that need training and a task to do in order to thrive.",

            "description": "** as of 1/1/21 @ 1pm we are no longer accepting applications for miss Roxie. ** \n\nIf you have already submitted a request, please be patient as we work through all of the inquiry\u2019s for both her and her puppies. We will be calling everyone by Friday morning. We won\u2019t have the opportunity to get back to everyone that has applied, but if you do not get a phone call by Friday morning, we have move forward with another applicant. \nBe aware we get dogs/puppies in frequently, some that don\u2019t make it to this site. You\u2019re welcome to send an application request with the breed/age/gender you\u2019re looking for to have us hold.  \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a well rounded, loving companion without going through the hassle of puppy stages, look no further.  Roxie came to us with 8 puppies in tow, after being found in an abandoned house. Now that her crew is nearing adoption day, we would like to get a home lined up for her! She has been a wonderful momma, and has captured the hearts of everyone she meets. Roxie has a kind, patient heart and spends her free time snuggled up with the young kids in her foster home. She gets along with dogs of all sizes, and while she can live with a cat, she will chase them. The second you meet this girl, you won\u2019t want to let her go. She is just under 40 pounds, and thinks she\u2019s a lap dog! She is great on the leash and loves to go for walks, and is all around a mellow girl who is up for whatever is in store for the day. She is fully house trained, knows all basic commands, and non destructive. She is believed to be 6 years old, and will be fully vaccinated/microchipped and spayed upon adoption.  Please email if you\u2019re interested in finding out more or adopting Roxie.",

Maybe he wasn't exposed to them when he was younger, or maybe he was treated poorly by children and is no longer comfortable with them.  Whatever the reason, his previous owner indicated he did not like children and we will make sure he is placed appropriately in a home with no kids.\n\nNow for the wonderful things about Loki .... He is good with other dogs and good with cats!  He is great in the car and really enjoys going for a ride.  He is housebroken and good on a leash.  He enjoys playing fetch (must be the retriever in him) and loves his chew toys.   \n\nAt just 1 year old Loki is young and active and would enjoy a home where he gets plenty of exercise, attention, training and love.  He is very happy and outgoing and will make someone a great companion.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:    DO NOT CALL THE SHELTER.  If you have questions you will get a much faster response if you email questions to  HSPCdogs@gmail.com \n \nIf you rent you must verify with your landlord that they allow dogs and do not have any breed or size restrictions.\n\nWe are open for adoptions Thursday - Saturday from 12-4pm (excluding holidays).  Adoptions are on a first come, first serve basis.  Adoption fee is $100 (cash or check only, NO credit cards).   Meet and greets with kids and other dogs are required.\n",

            "description": "Nellie is about 4 years old. Nellie is VERY shy at first and is going to need someone who is patient and understanding with her and willing to give her lots of time to get used to you and her new environment. We recommend a person with shy dog experience or are very dog-savvy! She would do best in a quiet household where there is not much commotion and no children as well as a SLOW transition into your life. Because of that, we ask that she stays local to Temecula and surrounding cities so we can easily assist when needed. \n\nNow, about her personality...\nNellie is a VERY sweet girl who will follow you around like a shadow. She gets very excited to see her people. She loves to get lots of attention from you too. She is 100% house trained. She appears to be okay with cats. She prefers mature male dogs over females and exuberant puppies but will also do just perfectly fine living in a single dog home. Nellie recently had orthopedic surgery so she cannot do strenuous exercise or hiking - at least not yet. Nellie is pretty mellow but does enjoy playing a little bit every now and then. She would really appreciate having a family who is enthusiastic about continuing her socialization and help her explore the outside world.\n\nIf interested in ADOPTING, please fill out an adoption application online:\nwww.hoperanchanimalsanctuary.org/adoption-application\n\nA copy of your application can be sent to us via email\n\nFor more information about Nellie, please contact Kathy:\nCall/Text: (951) 515-4077\nEmail: k.haley.hope.ranch@gmail.com",

            "description": "Sophia is a gorgeous, affectionate Red Nose Pittie who is 2 years old and weighs 65 lbs.  Her foster family says she is a \"one of a kind\" special girl who has it ALL!  She is great with other dogs and LOVES kids of all ages!  She is a happy, gentle, social dog who is maternal, calm and a shining example of the Pitbull as a Nanny dog!  She is a snuggly, intelligent, obedient girl who loves all humans and is extremely nurturing & gentle with babies & kids of all ages (she is currently in a foster home with 2 beautiful boys ages 10 & 8 months).  It is obvious that Sophia has had several litters of pups and possesses a motherly instinct that allows her to gravitate naturally towards kids. She naps when they nap, she dotes on them when they're awake!  She is a low/medium energy dog that does not require much maintenance except snuggles. She loves to give kisses!!   She will happily go in her crate if she wants some peace & quiet, but more often than not she wants to be close to her humans.  She is still learning basic commands such as sit & lay down, but she is a quick learner, walks well on a leash, and loves car rides! This amazing girl will fit into ANY home!!!  She is spayed, fully vaccinated, microchipped, crate trained and 100% housebroken (if she needs to go out, she will stand by the door and if that doesn't get your attention, she will start whining at the door).\n\nSophia has her own Facebook page because she is THAT special! If you want to see more pics of her at her current foster home, please go to The Foster Pupperz Diaries by copying the link below into your browser:  \nhttps://www.facebook.com/108715817262756/posts/275862293881440/\n\nFor more information about Sophia, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org. If you would like to adopt this sweet girl, please submit an application for her at https://www.barkvilledogrescue.org/applications",

            "description": "Tyga is an American rap singer and one of his songs says, I'm best . . . I'm blessed. Pasadena Humane's Tyga isn't a rapper, but he did cry when his owner moved away and left him at the shelter. He had lived his entire life with that owner and now at age 13, he finds himself without a home. Looking at his picture, one can see an obviously well cared for dog with good looks on top of it all! He is described by staff as calm and getting adjusted to his surroundings. His owner reported that he is an indoor dog and that he is house-trained. He is good with people and also good with kids. However, he doesn't really like the mail carrier much, but then, how many dogs do? He knows his sit command cue. Volunteers report that he enjoys getting petted, plays with a ball, and that he walks well on leash. His age qualifies him for our Senior for Seniors Program in which any adopter who is sixty years old or more can adopt Tyga completely free! Yes, he's a bit stiff in his joints, but that means he's all the more in need of a warm and loving home. Tyga needs to feel blessed again and with someone who thinks he's the best! Learn more about our virtual adoption process .",

            "description": "I AM ON HOLD PENDING AN ADOPTION APPOINTMENT. Shamu is a handsome 2-year-old mixed-breed fellow who currently weighs about 107 pounds. He came to SFAS from a partnering shelter and he is now ready for a new family. Here at the shelter, Shamu has walked well on a leash and has participated in playgroup with other dogs. Shamu's adoption fee is $250 and he is SHELTER HERO! Which means 100% of his adoption fee goes towards other animals in the shelter. He is neutered and microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. To meet Shamu or to be added to his waitlist, call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the DOG'S NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org. A scheduler will call you back within 48 hours to confirm your request. If you have other dogs at home, tell the scheduler you would like to bring them along for a Meet n' Greet. SFAS offers a variety of excellent training classes, seminars and Trainer Talks led by animal behavior professionals. These are $50 off for animals adopted from any shelter or rescue group! Due to current COVID-19 restrictions, classes and talks are all presented virtually using Zoom. For course descriptions, schedules and registration, visit https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/group-training-classes/ for classes and https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/special-seminars-and-workshops/ for seminars and Trainer Talks.",

He gets zoomies in the yard and has a super waggy tail. He is very tolerant of being handled and doesn\u2019t mind having his paws or mouth messed with. He is a super good boy but would likely not do well with smaller children as he\u2019s rambunctious and might misinterpret their fast/unexpected movements as play or find them confusing. He would love a family who can work on training with him so he can grow up to be a good boy! \n\nAGE\n9 months\n\nHOUSE-TRAINED\nUnknown\n\nGOOD IN A HOME WITH\nSeems fine with other dogs, no small kids.\n\nInterested?

            "description": "This beautiful girl has been in rescue for over 100 days. We figured it was long past due for some new photos and bio! Without further ado, say hello to She'! ?\n\n\"She' is a smiler. She LOVES to smile and always seems to be happy. She wants to be close to you and will happily lie on the couch with you. Other times she will be by your feet. She is also the kind of girl who would probably sleep in bed with her new owners if given the choice. She' has the cutest little freckles on her nose and the most beautiful patch of color on her face. She' is all about having fun! She loves exploring the yard outside, she loves to play with the other dogs, she loves chewing on her bones, and she loves getting to be part of the family! If you are looking for a playful and super sweet dog, this girl will steal your heart ? \"\n\nShe's is a 3-year-old female Great Pyrenees. She currently weighs around 80lbs. She' is a happy girl and does well when meeting new people. She has not had much experience being out in public. So when she sees another dog she does try to go greet it and sometimes gets overexcited. Unless her new owner is experienced with large dogs, they should probably skip the walks around the neighborhood with this girl. However, she would probably LOVE going for hikes/walks in more secluded areas where she can't get distracted by other dogs walking around. She' has not been destructive in her foster home. She has only chewed on bones. She' has not shown to have any issues with resource guarding in her foster home. She' doesn't really jump on people, but sometimes does if she is really excited. She' does ride well in the car, but can sometimes be vocal if she sees something that interests her outside. She' does walk well on a leash given there are no distractions that make her want to stray from her course ?\n\nShe' has a more energetic personality. She is laid back inside and typically just grabs a bone to chew on. Sometimes she will play with the other dogs. When outside, she loves playing chase with them and exploring. She' has not shown any interest in playing fetch. We are unsure at this time if she is a water dog or not. We are unsure how She' would do in an apartment setting. She' can be vocal if there is reason to be (another dog is barking/strange noise/stranger/etc). When no one is home, She' has free run of the house and does great. At night, she tends to sleep downstairs on the couch or doggie bed. She' is potty trained. Her foster does not kennel, though.\n\nShe' is one gorgeous girl. You could definitely describe her as the life of the party. If she sounds like your kind of girl, here are a few more things to note before applying for her\n\n-She' is an alpha dog. If another dog challenges her, she won't back down. It would be best if her new home had a submissive male dog that likes to play.\n\n-She' is good with cats. She doesn't seem to pay them any mind in her foster home.\n\n-She' has not been around any kids. She does have a super sweet temperament but can be rowdy at times. We recommend the kids be 8+ in her new home.\n\n-She' is good with other dogs, but she is food aggressive towards them. She does need to be fed separately from them. She hasn't shown to have any treat aggression, but those interactions should always be monitored as well(if there are other dogs around). When no food is around you will see her playing tug-o-war with them or roughhousing in the backyard. She does enjoy their companionship.\n\n-She' would be fine as an only dog if her new family was home most of the day. They would also need to be on the active side.\n\nShe' has been waiting a while for her PYRfect home. She may not be a dog for everyone, but she will be the best addition to the right family! One that is looking for a goofy, smiley, and super lovable girl! If you happen to be that family, please apply for her at https://www.pyrpawsandfluffytailsrescue.com/adoption-app\n\nHer adoption fee is $225. That includes DHLPP, Rabies, and Bordatella shots. She will be micro-chipped, heart-worm tested, have a fecal done, be de-wormed, be spayed/neutered, and will be current on heart-worm and flea/tick prevention.",

            "description": "Cocoa is living in a foster home. Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet her.\n\nCocoa is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~2 years \nWeight: ~44lbs\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate trained: Takes some time to settle and will benefit from continued training for this\nDog sociability: Friendly! Is interested in playing with every dog she sees on walks and may pull to try say 'hi!'\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Unknown, but can guard high value bones/kongs so best with older kids that understand trading\nIdeal home: Cocoa is a pretty adaptable pup! She'd love an adopter that is eager to work on training so she can learn all the best behaviors.\n\nCocoa is the wiggliest and sweetest girl around. Her happy place is leaning on, into and around you as well as getting all the chest rubs on her heart shaped patch as possible. And she gives you the weirdest, cute smile when you hit the spots right. While Cocoa is great at loving you, she is also able to be alone in the crate or be a quiet work from home buddy self-soothing. If you want a girl who loves to lick your face, is smart, often wants rubs and snuggles then look no further than Cocoa because she is a full package.\n\nCocoa's adoption fee is 300. She is spayed, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. She will require booster vaccines at the adopter's expense.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

            "description": "Sweet Charmer is a 14-16(!) year-old shepherd hound mix who came to us from another rescue in the Miami area. We are looking for a hospice foster home for him - Canine Estates will take care of his medical expenses at our local vet(Palm Harbor, FL), and all he needs is love and a place to lay his head for the rest of his days. If you do not live in the immediate area for vet visits, he is available as a traditional adoption as well. He has arthritis and balance issues, but still manages to get around pretty well for his age. He also has a heart murmur and needs his ears cleaned regularly, but otherwise is a sweet, healthy old man. Very food motivated and a nap lover, he will also get along with one or two mellow dogs if they are not too rambunctious or in his face. Cats and children would likely be fine as well. He does not walk well on a leash and cannot handle steps very well, so we would require a single-story home with a fenced yard for him to sunbathe in. Do you have room in your home and heart for this old man?\n\nPlease fill out an application and we will call you once approved to set up a meet and greet. If you have any questions, email director@canineestates.com or call 727-412-0558",

When I first meet my new family I will be nervous, especially after traveling for three days and having to learn a whole new routine with new people. It will take me about 3-4 weeks to really warm up and show you how much fun I can really be. I do best with considerate children over 6 years old. It would be best for me to go to a family with no other dogs and no cats. I will need a family that is patient, willing to spend time with me and ready to love me. My life in Texas has been a hard life. I was dumped out in the country and had to be trapped in order to be rescued. I get nervous meeting new people, but my foster mom has really worked with me. She keeps me well socialized and it has really helped me come out of my shell. I walk well on a leash and enjoy going for walks. I do best when provided with stimulating toys to keep me busy. I love my Kong. Some good activities for me are walks, hikes, going out to eat at pet friendly establishments or other fun activities you enjoy doing. I need a home with a fully secure wooden fenced backyard. \n\nHe is up to date on vaccines according to his age, he has received proper deworming, and comes with additional dewormer. He is microchipped, neutered, comes with 6 months of preventatives, one month free trial of pet insurance, and all of our animals receive a health certificate (this states a licensed veterinary saw the pet and deemed it healthy for travel, it is not a promise of perfect health.) Our transports are USDA certified and transport is included in adoption fee of $500!\n\nHe is currently being fostered in Houston, TX but will be traveling to the PNW as soon as he finds his/her perfect home!\n\nFor questions, please email krissa@threelittlepittiesrescue.org\n\nTo apply: https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/26841/generic",

            "description": "Hello adventure seekers! Meet Maximillion-- the most handsome, well behaved, well rounded husky that is ready to join you on all of your outdoor adventures! Just look at that smile! He is a big, fluffy boy estimated at 7 years old and weighs in at approximately 85 lbs. He's big and strong and ready for any challenge you send his way!\n\nMax is kennel trained, potty trained, good with people, kids and dogs! He's a little too interested in cats...and squirrels! Will have to say he will not do well in a home with cats. Max knows how to sit, shake, loooves car rides, walks well on a leash but he is a strong boy and if he something tickles his nose he will pull in that direction. He likes to take in all of the smells. He is not very interested in other dogs or people, which makes it so much easier for walks. His current foster takes him along on his daily jogs, which he loves. His foster momma and kiddos also walk him and he does well. Max takes treats very gently, loads into a car easily and is super mindful in general. He understands the word \"no\" very well! This big guy will make such an amazing companion to anyone that is ready for some fun!\n\nHe arrives in the PNW on 2/9. Don't miss out on such a great catch-- please apply here- https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/30275/generic\n\nor email cynthia@threelittlepittiesrescue.org if you have an application on file.\n\nThe adoption fee is $550 and includes all vaccines (DHPP & booster, Bordatella, Rabies), spay/neuter, microchip, multiple dewormings, flea and heartworm preventative with 6 month of heartworm preventative injection for after adoption, a high quality nylon Martingale collar, a 30 day trial of pet insurance, transport from TX to the PNW, and many years of priceless memories.\n\n**APPLICATION REQUIRED FOR A RESPONSE**",

The individual who gets him will be blessed. If you are interested , we suggest you act quickly because a gem like him will not stay homeless long.

He is a middle-aged gent (7 years old/50 lbs), who has been professionally trained.\n\nNot your average dog, Ziggy is our 'unicorn' who when he loves, loves with his whole heart.\n\nZiggy will need slow introductions to new people especially in his home.\nand he likes to be the protector of his person/people, so it's always necessary he be put in another room when new people enter the home. \n\nZiggs takes time to warm up to new people, although he can sometimes make a snap judgment that yes, you're his kind of people and it's love at first sight. Ziggs loves his walks, is housetrained, is wonderfully \n\naffectionate with 'his' people, loves to play fetch (he's a pro), and can also amuse himself for hours playing with a ball or two or four! A good roll in the grass, a belly rub, showing off his sit, paw, and down for a treat, he's pretty amazing\n\n. Ziggy loves a car ride, and often goes for a ride with staff for a bagel! Well behaved when home alone, \n\nAs stated. once he decides he loves you, his love has no boundaries! Ziggy also needs slow introductions to other dogs, but at this stage in his life, he's fine being solo. Our Ziggs is ready to find the person to devote his life to; he's neutered, up to date with vaccinations, microchipped.\n\nZiggy is neutered, up to date on his vaccinations, microchipped and ready to find his person to devote his life to \n\nPlease fill in this application\n\nhttps://poshpetsrescueny.org/dog-application/",

            "description": "Meet Janie!\n\nJanie came to us recently when her disabled owner was unable to properly care for her. She lived in an apartment with an owner that never left.\n\nShe is said to be a chocolate lab and Australian shepherd mix, but definitely exudes more of the herding temperament and has alot of energy! \nJanie is about 11 months old and 56lb. \nJanie needs somebody that will be home a lot right now that can work with her departure anxiety. She sleeps great in a crate all night long without any issues. A doggie brother or sister must be young and patient enough to handle playing and jumping on one another since she is still an big puppy and doesnt know her boundaries. BUT she LOVES dogs and playing and is also good with cats. She is great with kids but again may jump/needs continued manners work.\nShe is crate and potty trained and knows sit and paw, but will need some continued training on the leash. She loves to run and would make a great running partner. But again she did live in apartment.\nDue to the need for continued manners work we require no kids under 10 but she does love kids and everyone she meets. She has not been cat tested.\n\nAdoption fee is $300 and includes spay/neuter, microchip, fecal/deworming, vaccines and prevention up to date. Ohio residents only.\n\nSTS is a foster-based and volunteer-run rescue. We do not have a physical location or set hours for you to meet dogs, and it does take time to answer each inquiry. All dogs are in foster homes and once an application is approved and a home visit is completed you will be able to schedule meet and greets with available dogs. We encourage interested individuals to get approved prior to searching as it helps expedite the process. A Petfinder inquiry is not a substitute for an application. For detailed information about our adoption process, including fees, please visit our website at http://www.stopthesuffering.org.",

He is good with dogs of all sizes. He is submissive and cowers and screams if another dog is aggressive. He will crouch and show you his belly when meeting. He is not food aggressive. He tried to be the co pilot when he's riding in a car.\" Noah would like a family that likes to walk and let his roam the great outdoors with them, camping or hiking. He'll make a great family companion. \n\nThe adoption fee is $300 and covers age appropriate vaccines, a microchip, and a spay/neuter.\n\n Applications are typically worked in time stamp order based on date/time of submission. If you have other dogs in your home, they must all meet the potential adoptee. It may save you a trip to bring them with you when you visit, if you are certain you want to adopt a new family member. \n\n*****We are currently operating by appointment only during the social distancing stage of quarantine. If you want to meet this pet, or are interested in adopting, please submit an inquiry or email to email@townandcountryhumanesociety.org.\n\nSomeone from the rescue will contact you and/or your family and determine, on a broad level, whether you might be a fit for the animal. If so, they will provide instructions for completing the application. Your application will be reviewed and you will be contacted to set up a time to meet at the shelter or the foster home. The introduction between you and the pet will be supervised by one of the dog counselors or the foster. If all goes well, you can adopt during the same visit.\n\nPlease be sure to follow us on Facebook to learn more about Town and Country Humane Society and our mission.",

He is good with other dogs, however we are not sure about cats or small children. He is still new to PAW, we are just getting to know him. We will update as we get to know him better.\n\nPAW places animals in the Washington DC/Batlimore Metropolitan area only.",

            "description": "0121013 - Hi my names Ainsley! Im a 10mo old lab mix and Im looking for my furever home! Some of my favorite things include playing with my foster doggy sisters, frolicking outside in the snow, and any kind of toy - squeaky, chewy, bouncy, I really mean ANY toy! Sometimes I mistake human things (like shoes or socks) for dog toys but I quickly learn if you tell me no. Ive been able to entertain myself for hours with just a bin of various toys!\n\nMy foster parents think that Id be best suited in a home with another dog or dogs who can help bring me out of my shell. I have a hidden curious, playful nature but only after I get comfortable. I definitely need a patient family who will put in the time to build my trust because I can be apprehensive towards humans. I dont like to be cornered or corralled, so Im probably not best for a family with young children. Despite my timidness when I first meet you, when I warm up to you I am pretty much the perfect dog! \n\nI can sleep either in a kennel or in bed with you, but if its my choice Id always choose the bed! Im working on my commands sit and come and with some more time I could really master these. Im not overly food motivated but positive praise from humans works as a good alternative for me. I am nearly completely potty trained, and frequent opportunities to go outside really help me with this. I am a natural leash walker and will stay right by your side without any pulling! To adopt me please complete an application at www.sloppykisses.org/adoptions!",

            "description": "Shellie is in a foster home, and is currently not at the shelter. Please find info on how to adopt her below, thanks!\n\n\n\nShellie is a sweet and gorgeous girl with an innocently dopey smile that will warm your heart. She's calm, friendly and enjoys spending time with her human. Shellie is very polite, doesn't bark and prefers pets and cuddling over play. She is well-behaved but would benefit from some house training. Shellie doesn't need a lot of space and will do well in house or apartment setting. She has a calm temperament and may do well with other pet siblings, pending meetup.\n\n\n\nShellie enjoys her slow walks a lot and is always excited to go out, but due to a health condition should not exert herself too much, or be allowed to overheat. Medical records will be shared with those who apply.\n\n\n\nShelly would thrive in a quiet home where she can get the care she needs and have lots of cuddle time!\n\n\n\nHOW TO ADOPT - Please fill out a Dog Adoption Application, available at http://www.seattle.gov/animalshelter/forms.htm and email it to the Seattle Animal Shelter Foster Dog Program at adoptionreview@gmail.com.\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Many of our dogs will receive numerous applications, and the Seattle Animal Shelter asks for your patience during the process of finding the very best match. If you have questions about this dog that have not been answered above, please contact us at sasfosterdogs@gmail.com. If you would like to arrange to meet this dog, you must submit an adoption application. Thank you!",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Ms. Molly is a 1.5 years old at the time of intake in January 2021. Ms. Molly is good with people and other dogs. We were able to rescue Ms. Molly from a backyard breeder with her 4 puppies in tow. We suspect that Ms. Molly has known nothing but neglect her entire life as her fur was so matted and knotted that she couldn't even walk. After a trip to the spa for a makeover, Ms. Molly is as good as new. In fact, she is better than new as Ms. Molly's future drastically changed that day from one of endless breeding to one of love and happiness as a cherished member of her forever family. If you would like Ms. Molly to join your family, please apply online to adopt Ms. Molly (TX) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

Hes so Velcro that hell do whatever his person is doing. He loves adventures and needs an active family to keep him moving. Hes a whopping 89 pounds so an energetic family will keep this loving boy healthy and happy.\n\nJazzy loves walks and is good on a leash. He enjoys car rides and anything his person wants to do. He is 100% housetrained and is crate trained, but is totally trustworthy in the home. He is a quick learner and knows sit, down, leave it, and has great recall. Hes eager to please and obviously loves treats!\n\nHe is great with the many dogs in his foster home and would be good with or without another dog. The main requirement says his foster mom, who is utterly smitten with this great guy, is that he spend forever in an amazing place with amazing people.\n\nJazzy Blue is up to date on vaccinations, neutered, microchipped, and current on heartworm/flea and tick prevention. Also included in his adoption is a Fi GPS collar and one year of GPS service subscription. If he were to escape, as soon as he leaves the safe zone you set around your home, you are alerted\nso that you can find Jazzy's whereabouts. Youll also be able to see how many steps per day he takes to ensure he gets the right amount of exercise, alongside many other features to explore in the Fi mobile app.",

I\u2019m an eight-pound, eight-year-old female chihuahua, fully vetted, vaccinated, spayed, microchipped, and on heartworm preventative. I\u2019ve had a rough couple of months and now I\u2019m ready to live the good life with my forever family. Could that be you?\n\nI was given up by my previous owner, who was older and unable to take care of me. When I came to my foster family, I was in a lot of pain. The vet said I had a bladder infection and I had to have surgery to remove twelve bladder stones. I wasn\u2019t so sure about it, but now I feel like a whole new dog! \n\nNow that I\u2019m healthy, I am very active and love to run, jump, and play, then go crashing into my doggy friends! I\u2019m a sociable girl, and I get along just fine with the other three chihuahuas, the cat, and the toddler in my foster home. And now that the bladder infection is gone, my housetraining is on point! I always let my foster mom know when I need to go. I must confess that I\u2019m a bit of a food critic. If you serve me dry food, I will turn up my nose and demand something a little more appealing! What can I say? I know what I like!\n\nI think I deserve a comfortable home and loving family after what I\u2019ve been through, don\u2019t you? If you\u2019re ready for some fierce fun with a feisty pup, look no further! Fill out that application today!\n\nLily\u2019s adoption fee is $250. If you are interested in adopting Lily, please DO NOT SEND A MESSAGE TO OUR RESCUE GROUP.  We are too busy placing dogs in great homes to answer messages and inquiries through the listing site. \n\nPLEASE GO TO THE LINK BELOW TO COMPLETE AN ADOPTION APPLICATION.\n \nwww.chihuahua-rescue.com/adoption-application\n \nCRT requires an approved adoption application and a home visit for all adoption applicants.  CRT transports to OH, KY, IL, MI, MN, WI. \n",

These three Beagle 6 year old girls are a bit small for the breed but are big on giving kisses, getting scratchies and butt rubs and are just overall good girls. And are ridiculously cute. Oddly they seem to be mostly potty trained as well. They get on famously with other friendly animals and well mannered children. They can be adopted separately though we would adopt all three if we could 'cause they are just that fine. Sigh.

We are a group of individuals that have come together to save the lives of animals that are in danger of being euthanized. We raise funds to fully vet the animals and to provide them with a stable home until they are adopted. All of the dogs in our Rescue are in Foster homes while they are looking for their forever family. The only time we put a dog in boarding is for a Foster to go on vacation if another Foster is not able to care for them. We appreciate your taking the time to fill out the application to adopt one of our Guardians of the Green Mile pets. The questions that we ask are to only find the right fit for all of our dogs and the families that will be adopting them. Adoption donation is $300.00 for dogs over 1 year old and $350 with a $50.00 spay / neuter deposit for puppies/dogs under 1 year old.\n\nClick on this link to access the online form, https://www.jotform.us/form/43196636952162",

His food aggression is disappearing and he is learning that his crate is a safe place.\n\nChase will need an experienced, dog savvy home that provide him with a loving environment where he can live without anxiety and fear.

I'm Bombay, and I am a real stunner. My super-shiny, soft, silver coat almost looks like chrome. When you meet me, you'll notice that my incredibly charming happy-go-lucky personality matches my handsome looks. I absolutely love affection, giving kissing and I especially enjoy pets and belly rubs. Toys are so much fun. I really adore soft stuffed toys to chase and sliding across the floor being silly and puppy like! I do walk well on leash, but sometimes I get awfully excited when I see small animals and can really show my strength. That's why my ideal home would be with a very strong handler and someone that is willing to work with me on this. I'm great at the \"sit\" command, and I take treats very gently. I'll admit that sometimes I have a tendency to jump up for attention, but I also respond well to correction because all I want to do is please. I've been told by my volunteer friends that I am a perfect gentleman with impeccable manners. If you are looking for a super-affectionate, energetic, fun companion, I'm right here waiting for you.\nAdoption Information: Size: Extra Large/weighs 82 pounds Children: 10 and up (due to size and strength) Dogs: Selective Cats: NoRequired: Single-family home with fenced in yard Experience: Needs a strong and dog savvy, experienced handler. Not the dog for a first-time dog family. Plus must live in a house, no apartment or condo living for him.Adoption fee: $300 This dog is neutered, microchipped and has had a full veterinary checkup and vaccines.\nIf you are interested in more information or would like to meet this dog, please fill out our online adoption survey: carenorthshore.org/dog-adoption-survey",

            "description": "Hugh is an approximately 1 year old Beagle mix that weighs about 20 pounds. This sweet as candy boy was part of a hoarding situation in rural Kentucky. Hugh can initially be shy when meeting you, but quickly warms up and shares his sweet personality. Hugh is nicely crate trained and is doing well with potty training but will need continued training in a new home. Hugh is dog friendly and has seen a cat...still not quite sure if he likes them. Hugh would do best in a home with a fenced in yard as he is still learning what a leash is and working to gain confidence. \n\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm tested negative (age 7 months and older) and microchipped. We do not ship or transport. A dog's adoption donation is $200. There is a $5 fee for credit/debit cards.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please fill out an online application here: www.heartlandsmallanimalrescue.org/canine-application.html",

IF YOU MEET OUR CRITERIA FOR ADOPTION OF THIS DOG, PLEASE FOLLOW THE LINK TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE PROFILE TO COMPLETE OUR APPLICATION. THANK YOU!\n\nMeet Angel!\n\nAngel is 10 years old and a super snuggler. Sadly, she is actually one half of a bonded pair who have had a very hard life. Over the past few years they\u2019ve been bounced around from shelter to shelter. Evidently their owner was unable to maintain a housing situation. At one point, the dogs were abandoned in a car with nothing but water for four days. The last picture we have posted is of her male companion dog with her.\n\nAngel is a sweet, sweet girl. She has some mobility issues, related to arthritis. She is a little stiff to get up or down and stairs are definitely a challenge for her. She limps just a bit on her front left leg and really only needs very slow, short walks to be happy. \n\nWe think both dogs deserve to live a comfortable, safe life from here on out.\n\nAdoption Process: We are not first come first served. Indigo Rescue focuses on finding good matches between dogs and families to ensure life long adoptions. We deliver all dogs to their new homes. All of our dogs are in foster homes. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in meeting one of our dogs, please use the following link and complete our Adoption Application. You can either scan your completed application and email it to us at: info@indigorescue.org, or you can fax it to us at: 888-502-7660.\nThe link is not live, so you will need to copy and paste it into your browser: https://storage.googleapis.com/gator-users/user-680788/documents/d1742bff02e44c2ea25649cb45df5103/Pet%20Application%20Form%20December%202020.pdf\nIf the dog you're interested in seems compatible with your lifestyle we'll set up a time for you to meet the dog privately.\nPLEASE NOTE: Indigo Rescue only adopts to homes within 30 miles of Beaverton because our volunteers deliver all of our dogs to their adoptive homes. We work very hard to create a family of our Indigo Rescue adopters because we want to be close enough to help in case there are any problems. We want everyone to be happy and successful!\n\n**ALL of our dogs and puppies come vaccined to their age, spayed/neutered and microchipped.\n\nThank you for your interest in adopting and saving a life.",

A bit timid at first, she quickly warmed up and now wants nothing more than to be close to \"her people.\" Harley is not a clingy puppy, but does prefer to be in close proximity to her humans. She's content to nap at your feet or on a nearby dog bed, or just sit and watch the activity in her busy foster household. She's a confident pup, but also cautious when approaching something new. She mastered stairs and the doggy door very quickly, will sit for treats, and is working hard on potty training. Harley is in a foster family with 4 year old and 8 year old children and is not fazed by their rambunctious play. She fit right in with the two resident adult dogs and is happy to romp and roughhouse with them in the yard. Harley will be a medium to large size dog when full grown, so will definitely need a yard or lots of outdoor exercise to burn off energy. And that soft downy coat that makes her so cuddly will also need regular brushing. Harley is being fostered in Arvada and will be ready for adoption after January 29th.",

He is a 2 year old wired hair Jack Russell Terrier mix who is all of 11 pounds. He was brought in Christmas Eve by his owner as he was going to Boot Camp and could no longer care for him.  Snowball was pretty fearful at first - which is to be expected as his whole life was turned upside down.  It took some time and patience and of course lots of love but we soon gained his trust and now he is the happy go lucky boy we knew he could be!  He seems more at ease with women then men but certainly lets our male staff members hold and take care of him.  He LOVES other pups, and his perfect home would have another pup that could show him the ropes as he may find a new environment again pretty scary.\n\nHe has been a joy to have with us but he is ready to go to his forever family- we're confident he will make his adopters a terrific companion. Please copy and paste the link below (or above) into your browser to fill out our online application. Please hurry so you don't miss out as we expect good response. Snowball is up to date on all shots and dewormings and carries an adoption fee of $399 which includes his micro chip.  Don't delay, get your application in to his coordinator at\n\nhttps://tinyurl.com/MAMAS-Melissa   If you have any issues please contact me at my email below.\n\nPlease CONTACT us here--MELISSAU.SAFEHAVEN@GMAIL.COM\nNOT the Safe Haven button--MELISSAU.SAFEHAVEN@GMAIL.COM\n",

They are working on using their puppy pads, they love to play with their stuffed animals (crinkle, squeaky), & love to cuddle and take naps.  They have been fostered with kittens and a young dog. Dad was noted as being a boxer and mom is noted as being a lab.  These babies will melt your hearts. Their adoption fee is $400.00\n\nShawnee Lookout \"Shawnee\", male \nhe loves puppy cuddles, and playing with his siblings. Shawnee's adoption fee is $400\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

Since she did not really respond well to her name we dubbed her Stevie Wonder and call her Stevie. \nHaving a vision-impaired dog takes a special person. Although Stevie is very low maintenance, she needs to always be kept safe. She needs a very secure yard, probably no steps, and a person who does not mind a bed partner. Once acclimated into a new home, Stevie is confident, assured and just a \"Wonder\" to watch.\nShe comes when called, is a great foot warmer and is very charming. \nAfter being in her foster home a week or so, her foster mom panicked when she could not find her. Turns out, Stevie is very found of the couch and fuzzy blankets.\nStevie will be spayed soon, vaccinated, and microchipped. \nShe will be available to go to her new home mid February.\nWe do not do out of Oklahoma adoptions and we do not transport dogs out of state.\nIf you are interested in Stevie, please email the reuse for an application to be sent.\nHer adoption fee is $225. \n",

Since COVID took away happy hours, let me bring the happy hour TO YOU! Every hour is a happy hour with me by your side!\nI'm a very handsome 10 month old American Staffordshire boy looking for an amazing home to call me own! I'm a big goof ball, like one would expect of my breed. I like to play play play! If there's another dog to wrestle, I'm game! I am super respectful with other dog's wishes. There's a couple little dogs at my foster home that are elders, and if the tell me to back off and mind my biz, I do that. After all, I'm the new guy here and I don't mean to start any trouble. Not sure if I've met any cats, but I would likely respect them as well. I'm still a pup and learning the ropes on how to be a great ambassador for my breed! The perfect home would be one that can work with me on basic training and socializing like every young pup needs. I already know how to sit so that's a great start! I am motivated by treats and I want to please my people! I am a STRONG bully boy, and i am still learning how to walk on a leash without pulling. Hopefully we can go for walks and you can leach me these skills! I'm quiet in a crate for bedtime and doing well with house training in my foster home. There are little kids at my foster home and I've been good with them also. They like to have fun, just like me!\nIf you're looking for a hippopotamus to be your new best friend, I'm your boy! I promise to keep you laughing and loved for years to come! Pick me! Pick me!\n\nThe adoption fee covers the cost of the animal's spay/neuter surgery, microchipping, FIV/FeLK testing (for cats) or Heartworm Testing (for dogs), deworming and all core age appropriate vaccinations. For the most complete information regarding this animal, and all of our adoptable pets, please ensure you are visiting our website directly at www.RescueCrew.org.

They are working on using their puppy pads, they love to play with their stuffed animals (crinkle, squeaky), & love to cuddle and take naps.  They have been fostered with kittens and a young dog. Dad was noted as being a boxer and mom is noted as being a lab.  These babies will melt your hearts. Their adoption fee is $400.00\n\nWinton Woods \"Winton\", male\nHe is able to fit through the bars of the puppy pen and he loooovvvveeess to greet his foster moms with his wagging tail and smiling face.  He likes to follow his foster moms around, he loves to be held and cuddled. Winton's adoption fee is $400\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

Please read the bio before sending questions - we answer all we know about the dog here.\n\nMeet Georgia who arrived to Florida from rural Georgia where she was living under an abandoned trailer with her 10 puppies, all of which have been placed in their forever homes! Now it is Miss Georgia's turn!!\n\nAt an estimated age of only 2 years old; she is currently receiving treatment for heart worms and her X-rays showed bullets in her body. She is up to date on vaccinations and will be scheduled to be spayed and microchipped.\n\nThrough a life of anything but ease, this sweet girl is still trusting, no grumbles or grunts being carried as she learned to go in out of the house on her own, a very new experience for her. She is still timid, but that tail remains wagging constantly and she willingly follows a gentle toned voice.\n\nShe has quickly grasped house training, no accidents, and enjoys spending time in her chair, her absolute happy place. Her temperament is so calm, she loves being loved on but also appreciates her quiet time.\n\nGeorgia deserves a very loving home and a quiet, comfy place to call her own.\n\nIf interested in adopting Georgia please fill out the application on the Heidi's Legacy website only.\n\nGeorgia's adoption fee is $300 - obedience training is required after adoption.\n\nObedience training is also required for all our pups.

She loves to play with her brother and loves to show you how much she loves you by giving you snuggles and kisses! Once she gets wiped out, she loves taking naps. She tries to jump up and make sure you know she's there, but if you come down to her level and give her attention she's pretty good. She does pretty well with other dogs, but hasn't been exposed to too many, so we try to make sure to give a slow introduction so we don't overwhelm or startle her. She's learning to be crate/house trained. Rosie is such a sweet girl and is so patiently waiting for her forever home.\n\nHer adoption fee is $250 which includes age-appropriate vaccines, microchip, and spay. \n\nTo adopt me, please fill out an adoption application on the Lucky 13 Rescue website www.lucky13rescue.org\nOr use the link below\nhttps://forms.gle/Tc2jvVQ1oYjPSwmeA",

We are a group of individuals that have come together to save the lives of animals that are in danger of being euthanized. We raise funds to fully vet the animals and to provide them with a stable home until they are adopted. All of the dogs in our Rescue are in Foster homes while they are looking for their forever family. The only time we put a dog in boarding is for a Foster to go on vacation if another Foster is not able to care for them. We appreciate your taking the time to fill out the application to adopt one of our Guardians of the Green Mile pets. The questions that we ask are to only find the right fit for all of our dogs and the families that will be adopting them. Adoption donation is $300.00 for dogs over 1 year old and $350 with a $50.00 spay / neuter deposit for puppies/dogs under 1 year old.\n\nClick on this link to access the online form, https://www.jotform.us/form/43196636952162",

She is enjoying her time in foster care and is learning many skill sets that will help in her forever home. She adores to ride in the car, she is crate trained, and is leash trained too. Now Snowball can just enjoy life- no more puppies! She is an active girl, and needs to be in a home that will continue to provide daily exercise. She would be a wonderful running companion! She enjoys the companionship of other dogs, but prefers dogs that are laid back and smaller than her- oddly enough, she also has an affinity for other female dogs, but the key is their ability to not be too pushy or high-strung. She does require a home without cats.\n\nSnowball has allergies, and has been tested to determine what she is sensitive to. She will need to be maintained on a diet that excludes specific types of food and additives that she is allergic to. Since not all of her allergies are food related, medication will also be needed to alleviate her allergies. Please be sure this is something that you are willing to provide, prior to applying.\n\nSnowball has been spayed, micro-chipped, and is up to date on preventatives. Since she is active, she would do best in a home where all children are 8 years of age or older. She would love a home where her humans are not gone for long hours. A fenced in yard is also a must (structured fencing), she loves to play fetch and explore.",

I\u2019m Tucker and I am new to rescue. I used to live with a great family. But when my dad moved he could not have pets in his new home. So, here I am looking for a family to spend my golden years with.\n\nI am a pretty low key guy, but I do have some spunk, especially at chow time and treat time. Foster mom got a video of me so check it out!  I really like to snuggle on the couch with a blanket and I like my doggie bed too. I get along great with my foster brothers and sisters, but am fine being a loner. Saw a cat this morning during my morning walk, and wasn\u2019t interested in her. I have not been around small kids, but given my age, I think a home with older kiddos/no kiddos is more my thing.\n\nBeing outdoors is my thing. There is so much to see and do!! I like the yard, but do not try to dig out to see what else it out there. I am really good on a leash and I loves short strolls. I am potty trained and will sit at the back door to let you know when I need to do my business. I can use the doggy door too. Foster mom has put me in a kennel a few times, and I\u2019m cool with that, I just curl up and nap.\n\nI have not seen the doggie doctor for my check-up yet, but that will be soon. Foster mom says I need to be responsible and get neutered\u2014not sure what that is, but I am all about being a good boy!!  My skin is dry and flaking, and my joints are a bit stiff in the morning. And I need to have my teeth cleaned. Foster mom is working on this so I will be ready for my forever home.\n\nI will keep ya\u2019ll posted! If you want more information, email my foster mom!\n\nIf you want to help with this dog\u2019s medical expenses: \nhttps://therescuedrescuers.org/how-to-help\n\nIf you want to adopt this dog, apply at the link! \nhttps://therescuedrescuers.org/adoption-application",

I\u2019m Tucker and I am new to rescue. I used to live with a great family. But when my dad moved he could not have pets in his new home. So, here I am looking for a family to spend my golden years with.\n\nI am a pretty low key guy, but I do have some spunk, especially at chow time and treat time. Foster mom got a video of me so check it out!  I really like to snuggle on the couch with a blanket and I like my doggie bed too. I get along great with my foster brothers and sisters, but am fine being a loner. Saw a cat this morning during my morning walk, and wasn\u2019t interested in her. I have not been around small kids, but given my age, I think a home with older kiddos/no kiddos is more my thing.\n\nBeing outdoors is my thing. There is so much to see and do!! I like the yard, but do not try to dig out to see what else it out there. I am really good on a leash and I loves short strolls. I am potty trained and will sit at the back door to let you know when I need to do my business. I can use the doggy door too. Foster mom has put me in a kennel a few times, and I\u2019m cool with that, I just curl up and nap.\n\nI have not seen the doggie doctor for my check-up yet, but that will be soon. Foster mom says I need to be responsible and get neutered\u2014not sure what that is, but I am all about being a good boy!!  My skin is dry and flaking, and my joints are a bit stiff in the morning. And I need to have my teeth cleaned. Foster mom is working on this so I will be ready for my forever home.\n\nI will keep ya\u2019ll posted! If you want more information, email my foster mom!\n\nIf you want to help with this dog\u2019s medical expenses: \nhttps://therescuedrescuers.org/how-to-help\n\nIf you want to adopt this dog, apply at the link! \nhttps://therescuedrescuers.org/adoption-application",

They are working on using their puppy pads, they love to play with their stuffed animals (crinkle, squeaky), & love to cuddle and take naps.  They have been fostered with kittens and a young dog. Dad was noted as being a boxer and mom is noted as being a lab.  These babies will melt your hearts. Their adoption fee is $400.00\n\nRichardson Forest Preserve \"Richardson\", male\nhe loves puppy cuddles, and playing with his siblings. Richardson's adoption fee is $400\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

            "description": "Meet Jill ~\n\nMy name is Jill and I am a Terrier mix from South Carolina.  I weigh roughly  40lbs.\n\nAlong with my brother Jack, we were rescued by a really nice person. She sent us up North so we could find nice families to take care of us and love us.\nI am a very nice girl. Not being a barker, pushy or unruly, I am a really easy pup to have around! With my short legs, and chubby body, I am cute as a button!\n\nWith my adorable looks, and unbridled loyalty, I will always be there for you through thick and thin. I will never judge you, or turn my back on you. Every single day, you will look at me and you will know that you are loved unconditionally. I will never betray you or hurt you, and I will grow old by your side.\n\n******IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ ALL THE GREAT INFO BELOW******\n\n***Please don't apply unless you are very serious about adopting, and are ready to move forward with the adoption process. We are super busy and make a great effort to respond back to EVERYONE ASAP! WHEN WE TAKE THE TIME TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION AND RESPOND BACK TO THE APPLICANT JUST TO BE EITHER IGNORED OR BE TOLD THEY CANNOT COME FOR SEVERAL DAYS, MORE TIME IS WASTED~PLEASE HAVE MORE RESPECT THAN THAT!\n\nPLEASE read our website's ADOPTION PROCESS PAGE prior to submitting an adoption application. www.apupspizzazzrescue.com/adoption-process \nADOPTION APPLICATION: www.apupspizzazzrescue.com/adoption-application \n\nABOUT OUR RESCUE DOGS: \n All of our dogs are located in Connecticut, are spayed or neutered, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, have been given deworming medications, and have had CT State health checks, & go home with a leash, collar, & packet of medical paperwork. \n\nBREED IDENTIFICATION:\nPlease understand that many rescue dogs are mixes of multiple breeds. Petfinder allows us to choose up to two breeds per dog. While the shelters and our rescue do our best in accurately identifying breeds, breed identification is not guaranteed. If there is a certain breed that you do not want, it is very important that you share this with our rescue when applying. When adopting a puppy, breed uncertainty plays a big part in the size/look of the dog as an adult. Please know that any puppy can be a wonderful dog, regardless of preconceived notions of certain breeds, but it is very important that the adopter has the dedication and patience to raise the puppy with boundaries, consistency, structure, & love. The more effort you give towards training & time you allow for exercise, your puppy will grow to be a HUGE source of UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, TOTAL LOYALTY, HAPPINESS, COMFORT & COMPANIONSHIP!\n\nABOUT OUR RESCUE:\nWe are a small rescue run by volunteers & focused on finding the right match for both our dogs & for you. If you are interested in adopting through our rescue, you first will need to complete an adoption application & be approved as a potential adopter before meeting any of our pups. No need to be intimidated by our application as it allows us to get to know you & your lifestyle. Of course, the more you can share the better! Please also note, while a fenced yard is fantastic, it is not required by our rescue, however, it may be required for a certain dog occasionally.  Once adoption applicants are approved to become potential adopters, we offer private appointments where you can meet one or several dogs at the discretion of the rescue. We offer a unique & pleasant experience focused on finding the perfect match. It is extremely important to us that everyone is treated with respect & that NO ONE IS LEFT HANGING. WE WILL GET BACK TO YOU WITHIN 2 TO 3 DAYS of application submission. If there is a dog you are eager to meet, please  TEXT US DIRECTLY at 203-241-2351 so that we can check the status of your application and move it forward immediately. We look forward to hearing from you and helping you find your new best friend.\n\n*All adult dogs can be cat tested by request.\n\nHOME/RENTER INSURANCE:\nSOME PROVIDERS HAVE VERY STRICT POLICIES REGARDING WHICH TYPE OF DOG BREEDS ARE ALLOWED UNDER THEIR COVERAGE. STATE FARM WAS SUGGESTED TO US AS THEY DO NOT PUNISH, DROP, NOR REFUSE YOU DUE TO DOG BREED SHOULD YOU RUN INTO ISSUES WITH YOUR CURRENT PROVIDER.",

She loves to play, and is doing amazing with the other dog in the foster home. She is working on puppy training, and in less than 24 hours she is already using puppy pads correctly! Overall, Gracie is a wonderful puppy and loves to snuggle with anything fuzzy!\n\nIf you are interested in finding out more about this dog, please submit an application at www.petrescuealliance.com. All questions will be answered and meet and greets set up following a review of application. If the dog is listed on our website or Petfinder, they are still available! Pet Rescue Alliance does our best to provide accurate information about the dogs we have available for adoption. We cannot make any guarantees about age, breed or temperament.",

He's already neutered and is now microchipped and up to date on vaccines.\nHe was a stray in central Florida, picked up by animal control and is now with us looking for a home.\nBecause no one cared enough to take care of Yoyo in his previous life, he is heartworm positive. His treatment will be complete around mid-March when he'll be able to go to a forever home, but we're happy to accept applications for sweet Yoyo now.",

            "description": "Well hello fans!  I\u2019m 2 year old mixed breed Toby from West Virginia, temporarily residing in Westfield, WI. My foster mom calls me a couch potato and I don\u2019t see the point in toys when there is something soft to lay on. I had a traumatic beginning in my life so no matter how sweet you are... I don\u2019t trust you until you prove to me your going to be gentle and kind. I am very chilled in my foster home even with that crazy cat stalking me.  I love massages and enjoy binge watching dog shows on TV.  I am an only dog at the foster home and there are no kiddos so I\u2019m not sure how I would react to those species? I like going outdoors to play in the snow and do my business outside.  I need to be kenneled at night for bedtime or if you go away. I follow my foster mom everywhere when I\u2019m not napping.  I will warm up to you in a few days once I feel settled in and I\u2019ll be your bestie forever.  I just need time to feel safe.  So what do you say?  ?? If you are interested,  my adoption fee is $300 ,  I'm currently not neutered so there will be a $100 refundable fee which will be returned once neutered . You can apply for me at: www.lastpawrescue.org \n501 (c) 3 approved Wi Agriculture license number 285589-DS",

These guys were found a month ago abandoned without a mama.  A good samaritan took them in and gave them a great month in her home. And here they are to be vetted and wonderful homes found for them.\nDo I know what they are??? No, I do not.\nDo I know how big they will be??? No, I do not.\nThere are three boys and a girl. Three shorter-legged ones and one tall. All have long droopy ears. \nThey have been bathed, nails cut and wormed. They are now pooped and passed out in the buggy for now.\nMonday we will go get vaccinations and set appointments for their surgery in a week or so. \nThey will be sterilized, vaccinated, microchipped and wormed. The rescue will pay for the second vaccination if you take to our clinic. \nWe always send home dry food, canned food, enrichment toys, treats and potty pads with each pup adopted.\nAdoption will be $225 which includes all of the above. \nIf one of these guys catch your eye, send an email to tinytailssmalldogrescue@aol.com for an application to be sent.",

The application will not bind you to adopting but it will let us know if you meet the requirements to adopt.  All inquiries must be done by email; we do not take phone calls on inquiries but do answer our emails quickly.  You will find the application below.  We can hold the puppy for 3 days once application is approved.  We do not ship/transport any of our puppies, but we will adopt out of state; you will need to make arrangements to pick up the puppy. Adoption fees will vary.\n\n\nI am a sweet little puppy who was either sent to the pound, dropped off somewhere along the roadside or turned in by my owner who no longer wanted me. Lucky for me I was rescued and am now looking for my forever home. I have been taken good care of while in my foster home. I have had my shot(s), dewormed and flea/tick preventative applied and if I am old enough I have been altered. All I need now is a home with a family to love! \n\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION (copy and paste into an email listed as contact for this pet):\n\nFFHS Adoption Application\nName of the pet you are applying for:\nYour full name:\nAddress:\nCity:\nState & Zip:\nDriver's License State:\nAge of person filling out application:\nAre there children in the home?

            "description": "Watch out world up for debut are the Hamilton County Parks Litter \nThese 10 amazing 4-6 pound lab/boxer puppies are 8 weeks old and ready for their furever homes.  They are working on using their puppy pads, they love to play with their stuffed animals (crinkle, squeaky), & love to cuddle and take naps.  They have been fostered with kittens and a young dog. Dad was noted as being a boxer and mom is noted as being a lab.  These babies will melt your hearts. Their adoption fee is $400.00\n\nGlenwood Gardens \"Glen\", male\nhe loves puppy cuddles, and playing with his siblings. Glen's adoption fee is $400\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

WE DO NOT TRANSPORT OUR SMALL BREED RESCUES TO OTHER STATES\n\nLittle Tall Boy is one of 4 pups in the Quad Group. \nThese guys were found a month ago abandoned without a mama.  A good samaritan took them in and gave them a great month in her home. And here they are to be vetted and wonderful homes found for them.\nDo I know what they are??? No, I do not.\nDo I know how big they will be??? No, I do not.\nThere are three boys and a girl. Three shorter-legged ones and one tall. All have long droopy ears. \nThey have been bathed, nails cut and wormed. They are now pooped and passed out in the buggy for now.\nMonday we will go get vaccinations and set appointments for their surgery in a week or so. \nThey will be sterilized, vaccinated, microchipped and wormed. The rescue will pay for the second vaccination if you take to our clinic. \nWe always send home dry food, canned food, enrichment toys, treats and potty pads with each pup adopted.\nAdoption will be $225 which includes all of the above. \nIf one of these guys catch your eye, send an email to tinytailssmalldogrescue@aol.com for an application to be sent.\n",

He get's playful with his sister and loves to tug on their rope and chew on it is as well. When he gets nervous or scared he pees a little, but is mostly really good at whining to notify when he needs to go outside. He loves to sit on laps and give small kisses. He does pretty well with other dogs, but hasn't been exposed to too many, so slow introductions are best so he doesn't get overwhelmed.\n\nToby will come with age appropriate shots, microchip, deworming, and neuter. His adoption fee is $250.\n\nIn order to adopt, please submit an application by visiting this page \nhttps://forms.gle/Tc2jvVQ1oYjPSwmeA \n\nLucky 13 Rescue www.lucky13rescue.org",

The application will not bind you to adopting but it will let us know if you meet the requirements to adopt.  All inquiries must be done by email; we do not take phone calls on inquiries but do answer our emails quickly.  You will find the application below.  We can hold the puppy for 3 days once application is approved.  We do not ship/transport any of our puppies, but we will adopt out of state; you will need to make arrangements to pick up the puppy. Adoption fees will vary.\n\n\nI am a sweet little puppy who was either sent to the pound, dropped off somewhere along the roadside or turned in by my owner who no longer wanted me. Lucky for me I was rescued and am now looking for my forever home. I have been taken good care of while in my foster home. I have had my shot(s), dewormed and flea/tick preventative applied and if I am old enough I have been altered. All I need now is a home with a family to love! \n\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION (copy and paste into an email listed as contact for this pet):\n\nFFHS Adoption Application\nName of the pet you are applying for:\nYour full name:\nAddress:\nCity:\nState & Zip:\nDriver's License State:\nAge of person filling out application:\nAre there children in the home?

They are working on using their puppy pads, they love to play with their stuffed animals (crinkle, squeaky), & love to cuddle and take naps.  They have been fostered with kittens and a young dog. Dad was noted as being a boxer and mom is noted as being a lab.  These babies will melt your hearts. Their adoption fee is $400.00\n\nMitchell Memorial \"Mitchell\", male\nhe is great at taking his medication without incident, he is a sweet boy who loves cuddles and attention. Mitchell's adoption fee is $400\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

            "description": "Mille was rescued with 4 other JRT puppies. Millie is not with her littermates, as she has a special purpose. She is helping another puppy we have named Eli. Eli came to us malnourished. His recovery took 6 weeks. He was only 7 weeks old when he came to us. When he recovered he needed a playmate. He needed a puppy his size to show him how to play. You see... Eli is a lab mix. He should be around 15 pounds for his age, but he is only 5 lbs because his growth was stunted. So Millie has become friends with Eli and taught him how to play and interact. They are great buddies.\n\nNow getting back to Millie- This is her story. Mom is a 12-pound JRT and dad is 15 pounds. She is called a Shorty Jack because she has short legs and longer body. She was also born with no tail. She has had her first vaccines, been dewormed, and microchipped. Millie will be spayed on 2/12. She can go for adoption after that, however........unlike her littermates.........she can not go for adoption until Eli is adopted. He needs her. So you can put in an application for her, but we don't know how soon she can leave. \n\nWe require a fenced in back yard (physical fence) and our policy is no small children under the age of 7. Puppies needs a home where a primary adult caretaker is home during the day. If you have other dogs, another small dog 15 pounds and under in the home is acceptable, however no large dogs. \n\nAdoption fee is $425. Please put in an application on our website www.indianasaveadog.com A $50 deposit (once your application is approved) will hold your puppy until adoption day.",

            "description": "Eli is a very special puppy. He almost died when he was 7 weeks old. He came to us malnourished and he was only 14 ounces. Now he is 13 weeks old and he is a healthy, beautiful and strong boy. He is a lab/ cattle dog mix. At his age now of 13 weeks, he should be over 15 lbs. However, he is only 5 lbs. His growth was stunted. We do not expect him to be over 30 lbs. as an adult.\n\nEli was bottle fed when he first arrived here. He finally started gaining weight and now he is ready for adoption. Because he was not with any littermates, he did not know how to play with other puppies. Therefore, when we rescued our Jack Russell Terrier litter, we put a JRT, Millie in with him. Millie is a hoot and she shows him how to play and be a puppy. Eli still loves to be held and cuddled. He loves people. He was always held when he first came here. He will sit in your lap quietly and fall asleep. He will gently give you kisses. He loves people.\n\nEli is growing, and his bones are strong. He will be going for adoption without being neutered. Whomever adopts him will sign a neuter contract and have him neutered around 6-7 months of age or timeframe recommended by the vet. We want his bones to continue to develop and strengthen, and neutering early can deter bone density in male dogs.\n\nHe has started his series of puppy shots and is microchipped. We require a fenced in back yard ( physical fence) and please no small children under the age of 10. Eli needs a home where a primary adult caretaker is home during the day. If you have another dog in the home it must be a smaller breed that is friendly. Adoption fee is $300 and we will refund $75 of the adoption fee when proof of neuter is provided.

I had to leave my last house in a big hurry due to some pretty awful stuff happening that I can no longer think about. \n\nRight now, I'm am putting everything behind me and starting fresh. I am a healthy, happy guy and can follow commands just fine. I know SIT, STAY, SHAKE and LAY DOWN. I do fine in a crate, but even better in a bed - hahahahaha. Right now I get to go into my human's son's bed and boy is it comfortable. I like little humans - mine is about 9 years old I think I heard him say, and we get along just fine. I don't have a lot of experience around smaller ones and CATS - forget it. They are just plain weird. I do like my own kind however. Us dogs rock and roll,\n\nOh, oh, oh, forgot to tell you that I love walks. We can walk all day as far as I'm concerned. Lots of great smells and adventures to be had out in the woods or the neighborhood.\n\nDo you think you could find a place for me in your heart? I know I have plenty of room in mine for you. \n\n\n\n\n\nSIT STAY SHAKE LAYDOWN\n \nINTERESTED in BUSTER? The first step is to fill out our online Adoption Application (address link below)\n\nNOTE: All of our dogs live in foster homes so it is not possible to setup a meet and greet prior to submitting an adoption application. Filling out an application doesn't obligate you to adopt, but it does save your place in line if there are multiple people interested.\n \nADOPTION APPLICATION (Type or cut & paste the below website address into your browser): http://www.sdroregon.com/adoption-application.htm\n \nIf our Adoption Coordinator determines you are a good match they will contact you. This is a great opportunity for you to find out more about BUSTER and decide if you would like to setup a meet and greet.  \n \nADOPTION FEE is $150, and there\u2019s a 10% Discount for Senior Citizens and Veterans.\n \nLearn more about the ADOPTION PROCESS here (Type or cut & paste the below website address into your browser): http://www.sdroregon.com/adoption-process.htm\n \nWe apologize, but we are not able to answer individual questions about our dogs. We are a small, all-volunteer organization and we receive hundreds of inquiries. If you want to learn more about a particular dog, then please submit an Adoption Application. If your application is chosen, you will have the opportunity to meet the dog and to get answers to all of your questions. Thank you for your understanding.",

I am a very happy and very sweet gal, about 2 years old (or maybe just a tad younger) who just wants to have fun.  I love being walked and paid attention to.  I have lots of get up and go.  I really like playing fetch.  \n\nOh, I forgot to mention, I have black polka dots all over me.  It really adds character to my already beautiful appearance.  Sometimes I think I am a lap dog, but really, I am just a fun loving gal.\n\nEveryone who is interested in me must fill out a questionnaire first. All questionnaires are carefully reviewed so that the right home can be found for me. When the shelter has chosen the home they think is the right fit, only then will that person be called for a meet and greet.\n\nFor a questionnaire to be sent to you via email, please contact Sue at\n412-389-2480 or email her at turfg979@verizon.net",

Kevin\u2019s former life was in a backyard pen without much socialization other than with his brother (Joe, also with a Lucky13 foster family). Kevin loves other dogs and is great with kids (cats unknown). He prefers not being alone and will follow other dogs around until they either play with him or tell him to go away. He\u2019s discovering that people pats are great, and he will ask for attention with small licks to your hands. Since Kevin had little socialization previously, most things are new to him. Because of this, he can be timid with new people and stands back in new situations until he sees that he\u2019s welcome and safe. He is acclimating well and happily learning the joys of treats and toys and cuddles. He\u2019s also learning all about leashes and while not particularly happy about being alone in a kennel, is managing it as well as can be expected. Kevin is not a jumper and is not showing aggressive behaviors. He\u2019s a big boy who doesn\u2019t realize his size, but still plays He will be a great addition to your family if you give him a chance!\n\nKevin will come with age appropriate shots, microchip, deworming, and neuter. His adoption fee is $250.\n\nIn order to adopt, please submit an application by visiting this page \nhttps://forms.gle/Tc2jvVQ1oYjPSwmeA \n\nLucky 13 Rescue www.lucky13rescue.org",

Rather we are looking for guardians who are experienced with active large breed dogs. Baker is very strong and with his enthusiasm to play can be a handful. Still he is also cuddly and affectionate and a kind look goes a long way with him. At only 14 months, Baker can be like a very large puppy on the loose. Obedience training is highly recommended for him to become the great adult dog we know he can be. In his last home his energy level was just too overwhelming for their other dog so it would be best if he was an only pup. No cats please. As with all bully breeds, Baker is a sensitive fellow who would love to be someone's couch buddy. Buddy does have allergies to poultry so his diet must be monitored, otherwise he is in great shape. If you are looking for a companion who can fit in for both play and quiet times, Baker may be for you.\nPlease note, due to the current COVID-19 pandemic our adoption process has changed. \nPlease visit our website https://spca.bc.ca/adoption/how-to-adopt/ \nfor more information and to apply for the animal you are interested in. All adoptions are by appointment only once we have received and approved an application.\n\n*Due to the high number of applications we receive for our animals, we will only be contacting potential adopters to further review their application.

He is a American Staffordshire Terrier weighing in at 70 lbs of total beauty!  He and his brother, Pilsner, were both strays in Bartlett, Tennessee. Their owners were found, but because he was hit by a car, they chose not to claim either boy. He is doing great now that his elbow dislocation has been repaired. We realize how incredibly difficult it will be to find a home for both of these brothers together, but we are hoping we are due a miracle or two. They both love attention, cuddling on the couch and patrolling the yard. They love playing outside and are learning a few manners along the way. They love to go for rides in the car and truly love each other. They have excellent leash manners, even though they get excited from time to time. They are housebroken and crate trained, but much prefer being out with you. They ABSOLUTELY ADORE TOYS, especially those that squeak and crinkle. You will most likely find them in a toy box, if given the chance.  They have adorable personalities, especially once they get to know you and settle in. They would love going on hikes, spending the day at the beach or sitting by a bonfire. Whatever the adventure, these two are your boys!\n\nIf you are interested in these adorable, loving, adventurous young men, please get your apps in as fast as you can!\n\nTHE APPLICATION LINK CAN BE FOUND ON OUR PETFINDER PAGE UNDER THE PICTURE. \n\n\nANIMAL INFORMATION:  \nName:  Collins\nBreed:  American Staffordshire Terrier\nGender:  Male         \nAge:  1 1/2 years      \nWeight: 70 lbs           \nSpayed/Neutered: Yes    \nVaccines: Current                      \nHeartworm:  Tested negative on 1/5/2021, currently on Heartgard\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nFOSTER EVALUATION AND RECOMMENDATION:\nDogs:  Yes, fostering with dogs of various sizes, breeds and genders\nCats:  Unknown\nOther Small Animals:  Unknown\nChildren:  Yes, older children.

Our animals are fostered in various locations in the a South and in New England. Our fosters and adoption coordinators are the backbone of what we do. Our fosters work tirelessly to integrate our rescue animals into their home, so that we can provide as much information to potential adopters as possible. In addition, our coordinators offer as much information regarding the medical and behavioral and personality characteristics as is known to our organization. Without them, and our extremely generous donors, we would not be able to save as many animals as we do every day. With each adoption, we operate a Pay It Forward program, whenever possible, to help other animals in our rescue and future animals in need. \n\nIf you are interested in one of our animals, please complete an application. The application link can be found on our Petfinder homepage under the picture. You may also find our application on our website at www.petmatchmakerrescue.com under the Adopt page.

Please complete an application if you are interested and we will keep you apprised of their current status. We are all volunteers who work full-time jobs and have animals of our own, so please be patient with us. We will get back with you as quickly as possible.  \n\nIf you are interested in fostering for our organization, please complete an application.

They are working on using their puppy pads, they love to play with their stuffed animals (crinkle, squeaky), & love to cuddle and take naps.  They have been fostered with kittens and a young dog. Dad was noted as being a boxer and mom is noted as being a lab.  These babies will melt your hearts. Their adoption fee is $400.00\n\nOtto Memorial Park \"Otto\", male\nHe is little and mighty, he likes to act tough but he is really a love bug who loves attention and to be held. Otto's adoption fee is $400\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

Toby is a \u201cyoung\u201d senior who is strong and physically active.\n\nPlease read all about Toby (below) and if you feel you are a good match for him and want to meet him, please complete an application found on our website, Toby\u2019s foster home is in Olympia, WA.\nwww.mywayhomedogrescue.org\n\nLittle Toby was adopted from a shelter in 2019 and his person has recently ended up in the hospital and is now unable to care for him. \n\nToby is such a good boy! He is crate trained and does great on leash. He is house-trained, great in the car and good with other dogs. He is a confident dog but not overly bossy. He is an independent boy that will snuggle in his crate (door open) for the night and in the morning awake ready to go.\n\nToby\u2019s perfect home will have a person or couple that likes walks, car rides and wants a charming, gentle buddy to share their lives. Toby can be an only dog or have a dog buddy in the house hold. Toby has a cat in his foster home and sometimes growls at her but has no issues with her being near him. He has not been tested with children so children over 10 only.\n\nToby has had his vaccinations, was heart wormed tested, has been neutered, de-wormed, had flea treatment, and is microchipped. His adoption fee is $300 (our senior adoption fee).",

Because of his age and energy, we are looking for an experienced home that can provide lots of training and guidance. He knows all the basics and is very food motivated, but would benefit from further instruction. Please learn more about Hounds and their character traits to be sure Pabu is the best fit. He has a loud coonhound bark that he uses when he's excited, whether that be from seeing other people, dogs, or who knows what. \n\nSpeaking of exciting things, he does well with other dogs and loves to meet and lick strangers. He loves to follow scent trails and would excel at nose work. We are hoping to find him a home with a yard, and with tolerant neighbors. \n\nTo inquire about Pabu, send an application - http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/AnimalShelter/Dog%20Adoption%20Questionnaire_Fillable.pdf \n- to animalcare@seattle.gov",

All inquiries must be done by email; we do not take phone calls on inquiries but do answer our emails quickly.  You will find the application below.  We can hold the puppy for 3 days once application is approved.  We do not ship/transport any of our puppies, but we will adopt out of state; you will need to make arrangements to pick up the puppy. Adoption fees will vary.\n\n\nI am a sweet little puppy who was either sent to the pound, dropped off somewhere along the roadside or turned in by my owner who no longer wanted me. Lucky for me I was rescued and am now looking for my forever home. I have been taken good care of while in my foster home. I have had my shot(s), dewormed and flea/tick preventative applied and if I am old enough I have been altered. All I need now is a home with a family to love! \n\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION (copy and paste into an email listed as contact for this pet):\n\nFFHS Adoption Application\nName of the pet you are applying for:\nYour full name:\nAddress:\nCity:\nState & Zip:\nDriver's License State:\nAge of person filling out application:\nAre there children in the home?

            "description": "This amazing jokester is the full package\u2014athletic, smart, spry, fun-loving, obedient and young enough to take on the world right by your side!  \n\nPlease meet Pilsner!  He is a American Staffordshire Terrier weighing in at 70 lbs of total beauty!  He and his brother were both strays in Bartlett, Tennessee. Their owners were found, but because his brother, Collins, was hit by a car, they chose not to claim either boy. We realize how incredibly difficult it will be to find a home for both of these brothers together, but we are hoping we are due a miracle or two. They both love attention, cuddling on the couch and patrolling the yard. They love playing outside and are learning a few manners along the way. They love to go for rides in the car and truly love each other. They have excellent leash manners, even though they get excited from time to time. They are housebroken and crate trained, but much prefer being out with you. They ABSOLUTELY ADORE TOYS, especially those that squeak and crinkle. You will most likely find them in a toy box, if given the chance.  They have adorable personalities, especially once they get to know you and settle in. They would love going on hikes, spending the day at the beach or sitting by a bonfire. Whatever the adventure, these two are your boys!\n\nIf you are interested in these adorable, loving, adventurous young men, please get your apps in as fast as you can!\n\nTHE APPLICATION LINK CAN BE FOUND ON OUR PETFINDER PAGE UNDER THE PICTURE. \n\n\nANIMAL INFORMATION:  \nName:  Pilsner\nBreed:  American Staffordshire Terrier\nGender:  Male         \nAge:  2 years      \nWeight: 70 lbs           \nSpayed/Neutered: Yes    \nVaccines: Current                      \nHeartworm:  Tested negative on 1/5/2021, currently on Heartgard\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nFOSTER EVALUATION AND RECOMMENDATION:\nDogs:  Yes, fostering with dogs of various sizes, breeds and genders\nCats:  Unknown\nOther Small Animals:  Unknown\nChildren:  Yes, older children.

Our animals are fostered in various locations in the a South and in New England. Our fosters and adoption coordinators are the backbone of what we do. Our fosters work tirelessly to integrate our rescue animals into their home, so that we can provide as much information to potential adopters as possible. In addition, our coordinators offer as much information regarding the medical and behavioral and personality characteristics as is known to our organization. Without them, and our extremely generous donors, we would not be able to save as many animals as we do every day. With each adoption, we operate a Pay It Forward program, whenever possible, to help other animals in our rescue and future animals in need. \n\nIf you are interested in one of our animals, please complete an application. The application link can be found on our Petfinder homepage under the picture. You may also find our application on our website at www.petmatchmakerrescue.com under the Adopt page. If they are listed on our website, their adoptions have not been finalized yet. That does not mean that we have not received several applications, already. Please complete an application if you are interested and we will keep you apprised of their current status. We are all volunteers who work full-time jobs and have animals of our own, so please be patient with us. We will get back with you as quickly as possible.  \n\nIf you are interested in fostering for our organization, please complete an application.

            "description": "Tina Marina has been described as an \u201cENGAGING\u201d little dog.  Everyone that meets her falls under her magical spell.  At 10 years old and 4 \u00bd lbs, she packs an enormous amount of love and loyalty in such a small package.\n \nTina\u2019s background is unknown, but this is what we do know:  \n     She acts like a much younger dog.  She will follow you everywhere and melts your heart when she looks at you. \n     She will dance with you.  Yes, she dances.  You can request the video if you want to see it. \n     She is friendly with all people, dogs, cats, and chickens. \n     She is very diligent if she wants something and you will be entertained watching her think and plot how to get it. \n     She is house and crate trained (as long as she can go outside regularly).  She knows how to scratch the door to come in and she even scratched the door once to go out. \n     She is also a great traveler.  She really enjoys a good road trip and is well mannered when visiting other places.\n     She has the most adorable growly bark, especially at mealtime.  She will talk to you if you talk to her.\n     Tina is fixed and has no teeth.  She has all her immunizations and a clean bill of health from the vet.\n \nPlease complete an application on our website at http://rescueachi.com/adoption-application/ if you would like to meet Tina Marina, but hurry because she won\u2019t last long!\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n\nDid I catch your eye? Learn more about me by reading my profile below; I just might be your new best friend! Apply on our website\n(\n\nhttps://www.healingheartsrescue.org/adopt\n\n)\n\nto\n\nset up a private meeting or check below for my adoption event schedule.\n\nAge: 1 year old\n\nWeight: 45 pounds\n\nDog friendly: Yes - another dog is REQUIRED in her home\n\nCat friendly: Unknown\n\nKid friendly: YES - but prefers a quite home\n\nPotty trained: YES\n\nCrate trained: TBD\n\nFENCED YARD REQUIRED\n\nDo you enjoy relaxing inside, watching your shows, and having a quiet household? Addie does too! She would much rather lay on the couch than go for a walk! Loud noises (and some \"not as loud noises\" like the printer or blender) are scary and people coming over make her nervous. It takes a bit for her to be comfortable with new surroundings, but when she is-she finds her favorite spots and snuggles right into them. She loves other dogs and gets along with all kinds. She gets along with all humans. Addie comes from an initial situation where she may not have been given space to play or explore. Her previous foster in Texas said she was nervous and shy at first too, but opened up and became super loving, affectionate, and very playful.\n\nShe is spayed and potty trained. She hasn't shown confidence in leashes and shys away from going outdoors unnecessarily. The previous foster said she was crate trained, but she hasn't shown interest in going in the one available here. She hasn't met any cats yet, but I think she would be fine with them.\n\nAddie needs someone who will be patient, kind and understanding of her anxiety. She is quiet, smart, sweet and submissive. When she wags her tail you know you've found a way into her heart and it is so rewarding.\n\nAdoption Fee: $425\n\nINTERESTED IN MEETING ME?\n\nIf you'd like to arrange a private meeting or begin the adoption process, please fill out an adoption application by visiting\n\nhttps://www.healingheartsrescue.org/adopt\n\n**Note on breed and age determination:\n\nBreed and age are often determined on appearance, our own knowledge, veterinarian advice, and/or information from the sending shelters or previous owners. Most of our adoptable dogs were previously stray dogs with little history, we can't be 100% sure of a dog's breed mix, and unless there is a specific date of birth listed, we can't be 100% sure of a dog's age. Additionally, our assessments of a dog's interactions with other dogs, cats, or children are based on OUR experiences. Your experience may differ.\n\nADOPTION FEE INCLUDES:\n\nWellness check\n\nSpay/neuter (puppies adopted with required spay/neuter certificate)\n\nAge appropriate vaccines - rabies as required by law and distemper combo or proof of positive titer test\n\nHeartworm test if over 7 months of age\n\nFecal test and/or deworming for parasites\n\nMicrochip\n\n\n\n~ Healing Hearts rescue will also provide dental procedures, bloodwork, surgeries, and/or any other additional vet work as needed while dogs are in our care.\n\n~ Adoption fees are non-negotiable and fees are listed on the dog's profile\n\n~ Adoption fees can be paid the following ways with the required sales tax (7.525%) added:\n\nPayPal\n\nCredit Card\n\nCash\n\nWANT TO HELP SAVE MORE DOGS?\n\nHealing Hearts Rescue is a nonprofit, foster-based rescue\n\nlocated in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota\n\nthat is 100% funded through adoption fees and donations\n\n. We are excited for you to join us on this mission to save the lives of dogs in need.\n\nWe believe every dog deserves to be loved as true members of a family and are committed to fulfilling that dream one dog at a time! Sign up to foster, volunteer or donate on our\nwebsite\n\nHealing Hearts rescue will also provide dental procedures, bloodwork, surgeries, and/or any other additional vet work as needed while dogs are in our care.",

All inquiries must be done by email; we do not take phone calls on inquiries but do answer our emails quickly.  You will find the application below.  We can hold the puppy for 3 days once application is approved.  We do not ship/transport any of our puppies, but we will adopt out of state; you will need to make arrangements to pick up the puppy. Adoption fees will vary.\n\n\nI am a sweet little puppy who was either sent to the pound, dropped off somewhere along the roadside or turned in by my owner who no longer wanted me. Lucky for me I was rescued and am now looking for my forever home. I have been taken good care of while in my foster home. I have had my shot(s), dewormed and flea/tick preventative applied and if I am old enough I have been altered. All I need now is a home with a family to love! \n\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION (copy and paste into an email listed as contact for this pet):\n\nFFHS Adoption Application\nName of the pet you are applying for:\nYour full name:\nAddress:\nCity:\nState & Zip:\nDriver's License State:\nAge of person filling out application:\nAre there children in the home?

Lucky for me I was rescued and am now looking for my forever home. I have been taken good care of while in my foster home. I have had my shot(s), dewormed and flea/tick preventative applied and if I am old enough I have been altered. All I need now is a home with a family to love! \n\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION (copy and paste into an email listed as contact for this pet):\n\nFFHS Adoption Application\nName of the pet you are applying for:\nYour full name:\nAddress:\nCity:\nState & Zip:\nDriver's License State:\nAge of person filling out application:\nAre there children in the home?

            "description": "Date of birth:  6/24/2019\n\n1/31/2021:  Morris is a super cute American Staffordshire!  He\u2019s a year old and weighs 64 lbs currently.  Morris LOVES people and loves attention! He\u2019s sweet natured and very affectionate. He'd love to just hang out and watch tv with his new person!\n\n\u2022 Morris\u2019s left rear leg had been broken awhile back and healed poorly. The head of the femur was shattered. He had FHO surgery to repair it on December 12.  He\u2019s doing pretty well, but not putting enough weight on that leg. We\u2019re doing exercises with him twice a day.  We\u2019ll reevaluate his leg in a couple of weeks and be able to tell you more then.\n\n\u2022 Morris is looking for a home with someone who is home quite a lot. He\u2019d been abandoned at his prior home and, understandably, his top priority now is to be with people and not be left alone.  Someone who works from home would be perfect for him.\n\n\u2022 Morris needs a home where he'd be an only pet, without other dogs or cats in the home. \n\n\u2022 He\u2019d do best with a house and a wooden privacy fence\u2014 he runs the chain link fence when another dog is the adjacent yard. He doesn\u2019t like to be outside alone for long\u2014 he wants back inside where the people are.\n\n\u2022 He loves food and treats!  He should be easy to train. He takes treats gently.\n\n\u2022 He walks nicely on a leash.\n\n\u2022 He\u2019s had a hard life and will need someone patient to help him adjust to living in a house, work with him on house training, etc.  \n\n\u2022 We don\u2019t want to place him in a home with young kids. We think he would do fine with older kids who\u2019ve lived with dogs and are comfortable with dogs and are respectful. \n\n\u2022 We'd place his energy level at medium.\n\n\u2022 He likes to chew Nylabones. He isn\u2019t too interested in toys. He does not chew up bedding or blankets in his kennel. \n\n\u2022 Morris has been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for heartworms. He\u2019s a real sweetheart and will be a loving and loyal companion.  \n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE:  PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU.  Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info.\u00a0\n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.521.2339\nhsgkc.org",

Rooney is a quiet guy who loves snacks, cozy beds and his canine and human buddies. Will you be his forever BFF?\n\n* HERE'S WHAT ROONEY'S FOSTER MOM HAS TO SAY! *\n\nOnce Rooney warms up to you, he's the sweetest little boy with a lot of pep! Rooney loves adventures and long walks, but is also pretty content to nap the day away with a blanket over his head. He'll paw at you for pets, and will be your tiny shadow! Rooney is great with other people and dogs, and would flourish in a home with lots of attention.\n\nHe'll need a new family that has the patience to help him learn to be confident when he's alone and he gets attached to one person, so a home where his 'person' is home a lot would be best for him.",

They are working on using their puppy pads, they love to play with their stuffed animals (crinkle, squeaky), & love to cuddle and take naps.  They have been fostered with kittens and a young dog. Dad was noted as being a boxer and mom is noted as being a lab.  These babies will melt your hearts. \n\nMiami Whitewater \"Miami\" or Mimi\", female\ndiva-she is one of the smaller puppies and has figured out a way to squeeze through the puppy pen bars, she loves attention, she follows her foster moms around and howls if she does not get the attention that she wants, she loves to snuggle in the cat bed, she loves to be cuddled. Miami's adoption fee is $400\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

I am definitely a little stubborn and learning how to follow commands - but it's difficult.. Once I \"get it\",  I just want to lay and curl up in your arms.\n\nI love to play with other dogs but sometimes I get a little hyper and nippy. I also play a little too rough sometimes with cats especially with ones that don't want to be near me. Please don't walk up from behind me and surprise me ever - but especially when I'm eating!\u00a0 I love my chow and can get a bit reactive/aggressive if that happens!\n\nBecause of my special needs, I won't be adopted out to an environment with children under 10 years old.\n\nIt will take someone who has a lot of time to devote to training a deaf dog and a lot of one-on-one attention to be my perfect match.\n\nI am up to date with age appropriate vaccinations and have been dewormed.  I'm not yet spayed as I am too small and young.  My adoption fee is $350 with $100 to be returned to my adopter once they have me spayed. \n\nTo request an adoption application, please visit https://www.udranch.org/contact.  Please allow 24-48 hours for a response!",

            "description": "Meet Chief Winston. This beautiful 5 1/2 year old baby was adopted from us 5 years ago as a puppy. He was returned because he and the other dog in the home were no longer getting along. Winston is a 75 lb lap dog. He is an expert snuggler and loves every person he meets. He adores kids of all ages and has never met a stranger. Winston is so sad to be in his foster home. He misses his family. Please consider adopting him. He is such a good boy.\n\nChief's adoption fee is $175.\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, microchipped and if over 6 months of age, heartworm tested and on heartworm preventative in their foster home.\n\nWe require an approved application to meet any of our dogs. We do not have a shelter location and will not arrange a meeting without an approved application.\n\nWe strive to make sure the bios provided for our dogs are complete and accurate; we do understand that mistakes happen, however, so if you absolutely cannot find the answer to your question in the dog's bio, you can contact us for more information.\n\nWe require a home visit for each dog we adopt out, so we adopt within a 2 hour radius of Dayton, OH. If you are outside of this radius, we encourage you to contact your local rescue or shelter.\n\n2/2/21 12:03 PM",

I want to be your one and only!**\n**This dog would do best in an adult only home. **\n\nMedical Observation:\n1/31 (Vet Check)-- Previously spayed female, tattoo and spay scar observed. Multiple puncture wounds to left side of face around ear, lower jaw and side of face. All wounds are already scabbing over, no pocketing. Wounds do not need to be surgically repaired, should all respond well to medical management. \n1/30 (Vet Check)-- The patient has a bite wound from earlier today that appears relatively mild. She will be treated with pain medication and antibiotics while awaiting anesthetized wound care tomorrow.\n1/30 (Triage Exam)-- dog is BAR and not really interested in food at time of exam, she was bleeding from her mouth and had some dried blood in her left ear. she also had cut and puncture wounds all over her face\n\nBehavior Observation: \n1/30 (Per Vet)-- Nervous, but friendly. Very head shy - examination of wounds limited \n1/30 (Per Previous Owner)--she is very nice. she loves to run, she should not be around other dogs. Knows commands like sit, lay down, go to bed, go potty. she does not like hoodies. She is great on the leash.\n\nBITE DETAIL--\n1/30/21- The owners other dog and Cali were outside in the yard with the owners wife while she was cleaning. The other dog was sniffing a feather on the ground and Cali charged at her and bit her chest and Cali also bit the other dog nose. There were no triggers like food, Cali just attacked. Nothing in her body language alerted either owner to the attack coming. Cali has bitten the other dog before. The first incident was over food. A potato chip fell on the floor and both the dogs went after the chip at the same time. The other dog does not have to do anything to provoke Cali, it can be as simple as walking past her and Cali will lunge for her.",

Retreats to back of kennel when she spots handler. Is able to be coaxed back to front of kennel with high value treats and remains at front when door is opened. Dodges leash initially but able to be leashed with a wide loop when treats are dropped on floor. Pulls strongly on leash darting in front of handler. Outside, urinates and defecates and then starts pulling immediately back to the door. Did not attempt handling due to nervousness. Jumps right back into kennel and tries to retreat to back of kennel with leash on. Handler lets leash go so as to not hold her back and then coaxes her back to the front with treats. Drops treats on floor and able to loosen leash and drop it to floor before removing it from kennel. After closing kennel door, Hemi stays at front of kennel and licks hand through the bars.\n1/31 (Per Owner) Mild mannered, Does not get along with other dogs, Lived with childred",

Thank you!** \n\nMeet Brownie, a 3-year old, 33-pound, Mountain Cur/Dachshund/Beagle mix fellow.\n\nBrownie is a happy, generally outgoing, though sometimes shy, sweet boy. He is kind and gentle and would make a great dog for a family with children, but he is laid back enough to companion an older person just as well.\n\nHe\u2019s a loving, affectionate dog, who loves to play with other dogs, but is especially responsive to human attention. \n\nDon\u2019t those eyes just melt your heart?!\n\nAll dogs are up to /date on vaccinations and spayed/neutered at the time of adoption.  All dogs require professional training to become the best family member they can be.\n\nTo adopt or learn more about Brownie, you must fill out an adoption application. To find the application, copy and paste this URL into your browser: WWW.GDRNE.COM/ADOPTION-APPLICATION [Adoption Fee: $495]  **  PLEASE READ: If a dog is listed, then s/he is currently available for adoption. Their information is correct to the best of our abilities and the information we have been given as of the day of posting. Please note, GDRNE does not guarantee the breed of any dog or puppy unless stated that we have run DNA. All breeds listed are educated estimates. Our dogs are rescued from various situations. It is most likely that both their parents were strays and even if not, mixes of some sort and that their grandparents were mixes as well. The dog may have some genetic material of an American Staffordshire Terrier (pit bull). The dogs are usually mixes of many breeds, making them a breed all their own - a True and adorable American MUTT. If you are interested in this dog, you must submit an application. Great Dog is not a shelter so there is no building you can visit. Our dogs live in private foster homes until adopted. To learn more about our *shelterless* rescue, adoption fees, and procedures, review the list of Frequently Asked Questions on our website at WWW.GDRNE.COM.",

            "description": "#711654Age: 5 years. Weight: 56 lbs How this pet arrived: This pet was brought in by their Previous Owner on January 31, 2020. At SDHS:This pet has been vaccinated, microchipped and neutered. This pet is now ready for their new home! Why this pet is the one for you:Abram is intelligent and driven by the need for speed! Huskies were bred to run while pulling something heavy for miles in polar conditions so giving them enough exercise is no easy feat! The average dog may be happy with 2-3 30 min walks daily , but that won't cut it for this guy! Abram craves adventure and if you don't give him what he needs he'll go look for it on his own! Huskies are escape artist who could give Houdini a run for his money. They can jump over, dig under, or swim around any obstacle between them and a good time. For that reason, having a yard isn't what is important for a dog like Abram. He is a marathon mutt who is looking for an athletic human who has the same compulsion to wake up and GO every single day. If you love to run, bike, Rollerblade, skateboard, or hike, and you are looking for a dog with endurance and energy then Abram may be your guy! If your daily work outs have become stale and you're looking for a partner to bring new excitement to your runs, bikes, or hikes then what are you waiting for? Make an appointment to learn more about this wild man today!\n\n\n Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: White Weight: 50.6lbs Age: 5yrs 1mths 0wks Animal has been Neutered",

            "description": "Boxy headed, big hearted goofball loversJarvis is waiting for you. And by waiting, we actually mean he is running around the farm, having a blast, making buddies at every turn, eating like a champ and overall winning over everyone he meets to the Boxy Head Lovers Club at Saving Grace. Jarvis is a young lab mix who is about a year or so old and weighs around 40 lbs now but needs to gain a few as he isn't as bulky as he should be. No worries, he is working daily on that btw. Jarvis would easily melt into a home with other dogs as he seems always on the lookout for partners in crime, and by crime, we mean being ridiculously cute exploring and doing zoomies. Jarvis may not have a lot of home training yet, but he is a gentleman and waits in his crate for meals as well as his time out. He would make a fab adventure buddy as he would likely be up for anything from trips to Lowes, where he could woo all the ladies, to hikes in the mountains and summers at the beach. He is game for it all! Jarvis would love as many family members as he can find and is ready to become one to your clan.\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

In the meantime, she's having fun getting to know the DMV and playing in the snow!\n\nIf you are interested in adding this pup to your family, please submit an application at www.petrescuealliance.com. All questions will be answered and meet and greets set up following a review of application. If the dog is listed on our website or Petfinder, they are still available! Pet Rescue Alliance does our best to provide accurate information about the dogs we have available for adoption. We cannot make any guarantees about age, breed or temperament.",

Until we can safely to resume normal operations, we will be taking deposits and doing adoptions by appointment only on Fridays and Saturdays from noon until 3.  We know it\u2019s difficult to choose a lifetime companion animal from a picture but it\u2019s been working out well for our adopters and most importantly, for the animals in our care. The financial impact is obvious but we're committed to keeping our community and volunteers as safe as possible and providing the best of care for our animals.  Any donations are greatly appreciated to help PAWS provided that care.  Thank you.\n\nWhen we were asked to take Annie, we were told that she\u2019s deaf.  After having her with us for a bit, we\u2019d have to agree.  At a minimum, Annie is hearing impaired.  Deaf pups, especially the young ones like Annie at only 12 weeks old, should pick up hand signals quite well.  She\u2019ll be a medium sized lady when she\u2019s all grown up.  Her adoption fee is $225.\n\n\nAll of our animals are provided with age appropriate vaccinations, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. \nPAWS has added the H3N2/H3N8 combo flu vaccine to its shot protocol. Every dog is being vaccinated upon intake, however we urge adopters to get a second flu shot for their new family member to ensure as much protection against the flu as possible.\nTo meet our incredible dogs and offer them the love they deserve, stop by PAWS on Friday, Saturday or Sunday from 10 - 4 PM, call us at 217-243-7297. We do applications in person or over the phone. You can also see pictures on our Facebook page, PAWS Jackson.  With an approved application, a deposit will hold your new best friend for up to 1 week to allow you time to come to PAWS.  This deposit is not refundable nor transferable.",

Thankfully all five dogs recovered with veterinary supervision and lots of love poured into them. Tacho is 5 months and weighs 16 lbs. He is a terrier x pug mix and is as cute as can be. He is a happy, social, and sweet boy that was raised in a foster home with dogs, cats, horses, bunnies, goats, and tortoises. Do you think Tacho would be a good fit for your household?

A typical Beagle, he knows & responds to his basic commands most of the time - sit, stay, lie down, come -- but is curious, smart, & can be distracted by more interesting things. He loves long daily walks- the earlier in the day the better, 2 x per day even better!  It helps to keep him settled. He loves his long walks along the Humber with his foster Mom!  He enjoys playtime & snuggling in his very calm, quiet foster home where he follows Mom around. \"Music for my dog\" on YouTube works for him!  He's friendly & great with people & other low key friendly dogs. He loves cats a little too much for their comfort & gets in their face. Roscoe was rescued from an intolerable situation, where he was passed around from home to home. He is highly anxious & fearful of loud noises, yelling, screaming, & banging. He then chases his tail & runs to find a 'safe' place.  He's much more settled now. We are looking for a quiet, adult experienced home with a low activity level where he can continue to progress. A home close to parks & trails, with a fenced backyard would be preferred.  Someone who works from home & has time to engage with him would be best. No kids/no grandkids/no noisy neighbourhood/no condos or apartments.  Interested?  Contact Sue:  sgaskell@sympatico.ca.  Adoption fee: $800.\n\n\n\n",

We think these pups will be medium to large 45-60#\nThese are very social and friendly puppies who love people and cats and kids.\n\nBrindy Cali have your average puppy personality: silly, goofy, sweet, loving and AWESOME.  Want to adopt me?  \nInterested in becoming a forever home for Brindy Cali? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Brindy Cali.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Brindy Cali the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \n\nOur adoption fee is $525. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

First, dogs just want to be happy and feel loved. Living inside and being a part of the family is really important to us. A lot of the things you need as humans to stay happy and healthy, us dogs need too. We depend on you for things like vet visits, nutritious food, clean water, social and play time with people and other pets, training classes, toys, and of course, lots of love and attention! Regular baths, nail trims and grooming help us to look and feel our best, while monthly flea and heartworm prevention help us to stay healthy. Did you know that depending on our size and breed, dogs can live up to 20 years? Just think of the wonderful life we could have together!",

            "description": "Hello, my name is Duke! I was surrendered to the shelter because I was not getting along with the existing dog in my house. I'm a very mouthy young dog. I have an inappropriate playstyle and display some rude behaviors. The behavior team here at the shelter have noticed that I seem to enjoy conflict. This is important information to know because it will affect the methods used for handling and training me to make sure I am successful in my new home. My new home should consist of adults only who have prior dog handling experience. Continued obedience training and keeping me mentally/physically fullfilled will be a must. Please keep checking my profile for updates as the staff gets to know me better! If this dog has been successful in our play groups it is not a guarantee that a dog will be social with other dogs in their home or in public settings. Dogs are individuals and have personality conflicts, just like us. Play groups do not guarantee that territorial or resource guarding issues will not surface in the home. While play groups do help us get to know the dog's better, once they are adopted their new environments and new relationships will influence their behavior in ways we cannot predict. The Adoption Fee Includes: - initial canine distemper combination vaccination - first worming or stool check - rabies vaccination (for animals over 3 months of age) - AVID microchipping - flea treatment/preventative - spaying or neutering Adoption fee: $135.00 Per state law, ALL ADOPTERS must purchase a non-refundable 2021 dog license at time of adoption for any canine three months and older. The cost of the license is $7.00. (Senior Citizen or Person with Disability-$5.00) Leash and collar included",

Love to go for long walks on the beach or hiking mountains? I'm the pup for you! Ok, so we don't have many beaches or any mountains nearby, but the point is I want to be with you every step of the way! I cannot go to a home with cats or any critters and if there are other dogs, I would prefer them to be male dogs. I need to meet any children or dogs in the home to make sure it's a perfect match. Sadie will be shown by appointment only. If you are interested in learning more about this animal, please fill out an application by clicking here . Be sure to include Sadie 0934632 when filling out the survey. After reviewing your application, we will only be reaching out to you if the animal is a good fit for your home.",

One of his favorite things is getting into your lap and then rolling over onto his side to be close to you. Oreo's previous owner said he's a good dog, friendly w/adults (never lived w/kids), housetrained, well-mannered and never tried to escape. When he arrived at DFL, Oreo was fearful. After training, today he's much more relaxed w/new people; after his walks, he likes to visit lobby staff and we'll give you tips for how to reinforce his confidence. Oreo doesn't like restraints, so we'll also give you tips on how to respect his sensitivity about the way his body is handled. Oreo will be so happy w/an active, loving owner to play and exercise with and love morning, noon and night! Age 10+.",

My foster home has 3 kids, 4 to 14, and I love to play with all of them. I haven't been around other dogs, but being I\u2019m a pretty submissive male and I think I would like them. \n\nI enjoy playing with my toys, balls (I'm working on playing catch, I throw the ball to myself sometimes) taking long walks or short, your choice. I am completely housebroken, and semi crate trained. I would enjoy a home where someone is home most of the time, like I said, I love my people. I would like a fenced yard, but it\u2019s not a must as long as you like to take walks.  \n\nI'm a great dog, looking for my own family to love!\nOur standard adoption fee is $375 cash or check and $385 credit card ($10 processing fee). .  It includes spay/neuter when age appropriate at our participating vets, age appropriate core vaccinations, fecal testing, deworming, flea and tick preventative,1st vet visit at one of our participating vets, and micro-chipping. \n\n\nWe must have an application, conduct a phone interview, and meet your entire family to approve an adoption. Please email adopt@safehavendogsIL.org for an application or additional details.\n\nPlease note that the breeds and sizes posted in this biography are educated best guesses and are not guaranteed.\n\nPlease consider becoming a foster home while you search for your new best friend. We need foster homes - pounds are overflowing with puppies and adult dogs that are at-risk and need help. We can only rescue as many as we have foster home commitments. Fostering is a rewarding experience for your family.",

Thank you!** \n\nThis is Boomer, a 2-year old, 45-pound, Mountain Cur/Shepherd mix young fellow.\n\nHandsome Boomer can be shy when he first meets someone, but he\u2019s a very kind and gentle dog who is basically very happy and loving.\n\nOnce he gets to know someone, he comes out of his shell and lavishes you with the full shine of his shining, sunny, affectionate personality. He loves children and although he can be a little wary around a new dog, when he gets to know the other pup, he makes fast friend.\n\nBoomer\u2019s only drawback is that he does occasionally get carsick.\n\nAll dogs are up to date on vaccinations and spayed/neutered at the time of adoption.  All dogs require professional training to become the best family member they can be.\n\nTo adopt or learn more about Boomer, you must fill out an adoption application. To find the application, copy and paste this URL into your browser: WWW.GDRNE.COM/ADOPTION-APPLICATION [Adoption Fee: $495]  **  PLEASE READ: If a dog is listed, then s/he is currently available for adoption. Their information is correct to the best of our abilities and the information we have been given as of the day of posting. Please note, GDRNE does not guarantee the breed of any dog or puppy unless stated that we have run DNA. All breeds listed are educated estimates. Our dogs are rescued from various situations. It is most likely that both their parents were strays and even if not, mixes of some sort and that their grandparents were mixes as well. The dog may have some genetic material of an American Staffordshire Terrier (pit bull). The dogs are usually mixes of many breeds, making them a breed all their own - a True and adorable American MUTT. If you are interested in this dog, you must submit an application. Great Dog is not a shelter so there is no building you can visit. Our dogs live in private foster homes until adopted. To learn more about our *shelterless* rescue, adoption fees, and procedures, review the list of Frequently Asked Questions on our website at WWW.GDRNE.COM.",

This 7-month old floppy and playful puppy came to us after being found as a stray. Zelda is charmingly puppy-like in all that she does and is always up for adventure. She enjoys being close to her humans - on the couch, in the yard, and as an adorable co-pilot in the front seat on rides. In fact, Zelda is a New Englander at heart and loves frolicking in the snowa snow bunny who also loves toys and chewing on nylabones. And her mischievous side loves stealing things that aren't hers.\n\nZelda knows basic commands, walks well on leash, and is easy at bath time. She is working on basic manners (like puppy mouthiness and jumping) and is picking up housetraining like a champ. She is an eager beaver when it comes to pleasing her humans and indiscriminately affectionate with those she holds dear.\n\nZelda is working on her doggie manners when playing with her canine foster brother. She plays rough, so the best canine siblings would be tolerant and able to correct her when they had enough. And she's a little too interested in kitties to live with one. This lanky lady will make someone a terrific friend!www.pittieloverescue.org\n\nPlease consider a donation so that we may continue the important work we do.",

Until we can safely to resume normal operations, we will be taking deposits and doing adoptions by appointment only on Fridays and Saturdays from noon until 3.  We know it\u2019s difficult to choose a lifetime companion animal from a picture but it\u2019s been working out well for our adopters and most importantly, for the animals in our care. The financial impact is obvious but we're committed to keeping our community and volunteers as safe as possible and providing the best of care for our animals.  Any donations are greatly appreciated to help PAWS provided that care.  Thank you.\n\nIndy is a 10 month old beauty who is supposed to be a Boxer/Bully mix.  We honestly don\u2019t know what her breed is but those eyes will steal your heart.  Indy is somewhat apprehensive around the human males and we\u2019re not sure why.  She might do best as  a girl\u2019s girl.  She weighs about 30 pounds and her adoption fee is $175.\n\nAll of our animals are provided with age appropriate vaccinations, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. \nPAWS has added the H3N2/H3N8 combo flu vaccine to its shot protocol. Every dog is being vaccinated upon intake, however we urge adopters to get a second flu shot for their new family member to ensure as much protection against the flu as possible.\nTo meet our incredible dogs and offer them the love they deserve, stop by PAWS on Friday, Saturday or Sunday from 10 - 4 PM, call us at 217-243-7297. We do applications in person or over the phone. You can also see pictures on our Facebook page, PAWS Jackson.  With an approved application, a deposit will hold your new best friend for up to 1 week to allow you time to come to PAWS.  This deposit is not refundable nor transferable.",

            "description": "Hi my name is Clara. I'm approximately 8 months old. I was found running by the river in Dayton. I am deaf and require a special home. I am super smart and have a lot of potential. I have already learned several hand signals. My favorite things to do are play, eat, sleep and snuggle. I love other dogs, especially dogs closer to my size and I absolutely love people. However I'm not so sure about cats. I will require a lot of patience, understanding and love. Are you the right family for me? I can provide you with a lifetime of love. Clara's adoption fee is $200. She is up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, spayed, and microchipped.\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, microchipped and if over 6 months of age, heartworm tested and on heartworm preventative in their foster home.\n\nWe require an approved application to meet any of our dogs. We do not have a shelter location and will not arrange a meeting without an approved application.\n\nWe strive to make sure the bios provided for our dogs are complete and accurate; we do understand that mistakes happen, however, so if you absolutely cannot find the answer to your question in the dog's bio, you can contact us for more information.\n\nWe require a home visit for each dog we adopt out, so we adopt within a 2 hour radius of Dayton, OH. If you are outside of this radius, we encourage you to contact your local rescue or shelter.",

We are working with him to return him to being the sweet and happy little guy we know he is. When we first met Toby last year he was a gentleman in a house and just loved to go for walks. He was adopted out and recently returned because he would nip. We are not sure what happened but he is currently being sent for a senior medical evaluation to help us determine if there is a medical cause for what is going on. After the evaluation he will be available for foster or adoption. If you would like to meet little Toby please email Erin at muellenbergerin@gmail.com for an application and to set up an appointment\n\n---\n\nCome meet our dogs Saturdays and Sundays at Petsmart in Costa Mesa from 11:30-2:30. All A Home 4 Ever Rescue dogs receive a wellness exam by our veterinarian and are up to date with vaccinations. They are spayed or neutered and microchipped before they go to their adoptive families. If you would like more information please email the adoption Director muellenbergerin@gmail.com",

She is a 10-week-old Pitbull mix and weighs about 12lbs! We were originally on a rescue for another dog when our director Lisa spotted Godiva and her brother being transported loosely in the bed of a truck. When Lisa inquired with the drivers, they said the puppies were for sale and Lisa paid them off to bring these babies into our care for medical, and to find them an incredible forever home.\n\n\nGodiva is super friendly, smart, curious and adventurous. She greets every human and dog with a wagging tail and just as much as she loves to play with her brother and other dogs, she loves for the humans to join. While playful, she is also very laid back and will put herself to bed when she\u2019s tired. According to her fosters, she is nearly potty trained and we\u2019re very happy about that!\n\nGodiva is going to grow up to be a big, strong girl (60-70lbs) and will need a dedicated family preferably with bully breed experience who will give her LOTS of needed daily exercise. Like any of our Pitties, her adopter will be required to invest in training! Applicants must have a backyard and preferably another doggy sibling.\n\n\nPlease apply on our website in order to be considered www.bigloveanimalrescue.org\n\n\nApplicants must be based in Southern California and if there are children in the home, children must be 10+ years or older.\n\n\nAdoption fee is $500. Our rescue covers microchip, vaccinations to adoption date and spaying at one of our veterinarians in Los Angeles when she is old enough.\n\n\nIf you're interested in GODIVA, please visit our website and fill out an application here: https://bigloveanimalrescue.org/adoption-application-form/\n\n \n\n**No meet and greets prior to approved application**",

            "description": "Looking for an all around fun dog?  Gypsy just may be your girl!  Although it took her about an hour or two to warm up, Gypsy is an absolute gem.  Gypsy just loves life and is always happy.  \n\nShe loves hopping in your lap and rolling around for belly rubs.  Gypsy is definitely a lover and will give you endless kisses.  Gypsy is great with several of the dogs in her foster home.  As I type she is wagging her tail playing with some of the pups.  She does well in the crate and has not had any accidents. \n\nGypsy has had no formal training but is quick to learn.  She has already worked on mastering sit for treats, lol, and we began working on down as well.  Gypsy would love to learn other tricks either through informal or formal training. \n\n Gypsy does need a little leash work however that is very typical of rescue pups.  Gypsy would be a great walking companion once she masters these skills but don\u2019t worry, not a walker, she will be just as content hanging out on the couch with you.  \n\nGypsy is a one year old possible mountain cur/boxer mix that is approximately fifty pounds.  This gal has the softest fur and beautiful markings on her paws and muzzle.  If Gypsy sounds like the perfect dog for you, apply today to meet this sweetie.  \n\nIf you would like to meet Gypsy, please go to our website at www.rescueahart.org and fill out an online adoption application. \n\nAll HART dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped and up to date on all vaccines, including bordatella and rabies.   They are heartworm tested and on preventative for heartworm, fleas, and ticks.   If you are interested in any of our pets, you must complete an online dog adoption application   at www.rescueAhart.org .   The application will put you in touch with this wonderful dog's foster family so you can schedule a meeting.   Thanks!   www.rescueAhart.org",

This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public.

We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

She is the full package\u2014athletic, smart, spry, fun-loving, obedient and young enough to take on the world right by your side!  Shhhh!  Don\u2019t tell her that she is a tripod, she has no idea!\n\nPlease meet Sassy Pants!  She is a Lab mix weighing in at 35 lbs of total cuteness!  This sweet young lady was living on the streets, eating chicken bones and dodging cars, when her luck finally ran out!  Unfortunately for her, the vet was unable to save her leg, but fortunately, it has not stopped her zest for life. This adorable girl is also the slickest bag lady this side of the Rio Grande. She can nab something and save it for later, without you even realizing she was up. She doesn\u2019t destroy her finds, but she knows she may need them for later. So....grab a buggy and have it waiting!  She loves attention, cuddling on the couch and chasing a toy or a friend!  She loves playing outside and is learning a few manners along the way. She still likes to help you cook, if you will let her, and she can find every morsel that you drop. She is learning commands, walks very well on a leash and loves to ride in a car. She will try to get out with you, just in case you need help, and riding shotgun is super fun!  She is housebroken and crate trained, but consistency is key to her continued training. She loves to play with friends and take leisurely strolls patrolling the yard. She ABSOLUTELY ADORES TOYS, especially those that squeak and crinkle. You will most likely find her in a toy box, if given the chance.  She loves to snuggle with her friends and sleeping on her back is totally awesome. She has an adorable personality, especially once she gets to know you and settles in. She will need a friend to keep her company and a fenced in yard to run and play. She would love going on short hikes, spending the day at the beach or sitting by a bonfire. Whatever the adventure, she is your girl!  \n\nIf you are interested in this adorable, loving, adventurous girl, please get your apps in as fast as you can!\n\nTHE APPLICATION LINK CAN BE FOUND ON OUR PETFINDER PAGE UNDER THE PICTURE. \n\n\nANIMAL INFORMATION:  \nName:  Sassy Pants\nBreed:  Lab mix\nGender:  Female         \nAge:  2 years             \nWeight: 35 lbs           \nSpayed/Neutered: Yes                \nVaccines: Current                      \nHeartworm:  Tested negative, currently in Heartgard\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nFOSTER EVALUATION AND RECOMMENDATION:\nDogs:  Yes, fostering with dogs of various sizes, breeds and genders\nCats:  Unknown \nOther Small Animals:  Unknown\nChildren:  Yes, She has NOT been tested with infants or toddlers, so proper supervision and introductions would be required. \n\nADOPTION INFORMATION:\nWe are a foster-based animal rescue and we thank you for your interest in one of our animals. Our animals are fostered in various locations in the a South and in New England. Our fosters and adoption coordinators are the backbone of what we do. Our fosters work tirelessly to integrate our rescue animals into their home, so that we can provide as much information to potential adopters as possible. In addition, our coordinators offer as much information regarding the medical and behavioral and personality characteristics as is known to our organization. Without them, and our extremely generous donors, we would not be able to save as many animals as we do every day. With each adoption, we operate a Pay It Forward program, whenever possible, to help other animals in our rescue and future animals in need. \n\nIf you are interested in one of our animals, please complete an application. The application link can be found on our Petfinder homepage under the picture. You may also find our application on our website at www.petmatchmakerrescue.com under the Adopt page. If they are listed on our website, their adoptions have not been finalized yet. That does not mean that we have not received several applications, already. Please complete an application if you are interested and we will keep you apprised of their current status. We are all volunteers who work full-time jobs and have animals of our own, so please be patient with us. We will get back with you as quickly as possible.  \n\nIf you are interested in fostering for our organization, please complete an application.  The application link can be found on our Petfinder homepage under the picture.",

He had no vet care and was tied to a chain all day and night.  Thor was just a puppy.  We hate to think of what his life would have been. \n\nBut, don't worry! Thor doesn't care about any of that.  He lives for TODAY and  wants an owner that will give him what he needs love and guidance.  Thor would do great in training and he comes with free lessons to help you bond with him!  He is an active dog and will need someone that can match his energy.  \n\nThor is crazy sweet, has an awesome personality, and loves everyone. He is a bit timid when he first meets new dogs (who could blame him), but in a short time he gains his confidence and does well. Thor loves to go for walks. Thor is not only adorable, he's smart, sweet, and loves to be close. This boy is going to make some lucky person or family very happy with his unconditional love and devotion. Since Thor is still learning about life, we think he would do best as the only dog so he can have all of your attention. \n\nWant some more information?

Until we can safely to resume normal operations, we will be taking deposits and doing adoptions by appointment only on Fridays and Saturdays from noon until 3.  We know it\u2019s difficult to choose a lifetime companion animal from a picture but it\u2019s been working out well for our adopters and most importantly, for the animals in our care. The financial impact is obvious but we're committed to keeping our community and volunteers as safe as possible and providing the best of care for our animals.  Any donations are greatly appreciated to help PAWS provided that care.  Thank you.\n\nOh what a handsome boy you are King.  King is only about 6 months old and weighs about 40 pounds right now.  He\u2019ll be a nice sized guy when he\u2019s all grown up.  His adoption fee is $200\n\n\nAll of our animals are provided with age appropriate vaccinations, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. \nPAWS has added the H3N2/H3N8 combo flu vaccine to its shot protocol. Every dog is being vaccinated upon intake, however we urge adopters to get a second flu shot for their new family member to ensure as much protection against the flu as possible.\nTo meet our incredible dogs and offer them the love they deserve, stop by PAWS on Friday, Saturday or Sunday from 10 - 4 PM, call us at 217-243-7297. We do applications in person or over the phone. You can also see pictures on our Facebook page, PAWS Jackson.  With an approved application, a deposit will hold your new best friend for up to 1 week to allow you time to come to PAWS.  This deposit is not refundable nor transferable.",

Over the last couple weeks he has gained over 6 lbs, and while he still has some ways to go he appears to be a healthy and happy young pup. He can be slow to warm up to new people, but he loves neck scratches and playing with toys. He also is very interested in other dogs and has done well with another young dog we have at the shelter. \n\n\n\nBecause he is a stray, there are still a lot of unknowns about how well he will adapt to a home environment. We're not sure he's potty-trained, and he startles easily at sudden movements or loud sounds. He will need a home that can provide a lot of training and guidance so he can grow into the best dog he can be. \n\n\n\nTo inquire about Samson, send an application - http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/AnimalShelter/Dog%20Adoption%20Questionnaire_Fillable.pdf \n\n- to animalcare@seattle.gov",
