We know people are that way, too, so why not a doggie?\n\nGizmo is a loving boy with people he trusts, but it takes him a little time to befriend new people but then his heart is yours. He is so loyal and extremely loving. He loves snuggle time. He is always so happy to see you walk in the door. He talks a lot with his funny and cute ways, telling you when he wants to eat or such, super comical and darling. He also is a neat and tidy boy.\n\nOne of his fave things to do it go on car rides!\n\nGizmo will thrive in a home with a yard. He loves his walks and we have tips on how to keep him focused so he isn't barking at other dogs. If your neighborhood is quiet, it is perfect for him! He thrives in the outdoors on long walks, esp on the beach, in the woods or wherever else great sniffing is offered!\n\nGizmo is a barker and we can provide tips but it is why we are seeking a more quiet neighborhood. He currently lives in a busy place and he may do really well right off the bat in a place with room. He also is fiercely protective of his owner. We have tips and can help with introduction techniques so he learns who in the family is cool as a cat.\n\nHe is now updated on all shots, neutered and chipped! His adopt fee is $295.\n\nWe cover the medical to prepare the pet for adoption and the adopt donations go directly to cover those costs and range from $295-$495. Thank you for stepping up to save a life!\n\nTo expedite to meet with this dog, please go to our site at www.savinggreatanimals.org and fill out an application. We look at the first applications to arrive, so we hope to hear from you soon!\n\n2/2/21 3:50 PM",

Please read our eligibility requirements and apply on our website: www.ildoberescue.com/adopt. After an application is submitted, additional inquiries can email PlusDogs@ILDobeRescue.com. Our adoption radius is 3 hours from the Chicagoland area.\n\nBack in March, Zola came to IDR+ after she was picked up loose, loaded with worms, and emaciated, and a prong collar was embedded in her skin. Animal control contacted her owners, but they didn't want her anymore since she lived outside on a chain for the past 7 years. Zola's wonderful foster home treated her parasites, healed her skin, and put some healthy weight on her. After all of that, her foster parents decided to keep her. But Zola's neglectful past made living with another dog difficult. She was used to defending herself at the end of a chain, and she does not appreciate the company of other dogs in the home or while walking on a leash. Therefore, Zola's ideal home would be as the only pet with a privacy fence. She does not need to go for walks around the neighborhood--she would be perfectly happy prancing around her yard as the queen bee. This was a difficult decision for her home the past several months, but this is the best for Zola. She loves to sunbathe, eat, snuggle, and get attention. She might even give you a cute little \"howl\" if she is looking for more attention. Zola is fully potty trained and knows several commands. She loves to be praised and rewarded for being the sweet girl that she is. Zola is on an easy medication for her bladder leakage. Her medicine is not expensive and stops the leaking, so she will need to stay on this medication.\u00a0 Zola is very well mannered.\u00a0 She stays out of garbage, doesn't counter surf, and will stay off the furniture if you ask her. Zola is very sweet-natured and would love to find a forever home that she can run around, chase balls, and be so loved. Zola will not be placed with cats, but she has been great with kids she has met.\u00a0\n\nThe biographical information provided is correct to the best of our knowledge while the animal is in our care or includes what may have been provided by a previous owner. We strive to be honest and accurate, but animals can change their personalities and behavior when they settle into a new home.

She is 2 years old and 80 pounds\nShe would greatly enjoy a dog playmate in her forever home.\u00a0\u00a0Poorly socialized for her first 18 months, she is very leery of strangers and needs a securely fenced yard, privacy fencing recommended... large enough for some good running play and fetch.\u00a0\u00a0A quiet neighborhood to live and enjoy walks in would be best.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She is fantastic at playing fetch, dropping the ball right back into your hand. She has perfect house manners, And greets you with enormous zest when you get home. Strong, physically fit, experienced dog owners are recommended for this tall powerful girl. \nShe is good with kids, but it takes her a long time to warm up to any new people she meets. For this reason, potential adopters need to be in the Johnson City, Tennessee area so that multiple meet and greets can occur before adoption takes place.\nShe is not recommended for a house that has frequent new visitors.\nShe walks good on a leash, loves car rides, cats not recommended due to breed.

            "description": "Dewey\n\nDewey is a very special boy who will need a very special adopter. He is about 6 years old and he came to us from a shelter in Louisiana. Coming from that part of the country, he was positive for heartworm, which we have treated. Unfortunately, he has a residual cough, and he may have heart issues as he gets older because he had a pretty heavy case of heartworms. Dewey loves the company of other dogs and he gets along with cats. We don\u2019t know what his past was like, but he is pretty terrified of men. He is shy around women as well, but he warms up to them more than to the guys. The ideal home for Dewey would be an all-girl home with another dog. His adopter will need to be patient as he learns to trust people. We have seen dogs like Dewey come around, but it does take time and patience. Because of his heart issues and his fear around people especially men, Dewey\u2019s adoption fee is our special needs fee of $75, knowing that the adopter will need to put time and effort into helping him to forget his past and move on to being a happy family member. If you would like to adopt Dewey, please got to our website and fill out an application. https://docs.google.com/.../1SnhudHYFJaPfZyCeKy36.../edit\n\nThis dog's adoption fee is a minimum $75.00 donation to help us save more dogs. Southern Arizona Beagle Rescue, SoAZBR is an all-volunteer group. One hundred percent of your donation is used for the care and treatment needy beagles. Your donation is 100% tax deductible, too.\n\nWe URGENTLY need fosters so we can help save more dogs.  If you can help, please contact us.\n\nSouthern Arizona Beagle Rescue Contact Info:\nE-Mail Southern Arizona Beagle Rescue adoption@soazbeaglerescue.com\nSee more of our adoptable at Southern Arizona Beagle Rescue web site http://www.soazbeaglerescue.com \nPhone us at (520) 247-7720",

I'm Chance and I'm new to CBR. Glad to be a part of this great organization. I've been with my foster mom for 5 days and she says I check off ALL the boxes! 1) Handsome boy, 2) No accidents inside, completely housebroken, 3) Friendly to all dogs and humans, 4) Crate trained- not particularly fond of it but will stay there when foster mom does errands, 5) Loves to ride in the car, 6) Walks well on a leash- love daily walks but do like to add in a bit of squirrel hunting (SO many in this neighborhood!), 7) Sleeps through the night and even has to be awakened in the morning, 8) Loves to play ball in the backyard and is GOOD at it!, 9) Proving to be a loyal and faithful companion- quiet and not hyper at all!\n\nI could go on and on but will stop here. Going to the vet this week to set up my heartworm treatment in several weeks and then I'll be good as new!\n\nJust one more thing- take a CHANCE on me!!!\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

I'm Chance and I'm new to CBR. Glad to be a part of this great organization. I've been with my foster mom for 5 days and she says I check off ALL the boxes! 1) Handsome boy, 2) No accidents inside, completely housebroken, 3) Friendly to all dogs and humans, 4) Crate trained- not particularly fond of it but will stay there when foster mom does errands, 5) Loves to ride in the car, 6) Walks well on a leash- love daily walks but do like to add in a bit of squirrel hunting (SO many in this neighborhood!), 7) Sleeps through the night and even has to be awakened in the morning, 8) Loves to play ball in the backyard and is GOOD at it!, 9) Proving to be a loyal and faithful companion- quiet and not hyper at all!\n\nI could go on and on but will stop here. Going to the vet this week to set up my heartworm treatment in several weeks and then I'll be good as new!\n\nJust one more thing- take a CHANCE on me!!!\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

The strange woman was nice to me, pet me, gave me kisses and treats but I was very nervous in the car. This woman, she said she was my new foster mom, whatever that is, showed me where I would be staying. There was these two small dogs that look a lot like toys but the yell at me. I am very curious about them and want to get to know them but every time I get too close, one of the little ones yells at me. Hopefully in time they will grow to trust me and know I am a big happy teddy bear. I think my size makes them nervous. Foster mom says I'm settling in good and tells me all the time what a good boy I am. I like to eat to my dog food! I like treats sometimes, I am picky about them. I love to give big sloppy kisses and love to get hugs and pets in return! I have been in the new home for a little less than a week so I'm still getting used to it. I'll give you all an update later!\n\nFrom Foster Mom: Thor is a gentle giant! Strong, mighty and majestic, he is! His fur is like velvet. He has so much love to give! He is very nervous when riding in cars. He seems to know some basic commands such as \"sit\" and \"lie down\" and \"come\". We are working on \"stay\". We are working on using the bathroom outside only. He is heartworm positive so he is getting treated for that now. He is kenneled when I am not home as he is a bit too curious at this time. He does not like going into the kennel but once in it, he is fine. He gets along with my male chihuahua just fine, my female chihuahua yells at him when he gets too close to her. He just stops and looks at her and then goes about his business. No signs of aggression at all. He loves his human and wants all the love and pets he can get!\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

Our mission: To balance the health, safety, and welfare needs of Boxers in the Carolinas (and parts of Virginia and Georgia) by providing a loving and safe environment for stray, abused, impounded and owner surrendered dogs by placing them in foster homes and ultimately - forever homes.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDog's Name: Thor\n\nDog's Approximate Age: 6 years\n\nGender: Male\n\nDog's Size: Large (70lbs plus as adult and healthy weight)\n\nDog's Weight: 70 pounds\n\nGood with small dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with big dogs?: Don't know yet\n\nGood with cats?: Yes\n\nGood with kids?: Don't know yet\n\nAny medical issues?: Heartworm positive\n\nCrate trained?: Working on it\n\nHouse trained?: Working on it\n\nHeartworms?: Yes\n\n10/14/20: From Thor: I had to take this scary ride in a car to a new home. The strange woman was nice to me, pet me, gave me kisses and treats but I was very nervous in the car. This woman, she said she was my new foster mom, whatever that is, showed me where I would be staying. There was these two small dogs that look a lot like toys but the yell at me. I am very curious about them and want to get to know them but every time I get too close, one of the little ones yells at me. Hopefully in time they will grow to trust me and know I am a big happy teddy bear. I think my size makes them nervous. Foster mom says I'm settling in good and tells me all the time what a good boy I am. I like to eat to my dog food! I like treats sometimes, I am picky about them. I love to give big sloppy kisses and love to get hugs and pets in return! I have been in the new home for a little less than a week so I'm still getting used to it. I'll give you all an update later!\n\nFrom Foster Mom: Thor is a gentle giant! Strong, mighty and majestic, he is! His fur is like velvet. He has so much love to give! He is very nervous when riding in cars. He seems to know some basic commands such as \"sit\" and \"lie down\" and \"come\". We are working on \"stay\". We are working on using the bathroom outside only. He is heartworm positive so he is getting treated for that now. He is kenneled when I am not home as he is a bit too curious at this time. He does not like going into the kennel but once in it, he is fine. He gets along with my male chihuahua just fine, my female chihuahua yells at him when he gets too close to her. He just stops and looks at her and then goes about his business. No signs of aggression at all. He loves his human and wants all the love and pets he can get!\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

I have said over and over to everyone I know that it would be so easy to keep her because she is perfect. But for that reason I know that she will be perfect for pretty much any family or any environment. She LOVES all people. She is content to just be with you and touching you. That is what makes her truly happy. if I am not sitting down and she cannot be in my lap or resting her head on my shoulder (which is her favorite thing to do) she goes to find her fur foster siblings and snuggles with them. She simply just wants to snuggle at all times. She is spunky in the cold weather outside and likes to run down the ramp into the yard and zoom underneath the deck and pop out on the other side and surprise her fur foster brother and sister. Just this week she finally barked and it is not near as deep sounding as I expected and its cute just like her! Willa Rae does not play with toys out in the open, instead she goes into my bedroom with her toys and plays in there. I come home from work in the afternoon and there is a pile of various toys in my bedroom along with my shoes. She does not destroy anything (except for a corner of the dog bed one day) and she likes the sound my shoes make when she tosses them in the air and they make a thud. She has the silliest little personality that shows more and more each day. The ONLY thing that I think Willa Rae should not have in her new home is cats or any type of small animals such as bunnies, birds, chickens. She has given some bunnies a run for their life in the yard and based on that behavior I would be concerned about her ability to co-mingle safely with small farm animals or small animals in general. I recently found her on the bed with my resident boxer and that was another first for her. She loves to come say good morning now when the alarm goes off and she greets me with gentle kisses. She is truly beautiful with the most soulful eyes, is a gentle girl with one of the sweetest personalities I have ever known, and is going to bring so much joy to someone's life when she is done with surgery and treatment and ready to go to her forever home.\n\n11/9/20: Hi everyone! Foster Willa Rae here! I have all sorts of new things to share with you today! I have been in my foster home for just a little over 2 weeks and my life has changed so much. When I first got here I was so unsure and scared. Now, I know I am safe and loved and I seek out foster moms attention and I love to be loved. I give lots of snuggles and sweet chin kisses to make sure foster mom knows I'm grateful to be here. I have been living in my safe foster room and have not been allowed to meet the other doggies here except through the baby gate but that all changed yesterday! The nice lady who pulled me from the shelter came to visit yesterday and I was so happy to see her again. I made sure she knew I remembered her and gave her kisses. Then today foster mom said it was time to meet my foster brother and foster sister. I was a little nervous but we all sniffed each other, walked in the yard together, and I showed foster mommy being with everyone in the living room was just what I needed! I snuggled up on the couch with foster mom and I am just so happy now. Foster mom says feeling secure and loved looks good on me! It's a secret, but I'm a little smitten with my foster brother....I really like him, so I would do fine with a very mellow fur brother or fur sister in my forever home as long as we move slow like we did here. I won't be ready for a little while to come live with you because foster mom says I have worms in my heart that are making me cough and I have to have surgery to fix my leg. Don't worry though....I'm not in pain and I know soon I'll be feeling much better. My soft bed, tons of treats, a soft couch, and foster mom snuggles along with my new friends here are making me very happy. I'll update again soon....sweet kisses and tail wags....Willa Rae\n\n10/26/20: Hi everyone. My name is Willa. I was at the shelter for 10 days waiting to see if anyone would claim me, and when no one did, this really nice lady I had never met before came to pick me up. Even though I did not know her I was so glad to get out of there and I gave her lots of sweet gentle kisses to tell her thank you. Then she drove me straight to this place called the vet because I needed to immediately get taken care of because my right hind leg was hurting and I hop because it hurts to put it on the ground. They were very nice to me there, but it sounds like I hurt my leg pretty good and they said its something called an ACL injury. I was able to get back in the care with the nice lady that picked me up. She took me to this house with a really nice soft bed and blankets. She told me she had to leave, but that my new foster mommy would be there soon and she would take care of me. I waited patiently for a few hours in my bed and then this other lady came home to meet me. She told me that she was going to be my mommy for a while because I need some love and care for a bit while we get my leg fixed and get rid of these worms in my heart. My temporary mommy gives me lots of snuggles and pets and I love that, and she also gives me tons of treats and a really good dinner every night. She says I am the sweetest girl. I am a very shy girl and I am still not ready to meet the other dogs in the house. The girl barks at me and the boy stands outside my room whining. We all see eachother through the gate but I am much more comfortable in my room for now away from them. Foster mom puts them behind the gate sometimes and we hang out in the living room and she gives me lots of love. Do you notice something? I REALLY enjoy foster mom and love. I got a bath on Saturday. I was a little bit scared, but afterwards I sure did feel better. It seems like foster mom snuggles me a little tighter now that I smell good. Guess what else? I have the most perfect potty manners of any foster that has ever been here. Foster Mom told me so. She said I am the best girl and she appreciates me making it easy on her. I love belly rubs too, so if you enjoy a sweet little girl that will give you the cutest little spotted belly to rub....its me....Willa. I can't wait to get all better and meet you!\n\nFrom Foster Mom: Willa is simply the sweetest! She wags her tail at me whenever I talk to her and she just loves to lean into me for attention, or lay her head in my lap. When she arrived at my home her eyes were so sad and it just broke my heart. I can tell at some point in her life she was loved and an indoor pet and she truly does have perfect house manners. She is starting to get her glimmer and happiness back in her eyes and does not seem so scared or confused. Next steps for Willa will be ACL repair and heartworm treatment. This sweet girl will then be ready for her forever family.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

            "description": "Carolina Boxer Rescue is a volunteer run, 501(c)3 non-profit organization. Our mission: To balance the health, safety, and welfare needs of Boxers in the Carolinas (and parts of Virginia and Georgia) by providing a loving and safe environment for stray, abused, impounded and owner surrendered dogs by placing them in foster homes and ultimately - forever homes.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDog's Name: Willa Rae\n\nDog's Approximate Age: 4-6 years\n\nGender: Female\n\nDog's Size: Pocket Boxer (under 50lbs as adult and healthy weight)\n\nDog's Weight: 47 pounds\n\nGood with small dogs?: Don't know yet\n\nGood with big dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with cats?: No\n\nGood with kids?: Yes, all ages\n\nAny medical issues?:\nWilla Rae has an ACL injury that requires surgery as well as being heartworm positive and will soon undergo treatment.\n\nCrate trained?: Don't know yet\n\nHouse trained?: Yes\n\nHeartworms?: Yes\n\n12/23/20: This update will be from Willa Rae's foster mommy because I have so many wonderful things to share about Willa Rae! I have said over and over to everyone I know that it would be so easy to keep her because she is perfect. But for that reason I know that she will be perfect for pretty much any family or any environment. She LOVES all people. She is content to just be with you and touching you. That is what makes her truly happy. if I am not sitting down and she cannot be in my lap or resting her head on my shoulder (which is her favorite thing to do) she goes to find her fur foster siblings and snuggles with them. She simply just wants to snuggle at all times. She is spunky in the cold weather outside and likes to run down the ramp into the yard and zoom underneath the deck and pop out on the other side and surprise her fur foster brother and sister. Just this week she finally barked and it is not near as deep sounding as I expected and its cute just like her! Willa Rae does not play with toys out in the open, instead she goes into my bedroom with her toys and plays in there. I come home from work in the afternoon and there is a pile of various toys in my bedroom along with my shoes. She does not destroy anything (except for a corner of the dog bed one day) and she likes the sound my shoes make when she tosses them in the air and they make a thud. She has the silliest little personality that shows more and more each day. The ONLY thing that I think Willa Rae should not have in her new home is cats or any type of small animals such as bunnies, birds, chickens. She has given some bunnies a run for their life in the yard and based on that behavior I would be concerned about her ability to co-mingle safely with small farm animals or small animals in general. I recently found her on the bed with my resident boxer and that was another first for her. She loves to come say good morning now when the alarm goes off and she greets me with gentle kisses. She is truly beautiful with the most soulful eyes, is a gentle girl with one of the sweetest personalities I have ever known, and is going to bring so much joy to someone's life when she is done with surgery and treatment and ready to go to her forever home.\n\n11/9/20: Hi everyone! Foster Willa Rae here! I have all sorts of new things to share with you today! I have been in my foster home for just a little over 2 weeks and my life has changed so much. When I first got here I was so unsure and scared. Now, I know I am safe and loved and I seek out foster moms attention and I love to be loved. I give lots of snuggles and sweet chin kisses to make sure foster mom knows I'm grateful to be here. I have been living in my safe foster room and have not been allowed to meet the other doggies here except through the baby gate but that all changed yesterday! The nice lady who pulled me from the shelter came to visit yesterday and I was so happy to see her again. I made sure she knew I remembered her and gave her kisses. Then today foster mom said it was time to meet my foster brother and foster sister. I was a little nervous but we all sniffed each other, walked in the yard together, and I showed foster mommy being with everyone in the living room was just what I needed! I snuggled up on the couch with foster mom and I am just so happy now. Foster mom says feeling secure and loved looks good on me! It's a secret, but I'm a little smitten with my foster brother....I really like him, so I would do fine with a very mellow fur brother or fur sister in my forever home as long as we move slow like we did here. I won't be ready for a little while to come live with you because foster mom says I have worms in my heart that are making me cough and I have to have surgery to fix my leg. Don't worry though....I'm not in pain and I know soon I'll be feeling much better. My soft bed, tons of treats, a soft couch, and foster mom snuggles along with my new friends here are making me very happy. I'll update again soon....sweet kisses and tail wags....Willa Rae\n\n10/26/20: Hi everyone. My name is Willa. I was at the shelter for 10 days waiting to see if anyone would claim me, and when no one did, this really nice lady I had never met before came to pick me up. Even though I did not know her I was so glad to get out of there and I gave her lots of sweet gentle kisses to tell her thank you. Then she drove me straight to this place called the vet because I needed to immediately get taken care of because my right hind leg was hurting and I hop because it hurts to put it on the ground. They were very nice to me there, but it sounds like I hurt my leg pretty good and they said its something called an ACL injury. I was able to get back in the care with the nice lady that picked me up. She took me to this house with a really nice soft bed and blankets. She told me she had to leave, but that my new foster mommy would be there soon and she would take care of me. I waited patiently for a few hours in my bed and then this other lady came home to meet me. She told me that she was going to be my mommy for a while because I need some love and care for a bit while we get my leg fixed and get rid of these worms in my heart. My temporary mommy gives me lots of snuggles and pets and I love that, and she also gives me tons of treats and a really good dinner every night. She says I am the sweetest girl. I am a very shy girl and I am still not ready to meet the other dogs in the house. The girl barks at me and the boy stands outside my room whining. We all see eachother through the gate but I am much more comfortable in my room for now away from them. Foster mom puts them behind the gate sometimes and we hang out in the living room and she gives me lots of love. Do you notice something? I REALLY enjoy foster mom and love. I got a bath on Saturday. I was a little bit scared, but afterwards I sure did feel better. It seems like foster mom snuggles me a little tighter now that I smell good. Guess what else? I have the most perfect potty manners of any foster that has ever been here. Foster Mom told me so. She said I am the best girl and she appreciates me making it easy on her. I love belly rubs too, so if you enjoy a sweet little girl that will give you the cutest little spotted belly to rub....its me....Willa. I can't wait to get all better and meet you!\n\nFrom Foster Mom: Willa is simply the sweetest! She wags her tail at me whenever I talk to her and she just loves to lean into me for attention, or lay her head in my lap. When she arrived at my home her eyes were so sad and it just broke my heart. I can tell at some point in her life she was loved and an indoor pet and she truly does have perfect house manners. She is starting to get her glimmer and happiness back in her eyes and does not seem so scared or confused. Next steps for Willa will be ACL repair and heartworm treatment. This sweet girl will then be ready for her forever family.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

Nothing like my old life! I'm gaining weight and feeling great! You know what I want? A family. That's it. I want someone I can be close to. I'm learning stuff quick and I've made some pretty cool friends, but I'd rather be with you. I'm still a young gal, I'm only two! I'm not noisy and I don't jump much and I'm really really trying to be a good girl so you'll let me come home with you. Pleeeeease?\nIf you're interested, contact natchitocheshopeforpaws@yahoo.com",

You can make an appointment to meet available dogs at our ADOPTION CENTER by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet and available cats at MEOW PALACE by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet1.\n\nFor animals in FOSTER homes, please submit an online application and an adoption team will reply with next steps. We thank you for your patience as we work to keep saving lives during this difficult time.\n\nPLEASE VISIT THIS WEBSITE TO FIND THE ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE: http://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-forms/\n\nMeet Dan the man! Okay, Dan the dog, but a cute dog at that. This 3 year old, staffordshire terrier is a handsome fella with a beautiful brindle pattern. Taco Dan is a sweet boy who is a sucker for the ladies! Prior to coming to Homeward Trails, he was picked up as a stray in Fayette County, WV. Relationship is the key to Taco Dan's success in a home. Since your new relationship is so important to him, he only asks that you plan on spending a few playdates and training sessions with him before taking him home. Taco Dan needs to be adopted by an adult only house hold. If you believe you can provide that for our amazing boy, please submit an application to meet him at our adoption center soon!\n\nAdoption Coordinator: Adoption Center\nLocation: Adoption Center\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $475. This fee includes spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\nWe also provide free online workshop with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria/Falls Church/DC area. Start your new dog out on the right foot with this valuable, expert guidance FREE!\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program",

Email T.A.R.A. | T.A.R.A.'s Web Site | On-Line Application\nThis beautiful girl was pulled from a shelter in rural MO. She can be a little nervous at first but she is so incredibly sweet once she knows you! She loves to roll over for belly rubs and look up at you with big brown eyes that will melt your heart. Roxy gets along with most other dogs but she would also be perfectly fine being an only child!\nApproximate Birthdate: Oct 2017\nAdoption Fee: $150\nTARA's adoption fee includes: spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, heartworm test (if age appropriate), heartworm and flea prevention, and deworming. TARA's pets are all eligible for a two week trial .\nDue to the fact that many of our dogs come from the local city shelters, we do not know the background of many of them and therefore cannot always guarantee age or breed. Size is subjective but we use the following guidelines: Small 1-20 pounds, Med 20-50 pounds, Large 50-80 pounds, Extra Large over 80 pounds.\nFor more information please fill out an APPLICATION\nPlease visit our EVENTS PAGE for information about our upcoming adoption events.",

For more information on \"Boelter's Bunch\", please visit http://www.caninecastaways.org/special-adoption-programs\n\nPlease consider opening your heart and home to a senior dog!\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THE FIRST STEP IS TO FILL OUT AN ADOPTION APPLICATION ON OUR WEBSITE AT:  \nhttps://www.caninecastaways.org/adoption-application\nIF A PET IS LISTED THEN THEY ARE AVAILABLE - WE KEEP OUR LISTINGS UP TO DATE AND REMOVE AS SOON AS ADOPTED.\n\nNAME:  Mabel\nBREED:  Chihuahua\nSEX: female\nCOLOR:  cream/tan\nAGE:  12 years plus \nWEIGHT:  7.5 lbs\n\n\n\nFOSTERED BY:   Vicki\nLOCATED IN:  Pt. Charlotte\n\n\nNOTES FROM FOSTER FAMILY:\n\nMabel just moved to her foster home a week or so ago - here is what her foster mom had to say about her:  Mabel has picked my bathroom as her bedroom, she stays in there most of the time and seems like a safe spot for her.  When she's up she does follow me everywhere but if I'm sitting she still walks around and doesn't seem to want to settle anywhere but in her \"bedroom\".  \n\nShe loves to eat and is first in line when I go in the kitchen.  No accidents, seems to have good potty habits.  She is getting pretty good about coming in without picking her up but I still need to carry her out.  Sleeps really good at night and usually have to wake her in the morning whether it's 6:00 a.m. or 8:00 a.m. and she does sleep a lot.  \n\nThere are hearing and vision issues but still hard to tell how much but her pacing has changed and it seemed like she was mapping the first few days and now just walks around.   Got a little tail wag the other day, will tolerate a little stroking on her back but still is nervous about it.  I'm just letting her do her thing even though I want to love on her so much.  So far so good.  Hopefully in time she will seek attention, she is just such a sweetie. \n\nMabel did come to us with mammary masses which have been removed.  They were were NOT cancerous but there is always a possibility she could have another pop up down the road.  At this time it is not an issue but it is something we want a potential adopter to be aware of.  \n\nDue to COVID-19 we are a little more limited on volunteers and the availability (and safety) of home visits.   Local applications are given first priority and some out of town areas will not be able to be processed.\n\nAt this time, we will only be able to process applications that have an excellent current vet history.  If you haven\u2019t had a pet or verifiable vet history we will not be able to process your application.   \n\nIf you are interested in adopting please complete our Adoption Application by copying and pasting the following link into your web browser: http://www.caninecastaways.org/adoption-application\n\nFor a full list of dogs we currently have for adoption use this link:  https://www.caninecastaways.org/adoptable-dogs\n\n\nMEDICAL INFO: \nThe following has been or will be done for this dog...\n- Basic Exam by Veterinarian\n- Spayed or Neutered\n- Heartworm Tested\n- Placed on heartworm preventive\n- Geriatric Bloodwork\n- Microchipped\n- Intestinal Parasite Exam and medication\n- Vaccinations\n- Placed on flea preventive\n- Dental, if needed\n\n\nADOPTION DONATION: \n$150 \n\nThis adoption donation helps to cover the vet expenses for this dog including heartworm preventive which is dispensed at the initial vet visit and then goes with the dog at adoption. All vet records will be provided to adopter.\n\n\nVisit us at www.caninecastaways.org",

While we do not know the details of his previous life, we do know that he was not very well taken care of. That has not stopped Orion from being a wonderful little happy boy. Orion quickly won over the hearts of the shelter staff. He can be a timid and shy little pup but quickly warms up to everyone he meets! He is currently working on leash skills, it's evident that he's never been walked on one until now... he will catch on though! \nOrion plays great with the other young dogs at Save A Pet and would love a home with another furry brother or sister to show him the ropes. He is definitely more of a submissive type and could benefit from a confident dog to learn from. \nOrion weighs about 35 pounds and is approximately 5 months old with a birthday around mid June 2020.\nIf you are interested in learning more about Orion, please call the Save A Pet shelter at 478-994-3882.

            "description": "For a young boy, Dracula is already quite a collector - of toys! He has a horde of toys, and is always looking for a new one to add. Of course, he loves playing with them just as much as he loves his people - and all humans he meets. This friendly boy is disabled. His spine was injured, causing the loss of use of his back legs. But that hasn't slowed down his playfulness. He loves being petted and snuggled, and he wiggles when his humans come close. He will scoot himself right over to be held and cuddled. As an active, curious boy, he loves being outside, scooting around freely with his front legs to see everything in the outdoor world, and chewing sticks to his heart's content. He'll pull himself halfway across the yard to grab a new stick when he already has one to chew - so cute! He's a smart boy, eager to learn, and listens to corrections well. He sleeps all night in his crate. He might also be fitted for a wheelchair as he matures. Dracula's disability causes incontinence, so he needs adopters who will be gentle and loving with him, help with his bladder and bowel control, and are always willing to patiently change his diapers. He'll reward them with so much love. Come meet this survivor!",

            "description": "Percy is a sweet boy full of Chihuahua energy. He is a particular boy that doesn't fancy other dogs too close to him. He doesn't trust easily, but he wants to be loved. The kennel life is not for him and he can't wait to be snuggled in a home in a familiar and comfortable space. He is about 5 years old and can be mildly aggressive to strangers if approached too quickly. We are working on these behaviors and he sure has come a long way! You can tell he wants to be social as he wags his tail when strangers approach him, however, he is still fearful at times. He would do best as an only dog with no children. He really is a cuddle bug and he can't wait to find his forever home.\n\nPlease email Erin at muellenbergerin@gmail.com for any questions or to meet him!\nCheck out our instagram for more info and available dogs: @ahome4ever_rescue\n\n---\n\nCome meet our dogs Saturdays and Sundays at Petsmart in Costa Mesa from 11:30-2:30. All A Home 4 Ever Rescue dogs receive a wellness exam by our veterinarian and are up to date with vaccinations. They are spayed or neutered and microchipped before they go to their adoptive families. If you would like more information please email the adoption Director muellenbergerin@gmail.com",

DON'T HURT HER JUST LOVE TO DO IT.\nI WAS A STRAY SO IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO FIND A HOME WHERE I CAN'T SLIP OUT THE DOOR AND GET LOST AGAIN.  \nI ALSO AM LOOKING FOR A SPECIAL HOME WHO WILL KEEP ME CURRENT ON MY SEIZURE MEDS. THEY CAN BE PRETTY SCARY TO WATCH BUT THE MEDS ARE WORKING ONCE MY VET GOT THE RIGHT DOSE FIGURED OUT.\nI HAVE ALL OF MY VET WORK DONE, INCLUDING NEUTERING, MICROCHIPPED, HEARTWORM TESTED AND ON MONTHLY PREVENTION,AND ALL SHOTS UP TO DATE. \n\nPLEASE FILL OUT AN APPLICATION IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ME AND I HOPE TO MEET YOU SOON!\nHERE IS SOME MORE YOU NEED TO KNOW IF INTERESTED IN ADOPTING ME! \nClick here to complete our adoption please email Kim at lovemelovemydogs2004@indy.rr.com: GRACIE'S HEART OF GOLD ADOPTION APPLICATION GRACIE'S HEART OF GOLD REQUIRES ONGOING PROPER VETERINARY CARE FOR ALL ANIMALS ADOPTED TO INCLUDE HEARTWORM MEDICATIONS, FLEA MEDICATIONS, AND YEARLY VACCINATIONS. GRACIES HEART OF GOLD DOES NOT SHIP OUR DOGS - WE REQUIRE A FACE TO FACE MEETING. WE ALSO DO NOT ADOPT OUR DOGS AS GIFTS UNLESS THE RECIPIENT MEETS WITH THE DOG PRIOR TO ADOPTION. MY ADOPTION FEE IS: $200. MY VET BILLS TO DATE HAVE BEEN ALMOST $1000 WHILE MY RESCUE GOT THINGS FIGURED OUT WITH MY SEIZURES. PLEASE READ MORE! Adoption fees average $150-$400. This fee varies per animal based on additional vet care required to save them. Due to the rising costs of veterinary care, premium holistic dog food, gasoline prices, and boarding fees, which are paid for out of our own pockets, we recently were forced to raise our fees. We are not funded by anyone - adoption fees help to offset only a part of our cost of getting the dog ready for adoption. All dogs > 6 months are vetted, up to date on vaccinations, spayed/neutered, microchipped, heartworm tested, wormed and have a goody starter bag. Puppies",

Typical for his breed, Dell needs an active family and some \"work\" to keep his brain entertained. He'll retrieve a ball all.day.long. He loves walks and is doing much better on a leash. He's extremely smart & learns new tricks and behaviors quickly. He's a cuddle bug and loves belly rubs.\n\nDell has some anxiety issues and can be whiny if not given enough exercise or when overly excited. He does need medication for storms to keep him calm.\n\nHe's crate trained and house broken. He's dog selective and prefers non dominant dogs. He's living with cats now but is not a fan..\n\nDell LOVES kids but will \"herd\" smaller kids by nipping at their heels. Dell needs a home without small children.\n\nDell is a silly boy who always keeps us laughing with his weird sleeping and lounging positions. He's affectionate and loves to be snuggled.\n\nAre you active and looking for a new buddy? Dell could be your guy! Apply today at Needy Paws.\n\nDell\n\n6 years old,\n\n50 lbs\n\nBlack / white / brown patches (one brown eyebrow!)\n\nHouse Trained\n\nCrate Trained\n\nNeeds a fenced yard\n\nCan be only dog or a slow intro to a new sibling\n\nHas storm anxiety and needs medication\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Dell, complete the Adoption Application on our website at www.NeedyPaws.org and we will contact you. Adopters must live within an hour's drive of St. Louis, MO.\n\nDell\n's adoption fee is $195.00, which includes up-to-date vaccinations, heartworm testing and preventative, spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are a 100% foster-based rescue and all of our dogs live in approved foster homes.

You must contact Wendy Lange @\n\nWgfrogs@yahoo.com\n\nor (\n858)204-7611\ndirectly for further information.\n\nBuddy, a 5-years-old, 15-pound chihuahua mix. He loves snuggling on your lap and being with you, but is also fine being left home alone during the day to sleep. He doesn't chew or dig in trash cans, and will let you know when he needs to go outside to use the restroom. In general, he is smart and learns fast. He would do best in a quiet home with no children or other dogs. Although he doesn't like other dogs, he seems fine with cats. We have guinea pigs and he's fine with them as well, although we don't let him too close. He has recently been updated on his vaccinations. 6-16-2020: Bordotello, DHP (3 year), Rabies (3 year)\n\nHe loves his walks, but is also just fine without them. He's aggressive towards other dogs, so walks can be a challenge. He seems to prefer women over men and loves to be the alpha male in the house. He responds better to positive reinforcement than negative. He was most likely fed people food (chicken, beef, meat), because he's a picky eater and doesn't like canned dog food.\n\nBuddy is an easy dog in many ways, but needs a quiet home. Looking for the perfect place for him. * contact Wendy Lange @\n\nWgfrogs@yahoo.com\n\nor (\n858)204-7611\ndirectly for further information.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Straight out of Detroit comes another beautiful dog in need of a new home! A Buster foster mom spotted Shuri across from her home and after speaking to some other neighbors she learned the pup was abandoned. Well, our foster mom did what any Buster volunteer would do, grabbed a leash scooped her up, and got her inside and safe. Her new name is Shuri, and besides some fleas and being underweight, she is decent shape. She is still getting used to being inside and has been calm, quiet, and easy going. She gets nervous when left alone outside, as we would expect. However, she is VERY good in her crate and relaxes quickly. She appears to ignore other dogs; however, we won't know for sure until she has a chance to settle down. Her foster mom thinks she will be medium to high energy level and will be around 80 pounds, once she gets back to her proper weight. For that reason, we recommend no young kids.Notes from her Foster mom: Shuri is an amazing girl! She loves every person she meets. She's great in the house, has never chewed something or gotten into things. She is fully housebroken and is great in her crate with things to keep her mind busy. This high energy girl would love an active home. Her favorite thing is to play and run, but when playtime is over she is the best cuddler! She even knows to wait for an invitation to get on the couch. Shuri is incredibly smart and learns really quickly. Check out the video of her starting to learn agility. This is less than a week into practice! More obstacles are coming soon, we'll add more videos as she learns. In addition to agility, Shuri is learning obedience and can 'sit', 'down', 'wait', 'stay', 'off', 'drop', and 'leave it'. She walks well on a leash, but does react to other animals. She would be great for an experienced owner that loves to teach their dog new things as she is eager to please. Unfortunately, before Shuri was abandoned by her family on the streets in Detroit, it seems like she had a pretty sheltered life. As a young girl gets very excited in new environments. We are working on exposing her to different situations and teaching her appropriate reactions, but she will need continual practice. She's learning the joy of different toys and to be a happy confident dog in various situations. :)Shuri would prefer a home without small animals, but may do well with a stable male dog with very slow introductions. She can't wait to meet with her perfect forever family!",

If there is an applicant, it will say PENDING ADOPTION next to the dog's name. If not, please submit an Application that can be found on our site, www.fluffydog.net. \n\nMY AGE: approx. 5 years  WEIGHT: approx. 40 lbs.  WHERE I AM FROM: AL (arrival 11/11) \n\nMY STORY: Kourtney is amazing. She came to us with her pups, who are now weaned. She loves everyone and every dog. Loves to play. Something happened, maybe hit by a car, maybe kicked or worse, and the side of her head is set back and the eye is a bit cross-eyed. Honestly it adds to her charm. She loves to play. She is not great on walking on a leash, but that will come. Kourtney has a lot of love to give and will make someone a wonderful companion.\n\nShe is a high energy dog and by no means special needs. She does play with her feet like a Boxer.\n\n\nDogs needing foster homes are available for adoption This dog does need a foster home. Have you ever considered fostering a dog?  For more information, see the Fluffy dog rescue home page. This dog does shed and is not hypoallergenic.\n\nHOUSEBROKEN?   GOOD WITH DOGS? Yes   GOOD WITH CATS?unknown\nADOPTION FEE: $350\n\nTo adopt the FIRST STEP is to complete an APPLICATION. The application can be found on our site www.fluffydog.net, or by clicking on the purple Fluffy Dog Rescue wording found in the left corner of this page under the dogs name.\n\nOur dogs are located in foster homes throughout the state. We do not have a facility. Adopters must be 24 years old.We can not adopt to families with children under the age of six. We also adopt in WI, IL, and parts of MN. Most of our dogs are strays, so the breed is our best guess.\nWI License #270548.\n \nCheck out Fluffy Dog Wellness on our Home Page. Great Solutions to Enhance Your Pet's Health. www.fluffydog.net",

            "description": "Foster QandA: Housetrained? Yes Details on leash/crate/other training: Acorn is crate trained. She has always gone into the crate happily and remains quiet. She is getting better every single day on leash. She is a master of 'sit' and 'paw', and is excited to master 'lay down' and 'fetch'. Describe cuddling behavior/affection level: Acorn's favorite thing to do is cuddle and give kisses. She especially appreciates kisses between her ears, and she will happily return the favor. Describe play behavior and favorite toys: Acorn loves to play with her toys! Acorn enjoys toys like Kongs and puzzle toys that keep her motivated and stimulated. She also likes a nice rope to chew on. Describe Acorn's activity level: Acorn is a medium-high energy dog. She is athletic- a fast sprinter, a strong jumper, and she's even got some goofy dance moves. However, she tires quickly, she is calm around the house, and will gladly focus her energy towards some intellectual exercise. What are the best adjectives to describe Acorn? 1) Loving- she eagerly gives us kisses and cuddles, and shows excitement when we come home 2) Intelligent- she has the ability to quickly learn new tricks! 3) Emotionally intelligent- she understands when we need space, are feeling frustrated, or when we're too tired to play. Any cute behaviors? One of Acorn's cutest behaviors is that she will walk between your legs just to receive pets. Ask Acorn's volunteer advocate, Megan, about her: meg1995.mw@gmail.com ACORN IS ENROLLED IN THE GOOD DOG PROJECT AT PACC - Read a message from her case manager here: tinyurl.com/gdpmessage - Ask her case manager about him: rachel.jones@pima.gov",

GRACIE'S HEART OF GOLD ADOPTION APPLICATION GRACIE'S HEART OF GOLD REQUIRES ONGOING PROPER VETERINARY CARE FOR ALL ANIMALS ADOPTED TO INCLUDE HEARTWORM MEDICATIONS, FLEA MEDICATIONS, AND YEARLY VACCINATIONS. GRACIES HEART OF GOLD DOES NOT SHIP OUR DOGS - WE REQUIRE A FACE TO FACE MEETING. WE ALSO DO NOT ADOPT OUR DOGS AS GIFTS UNLESS THE RECIPIENT MEETS WITH THE DOG PRIOR TO ADOPTION. MY ADOPTION FEE IS: $250. THESE FEES HELP KEEP THE RESCUE GOING. PLEASE READ MORE! Adoption fees average $150-$400. This fee varies per animal based on additional vet care required to save them. Due to the rising costs of veterinary care, premium holistic dog food, gasoline prices, and boarding fees, which are paid for out of our own pockets, we recently were forced to raise our fees. We are not funded by anyone - adoption fees help to offset only a part of our cost of getting the dog ready for adoption. All dogs > 6 months are vetted, up to date on vaccinations, spayed/neutered, microchipped, heartworm tested, wormed and have a goody starter bag. Puppies",

            "description": "Meet Ranger!\n\nRanger came to us from the Humane Society of Imperial Valley. He is approximately 8 years old and weighs 70 lbs. Ranger gets along well with other dogs in our play yards, and he passed the cat test, too. As for people, Ranger LOVES everyone and even thinks he's a lap dog!\n\nRanger enjoys going on our weekly Frosted Fakers hikes, and he is the perfect example of a Frosted Faker, a senior dog who acts younger than his years. At only 8 years old, Ranger is on the young end of being a senior, and he's a great walking buddy. Volunteers have taken him running, and he's up for it! Ranger would be a great fit for an active family.\n\nRanger went on a two week Frosted Fling for the holidays, and his Fling family decided to foster him until he's adopted! His now-Foster Mom shared what they've learned about this special boy:\n\n\"Ranger has been living with us for one month! We have learned so much about this love bug:\n\n*Ranger is a perfect gentleman in the car, he likes to ride in the back and take a nap\n\n*Ranger likes to move his body, either hiking or walking around the neighborhood. I would call his energy moderate. We started out with 5-6 miles a day to get the worries out, he would be great with a 2-3 miles a day when he's comfortable in a home. He is a great running partner, too!\n\n*Ranger met our neighbor's small black doggo on a leash and did great with him.\n\n*Ranger is 100% potty trained. He can hold it for a work day, no problem!\n\n*Ranger sleeps like a champ in his crate for 8-10 hours with his blankies. He snores, but it soothes me right to sleep.\n\n*Ranger loves being touched. If he thinks you are going to love on him, he will give you his belly.\n\n*Ranger started off as a picky eater, but as he's gotten more at home he's been broadening his food repertoire, but raw veggies are still a no go. He really loves chicken or beef stock on his food and his coat is getting silky!\n\n* Ranger sings to you when he is excited about an upcoming activity. It's music, y'all!\n\n*Ranger adores being close to his person and if he can't be close to you, he will settle nearby. He is ALWAAYS up for lounging in the couch (doggo beds work too!!)\n\n* Ranger would be a great body guard (does anyone know about an open position?). I feel like a movie star walking about the house. He has got to know what I am working on and if I need any assistance.\n\nRanger DESERVES a loving home. His people are out there. Until then, I will snuggle Ranger's big head and love on him.\"\n\nIf you're looking for a fun and sweet buddy, apply to meet Ranger: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees, and we help with medical costs!\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 1/30/21 KG",

            "description": "Link is a 4 year old 50lb pit mix, who was rescued from a rural high-kill shelter, and is now so happy to be in a home setting. He is very sweet and loving and just wants all your attention! He is house trained and kennel trained, and is very treat motivated. He needs a little bit of work on his greeting manners, as he gets very excited to see you! But he is also happy to curl up and quietly nap once he\u2019s gotten in some playtime. He is very smart and wants to please, so he is picking up basic commands and walking on a leash quickly!\nHe would do well with another dog that is not too dominant, when introduced properly. He would do better in a home without cats. He is neutered, and up to date on all his shots. He has tested positive for heartworm, has already started treatment and is so excited to begin his happy forever with you! \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

            "description": "Whisper is a sweet, very chill Boxer mix (possible Rottweiler). He has an old soul and a gentle spirit. He loves going on walks through the neighborhood and is also a great jogging buddy in the mornings. He\u2019s great with apartment living and perfectly content chilling out while you work or watch movies at home, and he\u2019s working on new commands. At the dog park he\u2019s the most behaved dog (never barks, never jumps) and is gentle and happy to play with dogs of all sizes. He also quickly adjusts to new surroundings and is house trained and crate trained. He loves belly rubs at night before bedtime. Whisper would be perfect for a loving home or family looking for a sweet companion.\n\n\nYou may read more about our adoption policies and procedures at www.truenorthrescue.org. Please submit a complete application on our website - meet and greets are only scheduled with approved applicants. Please be sure to answer every question as thoughtfully as you can, this will help your chances. Incomplete applications will not be reviewed, and we unfortunately can not contact all applicants to inquire about missing information.\n\nDo not email through Petfinder because we won't be able to answer. Please email adopt.truenorthrescue@gmail.com to check on the status of your application. All applications can take anywhere from 24-72 hours to be processed and only approved applicants will be contacted.\n\nIf a dog is listed here on Petfinder, they are still available. Please don't email just to ask if they're available - they are! With the high volume of emails we receive daily, it is not guaranteed that we can reply to every inquiry. As a fully volunteer run rescue, we make every effort to reply in a timely fashion, but please allow 24-48 hours for a response.\n\nWe strive to have accurate and up to date bios, and regularly check in with our fosters to ensure we are providing the most relevant information. If there is no mention of a health or behavioral concern, then it means we have not been informed of one!",

She is spayed, up to date on vaccines, micro chipped and has undergone heart worm treatment (hence the stripes on her back where she got her injections).  She is now ready to find her forever home.  \n\nRoni would do best in a home with a physically fenced yard, kids who are 8 years old or older and no other small pets/ animals.  She likes to be the alpha and would do best in a home with a bigger dog.  She is about 40 lbs currently.  She has a great personality with people and just loves attention.  She can be a vocal dog, so she is not suitable for apartments, townhomes or condos.\n\nShe is in our indoor/outdoor kennels but does appear to have some house-training experience, but may need some refreshers when coming into a new home.  All dogs need time to decompress, get familiar and comfortable with new people, new routine and that just takes time.  Since she is still young, we would suggest either crate training for when you are not home until she gets a bit older and more accustomed to being in a home.\n\nIf you think you can be that family for Roni, please fill out our adoption application on our website at www.safehaventn.com .  We are happy to set up a meet and greet for the approved application.  Her adoption fee is $150.00 and she is located in Cookeville, TN.",

Scrappy loves the company of other dogs, so doggy siblings and a fenced in backyard are a must.\n\nScrappy is an adorable one year old Terrier mix, 45 lbs of pure love and energy. He is house broken and even tells you when he needs to go potty. He gets along with dogs and cats, unfortunately NO kids for this boy.\nAdoption fee includes DHPP vaccine, Rabies vaccine (if age appropriate) heartworm testing, spay/neuter surgery, deworming, wellness vet visit, one month of pet insurance and microchip. All animals are examined by a veterinarian.

Naihla's adoption fee is $130. She is spayed and microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. See adorable Naihla in the snow! To meet Naihla or to be added to her waitlist, call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the DOG'S NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A GOOD PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org. A scheduler will call you back within 48 hours to confirm your request. If you have other dogs at home, tell the scheduler you would like to bring them along for a Meet n' Greet. SFAS offers a variety of excellent training classes, seminars and Trainer Talks led by animal behavior professionals. These are half-price for animals adopted from any shelter or rescue group!

            "description": "Reese is a handsome 5-year-old mixed-breed fellow who currently weighs about 64 pounds. He came to SFAS as a stray and he is now ready for a new family. Here at the shelter, Reese has been assessed with other dogs and we ask you to bring your dog in for a meet n greet during your appointment. He would enjoy going on morning and evening walks. When Reese walks down the hall all the shelter staff stop to say, Hello!! He is very popular because of his cheerful and loving behavior! Reese loves treats and walks well when harnessed. He hops for joy on his walks and would love to run around in a yard or single use dog park! Reese's adoption fee is $130. He is neutered and microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. To meet Reese or to be added to his waitlist, call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the DOG'S NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org. A scheduler will call you back within 48 hours to confirm your request. If you have other dogs at home, tell the scheduler you would like to bring them along for a Meet n' Greet. SFAS offers a variety of excellent training classes, seminars and Trainer Talks led by animal behavior professionals. These are half-price for animals adopted from any shelter or rescue group! Due to current COVID-19 restrictions, classes and talks are all presented virtually using Zoom. For course descriptions, schedules and registration, visit https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/group-training-classes/ for classes and https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/special-seminars-and-workshops/ for seminars and Trainer Talks.",

            "description": "Apple (female, about 2 years old) and Andy (male, about 1 year old) are a very sweet, bonded pair, born in separate litters to the same mother. They are calm and gentle; they love cuddling together and can be walked together.\n\nApple and Andy were rescued from an abandoned house. Apple had a face full of porcupine quills, and Andy had a broken hind leg that could not be repaired and required amputation. They must be adopted together. \n\nAndy is shy and will need to be with people who are patient with him. Apple is his protector, and Andy is braver when she is with him. They have excellent house manners. They chew on their toys and leave the people shoes alone! They like to sit on the couch and look out the window. While they quietly watch the squirrel who lives outside through the window, they are not as tolerant of the rabbits down the street and will probably do best in a home without cats.\n\nTheir foster mom reports that they were very good about not pulling on their leashes when they first came to her but have started pulling a bit. They will probably need and respond well to a positive training program. They seem to be curious and happy to see other dogs when they\u2019re out walking.\n\nThis loving pair had a tough start but are ready for a forever home where they are loved and loving. They will give you a rewarding relationship and lots of snuggles!\n\nApple and Andy\u2019s adoption fee includes spay/neuter, basic vaccinations, rabies vaccination, and heartworm tested negative.\n\nApple and Andy\u2019s adoption fee includes spay/neuter, basic vaccinations, rabies vaccination, and heartworm tested negative.\n\nYou can find the application for Apple and Andy here:\n\nhttps://forms.gle/5eSBjHrWv7pTEEzUA\n\nQuestions? Contact us at connellpetrescue@gmail.com \n\nThank you! And Apple and Andy thank you!\n\n",

She loves squeaky toys and treats. Come by to visit this sweet fun girl. \n\nCome visit us at our shelter in Ashland, AL, Please call 256-354-1453 for adoption inquiries.",

Tommy strives to be a good boy at all times but can be a little mischievous but will correct when reprimanded. This 2 year old is very calm in his run, and is very well-behaved, sits and lays down when told.  When Tommy arrived in the shelter is was a gentleman on the leash but due to being stuck for so long in a cage he has become a little hard to handle on the leash and will need some training. He loves, loves, loves toys of all kinds. Tommy is the nicest boy around, and he is so photogenic! He has a sweet, gentle personality that will surely be an asset to any family. Meet this incredible, 71 pound boy in run 109. His ID number is 625474. Tommy is up-to-date on vaccines, and he will be neutered, microchipped, and heart worm tested upon adoption. He can\u2019t wait to love his new family with his whole being!\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

She\u2019s been spayed, vaccinated, chipped, and is heartworm negative. Chicklet is like any other Jack Russell. She is fun loving and energetic. Snuggling in a lap, playing with toys and running around the backyard are all things that she loves to do. She is also house trained, crate trained, and does not make a mess in the house. She\u2019s very good in the house.> She needs a securely fenced backyard and an owner who is home at least part of the day.\n She will be best as an only dog. No cats, critters, or kids. Her adopter must be able to go to Sherman, TX to get her. Home visit and good vet reference are mandatory. Adoption fee is 275 dollars.\n Please fill out the online application on www.russellrescue.com\njamesejolley@gmail.com.",

Ziggy did not have a great start to life and he lived outdoors with little attention from humans.  He is receptive to human touch and will likely bond closely to his new adopters.  Unfortunately his brother Zack, who was much more fearful, escaped from his home and we are still searching for him.  Because of this we require any adopters to have a completely fenced in yard.  He will also need someone that is dog savvy and willing to work with professional trainers in making this pup the best dog he can be.  We do not recommend children and it is unknown if he is good with cats.  Ziggy does like other dogs and living with another confident dog might be good for him.  We have been taking our time with placing Ziggy into the right home.  Email us today if you think you'd be a good fit for our special guy.\n\nPictures in snow taken by Meaghan Susi Photography\nPrimary photo taken by Bootsberry Photography \n\n*PLEASE E-MAIL OUR ADOPTION COORDINATOR AT HEARTOFRIADOPTION@GMAIL.COM FOR A COPY OF OUR APPLICATION.

Great! We have an adoption process that tries to ensure that our LLR animals have found their forever home. Adopting from LLR isn\u2019t the fastest process. We do not have a paid staff and rely on volunteers-for everything. From animal care, and veterinary appointments to checking emails, answering phone calls and scheduling all meet n greets! Please be patient with us, animals come first around here. We are not in a rush to place any of the animals in LLR. All of our animals live in foster homes comfortably which means that we can take our time to find the best possible home for each animal in our care. \n\nTo learn more about the Little Lotus adoption process, please go to:\nhttps://littlelotusrescueandsanctuary.org/adoption-process/\n\nFor an application to meet this pet, please go to:https://littlelotusrescueandsanctuary.org/adoption-application/\n\nBeing fostered in Sierra Vista, AZ.

If you're interested in me please go to http://www.swesr.org/Apply-to-Adopt.html and fill out their application.  Do not respond electronically to this post because it will go to Utah's Perfect Pointers.\n\nI was turned into the shelter by my family because they said I was \"guarding\" my toys, etc. from their other dog.  For goodness sakes, I'm a kid and I didn't know any better.  My approx. DOB is 2/13/2020 so I still have a lot of learning ahead of me.  I was very good when I was visiting at Casa UPP.  I would have liked to be a bossy little girl, but UPP rescue lady told me that was her job and I could \"stand down\".  I decided to let her be the boss.\n\nI played well with the other dogs for the week I was at Casa UPP.  I wasn't particularly trustworthy with the cats.  I really need a male dog in my new home to help me become a respectable adult.  I also need humans who know my breed and particularly my age.  Teenagers are a lot of work!\n\nI have a lovely coat that doesn't tangle but will benefit from brushing.  It's also nice and calming for me so it's a nice way for me to spend some quiet time with my favorite people.\n\nI'm going to grow up to be a wonderful dog in the right home.

Millie also is a shy girl, sweet as sugar but it will take about 2 weeks for her to decompress and not shake in your home. She's with me until she finds that perfect combo: female adopter, with a dog and a fenced in yard. That's the magic needed for Millie!!! You will have an awesome lifetime with her. Oh and she's spayed, up to date on shots, house trained, leash trained. Super loving, sweet girl!!! If interested apply at ruffhouserescue.org/adopt",

He arrived at the shelter as a lost dog on Oct. 10, just when the shelter discovered a respiratory infection in another dog and had to quarantine all the dogs and suspend adoptions. He'd make someone a great new friend and loyal buddy. Yogi is about 5 years old and weighs 62 pounds. He is neutered and up-to-date on vaccinations; he will be heartworm tested and microchipped upon adoption. Come meet him in Run 880 using ID# 625424 and see for yourself what a calm and sweet boy he is. Super sweet, does not pull and loves his treats. Sits very nicely!\n\nYogi meets Precious - https://youtu.be/sTvNxrvbJyU\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

            "description": "Description of pet\nOur adoption area is limited to UT, NV, ID, OR, WA and MT with a home visit. If you are outside of this area please do a search for your local GSP/GWP/Pointer rescue group.\n\n--------\n\nI'm PIXEL! And I'm totally beautiful little girl.  I came to UPP from a rural shelter with a shattered right elbow.  X-rays showed that it was an old injury (a couple of months) so it couldn't be repaired.  I had a drastic amputation right to my shoulder and wouldn't you know it........... the next day I was ready to go out and run in the yard.  My rescue lady is trying to keep me quiet but that's not a particularly easy task for a young, mostly GSP girl.  I may be purebred but my ears are a little short and set a little high on my head so my rescue lady isn't sure.  I'm at least 90% GSP, particularly when it comes to my energy level.  My approx. DOB is 2/24/2020 so I'm the perfect age to be a great companion for many years.\n\nI'm becoming house trained (mostly). I love my people and being outside with the other dogs. I need a home with a well-trained, well-socialized male dog who can show me the ropes in my new home and help me wear off some of my excess energy.  I'm not a good \"starter\" dog.\n\n---------\n\nGENERAL APPLICATION NOTES:\n\nWe strongly urge adopters to consider a male canine companion if they already have a female GSP/GWP. We get asked several times a year to take in one member of a 2-female GSP family because there are control issues between their girls that result in pretty ferocious fights. Interestingly that never happens among males. Go figure.\n\nDogs under 2 years of age need to go to a home with another well-socialized canine companion of a similar size (when grown) and within a few years of the pup\u2019s age. This is how they maintain and continue their learning/socialization process. Socialization outside the home is important but doesn\u2019t replace the in-home learning that is so important as the pup ages. https://www.facebook.com/ UtahsPerfectPointers/posts/ 1460968517254816\n\nMost older dogs aren\u2019t interested in having a puppy incessantly chewing on it and demanding attention. If you live outside of the Salt Lake area and are sure that your older dog just loves puppies, please arrange a visit at your home with a 2-4 month old pup for a couple of hours and make sure that your older dog feels the same way about this that you do. Please video the interactions and send it to us.\n\nJust a word of caution........ most pointer types need jobs. Otherwise they're not good pets. They need to be able to utilize their brains and no amount of exercise without a \"work\" or \"thinking\" component is adequate. The job doesn't need to be hunting. But it does need to be something that satisfies their genetic predispositions - nose work, agility, tracking, dock diving, etc. The job cannot just be obedience. If they can't use their innate senses they're just never going to be the dog you want for the next 15 years.\n\nA physical fence is required for most of our dogs.\n\nAs far as other breeds go, the pointers are generally good with most other breeds with the exception of the Arctic breeds and bulldogs. I'm not sure why, but if there's ever an altercation in daycare between a UPP dog and another dog, it's generally one of those two breeds. It may be the difference in energy levels. It may be some ancient behavior we know nothing about...... Not sure.\n\nUtah's Perfect Pointers is a very small rescue group and doesn't have the resources to adopt to states except for the ones noted above. If you are interested in adopting a GSP please contact the closest groups below.

After a couple of months of healing, her fur has grown back and she is looking great now.  She does need Apoquel to help with her allergies but we are not sure if they will be needed life long or all year long.  \n\nHarlow loves to play and loves other dogs.  She is a very active girl!  She will do best with a dog friend to play with and a fenced yard.  Harlow seems to ignore the cats in her foster home.  \n\nHarlow is crate and house trained. \n\nHarlow is spayed, microchipped, and current on her vaccines.  Her adoption fee is $175.  \n\nIf you would like to adopt Harlow and make her a part of your family, please apply at FYDRadopt.com.",

            "description": "Description of pet\nOur adoption area is limited to UT, NV, ID, OR, WA and MT with a home visit. If you are outside of this area please do a search for your local GSP/GWP/Pointer rescue group.\n\n--------\n\nI'm FALK! And I'm totally stunning.  I know because that's what my rescue lady said.  I have perfect confirmation, a field-dock tail, and totally love my people without being clingy.  Actually, I'm pretty happy if they'll spend the entire day playing ball with me.  My approx. DOB is 10/13/2017 so I'm the perfect age to be a great companion.\n\nI'm house trained (mostly). I love my people and being outside with them for hiking and other adventures. I'd really like a home with another well-trained, well-socialized dog who can show me the ropes in my new home.  I'd be OK as an \"only\" as long as I have lots of interaction with other dogs and outdoor time with my people.\n\nI've really been enjoying my daycare time. It allows me to socialize with people and other dogs all day so I get a good night's sleep. I'm looking forward to having my very own family to love me and care for me.\n\n---------\n\nGENERAL APPLICATION NOTES:\n\nWe strongly urge adopters to consider a male canine companion if they already have a female GSP/GWP. We get asked several times a year to take in one member of a 2-female GSP family because there are control issues between their girls that result in pretty ferocious fights. Interestingly that never happens among males. Go figure.\n\nDogs under 2 years of age need to go to a home with another well-socialized canine companion of a similar size (when grown) and within a few years of the pup\u2019s age. This is how they maintain and continue their learning/socialization process. Socialization outside the home is important but doesn\u2019t replace the in-home learning that is so important as the pup ages. https://www.facebook.com/ UtahsPerfectPointers/posts/ 1460968517254816\n\nMost older dogs aren\u2019t interested in having a puppy incessantly chewing on it and demanding attention. If you live outside of the Salt Lake area and are sure that your older dog just loves puppies, please arrange a visit at your home with a 2-4 month old pup for a couple of hours and make sure that your older dog feels the same way about this that you do. Please video the interactions and send it to us.\n\nJust a word of caution........ most pointer types need jobs. Otherwise they're not good pets. They need to be able to utilize their brains and no amount of exercise without a \"work\" or \"thinking\" component is adequate. The job doesn't need to be hunting. But it does need to be something that satisfies their genetic predispositions - nose work, agility, tracking, dock diving, etc. The job cannot just be obedience. If they can't use their innate senses they're just never going to be the dog you want for the next 15 years.\n\nA physical fence is required for most of our dogs.\n\nAs far as other breeds go, the pointers are generally good with most other breeds with the exception of the Arctic breeds and bulldogs. I'm not sure why, but if there's ever an altercation in daycare between a UPP dog and another dog, it's generally one of those two breeds. It may be the difference in energy levels. It may be some ancient behavior we know nothing about...... Not sure.\n\nUtah's Perfect Pointers is a very small rescue group and doesn't have the resources to adopt to states except for the ones noted above. If you are interested in adopting a GSP please contact the closest groups below.

This guy has a a cattitude - he will let you know when he wants attention and belly rubs - and when he's had enough. Archie is a 4 on the floor guy - he needs to keep all 4 paws on the ground. If you let him take possession of the sofa or the bed he will and he doesn't like to share. Little Archie has plenty of energy and does like to play. He loooves car rides and likes to go for walks. He's not going to shower you with kisses but he's perfectly content to be your companion. He's completely housebroken and does not need to be crated, which is good because he doesn't like crates. Archie lost his furever home when his person passed away, and we're having a tough time finding a home that's the right fit for his independent personality. People expect him to be a cuddly lapdog, but he's just not that dog. We know the right home is out there for this guy, and we're hoping this very honest description will help us find the right home for Archie. If you'd like to meet Archie, please fill out a foster-to-adopt application at dreamhouserescue.org.\n\nAll of our fully-vetted adoptable dogs go to prospective homes for a one-week trial foster-to-adopt period to make sure the dog and home are the right fit before an adoption is finalized. We only adopt dogs into homes where all current pets are spayed/neutered and current on vaccines and heartworm and flea and tick prevention. We do check veterinary references to make sure adopters are compliant with standard veterinary care.",

            "description": "Pixie Stix is a beautiful Labrador - Airedale mix puppy with beautiful blue eyes! Wow!  What an unusual beauty!  She was born 9-19, currently weighs about 18 lbs and will grow to be a medium sized to large dog.  Mom is Sharla, an Airedale mix.  Daddy was apparently a traveling salesman.  Pixie Stix is a bundle of normal puppy energy and affection.  Pixie Stix\u2019s foster mom says she is curious, adventurous and loves to \u201ctalk.\u201dShe also has adorable blue eyes. \n\nOWR will cover the costs of all puppy shots and spay. Adopters must live in the Tulsa or OKC area so that the pups can be treated at one of our partner vets. \n\nIf you\u2019d like to meet Pixie Stix, the first step is to complete and submit an adoption application on our okwestierescue.com website and we\u2019ll get the process started. \n\nPlease allow 1-2 weeks to finish processing your application, but please know our volunteers are working hard on it. \n\nPixie Stix\u2019s adoption fee is $300 and is tax deductible. \n\nNOTE: You must complete and submit an application and be approved to adopt prior to being able to meet the dog.  The requested tax-deductible adoption donation is $400 for our puppies, $300 for up to age 7 and $150 for ages 8 and older.\n\nWe do not ship our pets.  Be prepared to travel to Tulsa, OK, or Oklahoma City, OK, or the location where this dog is fostered to pick up your dog in person if your application is approved.  Once you are approved, you may adopt any of our dogs that is a good fit. \n\nWe are a non-profit organization that spends our adoption fees and donations on vaccinations, surgeries, various medical tests, medicines, food and supplies needed by our dogs. Our fees do not cover the overall expenses incurred by the care of our dogs, but they do help defray the costs involved.  We thank you for your support. \n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always try to select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dog\u2019s needs and try to find the best match for both dog and human. \nWe leave a dog\u2019s profile online until either it has been adopted, has received several applications, or is not able to be adopted for some reason. \n",

For the past several months, he has been growing and learning in a loving foster home. Pete is a smart guy who is eager to learn. He enjoys tasty snacks and would benefit from enrichment activities like solving food puzzles or using his keen brain to learn new skills. He already knows ''sit'' and ''shake''! Pete enjoys the company of other dogs and would do best sharing his forever home with a social, canine friend.\n\nBecause of Pete's history and behavior, his new home must include the following:\n- Must be an indoor pet\n- Never left outdoors unattended, or on a tie out or in a kennel\n- Secure fenced-in yard\n- No children under the age of 12 years old\n\nPete may be best suited as a homebody type of dog and will likely not be well suited to many adventures away from the home. Given time, patience, love, and understanding, Pete will make a fun, loving canine companion for the right family or individual.",

Sumari has a history of being a shy, fearful dog but in the time that he has been in our care, he has experienced tremendous growth and progress. Given time, patience, and understanding, Sumari can learn to trust and enjoy humans. Once he is comfortable, Sumari absolutely shines. He loves playing with stuffed toys and tossing them in the air! He enjoys using his keen brain to solve food puzzles and learn new skills. Most of all, Sumari is our ''helper dog'' and has been given a job at the shelter: to help us gauge the behavior of all incoming dogs. Sumari adapts to whatever any new dogs need, whether it is a playmate, or some space. He has been instrumental in helping many new dogs feel at ease in the shelter environment. Although Sumari has thrived in many ways, he can still be unsure in certain situations.\n\nDue to his shyness, there are specific requirements for Sumari's forever home:\n-Must be an indoor pet\n-No children under the age of 10 years old\n-Securely fenced in yard - but not to be left outdoors unattended, on a tie out, or in a kennel\n-Another social, friendly dog in the home preferred\n\nSumari has an unknown history with cats. Sumari may be best suited as a homebody type of dog and will likely not be well suited to many adventures away from the home. Given time, patience, love, and understanding, Sumari will make an incredible companion for the right family or individual.",

Kevin came into our care as a stray so his history is a mystery, but since then, we have enjoyed getting to know Kevin! Kevin enjoys the simple things in life: good meals, comfortable beds, and enthusiastic attention from caring humans (he loves when you say hi to him!) He's an easy-going low maintenance kind of dog, but don't let his mellow demeanor fool you! Kevin is a smart boy who loves to give ''high five'' and will likely prove that old dogs CAN learn new tricks! Kevin can be a little unsure about his dog friends and may do best in a home without any other pets. Kevin is currently living in a wonderful foster home, on a farm, where he has been able to meet other animal friends of many different species. We are happy to share that Kevin doesn't have any interest in chasing chickens and may be able to safely live around chickens! He is very curious about his foster family's cat, however, but the cat is not interested in playing with Kevin. Kevin has also met horses. His foster mom describes him as having the most wonderful energy - ''he is curious about everything, and obsessive over nothing.''\n\nRecently, Kevin was diagnosed with cancer. We're so hoping that Kevin will find a family that will shower him with love and care (and snacks!) Kevin deserves to know a comfortable life in a loving forever home.",

Still, she would do great in a home with a social, active male dog who is happy to chase her and play with her when she's up for it! If you are gentle, soft spoken and ready for a dog that will undoubtedly want to cuddle and watch some movies with you, Tillie is your girl! She of course is ready for some adventures and walks too, but would love the time to gain some confidence before jumping out into the big world! \n\nAt this time because of her need for a patient home, Tillie is not a candidate for interisland adoptions.",

            "description": "Our adoption area is limited to UT, NV, ID, OR, WA and MT with a home visit. If you are outside of this area please do a search for your local GSP/GWP/Pointer rescue group.\n\n--------\n\nI'm COLTER!  I'm a stunning, active guy.  I'm a nice, solid boy, about 50 lbs and 24\" at my withers.  My approx. DOB is 4/30/2019 so I'm still pretty young and very, very active.\n\nI'm house trained and will whine/run to the door when I needs to potty. I sort of know: Sit, (lay)Down, Shake, Kennel, Drop it, Get it, and Off. My recall is NOT good and I'm not particularly happy about \"staying\".\n\nI spend my outdoor time chasing birds, playing with the other dogs, or lounging on the yard furniture. I also like to have toys to play with - nylabones, soccer balls, etc.  I'm pretty good in my crate at night.  I'm still a counter surfer so everyone's happier if I have some control on my wandering when my people are asleep.\n   \nI like to dig so it's a good idea not to leave me outside unattended.  I totally love playing tug-of-war and chewing on nylon bones. I can't have fluffy toys because I shred them or try to eat the whole thing. Additional talents include  swallowing socks or small fabric items comparable to socks.\n\nI'm great with adults and OK around children if I'm monitored.  I'm good with  other dogs with the exception of Arctic breeds. I lived with a hound mix, golden retriever mix, and a catahoula mix in my past life and I'm doing great with the other dogs and handlers in daycare.  \n\n---------\n\nGENERAL APPLICATION NOTES:\n\nWe strongly urge adopters to consider a male canine companion if they already have a female GSP/GWP. We get asked several times a year to take in one member of a 2-female GSP family because there are control issues between their girls that result in pretty ferocious fights. Interestingly that never happens among males. Go figure.\n\nDogs under 2 years of age need to go to a home with another well-socialized canine companion of a similar size (when grown) and within a few years of the pup\u2019s age. This is how they maintain and continue their learning/socialization process. Socialization outside the home is important but doesn\u2019t replace the in-home learning that is so important as the pup ages. https://www.facebook.com/ UtahsPerfectPointers/posts/ 1460968517254816\n\nMost older dogs aren\u2019t interested in having a puppy incessantly chewing on it and demanding attention. If you live outside of the Salt Lake area and are sure that your older dog just loves puppies, please arrange a visit at your home with a 2-4 month old pup for a couple of hours and make sure that your older dog feels the same way about this that you do. Please video the interactions and send it to us.\n\nJust a word of caution........ most pointer types need jobs. Otherwise they're not good pets. They need to be able to utilize their brains and no amount of exercise without a \"work\" or \"thinking\" component is adequate. The job doesn't need to be hunting. But it does need to be something that satisfies their genetic predispositions - nose work, agility, tracking, dock diving, etc. The job cannot just be obedience. If they can't use their innate senses they're just never going to be the dog you want for the next 15 years.\n\nA physical fence is required for most of our dogs.\n\nAs far as other breeds go, the pointers are generally good with most other breeds with the exception of the Arctic breeds and bulldogs. I'm not sure why, but if there's ever an altercation in daycare between a UPP dog and another dog, it's generally one of those two breeds. It may be the difference in energy levels. It may be some ancient behavior we know nothing about...... Not sure.\n\nUtah's Perfect Pointers is a very small rescue group and doesn't have the resources to adopt to states except for the ones noted above. If you are interested in adopting a GSP please contact the closest groups below.

            "description": "Candy Corn is a beautiful Labrador - Airedale mix puppy. She was born 9-19, currently weighs about 18 lbs and will grow to be a medium sized to large dog.  Mom is Sharla, an Airedale mix.  Daddy was apparently a traveling salesman.  Candy Corn is a bundle of normal puppy energy and affection.  Her foster mom says she is as sweet as her name!  Candy Corn has one blue eye and one brown, which makes her pretty special. \n\nOWR will cover the costs of all puppy shots and spay. Adopters must live in the Tulsa or OKC area so that the pups can be treated at one of our partner vets. \n\nIf you\u2019d like to meet Candy Corn, the first step is to complete and submit an adoption application on our okwestierescue.com website and we\u2019ll get the process started. \n\nPlease allow 1-2 weeks to finish processing your application, but please know our volunteers are working hard on it. \n\nCandy Corn\u2019s adoption fee is $300 and is tax deductible. \n\nNOTE: You must complete and submit an application and be approved to adopt prior to being able to meet the dog.  The requested tax-deductible adoption donation is $400 for our puppies, $300 for up to age 7 and $150 for ages 8 and older.\n\nWe do not ship our pets.  Be prepared to travel to Tulsa, OK, or Oklahoma City, OK, or the location where this dog is fostered to pick up your dog in person if your application is approved.  Once you are approved, you may adopt any of our dogs that is a good fit. \n\nWe are a non-profit organization that spends our adoption fees and donations on vaccinations, surgeries, various medical tests, medicines, food and supplies needed by our dogs. Our fees do not cover the overall expenses incurred by the care of our dogs, but they do help defray the costs involved.  We thank you for your support. \n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always try to select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dog\u2019s needs and try to find the best match for both dog and human. \nWe leave a dog\u2019s profile online until either it has been adopted, has received several applications, or is not able to be adopted for some reason. \n",

He has great muscle mass, bloodwork is good. Such great news.\n\nDax gets along fine with other dogs but is not a good choice for small children. Dax is deaf and he has limited vision due to cataracts. He sees shadows and learns his way around new places incredibly fast. Did you see how cute he is with his tongue hanging out?!! So adorable! He has no teeth so there's nothing to hold his tongue in. And he is all ready for a great walk. Well, a walk for you, as you push him in a stroller.\n\nIf you'd like to adopt our handsome, sweet little Dax please fill out an adoption application at www.daretorescue.org\n\nIf you know that I am your forever dog please fill out an application at: https://daretorescue.org/adoption-application.html **Please don't forget to put my name on your application!\n\nIf you can not adopt me but would like to help DARE pay for my care while I am in their care you can donate online http://daretorescue.org/donation.html\nor send check or money order made payable to DARE to:DAREPO BOX 21161\nTAMPA, FL 32210\nYou can also contact us at info@DAREtoRescue.org\nEven if you do not see a dog that matches what you're looking for, you may fill out a no obligation application and we will work to find a match for you. We receive dogs into foster care almost daily, so it is impossible to have every available or soon-to-be-available dog on the website.",

Although Zeus has some pent-up frustration from kennel life, he exhibits pure joy playing in the yard and sharing quality time with his friends. Zeus is a strong puller on leash in his excitement getting out of the kennel and walks best with a harness. He is reactive to other dogs and needs training to overcome this trait. Zeus is smart, promptly sits for treats, and seems to be house-trained. He is a fun, happy dog who should thrive with an active person willing to work with him to become the best boy that he can!

            "description": "Rocco was previously a yard dog (and talented escape artist), but he was obviously loved. He was also, er... 'very well nourished'. He was overwhelmed by the shelter environment but immediately settled well in foster and no longer needs anxiety meds. Rocco does not like to be alone (inside or outside) and will cry, moan, or howl if he cannot be by your side. He is an adamant lap cuddler. It's hard to stop him. He is housebroken. He crates well at night in the bedroom. He does not chew forbidden items. Rocco played well with three neighbor children (7-10) one time. Otherwise, children are an unknown. Rocco came with some prior obedience training. Rocco needs lots of work on leash walking. He is very active and would like to go faster. Rocco currently thinks bicycles are related to dragons and he is the hero of the story. There's no doubt he LIKES other dogs. He is an energetic playmate and is VERY tolerant of much rougher dogs. He defers in social interactions and takes turns during play. A smaller, a more sedate, or an older dog may dislike playing as much as he wants. He has very high prey drive; recommend no small animals. The resident confident, indoor cat eventually tamed him with help from resident giant dog, but it was a nailbiter. Protecting the resident chickens has been a battle. With health precautions in mind, he should meet any animal buddies and also perform his own on-site, on-leash fence inspection prior to adoption. Videos of his escape artistry can be provided. This is one smart cookie.",

If there is an applicant, it will say PENDING ADOPTION next to the dog's name. If not, please submit an Application that can be found on our site, www.fluffydog.net. \n\nMY AGE: approx. 6 months (1/6)  WEIGHT: approx. 45 lbs. (1/9) WHERE I AM FROM: AL (arrival 11/11) \n\nMY STORY: 1/9 Uno is smart and food motivated. He learned to sit, stay, lay, and shake in the first couple of days he was with us. This handsome boy is absolutely adorable with his expressive ears and silky fur. Uno likes to be with his people and needs time to warm up to strangers. Once he is comfortable, his tail starts wagging the moment you walk in the room, and his silly, affectionate personality comes out. Uno loves being with the kids and running with them in our big green space. He needs an active family to help him run his energy out (or a fenced yard), then he is happy to chill inside. Uno has been great with other dogs and gets so excited to play with them. He has had no known exposure to cats but plays gently with small dogs.\n\nUno is housebroken and trained to ring a bell on the door when he wants to go outside. This clever fella LOVES the snow and will sometimes ask to go out just to play. Uno is excellent in the crate at night but would prefer to be with people during the day. He will happily follow us around the house and patiently waits for us to finish our tasks. Uno loves chewing on bones and toys. His favorite spot is napping next to the kids on the one sofa he is allowed on, and he is so good about staying off all the other furniture in the house. With Uno\u2019s sweet personality, he is going to make a great addition to someone\u2019s family.\n\nThis dog does shed and is not hypoallergenic.\n\nHOUSEBROKEN?   GOOD WITH DOGS?  Yes  GOOD WITH CATS?unknown\n\nADOPTION FEE: $450\n\nTo adopt the FIRST STEP is to complete an APPLICATION.

I am a loving, playful, strong, energetic, and fit 60 lb red-nosed pitbull (possibly mixed), and although I'm already pretty big, I still have some room to grow into my paws. I love attention and cuddles and am told my fur feels like suede. I like playing tug-o-war and fetch over short distances. I am house-trained, know \"sit\", and I am learning \"stay\". In my foster home, I am crated when my fosters are not home and enjoy supervised free roaming time when they are with me. I am still young and am learning which things are mine and are allowed to be chewed on- I love toys and I want to please you- durable chew toys, supervision, play time to get my energy out, and positive reinforcement are the ingredients to my success. I like play time with other dogs and love time with my canine friends in my foster home- I have a dominant personality so it has to be the right match and I do best with slower introductions. I love food and treats (don't you?!) but I need to be fed separately because I resource guard food (don't worry, it's easy because I am fine eating in my crate or a separate room!) I like all people- I live with kids and love to give them kisses and play with them! Due to my size and energy, I might be best with bigger kids so I don't accidentally knock down little ones with my excitement. Really, I am just a girl looking for love. Maybe you are just a family, looking for me?!",

I am easy on walks and ready to be your adventure partner! On walks I do get excited when I see small animals (so no cats in a forever home for me!) I like to play tug-o-war and romp with my fellow foster dogs. When playing with other dogs, I am a rough and tumble type of playmate. I am a sweet pup and love spending time with my foster family which includes 2 young children (although I love them, I am still learning not to jump up and I may be better with older kids that I won't accidentally knock over with my love and excitement). I am always happy to see people and readily greet them with a smile and waggly tail. After expending my youthful energy, I like to settle down for some cuddling and petting (fair warning: I might try to kiss you!) My foster family crates me when they are not home and lets me enjoy supervised free roaming time when they are home. Bonus, I'm housetrained!! I am a happy boy and I am looking for a loving forever family that will give me lots of petting and love.",

He is a bit rough around the edges but with the right family we know he would be eager to learn! Since Enzo is quite strong, he does pull on the leash while out for walks, but with patience we know he would learn quickly! This hunka hunka burnin' love can't get enough treats! The way to his heart like most dogs is through treats and pets! Enzo is quite affectionate, we love to shower him in affection and he gladly accepts! We know that Enzo's a bit of a fixer upper in terms of his manners, but that won't stop you from falling in love with him!

He is very friendly to people and has shown no aggression toward other dogs. Hamilton would love to find his own fur-ever home!\n\nAdoption fee for Dogs is $100, which includes microchip. All of our dogs and puppies have been examined by a veterinarian, de-wormed,  vaccinated, treated for fleas and ticks, spayed or neutered and  tested for heartworms (If 6 months of age and over) and are on monthly heartworm preventative.  Puppies too young to be spayed/neutered require a refundable $50 deposit which will be returned upon proof of spay/neuter. If this is done at our vet (Allen's in Parsons), there is no charge for the spay/neuter. Give us a call at 620-421-0445 or e-mail us at pals@wavewls.com today to find out more about this pet.",

She\u2019s friendly and submissive for other dogs and excited for a cat friend like in her original home. She\u2019s not high-energy around the house but would probably love to be a jogging partner or have a yard to run around in. \n\nInteresting quirks/behaviors:\nHer favorite place to sleep is under her foster mom\u2019s bed. She likes carrying around and snuggling with toys but still isn\u2019t necessarily sure how to play with them.

Panther's owners surrendered her to the New York City Animal Care Centers - They New York City municipal shelter. Panther Is an outgoing, energetic 100% ebony beauty. Panther is as sleek as the great cat whose name she bears. But that is where the comparison ends. Because PANTHER is sweet, loveable, good with other dogs. Just a youngster and only 40 lbs, this pint-sized cutie is always in motion and always sporting a big happy smile. Panther is waiting and hoping for someone who can understand her needs of a laid back home but active in taking longs walks, hikes, or perhaps even a swim when the weather is hot and sultry. She needs an experienced handler who understands her need for structure and consistency. Someone who can understand her needs for nonchaotic life inside your home. waiting for the next chapter in her life. We are told by previous owners that she has a knack for playing with her ball and chew bones, (while not so keen on sharing them, and understandably so - not everyone wants to share their favorite things!). She was a frequenter of dog parks and appears to like the company of not only dogs but even the resident cat. Panther seeks a home that can give her time and space to adjust, as becoming friends with her is quite a treat! An adult-only home would best suit this pup, \n\n\nThis is what her foster mom has to say:\n\nShe\u2019s friendly and submissive for other dogs and excited for a cat friend like in her original home. would love to be a jogging partner or have a yard to run around in. Her favorite place to sleep is under her foster mom\u2019s bed. She likes carrying around and snuggling with toys but still isn\u2019t necessarily sure how to play with them. Would love to be your lap dog, Panther is a Rockstar ready to shine with a heart of gold looking for her forever kind of love.\n\nPLEASE KNOW THAT AS CUTE AND ADORABLE AS PANTHER IS, SHE WILL NEED AN EXPERIENCED HANDLER TO UNDERSTAND HER FEAR BASED INSECURITIES. If you don't understand what this is, you're not the right adopter for her.\n\nThanks..",

WE WILL NOT RESPOND TO ANY OF THESE EMAILS/APPS\n\nThis little girl Harvest is mostly we believe a  double merle Aussie  and has the generic condition of eyesight issues b/c of it.  Her eyes are blue and she can see shapes and shadows but does not have full vision.  THIS DOES NOT STOP HER FROM FULL MOBILITY IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM.  YOU NEVER WOULD KNOW SEEING HER IN ACTION THAT SHE HAS ANY EYE DEFICIET.\nShe is only about 7 mo old and 30 lbs of cuteness.  She will be moving to foster care so updates will be shared soon.  Adopters will need a fenced in yard and another dog for her to follow and take the lead from.  Adoption fee 150.00\n\n12/2: UPDATE FROM FOSTER DAD:  Harvest - From frequent accidents to fully housebroken in a week. Plays and runs flat out with her dog buddies. Loves kids, hugs, snuggles and toys. Figures out and defeats treat dispensers to give all the treats at once. Watches how you open doors then tries herself.\nThis is Harvest, an upbeat smarty pants ready for whatever life brings. And life, in her case, is made somewhat more challenging than some. Harvest has congenital diminished vision and hearing, though it doesn\u2019t get her down. She inspires with her unsinkable attitude and uncanny ability to adapt. Harvest would make a fine friend, ideally in a home that includes an energetic dog play buddy. \n",

Jordan walks nicely on the leash and doesn't pull or stray too far from your side. What Jordan really loves is toys! He's great at playing fetch and will run after the toy, pick it up, and drop it on the ground in your general vicinity so you can throw it again. He's also happy to just chew on toys or carry them around the yard. Jordan attends play group and likes the company of calmer, gentler dogs like him, so he could go to a home with or without another dog.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n\nAs sweet as her name, Peaches savors the closeness of people. The 64-pound white and tan beauty who lives to be loved on, adores being petted, touched and having her back legs and butt scratched. A happy honey, calm and quiet most of the time, she gets along best with older children and not only loves playing with stuffed toys, but removing the stuffing and chewing on it! Taking food and treats very gently - apples are her new favorite snacks -- she knows her name, \"sit\", \"stay\" and \"down\" when her fosters are eating, walks well on leash using a harness to minimize her tendency to pull, and is housetrained to a doggy door.\n\nAnimal Rescue of the Rockies believes that every pet should find a wonderful, caring home. To ensure each pet finds the best possible home, we ask that you fill out our Adoption Application so we can learn more about you and your household. We review each application we receive and will contact you within 48 hours. If your home sounds like a good match for you and the pet,\n\nthe next step is to set up a \"meet and greet.\" After meeting the pet, if you would like to proceed with adopting, we'll ask that you read and sign our Adoption Agreement and pay the adoption fee. Our adoption fees help cover the costs of saving more lives!\n\nA home visit will be scheduled within one week of your new pet going home with you.\n\nThe adoption fee for this pet is $300. Our adoption fee covers the following:\n\n- Spay/Neuter, Microchip\n\n- DAPP vaccinations as age appropriate for dog - adopter shall be responsible for all DAPP boosters after adoption.\n\n- Rabies vaccinations as age appropriate for dog - adopter shall be responsible for any rabies vaccinations after adoption.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out an adoption application by clicking\n\nhere\n\n.\n\nWe want our pets to go to a lifelong new home, so thank you for your patience during the adoption process!\n\nPlease email ARRColorado@gmail.com for more information, as we can not accept calls at this time.\n\nOur adoption process is:\n\n1. Fill out our Adoption Application online. We'll contact you within 48 hours to answer any questions you may have about the pet.\n\n2. If the pet looks like a great match, we'll schedule a meet and greet and ask you to fill out our online Adoption Agreement if you'd like to proceed with adopting. Once you've completed the Adoption Agreement and pay the pet's Adoption Fee, you can arrange to pick up your new furry family member!",

We are a foster-based rescue in Chicago-land, which means that each dog is placed with a family in the area. This allows us to better understand each dog's individual personalities. \n\nYou must complete an application before you can schedule a meet and greet with each animal. The application can be found here: http://peaceforpits.org/adoptionfoster-application/ or if you prefer a Word version, download it here: https://goo.gl/bKo84P and email it to p4papplications@gmail.com.

He is a larger greyhound at 77 lbs., and as you can see from his photos, he is very colorful, black and white with ticking, (ticking refers to his large black spots.  Fireball likes to be near you so you can pet and adore him!  He loves attention and is gentle and affectionate.  He gets along well with the other greyhounds in his foster home and loves everyone he meets.  He also loves van rides and will hop right in.  He settles down quickly in his crate for the evening and sleeps through the night.  And he loves to eat!  He  cannot wait for you to feed him! Fireball competed in 15 races at Palm Beach and Derby Lane in St. Petersburg.  He only won one race before being retired.  In his lineage, there are some famous greyhounds, including Flying Penske, Kelsos Fusileer, and Gable Dodge. Fireball has not been cat tested. We tried him in a home as an only dog, and he was very unhappy, so we are looking for a home for him where he will have the companionship of at least one other dog.\n\nFireball just graduated from the Greyhound Advancement Center's greyhound training program at Hardee Correctional Institution.  Fireball knows all of his basic commands: sit, lie down, leave it, stay, wait at the door, go to place (his bed or mat), come on recall, heel, and leave it.  The training program is excellent for the inmates as well as the dogs.  The  inmate trainers can earn training certifications which they can then use to gain employment when they are released.  The dogs enjoy being at the prison and get lots of treats. We have had the training program for awhile now, and have graduated over 700 greyhounds!  \nFireball's $600 adoption fee includes his neuter, teeth cleaning, vaccines, Bordetella (to protect against kennel cough), microchip, leash and collar, adoption guide, BAGA identification tag, and prison training. Your adoption fee helps us to defray some of the veterinary and care costs we have incurred for Fireball, and will help us to continue our work on behalf of the greyhounds.   For more information or to meet this beautiful young greyhound boy, please contact us at us at BAGA@tampabay.rr.com. For more information on greyhounds as pets, or to submit an application to adopt  this greyhound, please go to our website: www.bayareagreyhounds.org.   Fireball is being fostered in the Tampa Bay area until he enters prison training on November 20th.  We will be happy to reserve him for your family with an approved application and a $100 deposit.",

            "description": "Kelsey is a shy 5 month old lab mix. \n\nPoor Kelsey was brought to a shelter in TX as an owner surrender. It was clear she had not been taken care of. She is very shy, and nervous of new people. She has some hairloss but with some TLC she will look better in no time. She has had a very stressful and hectic life so far. She needs someone patient to show her the good life. She deserves all the love in the world! \nFrom the foster: This girl is very sweet but is scared. She's been picked up by the local shelter, gotten fixed, given shots, and then ended up at my house to stay before transporting to CO. Kelsey wasn't taken care of before all of this. She has been relaxing at my house, she mostly stayed in her room (even when door was open). She has started coming closer to me but is not sure of being petted still. Kelsey will take treats from my hands though. She is learning that the house life is good.\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting the first step is to fill out an adoption application on our website aaanimalrescue.org. We are currently very busy! Please reach out to allaboardanimalrescue@gmail.com if you have an approved application on file! Please fill out an adoption application on our website if you are ready to adopt! \n\nThank you for your patience and understanding during this difficult time! We are on a mission to find everyone companions, we will continue to rescue dogs weekly! We update our page every Monday evening. We are not currently hosting any Petco adoption events for the public. We will be hosting meet/greet adoption appointments!\n\n\nBreed and size disclosure: As a rescue all of our dogs come to us from high-kill shelters or other rescues, so we do not get a lot of background or information on these dogs. We occasionally receive the mother with the puppies, but in most cases both parents are unknown. Because of this we do not know the full breeding of the dogs. We are required to list the dogs based on the breeds provided to us on their records, but they are all mixed breeds as far as we know, and we cannot guarantee the actual breeds of any of these dogs. Since the full breeding of the dogs is unknown we can also only give you an educated guess on the full-grown size of the dogs. All of the current information we have on the dogs is listed in their bio above. More information may be available at our adoption event, since a lot of the fosters turn in report cards on how the dog has done in their care when they drop them off. \n\nAdoption Process: If you are interested in adopting from us, the first step of our adoption process is to fill out an application online at http://aaanimalrescue.org/adoption_app.html. It takes us 24-48 hours to process your application and get back to you, via email. Applications turned in Friday afternoon or Saturday morning will not be processed since we are preparing for or at our adoption event. We do have applications on site at our events, but are not always able to approve them at that time and many of the dogs will already have holds on them, so we suggest you fill out an application prior to attending an adoption event. We can place a hold on one dog per approved applicant after a deposit fee has been received, please do not ask to hold a dog if you have not turned in an application and been approved, for the first hour of our adoption event, so that they can get the first chance to meet and hopefully adopt that dog. After the first hour of the event all dogs are available on a first come, first serve basis. If you already have an approved application on file, there will just be more paperwork and the adoption fee at the event, but you will be able to take home the dog/puppy that day. Since we are foster based and do not have a location, our dogs are only available to meet at our events, unless otherwise noted.",

How about a car companion? Reggie Wayne is the total package. He absolutely LOVES being outside, but after a nice long walk, he wants nothing more than to stretch out and take a nap. Reggie Wayne is the best listener and so eager to please. He can sit, stay, laydown, boop your hand, shake. On walks down a busy street, he will sit nicely by your side at every crosswalk, looking to you for the all clear to cross the street. He is housebroken and will even trot to the door and nose the handle to alert you that it's time! Taking a drive and want to bring Reggie along? He'll sit quietly in back seat, once he makes sure all is clear out the windshield. He loves to watch tv, with or without his foster mom, so he makes for a good Netflix buddy too. Go ahead and fill out that app today for your new best friend Reggie Wayne!\n\nReggie Wayne is about 5 years old and weighs about 65 pounds.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Reggie, please visit our website to learn about our adoption process and to fill out an application, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs and cats will be micro-chipped, spayed or neutered, and up-to-date on vaccinations at the time of adoption. For more photos of Reggie, follow us on Facebook Gateway Pet Guardians and Instagram @gatewaypets ... #gpgReggie. \n\nTo view other adoptable pets from our shelter, please visit, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nGateway Pet Guardians is proud to offer a variety of mixed breed dogs available for adoption. However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please download and complete an Adoption Questionnaire from our website and email Michelle at mhunt@k-9lifesavers.org\nYou can learn about the adoption process and find a Word, PDF and ONLINE version of the questionnaire by visiting: http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/howtoadopt/.\nDog's Name: Roxie\nEstimated Breed : Labrador Retriever Mix\nApproximate Age: 2 years\nApproximate Weight: approx. 50 lbs\nCurrently Living at: Foster\nAdoption Fee: $375\nDOG'S DESCRIPTION\nRoxie is just the sweetest girl who would love to find her forever home with you! She loves to give kisses, has done phenomenal with housetraining (no issues at all and goes immediately once we go outside), and has mastered 'sit'. Unfortunately, she is not a fan of cats. Due to her excitability, she might not do well with young/small children in the home. She is also dog select, so might not do well with another dog in the home - it will depend on the dog.\nShe is heartworm positive, but just received her treatment, and in a few weeks will be without any restrictions and ready to conquer the world!\nAre you in the mood for some Roxie love?\n\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

            "description": "Hi, I'm Marco and I have a heck of a story. I wish I could tell you! But apparently I've been bumped around from place to place, including a homeless camp and the pound. I'm kind of hyper, but I'm working on it. If I go for 2-3 nice walks during the day, I can be a couch potato. I get very excited when I meet new people and new dogs, but I'm very friendly and while I might be a bit too excited for little kids, I get along great with all people and other dogs once I settle down. If you're into hiking and walking and activity, I'm your dog. I can be a little picky about food, but I do eat, you just need to remind me that your food is not my food! I don't mind people touching my face, and I like my dog toys, sleeping in my crate (working on it with the door closed), and I love car rides (because it means I'm going on an adventure!). \n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pooch, please download the Adoption Questionnaire (farescue.org/pdf_files/questionnaire_canine.pdf), fill it out and email it back to us at info@farescue.org or fax (310) 362-0321. You can also meet this and/or other available dogs at our weekend adoptions.\n\n[Marco is 3 years old and weighs 54 lbs.]\n\n(2011)",

Mindy was one of the marina dogs there, we have help a few already and know how wonderful they are. Although she started out shy our wonderful volunteers have shown her that people are good. Mindy is coming out of her shell and loves meeting new people. She's doing great on leash and getting more confident everyday. Mindy will need more training and an understanding family that will introduce her to new things and take the appropriate amount of time to introduce her to other dogs. She would do best in a home with another dog.\n\nEmail dogs@labradorsandfriends.org or fill out our online application at\nwww.labradorsandfriends.org\nMindy is located in Southern California.",

Very much a puppy, Gibson is crate trained but has been in our kennel not a foster home, so house training will be required. \n\nGabby and Gibson ended up at the Seagoville Animal Shelter, the last of an unwanted litter. Due to their skin condition they were being passed over for adoption. All they needed was time to heal so we took them into our kennel and they've blossomed into darling puppies just grateful to finally feel well and eat on a regular basis. They'll both make wonderful companions for any active household with a fenced back yard and lots of room for zoomies.",

Willie is a very loving guy who will sit on your lap for hours just wanting attention.  He loves the snow and running in his fenced yard with the other dogs in his foster home.  He goes on daily walks and is very good on a leash.  Willie does not  have a mean bone in his body.  \n\nAfter being in his foster home for awhile, we noticed how many accidents he was having and had him seen at our vet and treated for a urinary tract infection.   The infection went away but the peeing did not.   After being seen by another vet for a second opinion and going through numerous tests, the conclusion is that his issues are behavioral.  \n\nWe are looking for a home for Willie where he may have to be in a heated barn or kennel with indoor and outdoor access at all times.  He definitely needs to be around people and other dogs as he would not be very happy if isolated.\n\nPlease contact Best Buddy Pet Rescue at 248-622-6097 for more information or to talk to Willie's foster mom.",

Enthusiastic about stuffed animals and tennis balls, Meeko is accomplished at both tug of war and fetch. Eager to please and intelligent, this bundle of fur is a quick learner. He is equally content with a long day of playing and walks as he is with a quiet night at home and lots of head rubs and belly scratches.  Meeko is a wonderful combination of playful and gentle and would likely do well with an active family with children to play and grow up with. \nKids over 8 years old please. \nemail delliott11@mindspring.com for application and adoption details\n\n",

I love to eat! \n\nI am a happy and confident dog and have shown no nervousness for various events - going to the vet, storms, loud noises, etc.  \n\nI have had some prior training, as I know and recognize command but do not always obey them.  I am doing well with leash training.  I am very high energy and need an active home where I gets lots of play time.  A fenced yard would be a huge benefit.  My foster mom says I let her take food, toys, and other items out of my mouth directly without issue.  I am fully house broken and have not been destructive of belongings.\n\nMy adoption fee is $150, which includes my neuter, shots, heartworm testing, and microchipping. You can find the adoption application and process on our website www.orphanannierescue.org. \n\nYou must live in GA to adopt me.",

            "description": "Lucky is an American Foxhound and true to his breed, he is sweet natured and sensitive yet relatively quiet.  He does well with strangers and all people and gets along well with the fosters'  two dogs - he has not been tested with cats.  He is a 5 year old neutered male that lost his home due to reasons unrelated to him.  This guy would do well in a home that knows about hounds and their noses - he will follow his nose and could get lost if you aren't watching.  So a fenced in yard is required.  We are looking for a home owner who lives near the Twin Cities area who understands hounds.  Lucky is good in the home and will be placed as an indoor only dog.  This means he will live inside with his family and only be outdoors when the family is outdoors.  He truly is one of the sweetest hounds we've ever met.  \n\nLucky is in the rehoming program of Blue Sky Rescue of MN, a 501c3 rescue that screens all applicants.  He is up to date with vet care and comes with vet records and an adoption agreement.",

For that reason I suggest him with larger dogs, even alpha dogs, since he does not try that funny business with our larger or other alpha dogs here.  \n\nGood with all female dogs.  \n\nNot a guy for small kids even though he seems to like them very well here, \n\nChildren ages 10 and up for this guy.  \n\nHe LOVES attention and will jump on our guests trying to get it.  \n\nHe is athletic, possibly a prospect for Agility for a beginner or as a project for a youngster, but he is not wild and crazy.  He seems pretty confident however. and he is smart.  \n\nTank has been treated for heartworms and is ready to find that permanent home.  He was one of two male dogs abandoned by a renter in our area.  He likes to hunt so a fenced in yard or an home in the city would be GREAT for him. Not a couch potato.  So we are looking for someone to hike,  bike, walk, run or just do some fun stuff with this guy.   \n\nAdoption fee is $250.  Call Marilyn at 573-722-3035 to adopt from 9:30am t o9:30pm Central Time.  \n\nWe adopt dogs all over the USA.  Flights are very difficult to arrange, however on the East side of the USA we use a transport company called ALPHA DOG TRANSPORT.

            "description": "This handsome Pyrenees mix boy is Greg and he is a sweetheart. Greg is doing well in foster and although he is shy, he is starting to seek out affection and learning how nice humans can be. Greg came into rescue from a neglect/cruelty case with multiple dogs who were starved and had mange. They were largely ignored and unsocialized so he has really come a long way in rescue care. He is good with other dogs and came into rescue with his buddy or maybe his sister Guinn. He is such a good boy as he looks out for her and cares for her. Greg is coming along so nicely now! Initially he would just freeze as he was frightened of new people but now, his tail wags when he sees a friendly face and he is learning to like walking on leash. He is not a huge boy, but he is a gentle boy who is learning everything he needs to know. It is so nice to see him coming around, getting friendlier each day, so he will need a kind, patient human to continue working with him. He likes to chase cats so a cat free home would be best for Greg. Greg could really use a home where he can continue to learn how great life can be. It is so nice that he has come so far in a short time, we know he will continue to do better and better. Greg is currently in boarding and we are looking for a foster or adopter who will continue to guide him.\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nNGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY. View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

            "description": "This sweet boy is Jack.  He is a 5 month old Shepherd mix who weighs 40lbs but will be about 75 lbs full grown. \n\nJack has a lot of personality.  He is an excellent napper but also playful.  He lives with many other dogs of all sizes and does great with all of them.  He is very lovable.  He is excellent with new people when they come over to his foster home.  He even did well with kids (age 7) who came over.  He has done excellent welcoming new foster dogs into his foster home as well.  \n\nHowever, when Jack is outside of his home, he is VERY nervous when meeting new people and new dogs.  He may pee meeting a new person at first but he does warm up fairly quickly to people.  Warming up to new dogs in a new home will take him some time often more than a day or so.   He lives with multiple dogs and has welcomed new dogs into his home but in a new place he is just so very nervous so is going to take time and patience and understanding.  \n\nJack would like a home where he is loved like crazy and treated like a member of the family.  He will need a home ready to give him the exercise he needs and the love and care he deserves.  He needs someone that will give him a few days to see him come out of his shell before giving up on him.  He really is an absolutely amazing dog if given the time.  \n\nHe is leashed trained,  pretty much house trained and will sit on command.\n\nJack is neutered, microchipped, and current on his vaccines.  His adoption fee is $175.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Jack and make him a part of your family, please contact ForeverYoursOKC@gmail.com.",

Outdoors, Kaiju has lots of energy...is a great walking, running and hiking companion. Small children make Kaiju nervous so he needs an adult home or a home with older kids.",

            "description": "Daphne is a super sweet shy kind of gal approximately 4 years old. She was returned to her foster home after 6 months with her new adopters. She wasn't bonding with her new family. Daphne was adopted to a quiet home with no other dogs and Daphne's foster Mom now feels that a better fit would be with at least one other outgoing playful friendly dog. Prior to adoption she was living with her foster Mom's 9 personal dogs and fit right back into the pack once she returned. She loves sleeping with her foster Mom and the rest of the gang. She would also do best with a family that is home a bit more than gone. Polite children could be a possibility since she loves attention. Her foster Mom sees tiny bits of a cute personality that hasn't 100% surfaced yet. Daphne is potty trained with or without a dog door, she does not bark and rides well in a car. Daphne will need leash training so best she goes to a home with a yard. She currently weighs about 9.5 pounds and is full grown.\nShe is spayed, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped. Her adoption fee of $300 includes a complementary vet visit. Home check required prior to adoption.\nPlease email her foster mom at lscott00001@gmail.com if you need more information or are interested in meeting her.\n\nWEEKEND ADOPTION EVENT LOCATIONS - Many animals available for adoption!\n\nSaturdays 10:30am to 3pm at Petco at Tatum & Bell Rd\n\n4727 East Bell\nRoad\n\n, Phoenix, AZ 85032\n\nSaturdays 11am to 3pm at Petco at Tatum & Shea Rd\n\n10825 N Tatum Blvd, Phoenix, AZ 85028\n\nSundays 11am to 3pm at Petsmart 73rd Ave and Bell Rd\n\n7290 W Bell Rd, Glendale, AZ 85308\n\n***Visit our website or facebook page for special events schedules!***\n\nWebsite:\nwww.azsmalldog.org /\n\nFacebook:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/arizonasmalldogrescue/",

Mom had enough... so he and five other dogs she collected which she said were found as strays, came to our rescue.  \n\nBruser has been an outdoor dog all his life.  We learned he has been neutered most of his life. However he is an alpha over the food bowl (and he looks it too).  \n\nHe also has chronic ear infections.  So we just started him on a total raw meat diet and anytime we have done this in the past the dogs health GREATLY improved.  \n\nHe requires about 8 ounces daily.  So we suggest the DINOVITE Raw Diet plan, using their supplements if you want an easy diet plan.  \n\nAlso, study the raw  diet on DOG'S NATURALLY Website for all the smarts of feeding raw.  10% raw bone, 10% organ meat and the rest muscle meat.  For the organ meat provide beef or poultry liver, gizzard, heart.  Liver is the BEST of them all.  \n\nI have found the raw diet also to improve temperament on a small dog we rescued.   It calmed him down in the dog pack and when in the crate waiting for his yummy meals. \n\nFREE to a home.  \n\nCall Marilyn between 9:30am to 9:30pm Central Time at 573-722-3035> \n\nWe adopt out dogs all over the USA.   \n\n\n\n",

She is shy but very sweet.  <P>\n\nCARLEIGH is a purebred Jack Russell who is shy and fearful of new people.  She needs a quiet home with someone willing to work with her to get over her fears. \nCARLEIGH would love a home where she can enjoy plenty of activity indoors and out. <P>\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIf you would like to meet, foster or adopt this pet, please fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser. EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

            "description": "Contact foster at HSDOGFOSTERMOM@GMAIL.COM Ronald is one of the most loving dogs I have ever fostered. He wants nothing more than too give you love and kisses and to receive love and affection in return. He's so happy when you are petting him. Loves to cuddle. Good in the car; content to have his head out the window or just sit and check things out. Loves squeaky toys, tennis balls and his favorite is Kong squeaky ball. If you throw the tennis ball or squeaky he'll go fetch it but he's not going to give it back ?? He just likes to carry them around. Gets along with my 3 senior dogs. He is very excited when meeting new dogs so needs slow introductions. Initially on two occasions he overstayed his welcome sniffing one of my dogs and she growled at him and he appropriately took the social queue and backed off. Knows how to use the doggy door and is housebroken. He had never chewed on anything in my house when I left him at home but he does have the company of other dogs so not sure how it would react if he was the only/sole dog. I have NOT crated him. Knows how to sit and shake and appears to understand the word no Does not seem to be food motivated. He does eat fast so I just watch to make sure he does not loiter around others who are still eating. Initially he followed me everywhere but as time has goes on he seems to be getting more comfortable with going outside and/or chilling in the living room on the dog bed. Needs training with regards to walking. If no distractions he is fine but if he sees a dog, cat, squirrel or rabbit he will pull. Typically for any creature outside of a dog, if I keep saying no Ronald he will stare but keep walking. NOTE: I do not have cats or children so I cannot speak to his behavior but as noted above he is one of the most loving dogs I have fostered so would not anticipate issues with children. The Animal Control staff indicated he did not do well with cats.",

            "description": "This big, stocky boy is full of love and joy!   He came to a high volume shelter with major skin problems, worms and grossly underweight.  He was rescued by SCP and what a transformation (see the pics)!  He's all fixed up and ready for his new home. He's still young (est EOB 1/31/2020) and weighs over 50 pounds now. He is dog and kid friendly.  He has not been around cats but he's young and not aggressive so he\u2019d likely just try to get them to play with him, which may be too much for some cats.  He loves all balls and squeaker toys.  He\u2019s sneaky and curious so you\u2019ll need to be careful when opening the front door because he\u2019ll want to go exploring.   His favorite time of day is any time food is involved so he'll be easy to teach new skills and tricks using food as an incentive. This boy loves to eat!   He is house and crate trained though he\u2019s not a fan of the crate.  He\u2019s proven himself trust worthy so has free reign with the other dogs but still eats in his crate because he'd gobble his food down and go looking for more in other dogs dishes. If you are interested in a lovable, fun, snuggle-bunny, please send an email to scpdogworld@gmail.com to get more information on how to fill out an application and have a great meet and greet to see if we are a match made in heaven.\n\nAdopter for this dog must reside in the immediate Houston/Galveston area and be at least 25 years old.  A home visit may be required prior to this dog going to any home. The adoption fee for a dog is $190 (or $245 for puppies) which includes State of Texas sales tax. All dogs are microchipped, on heartworm protection, spayed/neutered, vaccinated, de-wormed and treated for fleas.",

He is approximately 1 year old and he's all that in energy. \n*\tHe is a lab mix and can talk a big talk when trying to get your attention. \n*\tWith that said, he'd do best in a home with a fenced in yard. \n*\tHe LOVES to play with his humans and has many dog friends. \n*\tHe LOVES to get loved on and kisses on his snout. \n*\tHis energy level is pretty high but he'd make the BEST BFF ever. He'd love someone or a family who is SUPER active and wants to bring him along. \n*\tHe'd love access to water since his favorite activity at the rescue is playing with his favorite peeps, the hose and the water monster! Like I said a goof ball!!! \n*\tBut OMG the love factor with Brett is HUGE. \n*\tCall today to make your appointment and see if Brett is a good fit for you!!!If you wish to meet me, please call the Humane Society of York County at (803)-802-0902 to schedule an appointment. Adoption consultations are by appointment only.\n\nPlease refer to our website for adoption requirements: https://humanesocietyofyorkcounty.org/adopt/adoption-process.html\n\nTo learn more about the HSYC, please visit our website at www.humanesocietyofyorkcounty.org, Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/HSYC.animals/, or on Instagram at HumaneSocietyofYorkCounty\n\nThank you for your support.\n\nPhotographs courtesy of Emiko at https://www.studioemikophotography.com/, Christi Menefee at ChristiMenefee.tumblr.com, and Karen Carnahan from River Art Images https://www.facebook.com/riverartimages",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Georgia! Here's what my foster family has to say about about me:\n\n\"\"Georgia loves to be loved and has a lot of love to give. She loves everyone she has ever met and shows no signs of aggression to people. Georgia has some special needs due her neurological issues, but once you learn her quirks, you will love her as much as we do. Unfortunately, Georgia does not like our dog, our dog is too much for her. She would likely do well with a older, calm dog. My cats ignore her, and she ignores them. \n\nShe would do best with a fenced-in yard. She is getting better with walks, although we sometimes have to remind her what we are doing. She walks best with a harness. Georgia can run and play, but is not always steady on her feet. She has some vision problems, mostly in her right eye, but her nose and ears work just fine. She LOVES treats!! \n\nWe are so sad that we can not keep her, we have grown to love her so much. She needs someone with a little patience and a lot of time and love!!\"\"\n\nIf you're interested in adopting me, please fill out an application today: https://us01.sheltermanager.com/service?account=ah0334&method=online_form_html&formid=5To complete an adoption application, go to: http://almosthomeanimals.org/applications/adoption/",

            "description": "Hi there!\n\nMy name is Henry! I am 8 years old and I weigh 70 pounds!\nI was a stray that was found in South Houston. I was very skinny and had bad mange and was heartworm positive. I had been hanging out at a childrens park in a neighborhood and people finally realized that I was not going home with anyone but just following anyone I could home. I have scars all over my head and I look like where ever I came from was pretty tough but I'm just about as sweet as I can be. A nice lady with children felt bad for me and after seeing how sweet I was with her kids helped me to her home and took me to a vet. She got me into a rescue who started getting me healthy and ready for heartworm treatment and I am now negative and in a foster home!\n\nI had called shotgun in my fosters car and was immediately her best bud. I kept popping her hand off the shift to stick my head under it so she could pet me better. I'm very considerate that way and still do that whenever I'm sitting next to someone and I think they've forgotten how to pet me. They got me neutered, up to date on shots, current on heartworm/flea prevention and microchipped. Unfortunately after a long time of being on the street with no one to take care of me I was heartworm positive but I have already been through treatment and am now negative!\n\nI really love all people. Little ones, Big ones, tall ones and short ones it doesn't make any difference to me! I would love a home with just about anyone who would show me affection whether they've got kids or grandkids running around. I'm a little bit older boy so I don't need quite as much action as some of those young bucks out there but I still like to go for a walk down the road with my foster mom and I get super excited when I see people! I need to be and only dog. Other dogs rile me up too much and after being on the street for so long I don't know what to expect from them and unfortunately get overstimulated very quickly and I get upset! I also need to be in a single person home. I've always been good in my foster home but I've gone on two home trials and I've become protective of the woman of the home towards the males in the house. But my foster mom is still working with me all the time to make me the best boy I can be!\n\nI am still located in Houston, Texas but am super excited to find my forever home and get transported to your area! Will you be my family? For more info on me please email Stephanie at nicole.whar94@yahoo.com.",

Rescues had come in and picked all the youngsters and left me and my ol' lady friend all by our selves on the street. Finally after alot of networking a rescue heard we were still there and came to get us. I hopped right in her car but my friend she had to get fancy and corner in someones yard! I was so friendly I was trying to help her get my buddy the whole time! Didn't she know good people when she saw one???\n\nI had called shotgun in the car and was immediately her best bud. I kept popping her hand off the shift to stick my head under it so she could pet me better. I'm very considerate that way and still do that whenever I'm sitting next to someone and I think they've forgotten how to pet me. They got me neutered, up to date on shots, current on heartworm/flea prevention and microchipped.

You will see that I am still in Houston, TX but I want to get OUT of Houston and OUT of Texas so I can have a really good life. I want to see Texas in my rear view mirror. A nice person came along and took me in and, now, I am ready to hit the road to your house! Uh, make that \u201cour\u201d house, OK? As soon as you adopt me, I\u2019ll be on my way to you! I am very excited to find my forever home. I'm a good boy. You'll see!\n\nI am a mixed breed boy. I am 2.5 years old and I weigh approximately 50 pounds. I am house-trained. I am crate-trained. I have had all of my shots and have been neutered and I'm ready to go to my new home with YOU! Those funny-looking 2-legged creatures also say that I am microchipped \u2013 whatever THAT is.\n\nWanna hear more good stuff about me? OK, here goes. I am a friendly boy. I love all people and other dogs. I am active and love to run and play. I have been in a foster home with other dogs so am very well socialized with other dogs of different sizes and ages and I temper myself very well to whoever I'm with. When I'm excited I still have a tendency to jump  up but my foster mom is working with me on that and I love learning new things especially for a treat! I have a hound dog type bark but I don't use it very often usually only when I think I'm being left out of something like a walk or if everybody is headed to the back yard and I'm stuck in my kennel. Its  puppy torture! But I'm very polite and don't carry on very long about it. \n\nI was brought to the rescue by a couple who had seen their next door neighbor move and leave me and a couple other dogs tied up in the yard in back. Luckily they knew we were there and came to give us food and water until they were sure no one was coming back for us. I ended up being in a long term foster home as I had to luxating patellas which is super common but unfortunately due to how active I am they were bothering me often so the rescue elected to fix both knees for me so I could run and play with out them bothering me!  I have been neutered, micro-chipped, vaccinated and kept up to date on heartworm and flea prevention. I am also heartworm negative!\n\nMy foster mom loves me SO much that she only wants me to fly to my new home even if a pet transport truck was available. See my adoption information below.\n\nIf you would like to take me home (and you know you do), please email nicole.whar94@yahoo.com and she can get me on my way to a new and loving home! My adoption fee is $450 USD and includes my vetting, neutering, microchip, health certificate, travel crate AND transportation on United Airlines from Houston, TX to areas in the Northeast U. S., North Central U. S., Northwest U. S., and Canada and will be arranged by the rescue group",

            "description": "Hi there!\n\nMy name is Blue! I am 10-11 months old and I weigh 40 pounds!\nI was found running around a neighborhood. Many of the neighbors had seen me come up to their door but no one knew who I belonged to. Luckily I finally ran up to someone getting in their car and hopped right in with her! She volunteers for a rescue and works at a vet clinic so after posting me online, scanning me for a chip, and asking around the neighborhood for my owners with no success she decided to foster me and enter me into the rescue. I was such a sweet boy she just knew I would find a home! I was scared when I first had to go to the vet and had gotten my shots and everything done. But with enough treats I quickly came around and got used to being poked and prodded. I LOVE going to adoption events and get excited to see all the people. My foster mom is still working with me to get me to keep my confidence up as I approach groups of people as I can still get nervous and overwhelmed but I'm doing really well and warm up super fast! I instantly like other dogs though I just recently got neutered so we are still learning that humping human and dog friends alike is a rude intro! \n\nNow that I have settled into a foster home I could be shy with new people but I want to make friends so bad! And now I usually approach people very excitedly and confidently.  My foster mom is working on leash and potty training as I don't think I've ever had someone let me in the house and make me a part of the family before! I would do really well in a home with another dog especially one who wouldn't overwhelm me. I really like kids but the younger ones might be too much for me so we are looking for a home with teens or none at all.\n\nI am neutered, up to date on shots, current on heartworm/flea prevention and microchipped. I was also heartworm negative! Yay!\n\nI am still located in Houston, Texas but am super excited to find my forever home and get transported to your area! Will you be my family?

He has one cherry eye, which will be surgically corrected before he goes to a new home. This procedure costs about $500 and has a great success rate. Any donations to assist with his surgery are appreciated.\n\nHe enjoys sniffing around on walks. He will take some time to warm up to new people, but we are confident he will become a great boy for any family! Please email muellenbergerin@gmail.com or message us on instagram @ahome4ever_rescue\n\nHe can't wait to meet you!\n\n---\n\nCome meet our dogs Saturdays and Sundays at Petsmart in Costa Mesa from 11:30-2:30. All A Home 4 Ever Rescue dogs receive a wellness exam by our veterinarian and are up to date with vaccinations. They are spayed or neutered and microchipped before they go to their adoptive families. If you would like more information please email the adoption Director muellenbergerin@gmail.com",

This sweet 10 year old mini Poodle has been with us since February, spending his time with an amazing foster.\n\nWiley came from a local shelter with two debilitated back legs. After multiple vet visits to seek out his diagnosis, it was identified that both of Wiley's knees have severely subluxated patellas. Based on the severity and his age, surgery is not recommended. He will be on Gabapentin and in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. He cannot go for long walks and cannot climb stairs.\n\nEver since Wiley came to our rescue, he has been in great spirits and has a very loving and friendly disposition with his human but he does not do well with other dogs. He would make the best companion to a single person or retired couple looking for a companion\n\nIf interested in giving this sweet boy a loving home, please message us! muellenbergerin@gmail.com #adoptdontshop\n\n---\n\nCome meet our dogs Saturdays and Sundays at Petsmart in Costa Mesa from 11:30-2:30. All A Home 4 Ever Rescue dogs receive a wellness exam by our veterinarian and are up to date with vaccinations. They are spayed or neutered and microchipped before they go to their adoptive families. If you would like more information please email the adoption Director muellenbergerin@gmail.com",

This little guy loves attention, but he takes time to bond and trust. He does not like to be picked up, but once he gets to know you and trusts you, he is a very loving and affectionate boy who likes to sit on your lap.\n\nBeau is a ladies man and would prefer a female owner as he can be fearful of men. He needs an adult only home and lots of TLC. Can you be his one and only?\n\nBeau is healthy, neutered, heartworm negative, and up to date on his shots.\nTo apply: 1.

She was figuring things out for herself and her daughter and felt it was in the best interest of these two bonded girls to find a new forever home. They were well-cared for and loved and we are happy to have them with us.\nCoco is low energy, super cuddly and 22 lbs and Fern is medium energy and 12 lbs. Together, they are a great balance! They are UTD on vaccinations, microchipped, spayed and generally healthy. \nCoco is blind and Fern is her little seeing eye dog. Fern really seems to feel like she needs to take care of Coco and gets upset when they are separated. They often lay together, but Fern will get up on the couch whereas Coco stays safely on the floor. While they came to us as house trained, they will need just a little time to adjust to a new routine and new set-up. They both love to go on walks and are crate trained. And they are both good with other dogs, cats and children! Pretty perfect dogs!\nThese two really are the sweetest pair of buddies they look forward to spending forever and ever together.",

Because of this, we are requiring that you have a fenced in yard and have experience with fearful dogs. Despite how beautiful she is, she is not a good choice for a first time dog parent. She is not willing to walk on a leash at this time, another reason why she will require a fenced in yard. She is great with other dogs and currently is fostered with a cat. She is a Diamond in the rough and will require patience and earning of her trust. You can apply for her at www.furkidrescue.org \n\nHarlow is a a small German Shepherd, only weighing around 50 pounds. She was rescued when she lived in a backyard in Memphis with another dog. Both dogs were heartworm positive, and she has been fully treated for heartworm at this point. She was neglected, and underweight. She was not treated as a family member, and hence probably why she is un-trusting of humans and skittish. She has flourished wonderfully in her current foster home, but she will most likely go back to square one when she goes to her new home. You must have some basic knowledge on fearful dogs or be willing to work with an approved behavior consultant. \n\n",

He came to us in terrible condition from a neglected thyroid condition that simply needed an inexpensive daily pill. The worst symptom was his hair loss, but that is improving so much. This boy is beyond sweet. He loves people, is cooperative, and has an upbeat personality. Seriously, we have fallen hard for him because of his exceptional temperament. He is always cheerful! He especially enjoys car rides and stopping at Starbucks for a pupacino!\n\nThor would like a quiet home with people who will reciprocate the love and attention he will freely give to his humans. Children over 12 because this is a hefty boy. Likewise, we think an older female dog or no other dog would be his preference, so as not to have competition for his family's time or a younger dog who needs an agile playmate. Cats are unknown. \n\n**If you are serious about adopting , you must head to our website at www.kodisclub.org and submit a completed application . We will not do anything without an app. Due to the small size of our volunteer-run rescue, only the approved adopter may be contacted. It is not first come first served, but the best match **",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.German Shepherd dogs, as well as the other herding breeds that we have in rescue, are highly active, energetic, working breeds. They require considerable vetting, exercise, socialization, training, leadership and mental stimuli in order to be well-adjusted, well-balanced, and well-mannered dogs. Even if you exercise and play with your dog daily in your fenced yard, you MUST still take your dog out on daily walks and outings in order to work on his/her leash skills, manners, and social skills. These breeds make great additions to active families who will pamper them, but who will also work with them, as they are smart dogs who need leadership, structure, plenty of activity and mental stimulation. If you are new to German Shepherds (and other herding breeds), please research the breed to make sure this is the dog for you. We ask that you consider the time and financial commitment that your German Shepherd (or other herding breed) dog will require before applying for one. Please review the section on our website (www.heartlandgsrescue.org) 'Is a HUGS Dog Right for You?' for additional information.\n\nYsbrid (her name means \"Spirit\"), or Ysy for short, is a sweet, fun-loving, little girl. She loves to cuddle, play with other dogs of all ages, cats, and to run like the wind! She loves toys, running laps in the yard, and exploring. Ysy is still all puppy!\n\nShe is potty trained and crate trained. She sleeps on the bed with her foster mom and the other dogs (and cat) and has the run of the house. She prefers to hang out with the other dogs and can play all day. Ysy is very inquisitive and it is a delight to watch her explore! Sometimes, her desire to explore has got her into trouble. She has shown she can easily jump and climb a regular chain link fence so she will need a 6 foot fence to confine her explorations to a suitable area. She loves figuring out food-dispensing toys and gentle tug toys, and Ysy adores \"Hide and Seek\" plush toys - with squeakers in them. She is also fond of soft rubber chew toys and balls.\n\nYsbrid is very shy with new people and needs to have time to get to know them before her true personality comes through. It took months for her to let foster mom touch her. However, she now lets foster mom pet her and she sleeps cuddled up next to her foster mom as well. She now lets foster mom pick her up as well. She does love treats and that is a great way to help her warm up. She also dos not like loud people or when people move fast. When she is scared, she poops as she runs away inside or outdoors. Her fear default is to cower in her crate or the far corner of the yard; she has never offered to bite.\n\nDue to the above information, Ysbrid needs a home with no tiny children or a lot of people going in and out. She can slip in and out of a door or gate very quickly and silently. She needs a home with lots of patience.\n\nYsbrid's adoption fee is $275, all of which goes back into offseting our high-cost vetting expenses and rescuing more dogs. Adoption fees include spay/neuter, current on age-appropriate vaccinations, fecal, deworming, flea/tick and heartworm preventative, heartworm tested if old enough (treated if positive), and microchipped. Learn more about the adoption process and requirements, and apply at: http://heartlandgsrescue.rescuegroups.org/info/adoption.\n\nPlease review the information in the 'About Us', 'Important Considerations' and 'Adopt' sections on our website menu, as it contains useful information about the breed, adoption fees, the adoption process and our requirements, and how meeting the dogs works.",

He was a bit of hot mess when we busted him outta the shelter! \n\nHe had an upper respiratory infection, unstable back legs, mammary tumors, teeth that have never seen the dentist, severely under weight and a nose deformity they think is from a prior trauma but the bloodwork will tell us if he could possibly have a tumor or something going on in his face.\n\nSo basically he was all that and a bag of chips. LOL!\n\nThe shelter said he was 16 but our vet thinks he\u2019s 10-14 years old. We did a senior bloodwork panel and X-rays and X-rays showed Lumbosacral arthritis.\n\nHe\u2019s been with an incredible foster, who has been working on his leash skills and his manners that our trainer has implemented.\n\nWe will be scheduling his surgery for his Neuter, Mammary tumor removal and Dental in the coming weeks!\n\nIn the meantime, this distinguished gentleman is single and ready to mingle! \n\nIf you're interested in meeting this sweet and funny man, let us know.",

She is a very tall girl and will require a 6 ft fence to keep her safe. Myrtle is good with some dogs in her foster home. She is probably in the 3 - 5 year range and is very active. She would do best in a situation where there is plenty of opportunity for exercise and play. As noted a secure tall fence is required. She is tall, has long runway legs, and she is quite aware of the height advantage of standing on her hind legs to see over things. She has been a very good girl in her foster home and is housetrained.\n\nMyrtle is currently fostered near Pittsburg Pennsylvania. With the help of volunteers, transportation to her forever home can possibly be arranged.",

He is looking for adult only family who has breed experienced with active, high energy dogs and can provide him with mental stimulation and exercise and set him up on obedience path. Jackson gets along well with dogs but he hates the leash and can be reactive on leash towards people and dogs. For that reason, he is looking for a home that can work with him on overcoming the fear of leash, but in the interim has a fully fenced in yard to give him enough exercise and where he is the only dog. Jackson is not a bad boy, he is just not trained and can get excited and mouthy when not properly exercised. Active household who can work with him to channel his energy in appropriate way is a must.\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

            "description": "Meet Ginger! An adorable senior with the soul of a puppy. Ginger must be an only pet. She does not like to share her humans or her possessions.\n\nShe divides her time equally between playing and cuddling. She gets a little grumbly if you decide to end either before she's ready but she does correct easily. I wouldn't recommend a home with kids because of her desire not to share.\n\nThis sweet girl has a history of struvite crystals and does require prescription food lifelong. Otherwise, she is in good health.\n\nIf you are a strong, patient pack leader and are looking for a cuddly ball of energy, Ginger may be your girl.All SAAP animals are vet checked, UTD on vaccines, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, and given flea and heartworm preventative as age appropriate.\n\nOur website is: http://www.adoptastray.com/\n\nTo check if this animal is still available visit our master pet list on our website at:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/adoptable-animals/\n\nHave questions:\nPlease email us at saap@adoptastray.com for more information about this animal or to answer any questions you may have. You may also contact us at (859)391-1234.\n\nCompleting the online application when you find an animal you are interested in speeds up the adoption process. We can hold your application on file for a period of time if you are still looking for that perfect new family member.\n\nTHE APPLICATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS LINK:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/dog-adoption-application/\n\nINTERESTED IN FOSTERING:\nWe welcome your interest and ask that you complete our on-line foster application:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/foster-application/",

            "description": "Sweet Daisy came to SAAP back in January missing most of her hair, with bad ear infections, and a dislocated hip. After a thorough exam, it was determined her other hip had deteriorated to the point it would also need surgery.\n\nFast forward ten months, and this little warrior is ready to find her very special forever home.\n\nDaisy requires a home with no steps. Anything higher than a threshold is a challenge. Her dream would be doggie wheelchair friendly, to give her freedom to walk on her own as she tires easily.\n\nShe can walk short distances. It would be amazing if her family would be able to carry her in and out so that she could use her full energy to 'potty explore'. (Hey, that's a thing in our house.)\n\nDaisy will need lifelong meds for pain management. With the meds, she enjoys a great quality of life.All SAAP animals are vet checked, UTD on vaccines, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, and given flea and heartworm preventative as age appropriate.\n\nOur website is: http://www.adoptastray.com/\n\nTo check if this animal is still available visit our master pet list on our website at:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/adoptable-animals/\n\nHave questions:\nPlease email us at saap@adoptastray.com for more information about this animal or to answer any questions you may have.

His new home will have to enjoy both exercise and training.

He lives for exploring, sniffing & a luxurious dog bed. \n\nAll dogs will be altered, microchipped, and receive age-appropriate vaccines prior to adoption. \n\nInterested in fostering or adopting?

            "description": "Hi! My name is Toga and I am a one-year-old Husky. After being surrendered due to the hurricane I found myself on the euth list in Del Rio Texas due to overcrowded shelters. I am very friendly though still very young and do not appear to have ever been trained or taught any manners. I have been an outdoors dog and am working on feeling comfortable navigating indoors. I am very high energy and would love a family that can take me for long walks, runs, or hiking. I am still a puppy and need stimulation and engagement or I will find something to chew on. Being a Husky, I should have a 6ft fence to keep me safe in my yard. I love to give kisses and am not afraid to meet new people. I get along pretty well with other dogs my size, but have demonstrated a prey drive for smaller animals though I have not been cat tested. I really just want to love you and be with you and a part of the family!\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Toga is $400.00. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver. \n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months. \n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced.

I am blind but that hasn't slowed me down.\n\nLike any older guy, I have some lumps and bumps. But, I am also full of love and spunk!  I am currently living with another dog in my foster home and it's probably best that I go to a home with another dog so that he can \"guide\" me along.  Because I am blind, I should go to a home that is one-level so that there are no \"gotchas\" or as you like to refer to them, stairs.  I really like to run so having a fenced-in yard would be a top priority for me as well.  \n\nI am already housebroken and potty-trained as well. I am looking for my furrever home to live out the rest of golden years and be completely loved on.  \n\nIf you are interested in meeting me, please contact LOLIN for a meet and greet.\n\nTo be a successful adoption, Knight MUST HAVE:\nA physical fence\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please go to our website at www.lolin.org and click on Adoption Process along the left-hand side.  From there, you can submit an Adoption Application to be considered for this dog.  You MUST be an approved applicant to meet LOLIN dogs.  There is no central location or hours to meet dogs.",

Is suspicious about treats.\n- gets along well with the dogs\n- not afraid of men\n- knows sit\n- inconsistently sleeps through the night- he has to go out to go the bathroom\n- not fully housebroken- not sure he cares about that\n- does not to cuddle or sit with you but does want to be in the same room with you\n- does not like when you go over to him to pet him (he will usually get up and leave) but will come to you and get your attention to be petted\n- let us trim is super long nails \n- tolerated a bath\n- have not seen any aggression from him\n- barks when he wants to go for a walk or when he is hungry\n- loves to be outside.\n- he wants to counter surf\n- sits on the furniture- a kitchen chair, the kitchen table, toilet or sofa (an unusual repertoire)\n- drinks from the toilet\n\n\nBecause of the COVID situation, many rescues find themselves seeking dogs to adopt to families, with MidABHR ending up placing many of our hounds at the time of intake, or shortly thereafter,\n\nYour first step in adopting from our rescue is to complete our online application found under ADOPTING on the main website for MidABHR at\nwww.midatlanticbassets.com\n\nOnce we have received your application, we will contact you and discuss hounds that may be available or may soon be coming into our rescue.\n\nThank you for your understanding.",

Charlie came to the rescue under the most heart breaking of circumstances. His people drove him out to a country road, opened the door, threw him out and drove away. Luckily a good Samaritan was following behind the vehicle, saw Charlie tossed aside and rescued this sweet fellow. Charlie has a wonderful, happy and gentle temperament. Loves to be around people. Would make a excellent companion. Good with female dogs and children. Charlie has an old shoulder injury that causes a slight limp at times but never seems to slow him down. Neutered, current on vaccinations and heartworm negative. Serious inquiries please fill out and adoption application at huckleberryrescue.com and a representative will contact you. $175.00 adoption fee.

            "description": "***If you are viewing this on PetFinder or other venue , please go to our website at www.lovepawspg.org***\n\nWelcome Tammy - 12 month old Pitbull/Hound mix (Breed is Just a Guess!) Tammy is such a happy girl who loves to snuggle, go for long walks and play with her doggie toys. Tammy is great with other dogs, but we have no idea how she is with cats. For this reason she will need a cat free home. Tammy has learned sit and is doing well walking on leash, but does pull. Tammy is an energetic pup who needs her daily exercise and playtime with other dogs. Tammy has excellent house manners. Tammy is not fostered with kids, so if there are kids in her forever home they should be 10 years and up. If there is a dog in her forever home, he/she should be young and playful. Tammy will need daily exercise and an adopter who is around a good portion of the day and who has recent bully breed experience. Tammy needs a large fenced-0in yard. Tammy is not suited to apartment/condo living.\n\nShe is spayed, up-to-date on vaccines and preventatives and eager to find a family to love! The adoption fee for this dog is $350 which includes routine vetting and spay/neuter.\n\n***Please note that our first step is submitting an application (it does not commit you in any way but allows us to discuss with you if you and the dog are a good fit).\n\nIn addition, an important step in approving adoption applicants is to complete a vet check. Vetting of current and past pets is very important to us, thus we will be speaking with the vet(s) listed on your application to ensure that your current and previous pet(s) are kept up to date on vaccines (including rabies), spayed or neutered, maintained on appropriate monthly preventatives and examined annually by your vet.\n\n*** If you would like to meet Tammy, please fill out our online application by clicking HERE and then email Kim at KLarimerLovepaws@gmail.com***",

If interested in adopting, please complete an adoption application which can be found at www.seniordoghaven.org under the Adoption Process tab. Please note that because all of our dogs live in foster homes, we are unable to set up meetings with a dog unless we have a completed adoption application on file. Adoptions must be about an hour of Wilmington, DE in order for our volunteers to be able to conduct an in person home visit. \n\nMeet our very own Benjamin Buttons! Louie and Gene, unbelievably, are both 15yrs old,  but seem to be aging in reverse! They came to us when their owner passed away , which sadly, led them to end up in a shelter.  They are the perfect mix for our chihuahua lovers out there who understand the big feisty personality that comes with these \u2018little big boys\u2019 ! Gene is super quiet, calm and very laid back - while Louie is the more energetic and boisterous one of the 2. They are extremely bonded so where you find one, the other is sure to follow. Both have been completely vetted including senior bloodwork, neutering and their dentals ( which left them just ONE tooth between them!) Louie has been diagnosed with seasonal allergies - which requires his daily medication (apoquil- approximately $30/month) , and both show early signs of elevated kidney values (often found in our seniors at this age) . The best home would include a very laid back environment with a very calm dog or they would love to just hang out with each other! Both appear to be housebroken when given scheduled potty breaks. They sleep quietly through the night, and can be a little picky with their dog food (but they LOVE human food) !\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She is a sweet adoarable pup and has bonded with the young girl of the foster family following her and sleeping with her. She is just about house trained and does not use a crate. She stays home by herself sleeping, no problems.\n\nKora is timid and mellow. She shows no interest in the family cat. She might be frightened by little kids so older children are advised right now but we are confident that with love and patience Kora will continue to come out of her shell more and more each day.\n\nKora and her litter mates came to SoCo Rescue as owner surrenders. Their former owner took in a stray dog who ended up getting pregnant. As part of our agreement to take the pups in, the owner has agreed to have his female dog spay.\n\nKora is the shy pup of this litter, often staying behind her siblings when it comes time to play with the humans. She does, however, excel when she's allowed to play with other puppies and has even shown progress in becoming better socialized towards people.\n\nKora has already received 2/3 of her first year puppy vaccines with the final round coming due on Nov. 26. She's also received her rabies and bordetella vaccinations, been de-wormed and treated for parasites. Kora's adopter must agree to having her spayed by Feb 1, 2021 and provide proof of such to our rescue. Kora will need all of her basic training, which should come easy for this very smart girl.\n\nTo apply for the adoption of Kora, please submit an application at socorescue.com (no need to register or login).",

I will work for you, guard you, keep you company and love you. When I arrived I was battered and defeated. I was dealt a bad hand but I responded with courage. I don't judge the folks who neglected and abused me. I don't hate. I don't discriminate and I'm trying not to hold grudges. I DO know how to love unconditionally and that's all I want in return. Don't pity me because I am a rescued dog.  Adopt me and let me walk with greatness by your side.\n\nNote: Great Pyrenees are considered a Giant Breed. The average weight can be 100lbs. or more. They bark, shed and have a wanderlust, so secure fences are a must-have. They are NOT off-leash dogs and a Pyr off-leash is called a \"dis'a'Pyr\". Some Pyrs do well with other dogs and some don't because by the virtue of the breed traits they were bred to keep out intruders and can consider some dogs as intruders. While they make wonderful pets and family dogs, they aren't for everyone so be sure to understand and learn about the breed traits of this breed or any breed you might be considering.",

            "description": "Meet beautiful Bella Whimsy!!! Whimsy is a Lab mix, approximately 5 years old, and weighing around 80 pounds. She was originally found as a stray and was adopted four years ago after coming New Jersey. The adoptive family has loved her, but the longer she stayed, the more protective she became of the home against other animals. She would need to be the only dog in the house and there should not be other small animals of any kind. She has no problem with children she has met, though she has never lived with them and can sometimes play a little too rough. And older child with dog experience or all adult home would be best.\n\nWhimsy is house trained, crate trained, and walks well on a leash. If she's doing something wrong, she is easily redirected and minds very well, and she loves to play in the yard. Because of her habit of guarding against other dogs, she would do best in a home with a solid privacy fence or a fenced area that is not right along any road or sidewalk. She would be a great hiking/running companion, but also knows how to enjoy a good lazy day lounging around the house.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Bella Whimsy, go to EHRDOGS.ORG and submit an application. Don't forget to ask for BELLA WHIMSY LONESTAR!!!",

They brought back the sparkle in my eyes and the shine of my coat. They resorted my spirit so my tail can wag again.  I want to be your partner, your friend, your defender, your dog. You will be my life, my love and my leader.  I will be your, faithful and true. Will you take a chance on me to see what I become?  When everyone else let's you down, I will be there for you!  Waiting...Wondering...Hoping! Will you let me come into your life, steal your heart and change everything?\n\nNote: Great Pyrenees are considered a Giant Breed. The average weight can be 100lbs. or more. They bark, shed and have a wanderlust, so secure fences are a must-have. They are NOT off-leash dogs and a Pyr off-leash is called a \"dis'a'Pyr\". Some Pyrs do well with other dogs and some don't because by the virtue of the breed traits they were bred to keep out intruders and can consider some dogs as intruders. While they make wonderful pets and family dogs, they aren't for everyone so be sure to understand and learn about the breed traits of this breed or any breed you might be considering.",

Brownie is getting ready to get a \"fast-kill\" shot for heartworm treatment and will need a foster home in Santa Fe, El Dorado, or surrounding area that can host her for a month or so during recovery. The 30 days post-treatment is a very dicey time for dogs recovering from heartworm. Dogs must be kept resting with minimal activity; this means resting/crate time and only short walks and yard time to potty. They cannot do activities that will raise their heart rate or get them overly excited (no running, playing with other dogs, hiking, etc,). So we are looking for a quiet, restful home that can help keep Brownie restful and low energy during recovery.\n\nBrownie is a sweet, somewhat shy dog, who is very easy to handle once she gets acclimated (she might take a few days to get used to new people/situations). A foster home with an enclosed yard would be ideal since she will need to go out for potty breaks but not long walks. Brownie is approx. 50 lbs. \n\nCrates, equipment, food provided. You just be the dog-nurse in a quiet home! If interested in fostering, please email infodewpaws@gmail.com",

            "description": "**Looking for a temporary foster home - not up for adoption!**\n**This animal is located near Santa Fe, NM**\n\nDew Paws Rescue assists in the care of dogs in local pueblos. Mason is getting ready to get a \"fast-kill\" shot for heartworm treatment and will need a foster home in Santa Fe, El Dorado, or surrounding area that can host him for a month or so during recovery. The 30 days post-treatment is a very dicey time for dogs recovering from heartworm. Dogs must be kept resting with minimal activity; this means resting/crate time and only short walks and yard time to potty. They cannot do activities that will raise their heart rate or get them too excited (no running, playing with other dogs, hiking, etc,). So we are looking for a quiet, restful home that can help keep Mason restful and low energy during recovery.\n\nMason is a sweet, somewhat shy dog, who is very easy to handle once he gets acclimated (a few days to get used to new people/situations). A foster home with an enclosed yard would be ideal since he will need to go out for potty breaks but not long walks. Mason is approx. 46 lbs. \n\nCrates, equipment, food provided. You just be the dog-nurse in a quiet home! If interested in fostering, please email infodewpaws@gmail.com",

They bark, shed and have a wanderlust, so secure fences are a must-have. They are NOT off-leash dogs and a Pyr off-leash is called a \"dis'a'Pyr\".

She truly is a GREAT dog...but we believe the large number of other dogs (primarily handicapped and senior) here is simply too much for Maddie to deal with. She is dog-selective and should be an only dog.\n\nShe would be happier as an only dog with one or two adult people who could give her time and affection....\n\nMaddie is somewhere about 8 years old, a Newfoundland X Black lab...a big girl. \n\nWhen she arrived, Maddie had a major, neglected ear infection.Before she leaves we will be running through one more round of antibiotic ear medications just to insure her ear has finally healed.... \n\nAlthough we realize she needs a different home, we wanted to keep her here til she was healthy.\n\nFor Maddie's sake, so she can have \"her\" person or people (she is equally good with men or women) she needs to be adopted out to a loving no-animal home, experienced with large dogs.\n\nAn adult or two who are home a lot, or work from home, would be ideal. \n\nShe needs a fenced yard and a dog door, but the yard doesn't have to be terribly large, just with comfortable shaded areas. \n\nWe do home checks and reference checks with your Veterinarian, work and friends to insure she will have a safe home. Maddie is spayed and up to date with all shots. Medical records are available.\n\nAgain, she is a really wonderful, affectionate and loving dog....Maddie has had a very tough year.",

They sent me to the vet for an x-ray and OUCH! I\u2019m not going to lie, it wasn\u2019t pretty. But if you know this rescue, you know they also have an amazing vet who is good at putting little guys like me back together (you might remember Sawyer, Teddy and many more).\n\nAfter extensive surgery to repair things, I spent a good month at Dr. Wright\u2019s with his wonderful staff to recover. I was released in August and then needed to spend three months at the rescue ranch with the other dogs. I mostly had to rest in a crate (boo!), but once I started showing improvement, I got to run a lot and play. I especially love playing with this shy, cute girl here named Billie.\n\nI begin hydrotherapy sessions on 11/10/20 here in Georgia (the first of a series that should be continued for a while), but doc has cleared me for adoption to someone who understands my situation and is willing to work with me. The rescue will be more than happy to work with you on that, too.\n\nBecause I\u2019m so active again, I\u2019ll definitely need that fenced yard. I also like most dogs, but I\u2019d like to meet yours before we seal the deal.\n\nCome see me at\n\nhttp://www.jackrusselladoptions.org/",

            "description": "I AM ON HOLD PENDING AN ADOPTION APPOINTMENT. Meet Champ! He is an 8 year old mixed breed who came into our shelter because his owner could no longer care for him. Champ is 61 pounds and fully grown. He has been mellow and shy with staff but can be won over with some treats and may even show off his shake skills. Champ would enjoy a quiet home to spend time in. Nice long walks to enjoy the freshness of the crisp morning air and the sunset view at night. If you have another dog at home, feel free to bring them in for a meet n greet at your appointment. Champ's adoption fee is paid for by Mrs. Vigils class at Nino Otero Community School. He is neutered and microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. To meet Champ or to be added to his waitlist, call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the DOG'S NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org. A scheduler will call you back within 48 hours to confirm your request. If you have other dogs at home, tell the scheduler you would like to bring them along for a Meet n' Greet. SFAS offers a variety of excellent training classes, seminars and Trainer Talks led by animal behavior professionals. These are half-price for animals adopted from any shelter or rescue group! Due to current COVID-19 restrictions, classes and talks are all presented virtually using Zoom.

If we can find a committed foster, adopter, or financial sponsor, we can save Leona\u2019s life...please help us help her! \n \nLeona came into the shelter as a stray in August after getting into an altercation with another dog.  We don\u2019t know the circumstances surrounding the altercation but, sadly no one came forward for her.  She\u2019s a bit shy and under socialized, so she\u2019ll need a loving, patient and understanding family to give her the care and support she deserves.  We\u2019re not sure how she does with other animals or children, so depending on any meet and greets she does, she may need to be the only animal in the home. \n\nPlease help us get sweet Leona into a safe, loving forever home!  If you're unable to help by adopting, sharing this post or donating is always appreciated.  Don't forget, Passion for Pitties is a 501(c)(3), so all donations are tax-deductible!\u2026every little bit helps!\n \nIf you would like to adopt loving Leona, please fill out an application at www.passionforpitties.com under the \u201cAdorable Adoptables\u201d heading.\n",

            "description": "Meet Babygirl! Her name really is fitting for her personality. She is the sweetest girl you\u2019ll ever meet! Babygirl loves everyone she meets and everyone loves her right back. \nBabygirl is a Weimaraner/pit mix around 1.5 years old and 70 pounds. She was found as a stray by Acadia Animal Control and at risk for euthanasia before being saved by Take Paws. \nBabygirl\u2019s ideal day would be cuddling with her forever family on the couch and getting belly rubs - she loves to snuggle and will do anything to be right next to people. One of her favorite activities is playing with her foster mom\u2019s 12yr old cousins and getting all the pets from them. \nBabygirl would do best in home with dogs her size or larger (but she\u2019s also content being an only dog who gets all the attention). She loves to give hugs when she meets new people (which she is working on) and kisses. \nShe has a calm and loving temperament and is low maintenance, but will also play with her foster brother and has done great at parties with people. She gets along with dogs and cats. She has met children as young as 8 and did fine, but has not been tested with anyone younger. \nBabygirl is great on car rides, she loves to sunbathe and snuggle. She has been doing great walking on her harness. \nShe is house trained, working on basic commands, but prefers to eat separately from her foster brother. \nShe is working on kennel training as well but would much rather not have the kennel separating you and her. \nBabygirl would make the perfect companion for any family however big or small. Her foster parents think she would do well in a home with other dogs but who has a submissive personality. She is up to date on all shots/vaccinations, spayed, and just started heartworm treatment.\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

He walks with a good pace, stays calm on busy streets and sticks close no matter how quick or slow your pace.  On your journeys together, he meets both people and pups well and has no problem taking part in a friendly pack walk.   He is a calmer boy, which makes him great company at home. Around other dogs, he\u2019s just as congenial.  He gets along with both male and female dogs.  In play group he strolls around, says hello and wags his tail as he keeps tabs on all his new friends.  He is an adult dog looking for a home that appreciates his easy-going demeanor and that can give him all the guidance and wholesome meals a good boy like him needs.

Reba's sister (Juliet) was brought to the HSOV on October 31, 2020 and is also posted on our Petfinder/Facebook/Adoptapet listings.  Juliet is just as beautiful as sister Reba :)\n\nReba has an auburn/red short smooth coat with a patch of white on her chest, white socks on her paws, a long tail, and a lovely face with copper-colored eyes, a slender muzzle, a cute red/liver-colored nose, and large semi-erect ears.  \n\nThis little sweetheart has an affectionate, rather demure, disposition and a gentle easygoing personality.  Reba loved attention while she had her glamour photos taken and kept a watchful eye on cars pulling into the parking lot.\n\nOur kennel techs have learned that Reba is ok with other dogs, but she does not do well with children or cats.\n\nReba weighs 57.8 lbs and walks fairly well on a leash.  She will be spayed before being adopted by her new family.\n\nUPDATE: Reba was spayed on November 23, 2020 and was also given rabies vaccine.\n\n",

            "description": "These little siblings have lived their life outdoors.  Their surrendering owner is an older lady who wasn't able to find homes for this litter, and couldn't physically care for them.  They shed - for all those who have inquired.\n\nWith a guesstimated birthday in Aug. 2019, all of these pups are under 25 lb.  They're learning that being safe indoors is a blessing.  Each is shy, but catching on to house / crate / leash training.  The girls are scheduled for spay in late-Dec., so won't be ready for adoption until they recuperate.\n\nBurr is house-trained if kept on a regular schedule (currently every 2 hours for a potty break).  He'll wait all night in his crate for the morning potty break.  He's given a final walk around 8 p.m., then wakes up with his foster mom around 5 - 6 a.m.  \n\nHe's showing confidence on leash walks around his foster's yard.  He likes living in the house now and will prance around the kitchen, playing with the other fosters.  He'll chase the cats if they'll run, but doesn't seem interested in hurting them.  He's comfy in a 30\" crate to allow him to sprawl.  \n\nApril 2020:  We are not holding public adoption events at this time.  Qualified families are being invited to appointments to meet specific dogs.  There are currently no opportunities to view multiple dogs and adoption events aren't being held at Tractor Supply in Lenoir.\n\nWhether dogs / puppies come in as strays or owner surrenders, we usually have to make our best guess as to birthdate and breed.   \n\nIf adopted into a home with other animals, particularly cats, your new pet should be crated or secured when you're not available to supervise to insure a harmonious relationship.  \n\nA vet reference is required to confirm responsible pet ownership.  We suggest first time pet owners look for an adult dog for companionship and to gain experience through another rescue or your local government-run animal control..\n\nAdoption fee covers two vaccinations plus spay / neuter if using our local low-cost spay/neuter clinic (overnight stay required) and surgery occurs as agreed upon in the adoption contract.  Convenience fee equal to refundable spay/neuter deposit may be added if using our veterinarian.  Additional fees for 3rd puppy vaccination, refundable spay/neuter deposit, etc. may apply.  \n\nWe are an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue.  We receive no funding from agencies.  Available animals can be seen most Saturdays at Tractor Supply in Lenoir from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  We recommend interested parties contact us to pre-qualify for adoption so their new furry family can go home once paperwork is complete.  Fees are required in cash.  For more information on our organization, our website is www.petpartnersrescue.org.",

I am what is known as a \"double merle\" a genetic anomaly that occurs when two merles are bred together (either by accident or on purpose). The gene causes my coat to be mostly white and often causes varying degrees of deafness and/or blindness.  I am deaf and very slightly visually impaired.  But, don't let my hearing impairment stop you from adopting me!  I am really no different than any other puppy...well, my foster mom says I'm actually smarter than most puppies!  I am learning sign language and already know 5 different signs, including, \"sit\", \"stay\", \"potty\", \"eat\" and \"come\". I am a happy, spunky, playful boy that loves meeting new people and playing with other dogs.   When I'm not wrestling with my brother (Casey) or pouncing on stuffed toys, I am following my foster mom around the house singing to her. I love to sing!  I am doing really well on my crate-training, leash-walking and potty training and am up-to-date on my vaccinations.  If you are interested in completing an application for me, please contact kathie@herdinghaven.org",

            "description": "These little October babies have Halloween names, but aren't scary at all.  \n\nWith a birthday of Sept. 8, mama is about 23 lb.  We've included a picture of her.  Dad is a little bigger and has a good temperament.  \n\nThis is a litter of girls, no yucky boys :)  Leila is comfy in a 36\" crate.  She is house-trained when kept on a regular schedule (currently every other hour for a potty break).  She is energetic and loves to play with polite dogs.  Although she knows about leashes, she'll run out of sheer exuberance if she can slip out the door.\n\nApril 2020:  We are not holding public adoption events at this time.  Qualified families are being invited to appointments to meet specific dogs.  There are currently no opportunities to view multiple dogs and adoption events aren't being held at Tractor Supply in Lenoir.\n\nWhether dogs / puppies come in as strays or owner surrenders, we usually have to make our best guess as to birthdate and breed.   \n\nIf adopted into a home with other animals, particularly cats, your new pet should be crated or secured when you're not available to supervise to insure a harmonious relationship.  \n\nA vet reference is required to confirm responsible pet ownership.  We suggest first time pet owners look for an adult dog for companionship and to gain experience through another rescue or your local government-run animal control..\n\nAdoption fee covers two vaccinations plus spay / neuter if using our local low-cost spay/neuter clinic (overnight stay required) and surgery occurs as agreed upon in the adoption contract.  Convenience fee equal to refundable spay/neuter deposit may be added if using our veterinarian.  Additional fees for 3rd puppy vaccination, refundable spay/neuter deposit, etc. may apply.  \n\nWe are an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue.  We receive no funding from agencies.  Available animals can be seen most Saturdays at Tractor Supply in Lenoir from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  We recommend interested parties contact us to pre-qualify for adoption so their new furry family can go home once paperwork is complete.  Fees are required in cash.  For more information on our organization, our website is www.petpartnersrescue.org.",

A little about me-\nI like the great outdoors so short walks and outside play (ok play is a strong word) are important to me.\nI need to wear a seresto collar because fleas are gross and I\u2019m allergic. \nMedicated bathes every week or two keep my hair and skin beautiful. \nI eat proplan lamb and rice and I\u2019m doing well on that. \nI ride great in the car and enjoy outings. \nI\u2019m a pro at using the dog door to go out. \nI like to sleep with my people. I move kinda slow and have typical old dog struggles\nMy bloodwork shows that I have renal disease so a proper diet and I will sometimes need subq fluids. \nIf you would love to meet me, adopt me, or maybe even foster me then please apply! \nIf you find it in your heart and have the time and love to spare then-\nDo a BIG thing and love an old dog! \nCopy and paste for application  \nhttps://forms.gle/i6vCT6447Eew8NCg9\n\n\n",

My goal weight is 130 pounds...yes, I'm a very big boy bander and will enjoy putting on those extra pounds! I am still a puppy even though I am very big so please keep that in mind. \n\nI am a very sweet and loving guy my foster mom says. I'm a gentle giant that doesn't have a mean bone in his body. In fact, I can be a little timid around other dogs until I get to know them. I really need a dog in my new home so that I can have someone to play with and run around with. I will just need to meet them first.  I love to chew on bones, so I hope I get to have some at my new home. It\u2019s a must that I go to a home with a fenced-in yard, so that I can safely play outside.  I have been around teenagers and I do great with them but shouldn't have any kids younger than 8 in the house. I have a cat in my foster home and I don't bother it so a home with a cat will be okay too.  My foster mom says that I am very intelligent but that I will need obedience training and some leash training (due to my strength) so we can go on family walks to burn off my puppy energy.\n\nI\u2019m almost housebroken\u2026I would say I\u2019m at 98%.  I know that once I get used to a new routine I will get it down asap! I am already crate-trained so you won't have to worry about that either. If you are looking for a handsome and sweet boy to join your band...give me that audition!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting me, please contact LOLIN for a meet and greet.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please go to our website at www.lolin.org and click on Adoption Process along the left-hand side.  From there, you can submit an Adoption Application to be considered for this dog.  You MUST be an approved applicant to meet LOLIN dogs.  There is no central location or hours to meet dogs.",

I'm a happy girl whether we are relaxing in the house or out hiking. As long as I'm by your side nothing could be better! I need slow intros with other pups and no cats please! Won't you give me a real shot.\n\nAbby Grace is a 7 year old, 60 pound cataloula mix. She is UTD, spayed and chipped. She is also house broken and crate trained. She is not well socialized and would do best in a home without other pets but could do well in an experienced home with slow intros. \n\nUnfortunately, Abby does not get along with cats at all and is in a home with cats so the current owners would like to see her in a home better suit for her.\n\nAdoption requirements are as such:\n\n\n\tNo other pets or a submissive dog in a very experinced home willing to do slow intros \n\tNo children under 16 \n\tLarge breed experience \n\tExperience with insecure dogs \n\n\nPlease note, Abby Grace is part of Happy Trails Animal Rescues rehoming program. She has not been tested or evaluated and the information gathered is from the current owners personal statements regarding health and temperament. The owner is subject to placement outside of our organization. We cannot guarantee availability.",

THIS HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT DECISION AS WE WOULD LIKE ALL OF OUR CATS AND DOGS TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ADOPTED. WE APPRECIATE YOU YOUR PATIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING. ***\n\nMy name is Rani. I am still just a big goofy pup. I have been working hard on my basic obedience and learning that it is not appropriate to jump on people to get their attention. Sometime I just get so excited that I still forget. I should probably not live with small children or pets until I learn to control my excitement a little better. I wouldn't want them to accidentally get hurt. My last family moved away hoping I could eventually be sent to them, but the transportation to get me there did not work out. So... here I am in the shelter waiting for a new family. Could it be you??? \nIf you would like more information on the adoption process, please complete an adoption request online at https://www.orcaspets.org/dog-adoption-request-form.html or contact the shelter to find out other options for completing the form.",

Teo loves long walks and playing fetch almost as much as he loves treats!  However, he\u2019s also totally content napping in a soft, comfy place in the house while he patiently waits for his people to play with him.  He\u2019ll even very sweetly remind you that he\u2019s there by gently resting his head on your lap and gazing up at you with his hazel eyes...how precious is that?! \n\nTeo is still learning to trust new people, so all that he asks is that you\u2019re patient and understanding while he gets to know you.  And the payoff is AMAZING, as Teo is about as loving and loyal as they come!  Teo hasn\u2019t had much training or socialization in the past, so he\u2019ll need proper introductions and supervision with other dogs.  Additionally, his ideal family will be willing and able to provide him structure and continued training. \n\nPlease help us get sweet Teo into a safe, loving forever home!  If you're unable to help by adopting, sharing this post or donating is always appreciated.  Don't forget, Passion for Pitties is a 501(c)(3), so all donations are tax-deductible!\u2026every little bit helps!\n \nIf you would like to adopt loving Teo, please fill out an application at www.passionforpitties.com under the \u201cAdorable Adoptables\u201d heading.\n",

He was down and out in North Carolina, and was underweight and had some skin issues and missing fur. He needed a second chance and some TLC so he was transported up to a foster home in New Hampshire where he has been getting healthier and is now ready to find his forever home.\n\nRocko was originally aged at 12 years old, but as he gets healthier he gets more active and vibrant so he might be younger than we first thought. He loves toys, playing fetch, walks, couch snuggles, and any kind of love and affection he can get from his humans. He could potentially live with a female dog, but a home without cats or  male dogs would be best. We think he would really enjoy being an only dog since he is all about his humans.\n\nWe are partnering with The Grateful Dog Animal Rescue to find Rocko some new digs. He is a total rockstar, and we just know the right home and human are out there waiting for this wonderful old guy! \n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior pets have a history of being kept up to date on vaccines, annual exams and recommended bloodwork. We also do home checks to make sure that your home environment meets the needs of the particular dog you are interested in.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adoption, please fill out our online adoption survey at https://www.olddogsnewdigs.com/adoption-survey/\n\n",

            "description": "In November 2020,  Real Time Rescue was contacted by Banning Veterinary Hospital in the Hi-Desert area. They explained that an elderly woman had called asking about euthanizing her two dogs, who were under three years old and healthy. She let them know that the reason for her call was she could no longer care for them and didn\u2019t know what to do. Instead of scheduling an appointment, they gave them our number. Their daughter reached out to explain that she had just moved back to help her parents- her father had been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s 6mos earlier and recently her mother with fibromyalgia. All three were surviving on very limited funds and the dogs, Bella & Buddy, spent their lives outside. She further explained that when her mother called a local shelter and asked what would happen to them if they turned them in, she was told if not adopted quickly they would be euthanized due to an already over crowded shelter. Her next call was Banning Vet, feeling that euthanizing them there would be the better option over a shelter taking care of it. This is a woman who did really want what was best for her dogs but didn\u2019t have any idea how to help them with the resources provided to her. RTR let the family know we could help, but we\u2019d have to find fosters first\u2026 and thanks to the rescue gods, we did! \n\nBuddy  is around 2 years old. Both he and his sister Bella went directly to one of our trusted vets in Orange County and were given a clean bill of health and vaccinated. Both have now been safe and cozy in foster homes since then, decompressing and learning the ropes on how to live indoors. We are told that this boy is a sweet, playful and just generally always pretty happy. He has a goofy puppy way about him and LOVES belly rubs!\n\nBuddy is still working with his fosters on a still new to him potty training routine, but  ready for adoption and hoping you\u2019ll apply to be the next to meet him!",

Shelter was told by the person 'dropping her off that she was 15 (even the vet doubts she is that old) & was not dieing \"quick enough\", so they wanted to leave her at the shelter to get a PUPPY. I feel sorry for the puppy who will be neglected & get heartworms & never feel real love by a human. Casey's SMILE got to me, & we hope for someone who wants a very senior lady to give that love for her senior time. She is such a happy dog..she is not as big as she looks! Casey is sleeping w/one foster & 3 homes are sharing her! She is a delight! She would be best w/not many stairs, as she has one hind leg she will  hold up, but x-rays so no evidence of a problem & as an only dog or with another older dog(she has lived w/ another dog & a bunny...She has not had experience w/ much & is so happy to be getting love & loves being a house dog!  ^^there is some discussion if she is an American Staff. Terrier (Pit) but the shelter thought the people CUT her ears (they did it themselves which is CRUEL to imagine for Casey to have endured) to make her look more like a 'bully breed' ....we never know the dna & should look into working w/ a company who would offer us a discount to find out !!!\n***\nThank you for your interest in applying to adopt !

My family abandoned their house a year ago and then brought me back during the cold spell and snow of April, chained me to the fence and left. Luckily a neighbor noticed all this and called in for a humane investigation. Who knows what could have happened if they had not taken action. When I first came in, I wasn\u2019t quite sure what was happening and definitely did not have very good manners. I am a passionate dog and would often get overly excited so not the best way to interact with everyone. The Canine Care staff has spent a lot of time working with me, helping me understand positive ways to show when I am happy, playful or if something bugs me. I enjoy playing with toys and will sit nicely for some treats. All this is fine but I would really love to find a committed home, willing to continue working with me. I\u2019m quite smart and loving so hope to find someone very special.",

While I can get overprotective of my people, here I am pretty much cool with everyone. I am a happy guy, so fun can be hanging out with some of the humans here, getting a couple of treats. I may be one of the smallest ones but I sure can run fast. You just got to come and watch me in action. I am not always too good on leash but people are working on that with me. Since I\u2019m smart, I already know a bunch of commands. I also enjoy water so in the summer, a baby pool would be awesome. Want an active small dog, ready to make sure you are loved and safe, then let\u2019s meet soon!\nSince I can get protective, I do best in a single home so no apartment building or condo. Less people traffic will allow me to relax.",

Please email adoptions@pawstinleypark.org if you are interested in adopting.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet, please visit our website to check on their current availability: http://www.pawstinleypark.org..

            "description": "Red is a very special boy, in need of a very special home. Red is almost completely deaf, he may pick up on some deep vibrations or high pitched sounds but for the most part should be considered deaf. His deafness is very manageable for even a home unfamiliar with deaf dogs, but potential families should be very experienced with Heeler behaviors.\n\nThe Good: Red becomes the single most loyal friend to those who earn his trust but Red's deafness makes meeting new people and dogs stressful for him. Once earned, there is truly not a more loyal dog. He loves 100% and gives everything to his person. He adores them and would always protect his family and home. Don't let his deafness fool you, this pup would make an excellent watchdog for those he loves. Red loves car rides, giving hugs, and belly rubs most in life. He is constantly watching for hand signals and therefore has great \"recall\", even off leash. Red is very smart. He also knows sit, down, come, and wait from hand signals.\n\nThe Bad: Red needs a VERY special family willing to give him a two week adjustment period just to acclimate to their schedule and movements. Red needs a very experienced home that \"speaks dog\" and can understand dog body lanaguage. After growing up deaf and startled too many times, Red doesnt trust hands, and even \"good\" touches like petting from someone he doesnt know are just too much for him at first. He needs 2 weeks of being completely ignored while he learns everything is okay to allow him to become comfortable at his own pace. 2 weeks of No touching- seriously. Just completely out right ignored so he can watch and learn. His anxiety largely stems from his deafness that he over compensates and can be overstimulated when he's uncomfortable. As a heeler, Red's instincts tell him to herd it away if his trust is violated by a stranger and as a heeler that can mean nipping. It's only when strangers overstep, that he results to that level. Once through the \"trust building\" period, Red becomes rock solid and is completely trustworthy, allowing feet, eyes, ears etc. to be touched with no problems whatsoever. \n\nRed needs a home without kids or other dogs who may not understand his needs, disability, and anxiety. Red has excellent cattle dog herding instincts but his hearing impairment currently prevents him from training with cattle directly but he would love any form of \"work\" or regular exercise (especially mental exercises).\n\nRed needs a very unique and experienced home, but he's a very special dog himself. If you are looking for a truly loyal companion, then Red may be the dog for you.",

I still jump up some, but I'm working on it.  I like to play fetch and I'm very good about letting you take the ball to throw it again.\n\nIf you would like to talk more about Jenny, call 785-819-5138.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Jenny, please email an adoption application\n\nhttp://www.alexshouse.org/alexs_house_adoption_application.pdf\n\nto vicki@alexshouse.org\n\nAdoption fee: $150 (includes rabies, bordatella, distemper, parvo, lepto vaccinations, heartworm test, microchip, on heartworm preventative and flea preventative)",

            "description": "Meet Jade!\nJade is a pretty calm gal but has spurts of puppy energy when she gets a toy or claims her spot on the couch. \nJade is slow to warm up to strangers, especially men. When she is ready to trust you, she is 100% loyal and dedicated. She will love everyone in the house, but one person will become \u201cher\u201d hooman.\nJade had an injury to her left back leg in the past. But she doesn't let it slow her down. She has no pain or discomfort and she can get around, jump up, and balance like most other dogs. \nJade enjoys short walks, soft couches/blankets/pillows, and any chance to soak up sunshine. She will follow the sunshine all day to ensure she doesn\u2019t miss it.\nThe right person for Jade needs to be patient and willing to earn her trust. It will take time, but the love she has to give is worth it. \nJade will need to be introduced slowly to new dogs and she is fine with cats. Jade goes out the doggy door without a problem. She will go in the crate if it\u2019s set up as a cave with lots of soft bedding but she won\u2019t be happy for long. She wants to be with her people.\nIf this sweet girl sounds like a great addition to your home, get your application in today!\n\nPLEASE READ COMPLETELY \n\nAll of our moms are being raised in volunteer foster homes, so we do not have a single location to visit. You will need to submit an application to be approved for a Meet and Greet.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting or more information please do the following before contacting Path of Hope: \n\n1. Go to our website www.pathofhoperescue.com \n2. Thoroughly read through the FAQ section on the \"Adopt\" page (this will answer most questions!)\n3. If you are still interested, fill out an online application on our website and our Matchmaker will be in touch with you! \n4. Follow us on facebook, https://www.facebook.com/pathofhoperescue/ , to see lots of cute puppie photos. learn about puppy events, and get updates on the rescue!\n\nOur adoption fee for mom dogs is $300 and includes age appropriate core vaccines, minimum two rounds of dewormer, microchip with free registration and spay/neuter surgery. A refund of $100 is available with completion of any training class.",

While he can be a little bashful, he is quick to warm up to you because he loves getting pets.  He will also shower you with kisses and loves being hugged.  Rufus enjoys taking long walks and visits to the dog park.  He is very easy-going and well behaved on the leash, although he does get excited about the occasional squirrel or lizard.  At the park, he likes to explore but will often stick by your side, hoping for a good scratch on his chest.\n\nRufus is waiting for a family that will take him into their hearts and home.  He will do best with someone who is home often to give him all the love and attention he deserves.\n\n",

            "description": "? Meet Camo ?\n\n3 year old Pit/hound mix at 65 pounds.\n\nCamo will be three years old in December. He loves the taste of carot cake with peanut butter icing. His favorite treats include apples, carrots, jerky, biscuits, and peppers. He is not picky and will be sure to shake your hand for a treat.\n\nCamo is house trained and is not a destructive boy, however he does like to chew up old toilet paper rolls and plastic bottles.\n\nHe loves walks, swimming, chasing squirrels, car rides, his vet, fetch, and training. He is also a lover of blankets and will climb into bed to snuggle all while wrapping himself up in a little pittie burrito.\n\nCamo knows the commands give paw, high five, kiss, stand up, up there (for a couch), lay down, roll over, boop it, and focus on me.\n\nCamo is a sweet boy, but he just loves his food and toys to much. He is a resource guarder around other animals and his future family needs to understand his needs. He would do best in a home as an only dog.\n\nHe is a loving boy who just needs to find a place of his own with a family who can give him the love and attention he deserves.\n\nIf the animal is under the age of 3 years old or has health issues, a vet reference is required which means you must own a pet or have owned a pet in your name.\n\nAdoption fee of $250 covers all vetting including spay/neuter surgery, vaccines, microchip heartworm test and treatment if needed and any other medical that may be required while in rescue. \n\nWe only do adoptions on Saturday and not all animals are able to attend so if you would like to see a specific animal please let us know so that we can make arrangements for it to be present at the event. Event locations do vary so please check the homepage to find out where we will be this week. Please do not ask us to reduce adoption fees since all fees help us to cover medical expenses for all of our animals, some of which can be very expensive.  Saving lives is not cheap so thank you for your understanding and helping us save as many as possible.\n\nPlease email lowcountryanimalrescue@ymail.com for an application.",

She entered our program at 115lb in October and has already lost 10lb on her 60lb weight loss journey. She is approximately 7 years old and just a DREAM - her foster family can't say enough wonderful things about her! Zooki Pi is dog social and kid social, although she would prefer a home without kitty cats (cats get her up and running!). Zooki is heartworm positive, but the rescue pays for that treatment, and is otherwise healthy (we ran a full blood panel and thyroid test to verify she was just chubby and not sick). She is available for immediate adoption! Apply to adopt our happy, social, potty & kennel trained girl by visiting www.lwhbullies.org",

Every morning I sing for my breakfast - and it's the only time you'll hear me at all.  My foster mom thinks it's funny because I have to tell her how to cook every day.  Just wanted to share a couple of things...I'm getting more confident everywhere.  I can let my foster mom be out of my sight for fifteen minutes now without following and I insist on visiting next door every evening at suppertime with my canine foster brother.  I get along fine with their three dogs and four cats.  I also wanted to let you know that I'm deaf.  Or at least I hear very little.  My foster mom is trying to learn how to communicate with me, especially since I don't look at her much, and we're working on signs for food and come.  At the risk of immodesty, I'll share that she's very, very proud of me and how much I've accomplished.  I survived, learned to move around again, smile, and hold my tail high, and have met sooo many scary situations and been a really good girl (a little warning growl doesn't count).  And I did it without hearing.  I am awesome.  Thank you for saving my life.",

            "description": "Harley is an adorable 2 year old pitbull terrier looking for a new forever home. \n\nHarley has a lot of energy and needs routine physical exercise along with mental enrichment. This cutie has some anxiety and confidence issues, causing her to be reactive towards other animals. Unfortunately for these reasons, she is being returned to us. \nHarley is looking for a forever home that loves adventure and exploring. She would do best in a home with a nice fenced in yard. Since she is reactive out in public, having a fenced in back yard would give her a safe space of her very own to exercise in. Small children are overwhelming for Harley and she would do best in a home with children age 12 or older. \nDue to Harley's behavior challenges, she's looking for an experienced adopter that has lots of time to put into building a bond with her. Harley is currently taking medication to help with her anxiety issues and we feel that with a well fit person, she will live a successful and full life. It is important that her new human or humans understand the importance of routine, positive reinforcement training, physical and mental exercise and setting her up for success.  She is eager to bond and is a very affectionate and loyal companion. \n \nHarley must be the only pet in her new home. \n\nIf you feel that you may be a good match for Harley, please submit an adoption application on our website: www.offthechainmke.org",

I was flown from Louisiana to Wisconsin by Wings of Rescue and I can't wait to find a home here in the land of beer and cheese! My personality is best described as \"all about the love\" and I adore giving and receiving affection. I am a very high energy dog so daily exercise is an absolute must for me. I will need physical activity (going for walks, running, playing) along with mental stimulation (learning new tricks, playing with puzzle toys, eating from puzzle feeders) to keep me happy and healthy. I can be picky about other dogs and would be perfectly pleased to be your only pet. I'm looking for an active and involved adopter who has plenty of time for a high energy dog. I'm approved for respectful children aged 10 and up and will be a fun addition to an active family. If you're looking for an exceptionally intelligent and loving companion, I'm ready to be your number one exercise and snuggle buddy! Reign is approved for families with respectful children aged 10 and up. He is a high energy dog who needs both physical and mental stimulation.\n\nThe online adoption listing websites require that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We encourage you to select your new companion by considering each dog's individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on a breed label that is only a guess. 2/2/21 3:20 PM",

I can sit on your lap forever, mom says I'm the sweetest little girl you will ever meet. I love to play with my foster mom and my foster brothers, I'm good in the car and I love, love my couple of short walks a day. The rest of the time, I'm a mellow little Angel. I do have a little trouble seeing at times, but I find my way around just fine. I am loved and well-cared for with my foster family but I am looking for my forever home.\n\nI have had a thorough health examination, I'm microchipped and I will have a dental cleaning prior to adoption. If you have room in your heart and home for me, please complete an adoption application. https://bichonrescueoc.org/adoption-application\n\nIn the struggle to cope with COVID-19 and its effects on our daily life, it has become necessary to suspend our customary adoption approval process. Scheduling your \"Home Safety Evaluation\" and \"Meet and Greet\" presents a significant challenge. If you express an interest in adopting this pup, we will make every effort to make that possible. You will be contacted to schedule a telephone interview and details of the current approval process will be explained.",

They are a bonded pair so we will not adopt them separately. \n\n\nGretchen is a sweet girl who loves her people. She is young, and although she will need help learning the ways of the house, she is smart and catches on fast.\n\nGretchen is energetic. She is still in her puppy stage, so she will need training with walking on the leash. She absolutely loves toys and has been great with all staff, however we are not sure if she is comfortable around other dogs besides Tiger Lilly.

This 7 year old, 25 lb terrier mix loves to go for walks in the neighborhood and at the park. When we go outside he likes to keep warm by wearing a sweater, and around the house he relaxes with blankets. He loves to cuddle up close and have his belly rubbed. He is housebroken, doesn't get into things that aren't his, and has been friendly with kids. He likes hanging out and relaxing with his foster sister. He would be a good fit in a home with a low energy dog, as he is happy to mingle with dogs but isn't into playing, or he would also be fine as the only dog. Morpheus needs to be on a special diet and will gladly work for apple bits, yum! Please share to help this cutie find his furever home!",

If so, Marley might be perfect for you!\n\nShe was shaking scared when we picked her up from the shelter but within a few days at her loving foster home, she already started following the family around the house and enjoys lounging next to them on the couch. She's a sweet dog who is very mellow.\n\nMarley was originally found on the streets by a local shelter along with her puppy. A different rescue took the puppy in the next day but left momma Marley behind :( She waited over 100 days in the shelter and was finally adopted but they returned her a year later bc they moved somewhere that didn't allow dogs. We took Marley into our care once we found out she was back at the shelter. We look forward to finding a loving forever family that will cherish her!\n\nMarley's adoption fee is $225 plus tax and that covers her spay, microchip, vaccinations, heartworm test (she tested negative) and she is on heartworm/flea/tick prevention. She will make an awesome addition to a lucky family!\n\nHere's the link to turn in an application and learn more about our adoption process:\n\nhttps://www.thestreetdogproject.org/adopt\n\nPlease email placement@thestreetdogproject.org if you have any questions, thanks!",

He was left outside for long time by people who cared about him but\nworked out of town \n\nHi, y'all!!! Cuzzo, here. First and foremost, I'm a gentlemen.....well, most times. Sometimes, as my foster mom would say, I'm a GOOFBALL. What can I say? I'm just trying to enjoy life to the fullest after many years living in a cage. AND, it was OUTSIDE!!! BUURRRR!!!! So, please, no more sleeping outside for me, unless I'm working on my tan. \nAnywho, that life is behind me.\n\nNow, I am ready for a new adventure and a family that will love me just as I am, (AWESOME and CUDDLY, of course!!!!). I do like attention, Ahem!..I mean, LOVE, attention from hoomans. I get along well with my other foster dogs, but we need to be introduce properly. Other dogs tends to be intimidated by my size (Foster mom is working on HELPING me lose a few pounds. She thinks I don't know that she feeds me HEALTHY WEIGHT food. But that's ok, I know it's outta love and, besides, it taste lots better than what I used to eat.) I am more than ok if you want me as the only one (hint, hint).\nMoving on, as mentioned before, I love you hoomans, but it would be best if you are big hoomans and not little ones that I can \"bump\" into. Hey, sometimes I just get all excited and just NEED to express it by doing my version of zoomies, alright?\nPlease call Reggie Conley for more information: (916) 712-0401",

            "description": "Rusty is a six year old male lab mix. He\u2019s definitely mixed with something larger as he weighs over 70 lbs. Rusty is said to be house-trained and went through obedience course! He readily sits and lays down on command and there are probably some other tricks in there just waiting to be discovered! Rusty would do best in a home with older children because he doesn\u2019t know his own size and a lower traffic home. He is described as \u201ca pleaser\u201d who loves to play fetch! Rusty is not a big fan of cats (or maybe he\u2019s too big of a fan!); other dogs will need a meet and greet, but probably more submissive personality is best. To adopt this big hunk, apply at ITVrescue.org.\n\nAll of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heartworm tested and treated if necessary.\n\nPlease realize that many of our animals are kept in foster homes. Please complete an adoption application at http://itvrescue.org/adoption-application/ in order to meet with one of our animals. There is no obligation in completing the application, but it helps us find an animal that is most appropriate for your family.  The ITV Rescue Center is open Tuesdays 12-5; Wednesdays 12-7; Thursdays 12-5; Fridays 12-5 and Saturdays 10-5.  The Rescue Center is located at 1417 N. Stockwell Road.  You are welcome to come to our rescue center during open hours to see all of our great adoptable animals. Thank you for your interest in our animals!\n\nNOTE: Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

            "description": "Zayla is bonded with another dog Tuxedo. They've been together every step of the way--from running at large as strays, to everyday walks and nightly cuddles. They are inseparable, so they need to be rehomed together. \n\nWho knows what this old couple have been through? The only thing clear is that they have survived it together. \nZalya and Tuxedo are the unbelievably easy houseguests. They do not pay any attention to our old cat, are house trained and, while they love treats, they do not beg for food. In fact, their only bad habit is sleeping on the couch! \nTuxedo likes short walks while Zayla is just relieved to have a soft bed for her old bones. They both get nervous if he is gone too long. Zayla's arthritis makes stairs and long walks difficult but she loves our fenced yard and enjoys hanging out in the sun and sniffing the grass. She still gets around well, just slowly and not far. Tux would rather be with people and often calls Zayla back into the house when he is ready to be with his humans again. He is all about affection and will sit with you for hours if you will just pet him. He would love to be a giant lap dog if you let him!\nZayla is still very scared of people and we struggle to get a leash on her. She cries when we try to touch her but she has been in foster care for less than two weeks and is already taking treats from our hands and sniffing our fingers if we move slowly. On the other hand, she is very expressive and often woofs and wiggles (her arthritis does not allow for more) to show how happy she is to see us. We are hopeful that in a quiet, safe home she will have the opportunity to learn to trust humans again. \nTuxedo is her voice, he tells us when Zayla needs water, or food, or to go outside. I imagine taking these two might seem daunting, but they really are exceptionally bonded. And, this old pair are as easy going, gentle and kind as any prospective family could want. Generally, they are just so grateful for a calm home, regular meals, kind words and a warm bed for two. Or, better yet, a couch for two!",

She loves people\n\nand is\n\ndog & cat friendly. Cora has energy to play\n\nand\nwould do great with a little space to run at her already lightening fast speed. Cora has not exhibited any food or toy guarding and just wants to be loved by everyone, which is very easy to do! Cora is eager to please and loves affection, keeping her people close. Everything about Cora is amazing!!! She\nwas rescued from Texas with an injury across her chest and smaller one on her back; through all the pain she remained happy, friendly and very loved by her TX Vet staff. SSR provided Cora\n\nthe medical care & love she so needed. She\n\nwas adopted in October of 2020, but the little children proved to be too much for her, so she is currently seeking a home with no little ones.\n\nIf you are an approved adopter and are interested in this dog, please let your case worker know. If you are not yet an approved adopter but are interested, please complete an adoption application!\nYou can review our adoption process, www.shenandoahrescue.org/adoption-process if interested.

She is also available for adoption in the New Jersey and surrounding areas.***\n\nWhen the SoCo staff arrived at work one morning, they found a yellow Lab sitting in the parking lot. \"Shelly\", as we later named her, had apparently been discarded at SoCo during our closed hours. There was no note or other communication to explain why Shelly had been left at our rescue.\n\nShelly wasted no time in showing us exactly how friendly and wonderful she was. She made friends with all of our staff rather quickly. She loves to play fetch, loves to run wide open and loves her playtime with people. She's smart, a quick learner and even already knows her basic commands.\n\nShelly's initial dog-friendly test didn't go very well but that may have been due to the commotion within the rescue. We would recommend a meet-and-greet with any other dogs that Shelly would share a home with, but she may need to be the only dog in the home. We don't think she'll be good with cats.\n\nShelly was heartworm positive when she arrived but has since been treated. She's also been spayed, received an update on her yearly vaccinations, de-wormed and kept on her monthly preventatives. While Shelly shows some house training experience, she may need a refresher course once in a new home\n\nIf interested in adopting Shelly, please submit an application at socorescue.com (no need to register or login)",

She needs an owner that will be committed to continue her training.  She is is working hard on her commands with our trainers and is doing good with her potty training too!  Grace loves to run and play ball, and would love to find a home where she would have a yard to run in.  She is a sweetheart with a lot of love to share.  \n\nThe NAWS Dog Adoption Program operates as a rescue versus a shelter.  We believe in matching the right dog with the appropriate family based on each specific dog or family's needs.  To achieve this, we believe in spending the appropriate amount of time with each family to allow for enough interaction time with potential adopters.  This cannot be achieved if people stop by unexpectedly to meet our dogs.  Please e-mail Stacy at stacy@nawsus.org to setup a day or time to meet with one of our adoption counselors and our potential adoptees.  Thank you!\n\n\n\n",

She is about 5 years old and weighs 20 pounds. Fresca is a very sweet and affectionate little girl. She loves attention. She is currently in a foster home and is reported to be house trained and she gets along with her foster brother.\n\n**BECAUSE OF OUR REQUIREMENT FOR A HOME VISIT, WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO ADOPT TO HOMES IN THE NORTHERN VA / MARYLAND / DC METRO AREA**\n\nWe have adoption events EVERY SATURDAY from 12-3 p.m. Please note that not all dogs can attend every event, so if you are interested in meeting a particular dog, please complete a no-obligation application on our website at http://www.muttloverescue.org/application.html OR write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nUpcoming adoption events:\n\nMutt Love Rescue is doing everything we can to ensure the health and safety of our volunteers and adopters while continuing our mission to find homes for as many dogs as possible.\n\nEffective immediately, we will not be holding our weekly adoption events. Dogs available for adoption can be met by appointment only. Potential adopters should submit an online application at http://muttloverescue.org/application.html. Once we receive your application, we will contact you to let you know the next steps.\n\nWe are always desperate for foster homes, now more than ever. If you are interested in fostering during this difficult time, please complete an application... unless you are a previous adopter/foster, then you can just contact us via phone (703-988-2608) or email (adopt@muttloverescue.org) to tell us which dog you want to foster!\n\nFor information on sponsoring this dog, please write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nWE NEED FOSTER HOMES!

            "description": "Hi my name is Charming! I\u2019m 5 years old and 13 lbs!  I would love a home where my owners are home a lot.  I experience separation anxiety when I am left home alone too often.\n\nBio for Charming:\n\nWell hello. My name is Charming and for good reason. I am a sweet-natured, friendly little guy with a quirky personality that will make you laugh out loud. I am five years old and 13 pounds -- who knew this much charm could fit in such a little body? Here\u2019s what my foster family has learned about me so far:\n\n\u2022\tI love to be close to my humans! I do a full body wiggle and prance when I see my foster mom and I'm her loyal shadow. Snuggling on the couch with my people at the end of the day is one of my favorite activities. How about a scratch behind the ear or a belly rub too?\n\n\u2022\tI\u2019m gentle with the little kids in my foster home but their loud noises and rowdy movements sometimes make me a little nervous. I\u2019d be happiest in a home with older kids who understand to give me space when I need it.\n\n\u2022\tMy big foster dog brother is so fun! We love to play, go for walks together and take naps on the couch near each other.\n\n\u2022\tWhile my favorite place is wherever you are, I\u2019m happy to hang out in my crate too. I eat meals there, sleep quietly through the night and take rest breaks there a couple times a day. I keep my crate clean and dry.\n\n\u2022\tI\u2019ve been doing really well with my potty manners in my foster home. I go out for backyard breaks every few hours. My favorite reward for doing all my business outside is to go right back inside where it\u2019s warm. Brr!\n\n\u2022\tI walk very well on a leash and I\u2019m happy to go where you go. (But could you please not walk me through the snow? This cold, wet stuff is awful!)\n\n\u2022\tBenebones and natural chews are great! I\u2019m not a big chewer but every once in a while, I love to sink my teeth into a dog toy.\n\n\u2022\tI\u2019m not a barker--my foster mom has never heard me woof!--but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t make noise. When I get a good neck scratch from my human, I close my eyes and let out a long, happy hum. Mmmmm that feels great!\n\n\u2022\tMy foster mom thinks my cutest quality is the way I get comfortable on the couch. I like to fluff, test and circle my resting spot for a few minutes before I settle. Sometimes I get so into it that I do a silly little somersault.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a loving, loyal and spunky little companion, I hope you\u2019ll come meet me soon!\n\n\n\n\nYou can come adopt me or even join our foster program to help the humans learn all the awesome things about new dogs like me! Learn more on our website! \n\nHope to see you soon! \n\nWhat breed am I? Mixed mutt! ODHS does not breed label (unless there\u2019s official paperwork), as studies show it is nearly impossible to tell the exact breed of each dog based off of their appearance.\n\nEducational article:\n3/3/3 rule:\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturday from 12-2.  On Saturday's from 2-4pm, the events are open to the public. \n Our adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience.  Currently, the average timeframe for a response to your application is 1 week.\n\nLike us on Facebook \"Old Dominion Humane Society\"\nand be a part of promoting forever homes for dogs in need.\n#Adopt #Donate #Foster #Volunteer \n\nNote: ODHS only adopts to Virginia and surrounding states (including D.C.). A $50 out of state fee applies.",

For more information and the adoption application for Marley, please visit our website belowhttp://www.coastalgsr.org/dog_profile.php?ID=22315&name=MarleyWe saw a picture of a GSD at the shelter who looked absolutely broken: she couldn't stand, was in obvious pain, looked fearful, and needed help. We rescued her and immediately sent her to our vetThere we discovered it was pyometra, an infection in the uterus. Her uterus was huge and full of pus and her bladder was distended and the size of a volleyball. We can't imagine the pain she'd endured! She did well through surgery and was moved to the emergency hospital where she could receive 24/7 care. It was a few more days, but she was finally able to stand, kept improving, and was then released from the hospital. Marley is crate trained, good in the house, likes a car ride, and does well on a leash. She loves going for walks and can keep up with the best of them! Marley is going to need an experienced home, as she can get overprotective, and needs to be the only dog in the home. She will repay your kindness with lots of affection and ultimate loyalty.The minimum adoption donation for adults is $375 and the adoption donation for puppies is $500. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is tax deductible. The adoption donation provides that all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis ( i.e., puppies who will need to be altered by 6 mos old). Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.",

A community cat  group managed to trap them and asked if we would take them in. They are about 5 months old and definitely need to be placed in a home with a secure fenced yard, and also with a dog who can give them some confidence and guidance.  We do think they would be better off not being placed in the same home, so they would not feed off each other's fear.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all our pets have been spayed/neutered and have been given rabies and DA2PP vaccines.\n\nRIGHT CLICK THIS LINK TO OUR ONLINE APPLICATION AND OPEN IN A NEW WINDOW \nhttps://rawhiderescue.org/?page_id=13 \n\n\nTHIS IS THE LINK TO THE APPLICATION WORD DOCUMENT  THAT CAN BE EMAILED TO RAWHIDERESCUE@HOTMAIL.COM:\n http://members.petfinder.com/~NJ235/Forms/RawhideDogApplication.doc\n \n\nOUR HOME PAGE:\n https://www.rawhiderescue.org\n\nTHIS IS THE LINK TO THE APPLICATION WORD DOCUMENT OR PDF THAT CAN BE EMAILED TO RAWHIDERESCUE@HOTMAIL.COM:\n http://members.petfinder.com/~NJ235/Forms/RawhideDogApplication.doc\n https://rawhiderescue.com/RawhideDogApplication.pdf\n\nOUR HOME PAGE:\n https://www.rawhiderescue.org",

            "description": "Have you met Mac?\n\n8-year-old Mac was brought into the San Diego Humane Society by Humane Law Enforcement. He weighs 12 lbs. Poor little Mac needed to have his right eye removed due to injury and dental surgery to remove 15 yucky teeth. He was slow to trust when he got to Frosted Faces. He didn't like being reached towards in his kennel and would growl and snap if you came in too fast. Mac went on a two-week Frosted Fling for the holidays and wow, once he settles in, a whole little personality comes out!\n\nMac is house broken and crate trained! He sleeps overnight in his kennel without any midnight potty breaks and has never had an accident in the house! Mac did attempt to mark on his first day, but that behavior quickly stopped when he learned there was a yard for pottying. Mac has great energy and loves to go for walks. He has been to Fiesta Island and always makes it all the way around the loop with energy to spare. Mac lived with a dog and two cats during his Fling and got along great with everyone! He did occasionally chase his kitty Fling brother playfully, but it was never with malice and the cats always came back for more. Mac's major downfall is that he guards his food. His Flingers used a crate for mealtime, and everyone was happy - Mac felt secure without the need to guard, and everyone got to eat their meals in peace. He takes small treats nicely next to other animals.\n\nHis Flingers shared, \"Mac loves car rides! He stands up so he can look out the window the whole time! When we are on slow roads and have someone to hold the leash (just in case!) we roll the windows down so he can smell the breeze and his little ears flap in the wind. It's so cute! He also loves to play with toys! Mac will bring you his stuffy and set it on your lap so you will throw it for him. Mac was a pro at the food puzzle and really enjoyed using his brain and his nose to find all the treats. Mac takes some time to settle in and feel fully comfortable. During this time, we mostly just let him come to us when he wanted to be interacted with. He lets out a low growl if you are making him feel uncomfortable. If you push it, he will snap, but it seems to be mostly a warning rather than a serious bite. Once he got more comfortable, this behavior went away and he showed his spunky and loving side. Mac loves to sit in your lap on sleep next to you on the couch. He will nest in blankies to make sure they are just the way he likes them and then roll over to show you his belly for some rubbing. He's a super silly guy once he settles in. The family that allows him the time and space he needs to feel safe will get a super fun and loving little buddy!\"\n\nNow that Mac has settled in, he gets to stay longer as a foster! He still is on the lookout for his forever family, though!

            "description": "GET OFF MY LAWN!!!!\n\nYup.  We have all had or currently have one of those cranky old neighbors who just want to be left alone to live their life in peace and quiet.  \n\nTeefers is the embodiment of such a neighbor.\n\nNOW WAIT......before you swipe left....give us a second.\n\nBecause what Teefers lacks in the warm fuzzy department, he makes up for in being pretty dang easy to be around.  Well, if you have a sense of humor, move quick and don't get your feelings hurt too easily, that is.  \n\nYou don't have to be around this ole guy very long to understand he has been around the block a time or two and has probably never had much of a relationship with humans.  For some dogs, this might mean fear or timid behavior but Teefers is different.  He exudes confidence and dignity and has an air about him that tickles the imagination.  Even the circumstances in which he found himself needing our help, are curious and heartbreaking at the same time.\n\nWe first saw Teefers' picture, when the photographer of our local Humane Society shared some \"hard to adopt\" dogs on a pet Facebook page.  \n\nHard to adopt?  Why....how could that be? I mean, look how stinking cute he is!!.\n\nOur curiosity peaked, we contacted our shelter and asked if they needed help with him.  He would probably never make it to the adoption floor, given his age and crotchety behavior, so they willingly signed him over to us.   We are no strangers to the fear biters or those who act out because they are in a strange environment so we snatched Teefers up and brought him into our embrace.\n\nWe soon found out that Teefers does not suffer fools and baby talk is for sissies.  He's been fooled by baby talkers before so cute coo-ing and goo-ing, does not impress him.  From the very start, he established that touch is allowed with his permission only and if you don't ask first (and even sometimes if you do) he might nail you.  \n\nYet, we still find this old man charming.  \n\nHe is so dignified and sure of himself PLUS when he wants something from you, he is an absolute charmer.  Yep...this guy is no dummy and he's spent a lifetime playing humans like fiddles, to get what he wants.  \n\nFine...we can work with that.\n\nWe posted his picture on our FB page and the comments started to roll in.  Apparently he had been something of a curiosity on the community lost and found pet Facebook pages, where his pictured had been captured several times, as a stray, with a kitchen spatula dragging from his harness.  More comments rolled in about sightings of the funny dog dragging kitchen utensils around but some pretty sad comments said, his owners had been located and their response was, \"you found him...you keep him\"  \n\nOur hearts broke but our understanding grew.\n\nMaybe Teefers had a reason to be a crank pot.  Perhaps the spatula was how his former owners handled him and if so, what a loveless life he must have lived\n\nWe became even more fiercely respectful of him.  Had he ever known affection?  Had he ever been important to someone?   How was he supposed to trust and give when all he seemed to have known is how to get what he wants by using his own cunning.  \n\nSo we just let Teefers do his thing.  We fitted him with a harness and let him drag a leash so that we would not have to touch him, to direct him when needed.  To our surprise and thankfulness, this seemed to be an agreeable arrangement with him and he soon learned his daily routine and started to behave a bit less defensively.  He can now be picked up without setting him off and he love love loves his crate with it's snuggly bed and fuzzy blanket.  If he is not outside in the yard, this is where you will find him most of the time.  He also loves going for walks and is great on a leash.  He enjoys car rides and will even grace you with his presence in your lap, if you happen to be in the seat he wants.  Perhaps, if he is feeling super charitable, he might even let you pet him.  We can't tell you what an honor that feels like.  \n\nTeefers is very food motivated too and this is a very fun part of the day for him and his foster.  This is when the relationship between dog and human, feels most normal.  Teefers will get very animated and his tail wags furiously, while he charms treats from the house humans.  He will put his paws on their knees and lays his head on their legs, looking impossibly cute and adorable, just to get a little bite of something tasty.  It's during these moments, where most of the trust between human and canine, has been built upon.\n\nBecause he has probably spent most of his life as an outdoor dog, he is a work in progress with housebreaking.  He does however, keeps a very clean crate largely because he does not want to potty in his beloved palace.  If you take him straight from his crate to the outside, he understands what is expected of him but all his years of marking where ever and whenever, have required the use of belly bands indoors, which have turned out to be a fabulous solution to this problem. He has grown accustom to the belly band ritual (taking them off to go outside and putting them back on, when he comes inside) without complaint or grouse.  We are even happy to report that more and more, his belly bands are dry, when taken off to go outside, so he is getting it down but it is a work in progress that may need to be continued in his forever home.  \n\nTeefers is a pretty quiet guy too.  He vocalizes his desire to be out of his crate, to come back in the house or to be fed his dinner or snacks but he does not bark to hear himself bark.  He gets along great with all the dogs in his foster home, big and small, male and female and pretty much ignores the cats and has had no issue, one way or the other, with the horse.  We strongly feel that, where household or barnyard animals are concerned, if they leave him alone, he will leave them alone.   \n\nSo what do you think?  He's not conventional and he will make you work for every favor he bestows upon you.  He is open to friendship of convenience and will let you know when you are pushing too fast.  Compared to his attitude when he arrived, he has made respectable progress but we believe Teefers will always be a bit on the cranky, independent side and view humans as a means to an end, be that end, a good scratch where it itches, a tasty treat or a nice walk around the neighborhood.  \n\nCan your ego take it?  Because he's pretty funny and easy company, if it can.\n\nTo meet Mr Teefers, please go to our website at www.allmuttsgreatandsmall.org/adoption and fill out the application.  Teefers is one of a kind and there is a special person out there who will understand him and maybe even find his soft spot, with time.\n\nTeefers is between 10 and 12 years old, weighs a solid, 10 pounds, is neutered, has been treated and cleared of intestinal parasites, is up to date on his five way and rabies vaccinations, is microchipped and is scheduled for a dental on December 2nd.  After that, he will be ready to strut his unique, eccentric, dignified, proud, intelligent, sometimes cranky and always adorable little behind, right into your home....AND TAKE OVER!!!!\n\nHis adoption fee is $150\n\n.  \n\n\n\n",

She was scared, stressed and needed help getting adopted from a place with less commotion. H2H told the shelter we would be happy to help this little girl find her new home.\n\nInitially, Libby is a little unsure of new people and situations, but she bonds quickly. Once comfortable, she seeks out attention, gets in your lap and wants to be right by your side. She is affectionate, attentive and a little sweetheart.\n\nLibby can entertain herself by emptying the toy basket and running around playing with her toys. She sits by her foster mom & watches her work during the day and happily sleeps in the bed with her foster family.  \n\nLibby walks well on a leash and is reliably house trained. Libby can be scrappy with other dogs, so she should be an only dog.  Libby requires an all-adult home (no children or grandchildren)  She requires an all adult home (no children or grandchildren) with a small, securely fenced yard (4 feet or higher).\n\nThe adoption range for this dog is limited to NC, SC and VA.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, contact h2hadoptions@gmail.com. An all adult home with a fenced yard (fence must be attached to the home) is required to adopt from Hart-2-Heart Rescue.\n\nThere is an application process and adoption fee. We are an all-volunteer organization, and in addition to saving dogs, we have other responsibilities, so we appreciate your patience and understanding during this process. Response time can take up to 5 business days.\n\nPlease inquire only if you are willing to come to Greensboro, North Carolina to meet the dog after we schedule your home visit. We do not ship dogs or put them on transports. Adoption fee is $400.\n\nVeterinary Care: All Hart-2-Heart Rescue foster dogs are spayed/neutered, current on heartworm prevention, parvo/distemper, bordetella, and rabies vaccines and are professionally groomed. As needed, our foster dogs have teeth cleanings, extractions, bloodwork and other diagnostic testing.",

            "description": "Sydney came from the Oak Grove, MO animal shelter where she was surrendered by her owner. Sydney has had two owners already in her young life. Her first owners had a 1 year old child and surrendered her to the shelter because they said she was too big. They didn't have the time and space she needed. Sydney was then adopted by a family with 3 children. They had her for a week and then returned her to the shelter for nipping. We wonder if something happened with the first owner involving a leash/harness as that seemed to be the trigger. \n\nSydney is a delightful girl! Very smart and sweet. She enjoys love and attention. Sydney is house trained, does well on a leash, and knows sit, stay, lie down, and come. She is playful and dog friendly at her foster home. Her foster dad says she gets excited when she sees him with her collar and leash and sits while he puts them on. Sydney weighs about 85 lbs and is still growing. She will come to you spayed, up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, and up to date on heartworm and flea/tick preventatives. \n\nApplicants must have a secure and visible fence. In order for your application to be approved, you must also pass a home check and a vet check which includes having at least a two year vet history. Sydney will NOT be adopted to a home with small children. Sydney can be adopted in Missouri and surrounding states: Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and Arkansas. We are able to transport Sydney to those states. If you would like to give Sydney a furever home, please fill out an application on our website. \n\nBeing fostered in Holden, MO",

I'm a cream or white poodle.  I love love love attention!  I learned to use the pet stairs in 2 days (so I could get on the couch for more attention)!  Sometimes I let my people know that I need to potty, but I'm still a work in progress.  I likes walks and car rides.  I do not like a crate.  Sometimes I don't like being picked up.  No children under 12 please.  I need time to adjust to a new home and people.  I might be nippy until I get used to you.  Please be patient with me. \n\nBirch is a 9-10 yr old Poodle that was rescued from the Missouri City shelter.  He is fully vetted, neutered, up to date on shots, hw negative, had a dental and is microchipped.  He weighs 8 pounds. \n\nALL adoptions require a completed application, vet check, home check and final contract.  The application to adopt can be found at www.camorescue.com.\n\nAdoption fees are variable.

Thank goodness she did because she had a ruptured eye and bleeding mammary tumors. She was a solid mat of fur but allowed us to bathe her and shave her down to get all that horrible stuff off of her. \nThen we went to the vet and got her all fixed up. She went through a huge surgery but they got all the tumors and they were biopsied to make sure she would be cancer free. As with any mammary tumor, there is a danger that someday she may develop tumors in other areas, but for now, she is cancer free and living the good life with her foster mom. \nMazie would do best in a home with someone who can spend all their time with her. She tends to get whiney when you don't let her be with you. She's looking for a lap to spend the rest of her years on. \nMazie has no vision in the eye that ruptured prior to her getting to us but has great vision in her other eye. She loves her stuffed toys and is a bit of a toy hoarder. She will get all her toys and put them around her on the couch and just act adorable. It's a wonderful thing to see a pup that was so neglected and unloved blossom into a happy little pup. \nMazie is now fully vetted and healthy. She can be a little picky with her food but has her faves as her foster mom will tell you. She adores roasted chicken from the grocery store! \nMazie is around 12 years old, weighs 8 or 9 lbs, and is housebroken. She is dog selective and would be best as an only dog or have a meet and greet prior to any adoption with another dog in the residence. \nShe is located in Hicksville NY\nMazie's adoption fee is $400",

We think Reilly is around 10 months old.  Let's hope he has stopped growing. \n\nREILLY is a big, strong exuberant boy who, due to his strength and energy, would do best in a home with kids over 12.   He doesn't know what a big oaf he is!   This cutie pie is housebroken and knows sit!   \n\nREILLY has done well with other dogs and would probably love to have a doggie brother or sister on the medium to large size to play with.    A fenced in yard for him to run and play fetch in would be an added bonus. \n\nREILLY is an affectionate guy who just needs exercise, structure and consistency so someone with staffie or pittie experience would be a great match for him.\n\nIf interested, please contact Christine at crisley1@prodigy.net \n\n",

He is now a strong, healthy boy weighing in at around 72 pounds. Ulysses has a typical Plott personality: goofy, dorky, sweet, and happy. He is very friendly with all humans he meets, but would do best in a home without small children. Ulysses would prefer to be the only male dog in the household and would also be fine as a solo dog as he loves being with his people. He has a strong prey instinct, so NO cats or small animals, please. He is housetrained and cratetrained, rides nicely in the car, and is working very hard on practicing his leash manners. In the house, he is very mild-mannered and quiet. Outside in the yard, he is in his element, and will sing you the song of his people when he catches the scent of something to be tracked. A fenced property would be best, as he will follow his nose given the opportunity. He would prefer a home that allows him the time and space to stretch his long legs and put his nose to work in a safe way; he is not cut out to be a city boy.",

Finley is a real sweetheart, but had a sad start in life and is a victim of abuse.  So he is a bit shy at first, but once he knows you are \"safe\", he is a little lover and quickly bonds.  He would be a great family pet for older children.  His vision isn't 100 percent, but it won't stop him from being a wonderful companion and friend.  If you would like to meet Finley, please give Hanne a call at 850-682-4104.  Photos will follow soon!",

            "description": "Tia von Torgelow is a beautiful 4-5 year old Shepherd mix.  This adorable bi-color girl is ready to be chosen by you, especially if you like dogs who are quite affectionate.  She comes up to you for attention and follows you through the house and while on walks. She has an easy-going personality and prefers a calmer-paced life.  Busy streets, pushy dogs, loud noises are all not Tia\u2019s cup of tea.  She can take a little time to warm up with new people and curious dogs.  When out, she avoids dogs who storm up to her.  In playgroups, she prefers to get a feel of the yard first and then join in.  She greets everyone politely and does best palling around with other dogs with a similar calm demeanor. (No cats in the home please.)   She is a darling girl that would love to land a home with a family she can follow all day long and that will fill up her life.  So if you believe that Tia just might be the gal for you, fill out the application linked below.\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website and Facebook page!

            "description": "{s3829code380/}\nIf you would like to provide this dog a loving home, please fill out a pre-adoption application.\n\nHave a question? Please read our Frequently Asked Questions and Adoption Processed Explained documentation.\n_________ B I O ______________\n\nName:Mooney\nSize: ~Large range: 61-100 lbs\nAdoption Donation:$250 (applicable sales tax included).Adoption fees may be paid by cash or check.\nOther:Neutered Male, Vaccinations current, Microchip, NO Children\n\nMooney would luv to have a great place to stay.\n\nFoster Home Feedback\n\n*\nNO Children\n\n*\nBreed Experience Required\n\n*\nMooney is currently on medication for allergies and itching. The cost of this medication is $98.00 per month. It is unknown if this medication will be required long term or just temporarily, but he currently requires it every day.\n\n12/7/2020: Mooney has been continuing to settle into our home and we get to see more of his goofy personality every single day! He absolutely adores tennis balls and chuck-it balls. We have quite the hoard starting and Mooney can keep himself entertained for hours by pouncing on them, kicking them around, and playing keep-away with us. And beyond balls, he loves toys of just about any type! He is a destroyer, so stuffed toys don't last very long, but he has so much fun letting the fluff fly.\n\nHe has quite the 'Shepherd sass' as I am calling it. He is pretty vocal and likes to make himself known to those around. We also hear a lot of dramatic sighs around the house when Mooney doesn't get his way. We've been working hard on basic manners like not jumping up, loose leash walking, and waiting at the door. Luckily, he is very food motivated and has a strong drive to learn, so he has been a quick study in that department.\n\nMooney does great whenever we have to leave him alone. We kennel him and don't hear a peep the entire time. He isn't destructive to our things, so he would likely be okay left out of the kennel as well, but his wandering nose might find open trash cans or things on the counter if those get left out.\n\nStructure and boundaries are a big part of life with Mooney. We make sure to meet his physical and mental needs, otherwise, he can get a little mouthy and wild. He gets along fantastic with our resident dog, but he doesn't always take the hint when she is done playing or when he is being too rough (he can be oblivious to his size and strength) so he needs a little supervision and some occasional structured breaks.\n\nStrangers and new people are still very scary to Mooney. He does not react to strangers on walks or at a distance, but if someone were to try and approach him then he will. Every day we work on creating positive associations with strangers from a distance and are slowly increasing the circle of people he trusts. He needs a special forever home that understands he will need management and continued work in this area. Once you gain his trust, though, he does not disappoint. At home with us, Mooney is one of the most affectionate dogs I've ever met and has such a bright, funny personality that brings lots of smiles to our faces. I know someone out there will love him just as much as we do!\n\n11/5/2020: Meet Mooney! If you have been searching for a 75 lb. lap dog, then he is your guy! He loves to cuddle and be affectionate, it is no joke that he is a total lap dog! He can never get close enough! Since having him in our home, we have gotten an endless supply of snuggling, kisses, and demands for petting. Mooney doesn't always pay attention to his size, so sometimes we have to set some boundaries for him.\n\nHe gets along great with other dogs, but likely needs playmates his size and energy level! Mooney wants to play all the time and can be very boisterous and loud when he does (he also doesn't always realize his size and strength). He listens well to my 50 lb. Pitty when she has had enough. I have had no issues with him sharing toys and bones with my resident dog, he loves to play tug with her! He is just a young guy who loves to go, go, go!\n\nMooney is fabulous in his kennel and happily runs in any chance he gets! It is his safe space and he loves to relax in there. He will also go in there for some calm time when he is getting too excited and sleeps through the night in there too.\n\nWe've been working very hard on walking nicely on the leash since he has been with us and he is getting much better! Mooney is very strong and will need some reminders to walk nicely. He is incredibly smart and treat-motivated, which makes him quick to learn new things. Mooney certainly has that Shepard drive to learn! He knows 'sit', 'down', 'stay', and 'shake' so far.\n\nMooney is a young dog with energy to burn and would love a family that will give him proper outlets for exercise and mental stimulation. On the flip side, he is also happy to relax and cuddle on the couch while watching TV in the evenings.\n\nWe don't know a lot about his past, but we do know that Mooney's forever family needs to be devoted to continue creating positive experiences in his life to show him that this world isn't scary. Mooney can get nervous around new people (especially men), but cheese is the way to his heart and once he trusts you then he will love you forever. Younger kids make him very uncomfortable and the busy \"come and go\" lifestyle of teenagers likely wouldn't mesh well with his personality. While he is still scared of various things in this great big world, his confidence has grown immensely after being with me for a couple of weeks and I know he can continue to thrive with the right people.To view additional dogs available for adoption, please see our website: www.4luvofdog.org",

Daisy is very quit in her run, a great walker on the leash, and house-trained. She is smart and knows her basic commands. Daisy has had babies in the past, but that is behind her now. She is a happy-go-lucky dog that loves kids, but it would be best for her to be an only pet in the house. Daisy has a great personality; playtime, pats, loves, and cuddles all day would make her the happiest girl around! Meet this amazing girl in run 875. Her ID number is 625812. Daisy is up-to-date on vaccines, now spayed, and will be microchipped upon adoption. She can't wait to meet and love her new family!  Sadly she has tested positive for heartworms, but with treatment, she should be good as new in no time. Please speak to your veterinarian regarding treatment options.\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

            "description": "During the state mandated shelter-in-place order BACS has transitioned to virtual, socially-distanced adoptions.\nIf you have an interest in a particular BACS animal, please email KSwanson@cityofberkeley.info. The first step will be to set up a virtual meeting with their current foster family via phone, zoom, or facetime, to provide you with more detailed information about the animal. Following that, if you feel like it could be a good adoption fit, shelter staff will help coordinate a socially-distanced meeting in person so that you can meet your potential family member up-close and personal. Thank you for your patience during this time. We really appreciate your support!\n\nBuddy Love is looking for someone with a heart as big as his. This senior pup, affectionately known as an \"elderbull\", spent the first 11 years of his life living in a backyard. He's looking forward to making up for lost time in his golden years! Buddy Love wants to be with people \u2014 from neighborhood walks, to supervising kitchen duties, to lounging while you read a book or watch TV.\n \nBuddy Love's ideal adopter will have experience, patience, and time to help him through the transition into his forever home. He has dealt with a lot of change recently, which has been hard on him. Plus, his recent hearing loss has also made life more challenging. He loves routine, cuddles, meal time, and his walkies. But don't let his age fool you \u2014 Buddy Love will happily stroll the town with you for 30-60 minutes a couple times a day. \n \nHe's already house trained and currently lives well in a foster home with an older, female dog and parrot, but he might prefer to be the only animal in his new home. He also has experience with young children and has earned his nickname \"Buddy Bear\" for his teddy bear-like qualities (gentle, caring, loyal).\n",

Though he lived with a small dog and they were friends, he escaped through an open door as another small dog was walking by on a leash. He chased after it, and scared the small dog, so his family brought him to the shelter on Nov. 5. His family says he is house-trained and good with children. He is about 4 years old and weighs 76 pounds. He is neutered and up-to-date on vaccinations and will be heartworm tested and microchipped upon adoption. Come meet him in Run 52 using ID#625829.\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

But then, one Sunday was different; instead of taking a left, the car went right. I wasn't sure where we were going, this wasn't our usual route. She stopped on a side street and opened my car door; I didn't recognize this area, but I jumped out of the car and waited by her to be leashed. But my owner didn't leash me. She got back in her car and began driving off without me. I quickly ran after the car. \"Wait Mom, you're forgetting me!\" I barked and ran as fast as I could, but the car didn't stop. I eventually accepted defeat when the tail lights of her car disappeared...\n\nUnfortunately, Cinder's story is not unlike hundreds of others; all of which are deserving a loving forever family.\n\nCinder's eyes spoke to us and we hope she will speak to you too! She is a BEAUTIFUL 3 year old Labrador Retriever / American Staffordshire Terrier Mix. She weighs approximately 65lbs, is up-to-date on vaccinations, spayed, microchipped and heartworm negative. She has tested well with other dogs, rides well in the car and has gotten along well with people of all sizes (although her size and exuberance may not be the best match for very small children).\n\nPlease check back soon as we learn more about this amazing dog that has so much love to give to the right family. Home ownership is a requirement and BSL will apply to restricted areas (but she will be eligible to reside in Denver, come January)! Don't let your chance to love and be loved by this beautiful gal pass you by! Please complete an application to meet Cinder today!\n\n*Homeownership Required & BSL applies.\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

            "description": "Gucci is a sweet dog, born May 7, 2019. He is a shy, anxious boy who needs a home with someone who can help him build confidence and develop trust. Gucci loves to play with dogs of all sizes, but he is good at entertaining himself, when needed. He enjoys the attention of children. Being outside makes him happy, especially when it includes pool time and going for walks. He is housetrained, walks very well on a leash, and knows basic commands. This boy LOVES playing tag and is lightning fast so catching him is a challenge. He needs a yard with a 6-foot fence. In his new home, Gucci will need some time to warm up, but once he becomes comfortable, his is a calm and loving dog who just wants to lay on the couch with you. He is a very kind dog who doesn't have a mean bone in his body.\n\nHis prospective owner will be required to work with a trainer on his trust issues prior to adopting Gucci.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Gucci is $400. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

Spencer looks forward to his walks (yes, as in more than once daily, please!).  He starts off instantly at a good pace and can get get ahead of you, but Spencer is also sweet-natured and mindful of correction.  Spencer\u2019s pep isn\u2019t just about pounding the pavement; he\u2019s very active at home and seeks interaction and play.   Spencer enjoys the company of other dogs -- perhaps a little too much.  Whether he\u2019s in a pack walk or in a playgroup, he is always on the lookout for a partner to play with.  This can be too much for some more serious or laid-back canines, so Spencer is best matched with a tolerant dog who enjoys romping but doesn\u2019t get too rough and tumble.   A happy boy like Spencer seems enthusiastic about everything; however, what he\u2019s most looking forward to is an active home with no cats but maybe with someone looking for a jogging buddy. If you are as happy to get outdoors as much as this boy is,  fill out the application linked below for Spencer.\n\nWestside thanks you for looking at our amazing dogs and for choosing to save an animal's life through rescue. \n\nDon't forget to visit your local animal shelter...the source of many of our dogs.\n \nwww.sheprescue.org\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WGSRescue\n\n",

            "description": "Penelope is a 2 yr old Doxie mix who was rescued while pregnant from Mexico. She was wondering the streets and brought to the US for rescue. Penelope gave birth to 3 very healthy pups about 2 weeks later. Penelope appears to be a Doxie mix with longer legs. She is a super sweet girl who loves to be with people and playing with other dogs. She is housebroken but may take a week or so to get used to a new environment. The puppies are now weaned and she was ready to part ways so she is with a different foster to give her some peace. Penelope's milk is drying up and she will be spayed Feb 1st {unless we can get an earlier appt}.  \n\nPenelope weighs about 13 lbs and absolutely loves walks! She does have some food aggression with other dogs so if there is another dog in the home she would need to be fed in a crate. She has no other aggressions and loves to snuggle in her blankets. \n\nPenelope would do best in a home where she has a secured yard to play and will not be alone too many hours a day. She does go looking for her people and will scale gates to search. She is crate trained so it is recommended that she be placed in the crate while alone. She really needs another small sized dog in the home to play/bond with.\n\nIf you would like to meet Penelope please fill out an adoption application at www;dogsinneedorg.com\n\nThe adoption fee for Penelope is $350 which includes all vaccines, rabies, flea control, deworming, microchip and spay",

My name is Bikini, and my bright, sunshine personality will make every day feel like summer when I am by your side! I'm a big brindle-colored beauty - currently weighing about 100 pounds, but I would greatly benefit from losing a few - and my loving personality is even bigger! My favorite activity in the world is cuddling with my people, followed closely by receiving head massages, praise, and (of course) treats. I am generally pretty mellow and am a naptime expert so I would do best in a quiet, adult-only home without much activity (no children, please!) because too much excitement can stress me out. But I also have short bursts of energy and bounce around when I am feeling playful: I like to dance and reach out my paws to you. I get along well with the other doggie and cat in my foster home, and would enjoy a fenced yard at my forever home. I would also appreciate a family who will take me for daily strolls around the neighborhood so I can get some exercise and reach my healthier goal weight.\n\nI have lovely house manners and you will be happy to have me as your forever roommate. I am potty trained and rest easily in a crate if you need to leave home for a few hours for work or errands. If I had to admit one minor flaw, it would be that my tail rarely stops wagging so I might accidentally knock a mug or wine glass off a coffee table as I pass by. I am a smart girl who is very treat motivated so if you wanted to teach me more commands I bet I would be a good student! If you have been on the hunt for an affectionate dog with endless love to give to her people, I think you have found your girl! I hope you fill out an adoption application soon because I am ready to make you smile with my big heart!\n\nLove,\nBikini\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS, NO EXCEPTIONS:\n*ADOPTION FEE: $300\n*Be at least 21 years of age\n*Live in a 50-mile radius of Itasca, within the Illinois border\n*Have the knowledge and agreement of all adults living in the household\n*Have approval from owner of residence (written in lease)\n*Have a valid ID with current address (please provide proof of address if ID address is not up-to-date)\n*Be approved as a suitable adoptive home by Fetching Tails Foundation\n*Be prepared to make a lifetime commitment\n\nIf interested please fill out an application on our website at www.fetchingtailsfoundation.org; please make sure you fill in every required field/question or your submission will not go through. Please note that we take time to learn as much as we can about each dog in our care and our bios are our current observations; we are unable to make any guarantees on the future health or temperament of your adopted dog. Most dogs in our care come with unknown pre-rescue history and as such breed and age estimates are an educated guess.",

            "description": "Sundown is an approximately 2 year old hound mix. Found  by a good samaritan, emaciated (see \"before\" picture) and lying in the road, he was placed in a loving foster home where he has gained 12 pounds. Sundown has been fully vetted including neuter, vaccinations and microchip. He did test positive for heartworms and is being treated through the \"slow-kill\" method.  This requires him to be on heartworm prevention for life and his qualified family must have a history of monthly heartworm prevention.\n\nThis sweet boy is housebroken, loves his crate, and sleeps quietly in it all night. He likes to pull his blankets out of the crate for fun but isn't destructive while kenneled. He is not excessively vocal, he rarely barks unless it's supper time! And who could blame him for getting so excited?!\n\nSundown gets along with all the dogs in his foster home, even the small chi-weeniees. He's loves to play with his companions and would do best in a home with another dog or two. Not cat tested but does not show interest in prey like squirrels or birds.\n\nSundown adores his foster mom and checks in with her often when they are outside doing yard work and chores. He's truly a Velcro pup! He knows how to sit for his food bowl and gives howdy as thanks.\n\nHis perfect home would have a doggy friend and a human or two to continue working with him to be the best boy he can be. Good with kids, might be a bit exuberant for small ones. Overall this is a fantastic young fella who wants someone who will love him like he deserves.\n\nApril 2020:  We are not holding public adoption events at this time.  Qualified families are being invited to appointments to meet specific dogs.  There are currently no opportunities to view multiple dogs and adoption events aren't being held at Tractor Supply in Lenoir.\n\nWhether dogs / puppies come in as strays or owner surrenders, we usually have to make our best guess as to birthdate and breed.   \n\nIf adopted into a home with other animals, particularly cats, your new pet should be crated or secured when you're not available to supervise to insure a harmonious relationship.  \n\nA vet reference is required to confirm responsible pet ownership.  We suggest first time pet owners look for an adult dog for companionship and to gain experience through another rescue or your local government-run animal control..\n\nAdoption fee covers two vaccinations plus spay / neuter if using our local low-cost spay/neuter clinic (overnight stay required) and surgery occurs as agreed upon in the adoption contract.  Convenience fee equal to refundable spay/neuter deposit may be added if using our veterinarian.  Additional fees for 3rd puppy vaccination, refundable spay/neuter deposit, etc. may apply.  \n\nWe are an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue.  We receive no funding from agencies.  Available animals can be seen most Saturdays at Tractor Supply in Lenoir from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  We recommend interested parties contact us to pre-qualify for adoption so their new furry family can go home once paperwork is complete.  Fees are required in cash.  For more information on our organization, our website is www.petpartnersrescue.org.",

NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show. We have been told that you can go straight to the shelter and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog. From what we understand, the shelter will squeeze you in. (Please know this is not a guarantee).\n\nWe hope your adoption process is smooth and full of happiness!\n\nLook at Antonio's happy face!! Antonio has been at the shelter for almost 60 days now and he needs to go home. He's a friendly boy that likes to be petted, likes to play and loves his treats! He loves to go for a walk and he will pull hard on the leash at first because he's so happy to get out of his kennel but once he walks for a block, he slows down and takes a nice, leisurely walk. When a volunteer took Antonio for a walk and gave him some treats, he jumped up a bit because he was so happy to get them. But when he is told \"no\" and \"down\" he listens and sits right down. Other volunteers have said he loves getting his ears scratched and when he got a rock in his paw, he let the volunteer remove it with no issues.\n\nWhen Antonio was taken out to the play yard to meet other dogs, he was quite dominant with them. If an adopter already has a dog at home, they need to bring them with to the shelter to meet Antonio to see if they can live together. If Antonio is the dog for you, then come and meet him today!!\n\nThis amazing pup is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4465390.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

            "description": "PLEASE READ ENTIRE PROFILE BEFORE APPLYING.\n\nOlga is a 135lb, 3-and-a-half year old English Mastiff, and like all mastiffs she is a giant, lazy baby! Unfortunately though, Olga has been let down in life and has some trust issues because of it. She was abandoned by her old owner, and ended up in the shelter. Whatever happened in her life before, it caused her to not trust a lot of people, especially men, and young ones who may not be well-versed in a dog's body language. For this reason we are only going to adopt her to a home without men, unless they have professional experience with dog training or behavior.\n\nShe is extremely loving and affectionate with women she trusts, it just might take a few meetings. If she doesn't like you, just give it time, and work with her. She's not mean, just uncertain, and will react accordingly. She is currently on Prozac for her anxiety. \n\nDue to her history she needs a good amount of structure and personal time to solidify the dog-owner bond. Because of this, it would be best that Olga goes to a quiet home of only one or two adults, preferably someone with experience owning very large dogs. Good news though - Olga is fine with most other animals!! Of course if you have a dog a meet-and-greet will be required, but she's lived with dogs and cats before and had no issues. \n\nIf you give her a chance you won't be disappointed: she really is a sweet and gentle giant. She loves to sniff around the yard and scratch her back in the grass, and she is very gentle taking treats. She'll lean on you for ear rubs and neck scratches, and she likes to give slobbery kisses! So, won't you give Olgie a chance?\nTo adopt one of our animals, please visit our shelter, open Tuesday-Friday from Noon-6pm and Saturday from Noon-4pm. You may also submit an application online from our website at http://www.HelpTheAnimalsINC.com/adopt.",

            "description": "Hi there! I'm Boogie! Are you ready for a goofy boy to dance and wiggle into your life? I am a 2 year old, neutered male, pit bull. I weigh about 50 pounds. I have tons of young dog energy and love to be on the move! I am affectionate and love to get attention. I get very excited to see my favorite people and can get jumpy and rowdy, so my new family will need to help me spruce up my manners. To aid me in my goals, am required to go to basic obedience classes, which includes an additional cost at the time of adoption. I love treats and already know how to sit for one. My new family must be an adults only household or one with older teens. They should also have recent experience with large breed, high energy dogs like myself. If there is a resident dog in the home, I get along best with social, playful dogs around my size. Please be sure to bring in the entire household, dogs included, before adopting me to make sure we'll all get along.\nIf you're interested in learning more about me or setting up a time to meet, please submit your fully completed Adoption Profile Form to swerning@phs-spca.org or call 650-340-7022 x 316. You must be 18 or older to submit an application.\nApplication: https://phs-spca.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/AdoptionProfiles_dog.pdfUnless otherwise indicated, adoptable animals are located at our Lantos Center for Compassion at 1450 Rollins Road, Burlingame, CA 94010. Please note at this time we are doing adoptions by appointments only. Please call us at 650-340-7022 to schedule an appointment.Our hours are weekdays from 11am-6pm and weekends from 11am-5pm (closed major holidays). Interested adopters must arrive at least 1 hour before close. We do our best to update our listings regularly, but we can't guarantee every animal you see is still available. It's also typical for us to have animals who haven't had their photos taken yet, so you are welcome to visit our adoption center and have a look around!\nTo check on an animal's adoption status, please call 650-340-7022 during normal business hours to speak with an adoption counselor. Emails will be returned as soon as possible, but please allow up to 48 hours during busy adoption periods like weekends.",

Hasty is a love bug who enjoys belly rubs, playing with his female doggie friends, and more belly rubs. He is looking for home with patience and a gentle hand, as he seems to have had a rough start to life. Hasty is super sweet and wants to please and is just looking for praise for being a Good Boy. Come on out today and meet this gentle boy, and you will be quick to bring him home with you!\n\nWe work by appointment only and work on a first come basis.  If you are interested in making an appointment, please call the HCHS at 512-793-5463.  You can see all our available animals at HillCountryHumaneSociety.org.\nAll our adoptable dogs are treated for fleas, given DHPPV and Bordatella vaccines and are de-wormed.  \nWhen you adopt one of our animals it will be micro chipped and registered at the time of adoption.  Also, if not already altered, you will receive a voucher to get your animal spay/neutered for free.\nWhile we do our best to determine the breeds of our dogs, the majority are strays, and we have only general appearance, coat type, size, ear type, tail, tongue color and coat color to base breed on.  It is always possible when adopting a puppy that it will change dramatically to look like another breed.\n\n",

She is a strong-willed Alaskan Malamute mix with one of the cutest fuzzy faces around. Being a true example to the breed Hannah likes to test her limits occasionally. As such she will require an adopter who has a good understand of pack rules and a loving yet firm hand during training. Hannah loves a long hike as much as a Netflix and chill night on the couch. Her favorite snack is cheese curds. So if you have access to Beechers Handmade Cheese she would like to meet you immediately.\n\nHannah loves being with her humans and so if she is left for long periods of time may try to escape to find the company of another person to spoil her. Hannah needs an escape proof home environment (Fort Knox like since she is a master at creative escapes). She is a bit cool towards other dogs and would prefer to be your one and only in true Diva fashion. Cats and young children are probably not a good mix for this girl.\n\nHannah is being lovingly cared for in Washington while she awaits her new forever home.Interested in sponsoring?

His recall is amazing, including when he tries to climb the trees at the fence line to catch the squirrel on the other side. He's been higher than the fence, but fortunately hasn't jumped over.\n\nHan is available to the RIGHT home only. Han needs an experienced owner that is willing to work with him every day. He's a smart dog with limitless energy, but will become possessive if not corrected constantly. He needs a fenced in yard to get some of this energy out, but also requires mental stimulation through training, agility, or walks. Very long walks. He would be an excellent hiking partner. Han would do best as an only pet in the household.\n\nADOPT HAN!!!!! The adoption fee is $250.00 and we require a vet check and home visit. Han is neutered, chipped, vaccinated, heartworm tested and on monthly prevention for fleas/tick and heartworms.",

His recall is amazing, including when he tries to climb the trees at the fence line to catch the squirrel on the other side. He's been higher than the fence, but fortunately hasn't jumped over.\n\nHan is available to the RIGHT home only. Han needs an experienced owner that is willing to work with him every day. He's a smart dog with limitless energy, but will become possessive if not corrected constantly. He needs a fenced in yard to get some of this energy out, but also requires mental stimulation through training, agility, or walks. Very long walks. He would be an excellent hiking partner. Han would do best as an only pet in the household.\n\nADOPT HAN!!!!! The adoption fee is $250.00 and we require a vet check and home visit. Han is neutered, chipped, vaccinated, heartworm tested and on monthly prevention for fleas/tick and heartworms.",

Our mission: To balance the health, safety, and welfare needs of Boxers in the Carolinas (and parts of Virginia and Georgia) by providing a loving and safe environment for stray, abused, impounded and owner surrendered dogs by placing them in foster homes and ultimately - forever homes.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDog's Name: Pearl\n\nDog's Approximate Age: 7 years old\n\nGender: Female\n\nDog's Size: Large (70lbs plus as adult and healthy weight)\n\nDog's Weight: 64 pounds\n\nGood with small dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with big dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with cats?: Don't know yet\n\nGood with kids?: Don't know yet\n\nAny medical issues?:\nNEEDS DENTAL CARE, NEEDS TO GAIN 15 LBS\n\nCrate trained?: Yes\n\nHouse trained?: Yes\n\nHeartworms?: Yes\n\n12/4/20: Hi, Friends!\n\nDid you have a nice Thanksgiving? I sure hope so. The weather here was sunny and warm. Mom and I walked an entire mile very slowly, and I smelled so many smells. It was great. I love meeting new dogs of all sizes, and I am doing a great job of walking on my leash.\n\nMy appetite is good, but I am still a picky eater. I will definitely turn down treats or food even when I am hungry if it's not something that I like to eat. I'm still eating my healthy dog food, and special foods like scrambled eggs, cheese, and lunch meat.\n\nDo you know what I love even more than my favorite foods? Affection! That's right. Pet my head or rub my tummy or let me snuggle up next to you on the couch. There is nothing better. I love snuggles and cuddles so much.\n\nI am preparing for my heartworm treatment in January. In a couple of weeks, I will go in for my dental cleaning and to have some lumps and bumps removed. I'm looking forward to having all of the health stuff done, so I can concentrate on having fun with my dog friends.\n\nI'm still having some accidents in the house. Don't worry. Mom and I are going to keep working on it, and I will figure it out. Did I tell you that I'm working on commands? I am so good at sit, and I'm learning some other commands, too. I don't like lay down, though. If I do, I may miss something!\n\nCar rides? Yes! Crate sleeping for naps or nights? Yep! Best girl, ever? Mom says, definitely.\n\nHappy Holidays! And just remember, you can always visit me on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pearl_pup_2020/\n\n11/9/20: Hi, Friends! I cannot believe it's been an entire month since I have been in my foster home. The time has gone so quickly. In the past month, I have developed an appetite and started eating healthy dog foods! Don't get me wrong though--I still love lunchmeat and cheese as treats (or to take my medicines).\n\nGetting out and about is ok. I don't really like the very short walks to go outside and potty, but I have had fun taking some rides in the car. There's so much to see and smell. I am making friends with the dogs who live in our building. My best friends right now are Smoky, a chocolate lab, Doris, the tiniest yorkie mix, Bear, a German Shepherd, and Lily, a black lab. I look forward to being strong so we can play for real.\n\nMy spay surgery is over and done with and I am almost entirely recovered. I can't wait for my stitches to be out next week. Hopefully then I will be well enough to start my heartworm treatment. I am getting healthier and stronger each day! After my surgery, Mom got me a surgery suit instead of a cone and it was great. I may even start expanding my wardrobe.\n\nI continue to be excellent in my crate. I sleep there at night, and hang out when my parents are gone or it's the cat's turn to roam free. I do not chew things that I'm not supposed to, but I've had a number of potty accidents, so I don't spend time roaming free unattended. I spend lots of time with my mom as her assistant during the work day and cuddling to watch a tv at night.\n\nMy mom tells me what a sweet and beautiful girl I am. She says I am the very best snuggler and model! She takes so many photos of me every day.\n\nYou take care and have a Happy Thanksgiving if we don't talk before then. And just remember, you can always visit me on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pearl_pup_2020/\n\n10/17/20: Hi, Friends! I'm Pearl, a bulldog/boxer mix. I have been in my foster home for almost a week now, and I'm starting to get adjusted.\n\nI love people so much. I want to meet everyone I see, and if they want to give me pets--even better! Have you heard of snuggles? I love snuggles. Let's snuggle on the couch or on the floor or on my bed. Have you heard of belly rubs? I love them more than anything in the entire world. I will lay on my back and ask for a belly rub when I wake up in the morning and when I sit down to go outside. My foster mom gives me a belly rub a couple of times a day, and we snuggle so much.\n\nI'm a grown-up gal, so I have many of the basics mastered! I sleep very well in a crate. If you put a treat in, I walk in with no objection and stay there for as long as you need me to. I am completely house-broken and learning that I will get regular breaks to go outside. I walk well on a leash, but I am learning to be more confident. I am learning which dog friends I can trust. I do not like bicycles or loud cars too close when I am on a walk. I have excellent ears. If a dog barks or someone whistles on tv, I will think they are talking to me, and I might even stand at attention. I know what come means, but I still need to learn sit, stay, and lay down. I am not a loud girl, and in a week, I have only barked three times. I will be honest, I do snore a bit when I sleep.\n\nHave you heard of cheese? I'm still expanding my palate and figuring out which foods and treats that I like, but I really love cheese. I would share with you though. I do not chew on things that I am not supposed to like shoes, and I can be left safely to roam while you are out.

I sure hope so. The weather here was sunny and warm. Mom and I walked an entire mile very slowly, and I smelled so many smells. It was great. I love meeting new dogs of all sizes, and I am doing a great job of walking on my leash.\n\nMy appetite is good, but I am still a picky eater. I will definitely turn down treats or food even when I am hungry if it's not something that I like to eat. I'm still eating my healthy dog food, and special foods like scrambled eggs, cheese, and lunch meat.\n\nDo you know what I love even more than my favorite foods? Affection! That's right. Pet my head or rub my tummy or let me snuggle up next to you on the couch. There is nothing better. I love snuggles and cuddles so much.\n\nI am preparing for my heartworm treatment in January. In a couple of weeks, I will go in for my dental cleaning and to have some lumps and bumps removed. I'm looking forward to having all of the health stuff done, so I can concentrate on having fun with my dog friends.\n\nI'm still having some accidents in the house. Don't worry. Mom and I are going to keep working on it, and I will figure it out. Did I tell you that I'm working on commands? I am so good at sit, and I'm learning some other commands, too. I don't like lay down, though. If I do, I may miss something!\n\nCar rides? Yes! Crate sleeping for naps or nights? Yep! Best girl, ever? Mom says, definitely.\n\nHappy Holidays! And just remember, you can always visit me on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pearl_pup_2020/\n\n11/9/20: Hi, Friends! I cannot believe it's been an entire month since I have been in my foster home. The time has gone so quickly. In the past month, I have developed an appetite and started eating healthy dog foods! Don't get me wrong though--I still love lunchmeat and cheese as treats (or to take my medicines).\n\nGetting out and about is ok. I don't really like the very short walks to go outside and potty, but I have had fun taking some rides in the car. There's so much to see and smell. I am making friends with the dogs who live in our building. My best friends right now are Smoky, a chocolate lab, Doris, the tiniest yorkie mix, Bear, a German Shepherd, and Lily, a black lab. I look forward to being strong so we can play for real.\n\nMy spay surgery is over and done with and I am almost entirely recovered. I can't wait for my stitches to be out next week. Hopefully then I will be well enough to start my heartworm treatment. I am getting healthier and stronger each day! After my surgery, Mom got me a surgery suit instead of a cone and it was great. I may even start expanding my wardrobe.\n\nI continue to be excellent in my crate. I sleep there at night, and hang out when my parents are gone or it's the cat's turn to roam free. I do not chew things that I'm not supposed to, but I've had a number of potty accidents, so I don't spend time roaming free unattended. I spend lots of time with my mom as her assistant during the work day and cuddling to watch a tv at night.\n\nMy mom tells me what a sweet and beautiful girl I am. She says I am the very best snuggler and model! She takes so many photos of me every day.\n\nYou take care and have a Happy Thanksgiving if we don't talk before then. And just remember, you can always visit me on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pearl_pup_2020/\n\n10/17/20: Hi, Friends! I'm Pearl, a bulldog/boxer mix. I have been in my foster home for almost a week now, and I'm starting to get adjusted.\n\nI love people so much. I want to meet everyone I see, and if they want to give me pets--even better! Have you heard of snuggles? I love snuggles. Let's snuggle on the couch or on the floor or on my bed. Have you heard of belly rubs? I love them more than anything in the entire world. I will lay on my back and ask for a belly rub when I wake up in the morning and when I sit down to go outside. My foster mom gives me a belly rub a couple of times a day, and we snuggle so much.\n\nI'm a grown-up gal, so I have many of the basics mastered! I sleep very well in a crate. If you put a treat in, I walk in with no objection and stay there for as long as you need me to. I am completely house-broken and learning that I will get regular breaks to go outside. I walk well on a leash, but I am learning to be more confident. I am learning which dog friends I can trust. I do not like bicycles or loud cars too close when I am on a walk. I have excellent ears. If a dog barks or someone whistles on tv, I will think they are talking to me, and I might even stand at attention. I know what come means, but I still need to learn sit, stay, and lay down. I am not a loud girl, and in a week, I have only barked three times. I will be honest, I do snore a bit when I sleep.\n\nHave you heard of cheese? I'm still expanding my palate and figuring out which foods and treats that I like, but I really love cheese. I would share with you though. I do not chew on things that I am not supposed to like shoes, and I can be left safely to roam while you are out. My foster mom did catch me counter surfing last night though, so your treats may not be safe with me if you aren't looking. My mom says I need to gain some weight, so I will be working on that.\n\nI live with a cat now. I am still trying to figure him out. When I am in my crate, I watch him, but do not bark and he is safe to roam the house freely without any worries about me. I wonder if he will want to play someday? That's all for now. I can't wait to talk with you again soon.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

He would do well in a home where he can get lots of exercise and activity. He's lived in a home with another dog (littermate) since he was born, but they started not getting along.  Which can happen when two puppies stay together. \n\nWe think for now Mason would do better in a home without adults and or adults and older teens without other dogs, he needs a bit of proper socializing in the doggo department. \n\nHe'd do better in a home with a tall fence (he's a jumper) versus an apartment or condo, he will bark when he hears noises or someone pull up. \n\nMason does best crated when home alone.  He should be supervised in any new setting as he sometimes likes to sneak off and chew things he's not supposed to.  We think in the right home when he's getting the right amount of exercise he will grow into a good boy. \n\nHe is neutered, vaccinated, housebroken, and microchipped. \n\nApply at www.luckylabrescue.com and message our Facebook page and let us know you applied. Thank you!",

I have a foster brother who is another doggo. I had to mark my territory when I got here but now I am wearing this silly thing around my waist. Foster mom is going to feed me three times a day to beef me up.

Our mission: To balance the health, safety, and welfare needs of Boxers in the Carolinas (and parts of Virginia and Georgia) by providing a loving and safe environment for stray, abused, impounded and owner surrendered dogs by placing them in foster homes and ultimately - forever homes.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDog's Name: Luke\n\nDog's Approximate Age: 3 years\n\nGender: Male\n\nDog's Size: Medium (50lbs to 70lbs. as adult and healthy weight)\n\nDog's Weight: 65 pounds\n\nGood with small dogs?: No\n\nGood with big dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with cats?: No\n\nGood with kids?: Yes, all ages\n\nAny medical issues?: No\n\nCrate trained?: Don't know yet\n\nHouse trained?: Yes\n\nHeartworms?: No\n\n10/14/20: Hello everyone! My name is Luke. I had a good first night. I got a warm shower this morning. I was a little nervous but relaxed after a few minutes. I take some time warming up to women. I took to my foster dad and little foster human without hesitation! I love playing with the jolly ball! I keep trying to fit the whole thing in my mouth but it won't fit! I have a foster brother who is another doggo. I had to mark my territory when I got here but now I am wearing this silly thing around my waist. Foster mom is going to feed me three times a day to beef me up. I will check in to update soon!\n\n-Luke\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

My favorite games are play and run in the yard or park . I like to be around my humans when I\u2019m not playing with my sister or napping.  I try to please and like to hear that I am a good boy. I enjoy having head rubbed. I love to eat and am very food motivated. \nI am potty training and sleep in a kennel very quiet all night.  Sometimes I do not  want to go in my kennel, but a snack will work for me.\nHe is about 2 years and weight about 56 pounds\nThis is a courtesy post for an independent rescuer.\nPLEASE CONTACT THE FOSTER DIRECTLY \nDenisse at:\nRescuedog36@gmail.com\nor fill an application at:\nhttps://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=DQSIkWdsW0yxEjajBLZtrQAAAAAAAAAAAAMAADAV2WtUQzdJVjY0NTU2Wk1aMVJBWk9BM1g5TU9LWS4u",

He was great out in the yard, but being in the kennel made him anxious. So now he is in a home where he is more comfortable. Spark is a good boy with big smiles and lots of love to give. \n--------------\nUpdate from foster:\n\"\"He's 6 or 7 yrs old. Good around other dogs though expects to be the alpha dog. Not so good around cats. Loves humans and his teddy bear. Wants to be near his master sleeping in your lap or slobbering on your face. He wants to be indoors sleeping on the couch but he doesn't mind sleeping in a crate at night. But needs a fenced yard for when he's outdoors. He's smart but needs someone that has the time and abilities to train him, right now he's just a big goofball. \"\" Come give this big hunk a hug! \nTo meet Spark, please contact our foster coordinator at coordinator@moaspets.com and fill out an adoption application online at www.moaspets.com/adoptionapp. We would love to set up a meet and greet with you!\n-------------------------\n<br>Please call the shelter at (706) 795-2868 to schedule a meet and greet.\n\nMadison Oglethorpe Animal Shelter is a non-profit shelter serving over 720 square miles. We are open intake, meaning we can not turn away animals from either county we serve. Our shelter intakes double or triple it's capacity every month so it is essential we place animals quickly into adoptive homes. Since so many animals enter the shelter we often don't have enough volunteers to write an individual bio for each. Please feel free to call the shelter Wednesday-Sunday to inquire about the animal you are interested in. 706-795-2868.\n\nViewing and adoption hours at our shelter are Wednesday through Sunday from 12 PM to 5 PM. \nAll adoption fees include age-appropriate vaccinations, flea treatment, deworming, and spay or neuter, microchip, and adoption packet. \nFees:\nDogs over 4 months old: $100\nPuppies under 4 months: $125. \nCats and Kittens are $75 ($65 without microchip). \n\nFor your convenience you can fill out an adoption application for any of our current residents at www.moaspets.com. Join us on Facebook at\nhttps://www.facebook.com/moaspets. It's a great way to stay up to the minute on the furry 4 legged friends we have looking for a loving forever home. \nWe are located at:\n1888 Colbert Danielsville Rd \nDanielsville, GA 30633 \n706-795-2868\n\nNOTE: Our adoptions are first come first served, simply filling out an application does not mean the animal will be held for you, you must come meet the animal in person in order to be considered for adoption.\nIf you rent you must bring your lease or a letter from your landlord stating you may adopt.",

            "description": "Hi there! My name is Mona. I'm a sweet, affectionate gal looking for a forever home to live out the rest of my golden years. One of my favorite things to do is cuddle; I just can't enough quality time with the special people in my life. I'd love to spend every minute with you and be your forever sidekick. I'm a bit of a people pleaser, and I really know my stuff, like... sit, stay, wait, kennel, lay down, and more. I'm a very fast learner and love to please my family with all my smarts. At 8 years old, I still have a bit of an energetic and playful streak in me, but I also like to stay calm and curl up in a ball and take a good nap. Really, I'm the best of both worlds. Some of my favorite pastimes include: going for walks, going on car rides, licking the ice cream bowl clean for you, snuggling on the couch, stealing your spot once you've warmed it up, sitting in the window and sunshine, napping, burrowing under blankets, and playing tug of war. My ideal home would be with someone who doesn't have any other pets and who is home most of the day; maybe someone who works from home or a good ol' retiree like me would be perfect! We could keep each other company, so neither one of us will ever be lonesome. I promise I'll go anywhere with you! What do you say, do I sound like the girl for you? Set up a time to meet me today! P.S. Did you know if you're a senior just like me, my adoption fee is FREE for you through our Senior-to-Senior program?! Check out more info here: https://www.homewardonline.org/adoption-foster-info/adoption-discounts-for-seniors-military.html.\n.\n.\nAll animals are current on vaccinations and microchipped prior to adoption. All cats and kittens are Feline Leukemia and FIV tested. All dogs and puppies 6 months and older are heartworm tested. All animals 6 months and older are spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Any kittens/puppies will have refundable spay/neuter deposits included in their adoption fee; spaying/neutering will be the responsibility of the adopter and a refund will be issued upon proof of the surgery being completed by the adopter's veterinarian of choice.\n.\n.\nKitten adoption fees are $150 (includes a $40 refundable spay/neuter deposit). Cat adoption fees are $120, unless otherwise noted. Dog adoption fees may vary between $200-250. Puppies adoption fees may vary between $300-350 (includes a $100 refundable spay/neuter deposit). All adoption fees are taxable (tax is not included in the prices listed above).\n.\n.\n\"\"Sponsored\"\" means that a donor has covered a portion of the adoption fee for that animal. \"\"Fully sponsored\"\" means that a donor has paid the full adoption fee for the animal.",

She was dumped as a pregnant mom with her puppies and needed a lifeline quickly!\n\nNow she's spayed, all fixed up, and her puppies are all adopted. It's time for Medda to find a forever home. \n\nMedda is approximately two-years-old and weighs about 56lbs.  Medda is an outgoing and adventurous girl who has never met a stranger! \n\nMedda loves to play with her foster siblings. She's great with all dogs outside, but can be choosy about her female dog friends.   \n\nCats are unknown. \n\nShe will attempt to jump up upon meeting but is easily corrected.  For that reason, a home with older kiddos or only adults is needed.\n\nShe loves to cuddle and jump on the couch for pets. Medda is completely kennel and house trained and sleeps through the whole night without a peep! \n\nMedda loves to explore the backyard and look for sticks to chew on, her brother to pounce on, or squirrels to chase. \n\nShe loves walks but does need some minor correction when she pulls.  Medda is also always ready for a nap.  \n\nMedda doesn't care for loud cars or trucks, especially Amazon vans, and will bark if she hears or sees one. She will watch TV and bark at other animals or grizzly looking people (long shaggy beards). Medda has even barked at her own reflection in the window. (She's very alert at all times!)\n\nMedda is vaccinated, spayed and microchipped, and ready for her forever home!  \n\nIf you're interested in making Medda a member of your family, please go to www.luckylabrescue.com and complete an adoption application for her.\n",

If you are interested in meeting Bambi please call us at 780-826-3230 to book an appointment. also if you are interested in adopting her go to our web site for adoption application. www.bonnyvilllespca.com\n\nUPDATE: Hi my name is Bambi! I am an older girl around 7 years old. My face may show my age, but my spirit and love for life says differently. I still have lot's of play and energy in me and love to go for walks and run through the snow. I also love people of all ages, so much so that I want to keep the attention all to myself and not share it with another dog.  Can't say for sure how I feel about cats just yet, but the girls hope to test me soon. I do have a secret, one I have just recently shared with the girls here. At some point in my life, someone was not very kind to me. It was discovered that someone had shot at me, quite a few times. I have lot's of tiny pellets in my chest. Luckily, nothing has punctured any major organs. As there is so many bullets, removing all of them is out of the question. I may suffer from lead poisoning later on, which may shorten my life, it's impossible to say. But for my remaining years I would love to find a home where I could be the Queen! If you are looking for a medium size shepherd mix dog who will give you eternal friendship and love look no further then me! I hope to meet my family soon. Love Bambi. ??\n\nUPDATE #2 from her Foster Family: \n\nAre you looking for a sweet and loyal companion? Then Bambi is the dog for you!\n\nBambi is a senior dog, but her foster mom says you can\u2019t tell! She loves her walks, belly rubs, and being with her humans. She is still working on her jumping manners, and can be a little excitable until she settles in... but she is an eager-to-please sweetheart that loves everyone she meets.\n\nBambi would do well in a home as the only pet, or with a non-dominant dog with proper introductions.\n\nThis loving sweet girl very much deserves her second chance and a furever family to call her own ?",

Pauline was hanging around their house, being a perfect guest and great with their other dogs, however, the family could not keep her. \n\nPauline is a lovely dog, about 2 years old and a Blue Lacy mix. She is super with other dogs. Pauline is spayed and up to date on shots. Due to what we believe is a birth defect, our sweet Pauline is missing part of her right rear paw. As you can see in her video, that doesn't bother her one bit! We considered amputating the leg but were advised against it by our rescue vet. Pauline would love a family all to herself! She is loyal and very sweet!. \nAre you interested in learning more about Pauline? Please let us know ASAP.",

This 11-year-old, 80-lb. Labrador mix would do best in a home as an only fur-child. Known affectionately to shelter staff as Pearlie, she came to BARC shelter 3 years ago after her owner needed to travel for his job and could no longer keep her. This sweet girl enjoys going on walks but is equally happy chilling indoors stretched out on the sofa or floor. While she listens to commands to sit and be still outside, she can be aggressive toward big dogs, so she\u2019d benefit from a strong person who can handle her when she\u2019s on the leash. Pearl is housebroken and is not food aggressive, and she listens to commands and is food motivated. She absolutely aims to please and will be by your side as much as she can, looking up at you adoringly and giving her love. Her vaccinations are all up to date and she has some arthritis issues that are being regulated with Dosequin. Please call 718-666-8097 for more information",

Drako is a loving boy who could use some polishing up on his manners. When Drako gets excited he tends to be very mouthy and nibbly with his people, often in an attempt to play. \n\nDrako will need a patient owner with breed experience in order to allow him to properly decompress and learn his manners. Due to his size and energy level, we are looking for Drako's forever family to have no kids under the age of 12. He was previously cat tested and did well, however if his potential family does have a kitty we will cat test him again. As for doggy siblings, this would be on a meet and greet basis at the shelter. \n\nIf interested in adopting Drako, please fill out an application at www.lebanonhumane.org",

YET! I am working hard daily to allow my walker space to walk. See I like to be close, personal space is not something I am familiar with.\n\nI am recommended for a physically fenced-in yard and may require it pending applicants previous experience, location and other plans of containment. I am very energetic and would do well with an active person, couple or family, but I would prefer to not be in a busy household. Children should be at least 8-10 years or older. (no apartments)\n\nI am not a small dog. I weighed 45lbs when I arrived and have added a few. I am powerful for my size and can jump very high. \n\nI may be okay with another dog pending a meet and greet, but I have not been tested with cats at this time.\n\nI am a very sweet boy, and I will make a great companion for right situation.",

            "description": "Howdy my name is Justine. I am a 2 year old Chihuahua / Mini Pin mix. I weigh 13 lbs. & you can say I\u2019m all legs.\n\nSome of my favorite things are playing with toys, treats & sitting in your lap. I get along with other dogs but my preference is small dogs. I do great riding in the car. I enjoy wearing doggy clothes especially a warm sweater when its cold outside. I get excited to go on walks.\n\nWhen I first meet new people I am shy but I warm up quickly. I\u2019m good around older kids & a little nervous around littles. I am also cat friendly I mostly just ignore them.\n\nI enjoy spending time outside when others are out with me (my canine friends or my humans). I\u2019m not overly chatty but it\u2019s just too tempting when other dogs start barking that I must join in. Playing chase is so much fun for me. I also enjoy playing fetch.\n\nAt night my favorite place to sleep is in your bed anywhere you\u2019ll let me. When it\u2019s cold I like to burrow underneath a blanket. Where I am not good sleeping is in a crate. I will keep the entire house awake.\n\nI am crate, leash & potty trained. My foster home has a doggy door so I may require some patience as I adjust to a home without a doggy door since I\u2019ve become accustomed to letting myself out to go potty whenever I need to go. Oh, my foster mom said I must tell you that I\u2019m not a fan of the crate thing. I am quiet while you are gone but if you are home & I\u2019m crated I will let you know all about it. \n\nI am spayed, up to date on vaccinations, HW negative, current on HW preventative and micro chipped. My adoption fee is $175.   \n\nIf you would like to adopt Justine and make her a part of your family, please contact ForeverYoursOKC@gmail.com.",

Since I\u2019m from Massachusetts I\u2019m WICKED SMAHHT so I already know sit, down, stay, off, paw, other paw, catch, drop it, fetch, wait, take it. I\u2019m also pretty good on leash.  I love to learn so just teach more me please. I enjoy some zoomies and playing in the backyard but my favorite activity is going for walks and outdoor adventures. I\u2019m really good at agility too. \n\nI have shown some resource guarding around my food bowl and some favorite toys and bones, but my foster mom has lots of ways to safely take things from me with no issues, for example, just toss some kibble when you pick up my food bowl.  As a precaution, I need to go to a home with no young children. I can live with a confident 4 legged female dog or I\u2019m also happy being the only dog. I\u2019m confident and not to brag, but I\u2019m handsome too.  Who\u2019s ready for me cause I\u2019m ready for my fur-ever home!!\n\nAll dogs are up to date on vaccines, heartworm tested, microchipped and spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Please visit www.bulliedbreedsrescue.org for adoption policies and adoption application. The adoption application is the first step to be considered: http://bulliedbreedsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-application/",

Super affectionate and not a big barker.  She does have a tendency to rub her head on your legs and feet when you're walking so older people need to be aware of that.  We are accepting applications.

Graham goes in willing for mealtime but never goes in on his own at other times.\n\nHouse trained: Yes, Foster has a doggy door, Graham takes care of this himself. If the adopter does not have a doggy door, there may be a training period where the human learns Graham's signals.\n\nGood with dogs: yes\n\nGood with cats: no\n\nGood with kids: not likely due to his age, he has not been around children while in foster care.\n\nRequires Fence: yes, requires a physical fence\n\nUpdate 11/30:\nSweet Graham's wish as Christmas approaches is for a forever home. He is a delightful companion who would enjoy having his very own person. He's great with other dogs but his real focus is on YOU. \nYou may remember Graham's story: 8 years tied to a tree which led to arthritis in his elbows, spine and hips. While many of us are eager to put the year 2020 behind us, it has been the best year of Graham's life! OESR rescued him and has been most generous in giving him the care he needs to become active and, by appearances, pain free. \nNo more slow starts for Graham in the morning! He is up and ready to go! His favorite past time is goose \"hunting\" in a nearby park, followed by breakfast and a good nap. If I'm cooking, he naps in front of the refrigerator, If I'm at my desk, he's asleep on my foot (best way to monitor any potential activity that might mean food or an outing). We go to the woods or other parks in the afternoon to squirrel \"hunt\". \n\nGraham is all about hanging out with his person or chasing anything that moves (no homes with cats please).   Due to his structural problems, Graham is quite content with walks of a tenth to a quarter of a mile a couple of times a day.  He'd be the perfect companion for a retired senior who wants an adoring pal. When he does occasionally go out in the fenced yard, he stalks the squirrels and bunnies. In pleasant weather he likes to nap under the bird feeder but is uninterested in anything more than watching the song birds. Because his life before rescue was so limited, he deserves to live the rest of it with as much stimulation and freedom to do fun doggy things as is possible.\n\nGraham needs a very special home: \n1- no more than one step (going down steps would hurt his elbows)\n2 - an adopter able to lift him in and out of the car. Like going down steps, it would be too painful for his elbows to step down on them. His ideal weight should be about 40 pounds. \n3 - fenced yard (because he won't poop when on leash). I have a doggy door so he takes care of business himself. \n4 - an adopter willing to take him on short interesting walks (under one half mile b/c longer makes his left leg quiver), preferably where there are novel smells. Walking on ground rather than pavement is easier on his joints. According to the shelter, Graham spent 8 years tied to a tree. He is entitled to live out his days in an environment rich in scents, gentle experiences and love.\n5 - someone committed to continuing Graham's pain management program. He takes several supplements that are essential to supporting bone and tissue. He also receives a NSAID, gabapentin, weekly laser treatments and monthly Adequan injections (which I give to keep cost down). Anyone applying as Graham's forever home needs to know that this regimen costs about $260/month and they need to commit to paying this for the next several years. \n\n",

When Hunk arrived at our shelter he was heartworm positive and had a large head wound that required surgery. He has since recovered from the head trauma which has left him with a scar on his forehead. But we think it gives this handsome hunk some character! Hunk is still going through heartworm treatment. He will have to remain on crate rest until February 4th. After that his treatment is completed except for his heartworm re-test. Because Hunk is heartworm positive and on crate rest, we have not done any dog or cat testing because he needs to be kept calm. We always recommend a meet and greet with any resident dogs. We have no information on how Hunk behaves around children. We would recommend a meet and greet with any children in the household or children that visit often, such as grandkids. Please call for more information or to make an appointment to meet Hunk. (Updated 1/30/21).",

            "description": "Cato is a 12 year old male mixed breed. He weighs 65 pounds. He is still an active boy for his age. Unfortunately, Cato has been in and out of the shelter several times. Often for issues out of his control such as landlord or HOA restrictions. From our time with Cato and input from previous homes we have learned quite a bit about him. Cato can be friendly with other dogs although he is very fond of humping and needs a dog friend or friends that can give him appropriate corrections when they've had enough. Dogs that are not fond of being humped or that are prone to overcorrections may not make good dog friends for Cato. We always recommend a meet and greet with any resident dogs. If you are unsure about your pup's feelings on this type of play, our staff can help by supervising a meet and greet and explaining the behaviors they observe. Cato can not be in a home with cats including feral cats that may go in and out of the yard. Cato has been around children of varying ages and the only complaint we have received is that he can be a little rambunctious for smaller children, especially due to his size. We always recommend a meet and greet with any children in the household or children that visit often, such as grandkids. Please call for more information or to make an appointment to meet Cato.

            "description": "Astra is a 1 year old male mixed breed. He weighs 54 pounds. He is a very energetic young man. In his original household Astra lived with two large dogs that were close to his age. One was a male and one was a female. He was briefly adopted during which he was introduced to a small dog that was visiting the household. Astra was not polite to the visiting small dog. We would recommend a meet and greet with any resident dogs. At the shelter and while on leash, Astra met a dog-friendly cat and he was extremely focused on the cat. At this time we don't believe Astra would do well living with cats. We have no information on how Astra behaves around children. We would recommend a meet and greet with any children in the household or children that visit often, such as grandkids. Please call for more information or to make an appointment to meet Astra.

They are six months old as of early January, about 35 lbs and just great pups in search of active, loving and responsible homes.\nADOPTION FEES Dogs & Puppies.....$100.00. This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more.\nThe first step to do an adoption is to do our Adoption Application here: https://www.elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html\nIMPORTANT - we respond to your emailed applications and queries via email back to you. Please make sure you have either added our email (hselco@bellsouth.net) to your contact list or that you routinely check your SPAM folder for our response just to be safe. If we do not receive a timely response we simply move on to another applicant.\nYes, there are sometimes exceptions to our normal fee for older dogs or special cases. Some of our pets have also been lovingly sponsored by caring people and we will let the approved adopter know about that at the point of adoption. Visit our Website at: http://www.elmorehumane.org The staff would also like to remind you that for faster response to inquiries about adoptable animals to have the animals ID#, name & description. This way your questions will be answered in a timely manner.\nAll pet adoption websites & our shelter management software require that we choose a primary and/or secondary breed for our dogs. While our staff is quite breed knowledgeable, in many cases we are truly making our best guesses as to their breed(s) based on many factors but cannot promise that what we have said is accurate. So taking into account your own parameters for things such as size, coat care, activity level, etc please come and get to know our dog(s) as individuals to see if their personalities and yours are a forever match.\nPhone: (334) 567-3377 Fax: (334) 567-8774 E-mail: hselco@bellsouth.net",

Eli is probably about 1.5 years old, neutered, around 60 lbs and up to date on shots. When Furever Friends first rescued Eli, he was recuperating from an old leg injury which he has almost fully recuperated from. He doesn't miss a beat in playing with his dog buddies! Please consider adding this beautiful boy to your family! He and his big smile will love your furever!",

Blitzen has lived all his life as an only pet and has not learnt how to behave with other animals.\nHis owner is gravely ill and had to surrender him. Blitzen is sad and confused, due to his owner's long illness, he was not exposed to many activities, and he really needs to move on with someone who understands the breed, is ready to spend a lot of time with him and give him lots of love and attention. He is currently on medication for anxiety/separation anxiety and will need a person or family who has a lot of time for him. Preferably a retired person or someone working from home. Aside from being absolutely stunning he is an affectionate snuggle bug, good on a leash, housetrained and not at all aggressive\nBlitzen loves to play ball and to swim, he is learning new skills very fast. Blitzen is healthy, up to date on all vaccines and getting neutered and microchipped. He weighs 110 lbs, \nTo adopt or foster, please submit a fully completed application on our website at www.nalasrescue.org/adoption-application.\nWe are located in Palm City, FL and we adopt mostly in a 50 miles radius. However, for this particular case, we would like to adopt him out in Martin, St Lucie or North palm Beach County. We always do home visit, and personalized met and greet, to insure that your new companion will be a great match for your family.\n\n\n",

If you would like to meet me, please contact my foster at (928) 527-1459.\n\nBonus Perks of Adopting a Foster Dog:\n- Extra time spent working on potty training!\n- Insider info, like how I do being home alone and what I'm like at night!\n- Extra training time given to house manners, like greeting visitors!\n- My foster can give you tips on all my favorite things and least favorite things!",

He would do well as an only dog or with one other mild mannered female. He's about 10 months old and plays well kids but we do suggest older children because he's heavy and rambunctious and would knock small children down without meaning to. He's not house broken but is working on getting the hang of it. He's got some separation anxiety and needs a sturdy place to stay while he's alone or an owner that's home a lot. With some patience and crate training he'd be a wonderful pet.",

He would do best with older kids due to his size.  Victor is the sweetest boy! His groomer said he was the most well behaved boy she has ever bathed!!! He likes other dogs but can be an only dog. Everyone LOVES Victor!! He would do best as a COUNTRY BOY!!!!\n\n All of our Wigglers are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, hw tested/treated, and on preventatives. Most of our adoptable dogs need fenced in yards or an exercise regimen. We require proof spanning 3 consistent years of HW preventatives for already owned pets, UTD on shots, and spay/neuter in order to adopt. Please read their description above closely. Our adoption fee is $350. For an application to foster or adopt send us your number and email address in a message.",

They think I was hit by a car, possibly more than once. But after a few months, I\u2019m on the mend and back to running and playing! \n\nMy vets think I\u2019m about a year and a half old. Which means I still have some puppy energy\u2026especially in the mornings. Thankfully, I love enrichment activities like playing with balls and foraging. I also have a foster brother that loves to run and play tag with me in the back yard, and would do best if my forever family had another dog and a yard because I really love spending time outside.  But no kitties though\u2026I am reactive. \n\nI have pretty good manners for only being off the streets a few months. I know to go potty outside. And how to sit. I will also sit and wait for my meals, though sometimes still forget that one! My foster family has also taught me to go to my \u201cplace\u201d during mealtimes so I\u2019m not begging at the table. \n\nI\u2019m getting more comfortable spending time in my crate when my fosters leave, but I can have a little separation anxiety at times since they\u2019re home so much right now. Giving me something to work on when they\u2019re leaving really helps though! I also may need a little more leash training, but I love going for walks! Lastly, I\u2019m a bit of a talker when you aren\u2019t paying attention to me. But otherwise I don\u2019t really bark.  \n\nI have so much love to give. And when I\u2019m not playing, my favorite place is next to you and your kids on the couch. I\u2019m a GREAT snuggler! Who\u2019s ready to give me a forever home?",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Alma is a young pit bull mix gal who came to us from the city pound. She currently weighs around 50 pounds and is around 2 years old. She is a very friendly girl who loves people and gets very excited when she meets them. She will definitely need exercise and basic training. She's a good girl and does have a lot of potential. She has been vet checked and spayed and her fee is $125.\n\nWe do think that Alma would do best in a home without young kids. She does need a somewhat calm home without a lot of people visiting and coming in and out. An experienced owner who can provide her with calm and consistent positive reinforcement training would be best. Alma does need to be the only pet in the home.\n\nNOTE: We are not open to the public. Adoptions are done via private appointment once an application has been completed and approved. An application can be submitted at our website, mchs.rescuegroups.org.\n\nWe are located at 101 22nd St. SE in Austin, right next to the airport. It's exit 180B off of I-90, right off of 218 South.\n\nWe do require that potential adopters be at least 21 years old and that any resident dogs be up to date on vaccinations, heartworm testing/preventative, and spayed or neutered.",

She looks to be  a Boxer mix, with a huge heart, lots of energy, and would love to find her human family\n She is spayed, current on vaccinations, current on heartworm & flea prevention, and tested negative for heartworms. She is about four years old and 93 pounds of pure beauty. \nShe would do best in a home with at least one canine sibling and a securely fenced yard to run and play in. She walks well on a leash, is not food or food aggressive and shares her space in her foster home with the other dogs like the sweet lady she is. \n She is great with children, good with cats, and great with other dogs. Please email: jlopez42782@gmail.com if you are interested in adopting the girl. Adoption fee is $150.00.\n We do require all current pets to be spay/neutered, current on vaccinations and of course a history of consistent heartworm prevention. We do a vet check to confirm all this.\nAll yards must have a securely attached fence. We do adopt out of the area as long as one of our volunteers is available to do the transport.",

He loves to go on walks and just lounge around with people he loves. Zeus has no food aggression issues nor any toy possession issues but would do best in a home without any children. He is dog tolerant and an interaction would be necessary if need be. Zeus will be neutered, vaccinated and microchipped when he leaves the shelter.",

Well, when you are as nice a dog as Bristol then you do deserve the best. Bristol is a bundle of curiosity and affection and she is an adorable 40# Dalmatian Wannabe. Bristol loves it when her belly is rubbed, laying quietly with her legs straight in the air. How cute!! She is generally fine with the foster dogs, but she does prefer the boy dogs. Probably best with only male dogs, although she can be okay with quiet female dogs. On walks she does love to meet new dogs coming along. The neighborhood girls (8-11 yrs) are her favorite young people and they love her too. Her fun time is going to the woods to run. She does have a naturally high prey drive when it comes to wildlife critters and with cats she is unknown. Bristol walks well on the leash and our queen prefers fluffy beds but all she really wants is to be with \"mom\". Bristol is a very smart girl with PERFECT house manners. She is not a dog toy fanatic and she does not chew what she shouldn't, but she does love tennis balls and will return with them! Our girl is vocal about things outside, as nothing gets by her guarding instinct. One hind leg was injured before we met Bristol but the vet said that it is healed now and it works just fine. Bristol sits for meals or whatever she might want. Good girl! For more information, contact Chris at dalpal@rocketmail.com. Adoption $300. If interested in this dog, please go to www.dalmatianrescueco.org and submit an application for adoption. Under Adoptions, please read our adoption policy. We must have an application before we can begin the adoption process and each dog does have foster contact listed.",

Gemma was recently rescued from a puppy mill in Pennsylvania. Gemma weighs about 12 pounds.\n\nShe\u2019s a very sweet girl who is a bit timid in new situations particularly around loud sounds. She does well with other dogs and will do best in a home where there is another dog to help her feel safe. She will require a secure fenced in yard and a home with no young kids. She\u2019s great with the other dogs in her foster home and intrigued with the cat, but doesn\u2019t bother it. She\u2019s learning to play with toys good with older kids.\n\nGemma is currently fostering in eastern PA.\n\nWe currently adopt in the states of NY, NJ, Eastern PA, DE, and some areas in MD. We can not accept applications from other states at this time.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out our adoption application which you can find on our website at www.dutchcountryanimalrescue.org/adopt.html \n\nOur adoption fees are on our application.\n\nAll of our rescues are spayed/neutered, up to date on rabies and DHPP, heartworm tested, treated for worms and fleas and most are microchipped.\n\nWe are not a shelter, we are 100% volunteer public charity. All of our dogs are in foster homes until they are adopted. Since we are not a shelter, we do not receive government funding. We are a public charity that relies solely on funds through our adoption fee, fundraisers, and private donations. Since we are 100% volunteer based, all funds collected go directly towards the rescue and vet costs of our dogs.\n\nWe take each rescue personally and spend a lot of effort trying to match the right dog to the right family. Thank you for considering one of our rescued dogs.",
