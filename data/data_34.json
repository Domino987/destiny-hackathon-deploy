She's very quiet and loves humans of all sizes and ages. Hippie likes chew toys, but really loves stuffies and is very careful to make sure she is gentle with them so they last longer.  She likes to go on walks around the neighborhood, but would skip them if it's raining too hard and would rather just snuggle.  She's house & crate trained and has learned sit, stay, lay down, shake, and how to stay while her paws are wiped.  Hippie is a great road tripper and loves to go exploring new places. Hippie is still learning recall and should not be off-leash until she gets the hang of it. She's very gentle with young children and would probably love to have a human sibling. She has no history with cats. She has no issues with fireworks or loud noises, and loves to be in the room if music is playing.  She does have some separation anxiety, but is a great candidate for an office dog.",

            "description": "??Please read entire biography ??\n\nPaco is an 8yr male neuter chi/jack russell mix. Through no fault of his own he is up for adoption. He is up to date on vaccines, heartworm neg, on hw preventative and flea/tick treatment.\nPaco is house trained .  He gets along very well with other dogs.  He enjoys running around the fenced yard and going on walks.  He likes sitting on your lap and getting belly rubs.  He's a happy little guy and loves to play with toys.  He is just the cutest when he poses \"puppy butt in the air\" and races around in circles tail wagging a mile a minute.\nNow for the challenging part Paco is his own worst enemy when it comes to meeting new people.  He likes to .... \"talk alot of smack\" and is quite intimidating.  He growls, barks, snarls and gladly shows his teeth.  He continues fiercely carrying on when being picked up until he really gets to know you. Once that happens he'll sit and as you go to lift him he'll do the dog equivalent of a toddler with arms up to be lifted (not lifting by front legs of course). His crate is his safe zone and he will defend it when inside.  He guards his toys unless he wants you to play with him.  Then he brings the toy to you and let's you know play time is about to commence.  He loves burrowing under your covers and is a great snuggler.  The problem is he wants to cuddle up but doesn't want to be petted.  Again the whole growling, snarling routine.  We were told he is very uncomfortable with children so an adult only home is required.  He has what the vet believes is a flea allergy so needs to be on a flea treatment every month.\nI've fostered him for approximately a month.  He has NEVER bitten me regardless of what I have done and his intimidation technique.  He doesn't like his toes touched or nails trimmed which is certainly not rare in dogs so I strongly recommend a groomer with a muzzle as the best idea.\nWe're not sure where his bad attitude comes from.  He could be one of the little dogs that owners let get away with everything, with no structure and this is how they turn out.  Leaning over him makes him flinch and shy away so half squatting to pick him up is the way to go about it.  He has gotten so much better in the time he's been been here but still with the threat displays if you're trying to do something he's not 100% sure of.  He's fostered with 9 other dogs so a small part of the growling/snarling may be because he's worried the others will gang up on him in a perceived weak position.  I say a small part because he acts badly away from the other dogs also.\nPaco really is a cute little guy who I feel will continue to improve in his attitude as he gets more comfortable.  He needs a confident and patient person to give him a chance to reach his true potential.  He needs to learn he doesn't call all the shots slowly and with empathy.",

            "description": "We are so glad we could get Yula the medical care she needed! Now it's time to find her the adopter she deserves! Yula is a young adult hound mix who is about 2 years old and weighs 28-30 pounds. Yula was running loose with an injured back leg. No one claimed her so she came to us to get the vet are she needed. Yula's backleg could not be saved and was amputated. Yula barely seemed to notice! She has recovered well and it hardly slows her down! \n\nYula is house trained and has good indoor manners. Her very favorite thing is to lounge and cuddle with her foster mom. She is very affectionate and bonds deeply to her person. Yula has not been exposed to other dogs in her foster home but is likely to be fine with proper introductions. \n\nAugusta Dog Adoptions is an all- volunteer, foster- based rescue. We take applications online and are scheduling individual adoptions in the Waynesboro, VA area during the pandemic.  A $175.00 adoption fee ($300 for puppies under 6 months old) helps us take care of all the dogs we rescue. All dogs are spayed/neutered, tested for heartworm and tick borne diseases (if old enough), microchipped, and vaccinated for rabies (if old enough), distemper/parvo and bordetella. They are also treated for internal and external parasites. Many dogs also receive extensive medical care such as dental work and major surgeries. For more information and to apply to adopt, please visit www.augustadogadoptions.org",

We've witnessed this first hand as he whines to be let out of his confinement just to engage and be in the room. Not a high energy guy, but with a \"Beagle Nose for scents, Forrest walks so great on a leash, pausing to give the air a sniff and see what's up that tree.\n\nSo why is Forrest being confined? You'd never know it now, but when we got him out of the Mesquite Shelter it was because he'd been brought in as a stray after being hit by a car. Unable to walk or even stand; Forrest had a broken pelvis and was in a great deal of pain. Without the aid of a rescue, he'd be just another statistic at the shelter. We were glad to step up for this boy and get him the medical attention he needed and the time to heal. His confinement was to ensure he didn't do too much while his body was on the mend, and today he limps occasional on his right rear leg but is so joyful and happy to be feeling better, it's hard to even notice. Due to the nature of this injury, his neuter will be delayed until late March of 2020, but it will get done!\n\nHe'd love a back yard to browse around in and a playmate to go with it, but his activity level will need to be closely monitored until he's reached full recovery of that injury.",

Don't let that sweet face fool you--he can be crafty in looking for spaces to escape so a fenced yard for him would be preferable. This gem of a dog is heartworm positive, however that shouldn't stop you from meeting him.  Our staff can speak to you about ways we can help!

Tate is an alpha male Dane. \n\nTate will require an experienced Deaf Dane owner that can effectively manage a strong Alpha wannabe! No children under 15 for Tate. We are currently working though some of Tate\u2019s behaviors with our trainer. He will be fully vetted, vaccinated and microchipped. \n\nWe will require Tate to be in basic obedience training within 15 days of adoption.  Basic obedience training is a great opportunity for Tate to bond with his new family, learn new commands and reinforce good manners.  \n\nFor more information about our adoption process and an application please visit www.whitekissesgreatdanerescue.com",

All you have to do is fill out an application on our website: acadianaanimalaid.org/adopt/dog-adoption/application \n\nOur adoption fee is $225 for puppies and $205 for adults . All AAA dogs are up to date on all vaccinations, spayed or neutered, on heartworm preventative, and microchipped. \n\nDogs are individuals -- The shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We encourage you to select your new companion by considering each dog's individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on a breed label that is only a guess.",

She currently lives in a foster home with kids, another dog, and a cat. Livi is an energetic puppy still, but not a \u201cbounce off the walls\u201d type. She would benefit greatly from consistency and training to help her reach full good girl potential. To add this cute girl to your family, apply to adopt at ITVrescue.org.\n\nAll of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heartworm tested and treated if necessary.\n\nPlease realize that many of our animals are kept in foster homes. Please complete an adoption application at http://itvrescue.org/adoption-application/ in order to meet with one of our animals. There is no obligation in completing the application, but it helps us find an animal that is most appropriate for your family.  The ITV Rescue Center is open Tuesdays 12-5; Wednesdays 12-7; Thursdays 12-5; Fridays 12-5 and Saturdays 10-5.  The Rescue Center is located at 1417 N. Stockwell Road.  You are welcome to come to our rescue center during open hours to see all of our great adoptable animals. Thank you for your interest in our animals!\n\nNOTE: Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

He is eating well & gaining weight and loves to play with toys and his fur siblings.  \n\nEdward is a sweet and happy dog that will make a wonderful addition to a family who is ready to open their hearts to a senior Dane. He will be fully vetted, vaccinated and microchipped prior to adoption.\n\nWe will require Edward to be in basic obedience training within 30 days of adoption. Basic obedience training is a great opportunity for Edward to bond with his new family, learn new commands and reinforce good manners.  \n\nFor more information about our adoption process and an application please visit www.whitekissesgreatdanerescue.com/adopt\n",

He loves his people.  \nHe loves to give kisses and and grunts when he receives attention. He can snore up a storm.  Major H. learns commands quickly.\n\nMajor H. is really hoping for a home of his own soon.  Because his foster family has so many dogs and he does not do well with that, he has to hang out in a separate area of the house all the time. That's no way  to live for a fellow that loves people so much long term. \n\nMr. Handsome  walks lovely in forests or quiet side streets, but becomes difficult to manage in busy streets with dogs and children on scooters in hot pursuit.\n\nSo what does Major H.need?  A dog savvy owner that isn't perturbed when he joyfully wants to bounce up to say hello.. (we keep working on staying down) and that has a safely fenced back yard away from busy life and other dogs.  Preferably this young man would love  to live a country life with a person that he can adore.   Hugo's adoption donation is sponsored by his current foster family.. for a home that feels they can give this boy a chance.\n\nHugo crates well. \n\nIf interested in adopting please fill out our no obligation online application at www.puppypawsrescue.org \n\nNote: Our rescue requires that all adopter's current and prior animals are up-to-date on vaccinations (DHLPP & Rabies)  and preventatives (heartworm and flea and tick), unless there is a medical reason not allowing it. All animals in your household should be spayed or neutered unless medically indicated that they should not be or are currently still too young.",

She is quite playful; she loves wrestling with other dogs and chewing on her squeaker toys. She is also a sweetheart who likes to hangout and cuddle with her foster mom in her down time. Payton is a more curious and adventurous puppy. She is working on puppy pad and crate training but is not at 100% yet. She would love to have another doggy playmate and doesn\u2019t seem to mind cats. Payton would do best in a home with older kids (10+) because she can get a little feisty when she is in play mode. She will be a great addition to a family who will give her the socialization and training all puppies need.\nPACA is a foster based rescue with no shelter to view our dogs. We have temporarily stopped all our public adoption events due to COVID-19, however we are still placing dog into loving homes by private appointment with approved applications.\n\nCompleted applications will be given to the foster to coordinate meetings as everyone feels comfortable. This application helps us get to know you and your family a little better so we can find the perfect match! Application are found here:\nhttp://www.nmpaca.org/images/pdf_files/PACA_Adoption_Application.pdf\nPlease email completed applications to pacadogs@aol.com\n\nAll our animals are spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for tic born illness and heartworm prior to adoption. Our fee is $175.\n\n",

            "description": "This big dude is Enzo! Enzo came to us with his brother Killean. P Our friends at PETA rescued them from a life of neglect. Enzo lived all his young life in an outdoor pen. When we received him he was covered in mud, baring wounds, no manners, under socialized and heartworm positive. All signs of living outside without proper love and care. Since arriving here with his brother, Enzo has started to learn about the finer things in life. Such as medical treatment, walking on a leash ,simply receiving a badly needed bath and human love and affection.Enzo is a big puppy that needs, commitment, patience, consistency and love. He would benefit from a canine friend who can tolerate his puppy antics and pave the way for him. The folks who rescued him have so graciously sponsored his $780.00 heartworm treatment. His new family will only need to keep the big beast calm during treatment. When not attended Enzo should be crated. He is not use to living in the comforts of a home. His new family will have to be ready to teach him how to be a loved member of a family. Enzo has never lived with children. this big guy can easily knock a small child over with force, not meaning to of course. We are requiring that any children in the home be 12 years and over. After HW treatment Enzo will need and active life style. He is a mix of three very high energy dogs ( Lab, GSD Aussie). Enzo would love a home with a huge fenced yard, After he is medically cleared he wants to celebrate being heartworm free with a giant case of zoomies in his new home.If you are interested in meeting this hunk please ask today.",

However we can tell you that she was not cared for properly. Our sweet Zoey has heartworm disease. Luckily she is here with us and she will be treated. Her new family will need to pay for her treatment. It is a very small price to pay, when giving the gift of life. Heartworm disease can be deadly going untreated. Zoey has not been socialized around the little ones, so any children in the home should be at least 10 years of age or older. Zoey is very deserving of a family who will love and care for her through the rest of her life. Zoey dreams of blue skies, grassy hills, a comfy couch, being heartworm free, romps around the fields and humans that love her to no end. Will you make her dreams come true? Please ask to meet Zoey today.",

Not a mean bone in her body but she is very unsure of things and is just a nervous little girl so she would do best without young children and in a quiet household.

My foster mom tells me all the time how much she loves my one blue eye and my one brown eye. I am a chill, laid back gal. I spend a lit of times sprawled out napping on the sofa with my humans or soaking up the sun. I am quiet and alert. I prefer a home where I can get lots of love and attention from my humans. I am described as dainty and gentle. My foster sister and I like to chase each other around the yard and wrestle too. My foster mom describes me as the perfect dog. I am house trained, I enjoy car rides and I am good around children. You can say I get attached pretty quickly. If you'd like to meet me, please complete an adoption application at http://www.crossedpawsanimalhaven.org/cpah-adoption-application.html. My adoption fee is $300 which includes spay, microchip, HW tested negative on monthly preventative while in foster care and current on vaccinations.",

            "description": "Roscoe is a 7 mo. old dachshund/basset hound mix and a bundle of fun! \nHis family had to surrender him due to these trying times. He is neutered and up to date on all of his shots. He is too young for a heart worm test at this time. Roscoe is micro chipped. \nWe understand that his Mom was a dachshund and Daddy unknown.  We suspect some Basset hound due to his precious out turned kankles. He might have a touch of a Baby Yoda in his very expressive ears. \nHe is 30lbs. Long and low. He is a fabulous family pet. Funny and smart. He hits the bells on the door to go out. He doesn\u2019t love the kennel. Wanting to be a lap dog he follows his hoomans with great dedication! \nRoscoe is playful with dogs and children, cats unknown. He loves love and he loves to give it! He is a pure joy!\n\nPlease note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppy\u2019s breed or size potential. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

            "description": "Meet George - \n\nGeorge is a beautiful Doberman that turned 3 in October 2020. He gets complimented on his markings frequently when we go walking. George was rescued from a breeder/hoarder situation and was placed with his foster family at the beginning of December. He seems to have some minor loss of vision but he can see well enough to enjoy life. He bonded quickly with his foster mom, and has improved tremendously with meeting others in the past couple months. He is incredibly loving and sweet.  George knew from the beginning not to go potty in the house and is crate trained. His crate is his safe spot and initially he would go there when he needed down time. As he has gotten comfortable, he spends less time in the crate and seems happy to lay on his bed near us. He sleeps in his crate at bedtime and doesn\u2019t make a peep all night. His personality has been evolving as he becomes more confident. He has become very playful and more vocal, making a whining noise like he is talking to us. He has met a couple other dogs and we believe that he would do well in a house with another dog that could play with him, teach him, and give him confidence. George is smart, fast learner and eager to please. George would love a yard to play in.  He loves his walks and spends a lot of time sniffing everything. Due to George\u2019s past and compromised vision, he may startle easily with noises or fast movements.  He is continually getting more accustomed to living the pet life, and he is very appreciative of the comforts of his foster home.  A home with children over 16 that is willing to give George some time to adjust is recommended. Cats are an unknown.\nPACA is a foster based rescue with no shelter to view our dogs. We have temporarily stopped all our public adoption events due to COVID-19, however we are still placing dog into loving homes by private appointment with approved applications.\n\nCompleted applications will be given to the foster to coordinate meetings as everyone feels comfortable. This application helps us get to know you and your family a little better so we can find the perfect match!

A gentle natured soul, he is most happy with human companionship. He will enjoy joining you on walks that stick to the path (with the occasional sniffing of the \"roses\") and at the end of the day he will sit at your feet with his little head perched on the edge of the couch. He isn't too fond of other dogs and would rather have all of the love and attention to himself. Who is ready for some love in their life?\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers cannot guarantee that our dogs won't have accidents in their new home, even if they are fully house broken in their current foster home as they have to adjust to new environment, routine, and schedule. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention (while in our care), monthly flea/tick prevention, and our transport costs. As part of the adoption agreement, adopters agree to get the pup spayed/neutered by 6 months of age. K-9 Lifesavers do not cover the cost of spay/neuter for puppies 6 months and younger.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nHelp Save Lives!

He loves to be around people and is\ngood natured with his household. He loves playing fetch, tug of war, car rides and going on\nlong walks. He likes cuddling on the couch while watching TV or sitting on your lap while you read. He loves a seat by the window so he can watch people in the neighborhood. Shane is highly intelligent and easily learns new things. While with us he quickly learned to sit, shake, lay down and stay. His favorite chore is bringing in the Sunday newspaper. He also figured out that we only let him on the couch in the family room, a rule he easily follows. When he is uncomfortable he communicates it clearly. He has seen cats and taken an interest in them but has not met one up close. He does not mind being in his crate, but sometimes needs a bribe to go in it. Shane would fit in best as the only dog in the home and one that has older children. Available end of January for adoption once he finishes his heart worm treatment.\n\nWe were asked to help with dogs that were affected by Hurricane Laura. In Sulphur Louisiana, a very remote area between Lake Charles and the Texas border, there are lots of small rescues.\n2/2/21 5:36 PM",

            "description": "Cyrus is a beautiful and fluffy Akita mix that is fixed and estimated to be around 3 years old. He has Lyme's Disease but that doesn't slow him down. He should be in a household that doesn't have younger children under 13. This way the children know the boundaries especially with having this particular breed. He is friendly, affectionate, independent, and loves to play. He won't turn down treats and he knows sit, paw, stay, and down. He can be a little stubborn sometimes. He doesn't jump on people and walks well on the leash. Cyrus just finished obedience training so come and let him show you his tricks. He is good with cats and dogs, he was also in a house with a rat. You should not disturb him while he is sleeping, just like other dogs, because that will startle him and the outcome may not be a good one. He will nudge you when he needs to go outside. If you are interested you can call us to make an appointment for a visit @ 301-645-8181 and you can apply at humanesocietycc.org/adopt-a-dog.",

My name is Veneta and I am 7 months old! \n\nI have LOTS of energy and love to play with other dogs but I don\u2019t quite understand boundaries yet so I need a dog brother or sister who is very patient. I can intimidate small dogs because I want to play so bad and don\u2019t realize it can be intimidating! I haven\u2019t been around kids before, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019d love to play with them! But they need to be big enough that I won\u2019t knock them down while playing because I am still learning coordination and control over my body. I have a lot of energy so I\u2019d do best with a backyard to run around in and sticks to chew up! I love adventuring, so I make a great running and hiking buddy. \n\nWhen I am not playing outside or playing tug of war with my foster mom, I LOVE to snuggle. I\u2019ll curl up next to you while you watch t.v. or read a book. I am potty trained! When I go to new places, it takes me a little bit to remember my training but once I do, I almost never have accidents! I stay in my crate while my foster mom isn\u2019t home and I sleep in my crate at night... but occasionally I look extra cute and my foster mom lets me sleep with her:) \n\nI love everybody and have yet to meet a human who I\u2019m not excited to meet! I hope one of you will adopt me and show me lots of attention, love, and patience... and maybe even give me a few treats!\n\nI am up to date on shots, microchip and spayed for the adoption fee of $150. If interested in adopting me please email adoptions.spspca@gmail.com",

They  want to  do  what is  best  for  her, and  rehome  her  to  younger,  healthier  owners. They  can  keep  her  temporarily.\n\nBasil  is a 4 year  old  female  GSD mix.  She is up to date on vaccines and is spayed. \n\nBasil  is described as  friendly, loving  and  affectionate,  according to  her  owner. She is  used to  living in a  home.  She  does well  with  kids. . She's  over  the puppy  phase  and  would do  well in a  moderately  active  home.\n \nBasil  likes  other  dogs but  will  chase cats. \n\nShe is housebroken, leash  trained, and  has  gone  through  training.\n\nTo meet Basil,  please contact  chessone@charter.net directly, and let  them  know  you  are interested to  meet her.",

My eyes were swollen with the lids rolled in about three time, and my ears were full of infection and swollen shut. We started with lots of meds to reduce swelling and help with the infections. Then on 12/3, I had entropion surgery to fix my eyes and was neutered at the same time. I also had a lump on my head and a skin tag on my eyelid removed. I am recovering well at my Foster home and will be ready for adoption soon.\n\nI'm a love bug and like to be close to my people. I've made some new Pei friends here at my foster home - Muffy and Finn!",

Every night Lena hops on my bed and curls up right next to my chest. She loves being held and will gently nudge her head toward you until you pet her. She has a soft bite and sometimes she will try to put her mouth over your hand if she doesn't have a toy in her mouth. All of her toys from the shelter are still perfectly intact even though she spends hours of the day chewing on them. If we are watching tv or playing video games she's usually chewing on a toy on the couch next to you. Lastly, when she gets anxious from hearing another dog or too excited from meeting people, we've found that she relaxes when you pick her up and hold her like a baby. She's a sweet dog and very lovable!\" -Lena's foster parent",

            "description": "Roscoe George now known as Jasper is a stunning 5 year old Great Pyrenees weighing a little over 100 lbs.  He loves to be groomed, brushed and given pampering.  He does very good when clipping his toenails for his routine pedicure.  He loves kisses and hugs and will let you pet and rub on him all day long!   \n\nThis precious guy has lived a very rough life where he was rescued in Louisiana. His life prior to coming to CAFA rescue involved him being chained to a tree since he was a puppy with no shelter during all weather conditions (rain, cold, sleet, thunderstorms).  This poor guy had to endure it all alone and nothing to protect him from the elements. Roscoe was extremely emaciated, severe ear infection and strong heart worm positive when we took him.  He trust people unless you are wearing a hat which we believe triggers something from his past.  He seems to become uneasy at night and a bit unsure at times.  Fast movements tend to scare him and sometimes he seems to be uneasy especially at night.  He does not like loud noises such as piano playing, crowd noises from football games, sirens, loud construction noises or fast movements which are all things related to his past we believe.  \n\nWhat HE DOES LOVE is LONG naps, a nice meal, hugs and kisses, grooming, and a quiet household,  He is good with other dogs but will herd them as that is his breed.  Since he loves all the attention and TLC, we think he would be best in a home with no other dogs and his families only four legged canine love!  He is good with children and will allow them to brush and pet him but we feel he would be best in a home without children since he does not like fast movements and loud noises and busy households.  He  is also food aggressive so he needs to be fed separately because he was starved to death, tied to this tree forcing him to starve to death, is why he has these behaviors.  \n\nRoscoe likely lived with chronic ear infections, as his ear canals appear to have old scarring from repeat infections. In addition, he chewed on the chain that bound him to his tree causing his teeth to be very worn down and his canine teeth had some exposed pulp. Since he has been in New England, he has had fourteen teeth removed and is in much better and has a great new smile as you can see in his video.\n\nHe would love a quiet family with a big fenced yard to roam around. He wants cuddles, and would love a comfy doggie bed inside to cuddle and take those long naps he loves so much.  He will sit on command and is very proud of himself when he pleases you.\n\nRoscoe is a very special boy that will need a special home who understands his needs and quirks.  \n\nAdoption fees details:\u00a0\nPuppies - Adults $ 550, Seniors $375. These adoption rates include transport from Alexandria, Louisiana to designated New England adopter pick up locations and NE foster homes using either Rescue Road Trips, Pets LLC or CAFA Transport. If you do a search you will see that this is a very reasonable adoption fee and comparable to other rescues.\u00a0Adoption\u00a0fee breakdown:Adoption Fee: \u00a0 $ \u00a0365.00Transportation Fee: \u00a0$ 185.00MA and NH only--Quarantine fee if applicable: \u00a0$125.00\n\nMedical details:\nAll our dogs are altered (spayed or neutered), DHLPP, rabies, Bordetella, Heartworm tested with negative test results, microchipped, treated for parasites and on monthly heartworm and flea and tick prevention.

Available for a Meeting confirms the dog is in a NE Foster home and available for a meeting in the city state provided. \u00a0Most times our dogs get adopted before a foster home becomes available - and if so, they go straight to adopters home. Foster parents talk to adopters and feel confident that this will be a match before our dogs are transported up. Also if by some chance it is not a match we have a safety net in place as we ask that adopters to let us know that it is not a match and we direct you to take the dog to a foster home or boarding kennel once that is arranged. If necessary, we will ask you to foster the dog until a foster home can be arranged.\u00a0\nTransport details:Rescue Road Trips (rescueroadtrips.com), Pets LLC (petsllc.net) or CAFA Transport will deliver our precious pups on commercial rescue animal transport to designated locations. \u00a0The fee is 185.00 which IS INCLUDED in your adoption fee already.**Rescue Road Trips, was featured on The Today Show - view it at http://www.today.com/video/today/55034556#55034556\n\nMA and NH RESIDENTS:\nIf you are a Massachusetts or New Hampshire residence, an additional fee of $125.00 will apply due to State quarantine fee requirements. If the dog is in a foster home in MA or NH, this fee will be added in the adoption fee regardless of where the adopters home is located making the total adoption fee $675.00 for puppies and adults $500.00 for Seniors, otherwise the full adoption fee for all other states is $550.00 for puppies and adults and $375.00 for seniors.

She gets along with other dogs and very much enjoys walks. She was extremely timid when she arrived but has warmed up nicely. She is still somewhat scared of her own shadow but will not shy away. She is a barker and has quite a strong bark. She will alert you when necessary but stops quickly. She knows how to use a dog door and is potty trained. She would not do well in an apartment. She loves playing, especially outside. Is this cutie girl your forever girl? Her adoption fee is $250 Put in an application at www.eapl.com",

I'm a busy bee so I'd like a home where I can be playful and fun! If you think I'd be a good fit for you, please fill out an adoption application at www.al-van.org.",

A nice lady is currently fostering me and showing me the kindness of humans, so I'd like to find my very own family to give me that same kindness and love. I get along well with my feline roommates, as you can see. On walks I get excited when I see other dogs, but if you ask me to pay attention to you, I'll rein it in and be a good girl. Ideally, I'd love to find a home with people who are familiar with fearful dogs like me, understand I will need some time before I feel comfortable enough to come out of my shell and show my sweet and silly side. I really like receiving positive reinforcement as feedback; I learn and trust people more quickly that way!  I really love snuggling with my people curled up next to them on the sofa or bed. I'm house trained and pretty chill indoors. \n\nIf you're interested in Teague, please email us at: adopt@gigis.org. She is current on vaccinations, microchipped and spayed. She's rated PG-15, good with cats, and will probably be fine with other dogs through proper introductions. She is currently in foster care and doing very well.",

As long as the pet is viewable, we are accepting applications. No matter the outcome, we will email all applicants once the dog has been adopted. Thank you for your understanding.\n\n**\nHello all, my name is Milo and I\u2019m a 1.5 year old 50 lb. Shar Pei/Lab mix. When I was taken in by my foster mom, I was really scared. I would pee if anyone raised their voice for any reason and would cry in my cage at night. It was tough on me! But with a lot of love and patience, my foster mom has brought me out of that shell and I am now confident and happy.\n\nI live with 2 human siblings and one 4-legged brother and I love them all! I love to investigate the back yard when I\u2019m allowed, and I love my chew toys and stuffed animals, but for the most part I like to just chill with my foster family.\n\nMy foster mom calls me Mellow Milo because it fits me perfectly, just like my sweet droopy face! I mean you can\u2019t go wrong with me, so how bout it?! Not to mention, I'm crate trained and house trained, too. \n\nI am up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, heartworm negative, and neutered. \nMy adoption fee is $200?",

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please download and complete an Adoption Questionnaire from our website and email Michelle at mhunt@k-9lifesavers.org\nYou can learn about the adoption process and find a Word, PDF and ONLINE version of the questionnaire by visiting: http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/howtoadopt/.\nDog's Name: Denali\nEstimated Breed : American Bulldog Mix\nApproximate Age: 1 year\nApproximate Weight: approx. 35 lbs\nCurrently Living at: Boarding\nAdoption Fee: $375\nDOG'S DESCRIPTION\nDenali just loves people and laps up all the cuddles and affection he can get! He is very sweet but shy about new things, so will need a patient home to warm up to. He is friendly but will do best with submissive males and/or females. He would do best with an adult only home or children over 16 as he sudden movements can be a little too much for him. Unfortunately, he is heartworm positive. But don't let that scare you away from this loving boy! We will provide his treatment and he will be a great addition to one lucky loving family!\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

I\u2019m an approximately 2-year-old American Eskimo mix who will not give you the cold shoulder.\u00a0In fact, I love nothing better than nonstop pets on my super-soft, dazzling white coat.\u00a0At 19 pounds, I'm just the right weight to keep your lap toasty warm on frosty nights.\u00a0Fair warning though, I do take a beat or two to warm up to people\u2026hey, you can't go around doling out eskimo kisses willy-nilly!\n\nI am housebroken as long as I am kept on a schedule. I don't do well in a crate but do okay if relegated to a room, like a kitchen with a baby gate \u2014 that way I can stretch my legs a bit. I\u2019m a good friend: I\u00a0get along well with my foster's dogs, respecting the older Chihuahua and playing chase and tug with the younger fluffy one.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI am not picky at all when it comes to food. Heck, after living on the streets of Chicago, getting regular meals of kibble is wonderful.\u00a0While I do okay on walks, I'm still leery of the harness and sort of jump around whenever my foster tries to put it on, but I am getting a bit better. I do pretty well in a car, either in a crate or clipped in with a seatbelt harness, to keep me safe.\n\nEven though the vet thinks I'm around 2, I have a lot of puppy in me and get mouthy at times.\u00a0That is something\u00a0I will need my new people\u00a0to continue to work on and a reason why I probably wouldn't be the best fit for a home with really young kids.\n\nWell, that's about it from me. If your igloo needs warming, then fill out an application now!\n\nInterested in adopting this dog? Visit our website (http://www.SecondCityCanineRescue.org) to fill out an application and to find out where this dog may be shown this weekend.\n\nWe love our dogs. We want happy lives for all of them and are looking for the home that provides the best fit for each dog\u2019s individual needs. Please understand that there may be multiple families interested in this dog. \n\nAlso, please know that the breed mix listed is simply a guess. In most cases, we don\u2019t know their background. We encourage you to base your decision on individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on our guess.\n\nPlease understand, we only adopt our animals out near the Chicagoland area.

She will bark to alert and digs when bored but does not chew. He enjoys car rides, walks and is very loving and playful. She does well with large dogs after slow introductions as well as older kiddos. Lola has had a rough start to life and has bounced a few times due to no fault of her own. She is a bit insecure and will need a patient and trusting home to show allow her to settle into the pup she was born to be. Could it be you?\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

Jake was primarily an outdoor pet in his prior home, so at his age, is really in need of an indoor retirement situation. Heres what we know from Jakes former owner: - He's good with cats (hes a unicorn!) - He gets along great with kids (would do best with older kids who know how to appropriately interact with pets) - He loves to play in the pool and will jump right in - He knows sit and stay - He loves to be near his people and will sit at their feet while watching tv - He was housebroken for the most part when allowed indoors (give him some time to adjust in a new environment please!) When meeting other dogs in PACC playgroup, Jake was appropriate and tolerant with greetings, but mostly kept to himself. Jake needs to meet any resident pets before heading home to make sure they have all the important things in common- politics, religion, snack preferences the basics. Ask to meet Jake today!",

A cramped kennel is no place for a big old boy like Milo! Milo is a pretty mellow guy, relaxed and easygoing. He did well with older children in his former home, and did well when meeting other dogs in PACC playgroup. He was appropriate and tolerant with greetings, and mostly kept to himself and explored the yard. Ask to meet Milo today! Milo is a handsome, intelligent, and affectionate dog. He loves his walks and sets a brisk pace. Wonderful engagement with his walking partner, with lots of eye contact and responsiveness to verbal cues. With his keen intelligence and attentiveness, he should be a very quick study with some focused training. When we paused to enjoy the scenery, he leaned into my side for touch and affection. His good behavior was rewarded with additional treats and affection. Milo is a calm dog (though very strong) who should do well with an active partner who can help him polish his skills. - PACC Volunteer",

So, as you can imagine I'm a very anxious fella. Because of my breed I need to go to a home where I am given a job and am mentally/physically stimulated every day. Basic obedience classes would be greatly beneficial to me! I am an intelligent, playful, affectionate, shy, and sometimes stubborn boy, but am hoping to improve on that trait in the right home. Please apply to adopt me today!",

            "description": "Meet Ruger, the 1 year old, white with grey Great Pyrenees pup! This boy is house trained, leash trained and knows sit, shake and leave it. As he is still a pup, he does dig when bored and chews when left unattended. True to his Pyr breed, he will bark to alert and likes to patrol. He finds himself coming into rescue as his family has had to move from a large yarded home to a smaller apartment. Even with multiple walks a day, this boy isn\u2019t settling in well. So, BDHP has agreed to help him find his new family. He is just hitting his teen years, so he will need a strong leader and plenty of room to exercise and a nice yard to roam and patrol. He does well with other dogs after slow intros, so a buddy to show him the ropes and help him build confidence and manners would be great. If you feel Ruger could flourish in your home, click on Adopt!\n\nGiant Breed Experienced Homes Only.\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

He is more reserved and nervous than Abbott, but is slowly warming up! You can tell he wants to cuddle and get loving from his people. Abbott and Costello prefer to share a kennel and even cuddle on the recliner together. He has had a few accidents, but may be due to marking (he wears a belly band for now), until after he gets neutered. He is brand new to the rescue as we are still learning about him. \n\nBehavioral issues: None \nMedical issues: None \n\nHISTORY: Costello can from a small shelter in Texas\n\nAdoption fee: $200\nLocation: Salina, KS\n\nPlease apply to adopt at www.tinyurl.com/adopthaa",

She was taking in by a family who are unable to care for her anymore and want to do the best thing for Biloxi so they reached out to us and we have promised to help find her the perfect forever home. She has been kept outside previously but now she's an indoor girl and learning all about what comes with that. Her foster family is working with her on house manners and she's proving to be a quick study. Biloxi doesn't bark but she might dig or chew when bored; this is is easily correctable with exercise, toys and mental stimulation will help keep this puppy on the right track. Biloxi is good with other dogs and with kids but kitties are unknown currently. She is a sweet girl who is food motivated and likes any kind of treats and cannot wait to find her new family!\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

I am very athletic and love to run and play ball. I would make a great exercise or hiking partner. I am crate trained and housebroken. I like other dogs with the proper introduction. I am too inquisitive for cats. I love to chase squirrels. After a good play session I love to lay about in the sun. I am still learning boundaries and will need a home to keep up with my training. \n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $350 which includes routine vetting and spay/neuter. \n\nFor more information, please contact kberger@petconnectrescue.org\n\n**If you're viewing this on Petfinder, please visit www.petconnectrescue.org to complete our non-binding application.**",

He is more outgoing than Costello. The two of them prefer to share a kennel and even cuddle on the recliner together. He has had a few accidents, but may be due to marking (he wears a belly band for now), until after he gets neutered. He is brand new to the rescue as we are still learning about him. \n\nBehavioral issues: None \nMedical issues: None \nHISTORY: Abbott came from a small shelter in Texas\nAdoption fee: $200\nLocation: Salina, KS\n\nPlease apply to adopt at www.tinyurl.com/adopthaa",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Hello, my name is Lucky! I am a young Feist mix looking for my forever family that will spoil me with praise, belly rubs and keep me active.\n\nI am very smart and eager to learn. I love to make my foster mom proud whenever I get a chance. My house training is making great progress and I already know that my kennel is a safe spot. I like it better when it's covered with a blanket - it instantly calms me.\n\nOne of my favorite things to do is dig and run through the snow in the backyard with my dog pal Frankie. It's typical for my breed to try to nip at heels when I'm around other dogs or cats, but I am not aggressive and I respond well to redirection. Speaking of cats, I am curious about the ones that currently live with me, so together with the help of my foster family and the resident dog I have learned to understand their language better. We seem to get along best when I respect their space, so I gave up chasing them for the most part. In exchange we share the bed for naps while my foster mom works on her computer and I let them take a sip from my water bowl. If my forever family already has another dog I am hoping my new buddy would be similar in size so we can wrestle and play tug of war. It's fun for me to spend time with teenagers and older kids, but I haven't had experience being around any little ones so far.\n\nBeing patient around food was hard for me at first, but now that I know there is always plenty for everyone I won't try stealing it when someone tells me that they aren't sharing. It's still tempting for me, so my foster mom keeps it out of my reach in between feeding times and instead keeps toys and bones around for me me to chew on.\n\nI don't mind walking on a leash at all, though I'd rather spend my outside time in the yard with my teenage foster brothers throwing balls or sticks for me to fetch, which is a new game I learned. Since I am an alert and curious dog I pay attention to most things that make noise or move. If I get a chance to sit by a window you'll catch me being entertained by watching squirrels and cars driving by and you'll likely only hear a short bark from me to alert you when I see something that's unfamiliar. I am getting really good at reading my foster mom's clues as to whether she expects me to chill or if it's okay when I try to investigate what's going on. She appreciates how loyal I am and how quickly I catch on to new rules.\n\nAdoption fee includes: Full veterinary exam, alter, prepaid microchip, dewormed, Rabies vaccine, DAPP vaccine, Bordetella vaccine, 4DX\n\n, flea/tick and heartworm preventative while in rescue.

Bruno will dig when bored and barks to alert, but will not chew. This boy has been bounced around several times and our number one goal is to help him feel safe and learn to trust that not all humans will abandon him as he does have some mild anxiety currently. True to his breed, he can be protective of his people and his home and will need a fenced in backyard to patrol. Bruno deserves a loving and experienced family who will help him feel settled and loved for the rest of his days. He is so incredibly sweet and he is doing well with the older kids, other dogs and cats in his foster home after proper introductions. If you feel you can provide this boy with the structure and continued training that he needs, please apply to adopt.\n\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

She is a very sweet girl who loves to play with other dogs, but we do not know if she is happy with cats.  She is a lover of all humans.  If you would like to learn more about Amanda, please complete an application and then reach out to Roxy@bigfluffydogs.com\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

Yeehaw!\n\nLike most German Shepherds, I am smart, strong and I need regular exercise. I would do best in a home with prior shepherd experience but that\u2019s not a requirement. I do need an active person that will give me the time and exercise I need. \n\nA fenced yard is preferred and I cannot live with cats or small children. I can be dog selective so other dogs are a maybe for me. Ideally, I would be the only pet. \n\nThanks for stopping by my profile!

He loves everybody and will take all the pets he can get! Bentley would love to find a loving family and forever home that will give him a chance to show his loyalty.\n\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\n\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\n\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\n\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\n\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\n\nPlease \"like\" our\nFacebook Page\nfor the most current events and new dogs.\n\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

            "description": "Jackson is a bouncy, happy guy who has been starved for attention and neglected for too long. While we don't know the specifics of his history, we can surmise that he had been an outside dog until he came to us, likely confined to a kennel with a dog house. He came to us by way of the Perry County Dog Shelter as an unclaimed stray and tested positive for heartworm disease. He has been in our vet's care for several months now as he underwent treatment for his heartworm disease as well as learning to live like an inside dog and enjoying every day attention and individualized walks. He is an energetic guy and looks forward to playing in the snow this winter with his new family and then curling up on a new dog bed to dream of all the good things to come. Jacks is very sweet and loving; However, he's not suited for living with cats and will do best if not exposed to other dogs--he lived with other dogs in his foster home but that was after a very slow controlled introduction. We are estimating him to be a middle-aged (maybe 5-6ish) dog, likely Lab and another sporting breed mix. He is approximately 70lbs. Vet reference required; No invisible fence and would do best with a 6ft privacy fence.\n\nThis is a lovely note from a family who kept Jackson for a week, unfortunately he was not a good fit for them, but they were hoping this would help him find the right home:\n\nJackson is very affectionate and loves to sit, sleep,\nand walk close to you. He made us think of the\ntraits of a golden retriever.\nWe noticed that he is anxious when separated.\nHe did not like to be crated but he accepted his\n\"fate\" and joyfully embraced your return. That\nmight all change once he settles into your home\nand knows this is his safe place.\nHe loves baby carrots and ice cubes for snacks.\nHe loves to trash pick tissues from open trash cans\nand is a counter surfer. House training was easy,\njust had to be shown where to go. He paces when\nhe needs to go outside. He is eager to please so\nwith training those issues will be eliminated.\nWe believe he will be best placed in a home with a\nfence and no cats. Wait to introduce other dogs.\nHe LOVES to chase squirrels which is great in the\nyard, not so good when walking him. Trainable fix.\nJackson will warm your heart and be a great addition\nto any family. He loves children. Avoid balls and\nstuffed toys that squeak. He loves to carry them\naround but tears up for the squeaker.\nLove him and he will return that love 110%.\n Primary Color: Brown Weight: 70lbs Age: 5yrs 0mths 1wks Animal has been Neutered",

For whatever awful things she experienced in the past, men bring out a mean streak in her. Brooklyn is a cute little maltese/poodle mix who's about 6-7 years old and weighs about 10 pounds. She's a devoted, affectionate and playful girl with her foster mom. She has never tried to bite a woman but Brooklyn puts kids in the same category as men. She's super smart and intuitive and really connects with her person. She's housebroken (and wee-wee pad/pooch potty trained) and gets along with other dogs although would rather be queen of the house. Brooklyn loves to walk and you never have to worry about some strange man getting in your personal space. Brooklyn is the perfect devoted companion who will be your best friend and love you unconditionally. 1/30/21 10:42 PM",

His owner couldn\u2019t keep him and asked us to accept him into our program. \n\nIF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS DOG:\nPlease go to our Website: Poodlerescueofhouston.org and see the section: \"Steps 2 Adoption\". There will be a drop down menu where you must read and meet all of the prerequisites. Next, read the \"Steps To Adoption\", fill out the \"Interest Form\" and submit it online. THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO APPLY. Unfortunately, we are unable to respond to inquires made in any other way.\n\nPoodle Rescue will contact you if we feel this dog, or a similar dog in our program, matches the specifications on your Questionnaire/Interest Form. Please keep in mind Poodles and Poodle Mixes are in high demand therefore the demand for them far outweigh the supply. If you do not hear from us please re-submit your Interest form quarterly as they are not recurring. Unfortunately, we cannot answer email or telephone inquiries about our available dogs.  Please be sure you have a current phone number listed on the questionnaire/Interest Form and the best time we can reach you. Adoption Fees vary.\n\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, current on shots, parasite / heart worm disease tested (and treated if positive).  All dogs are microchipped, groomed and use a dog door at our facility.\n",

That  is  right......a  dog with  so much  going for him doesn't have a home?  That  will be  remedied  once  everyone  sees  how  cute  he  is.  He  is  fiesty, playful and energetic...  he  will keep  you on your  toes.  He  loves  other dogs  and playing  is  his  favorite  word. Benson  is  just  the  right size... not too  small and  not  too big.  He has  that  scruffy  eye catching look! We  are  not  sure  if he  is  housebroken because he lives at our kennel but  he  definitely understands  when  his gate  opens  where  he  needs  to go to relieve himself...  so  if he  isn't  100%  housetrained  we  think  the   process  will not be  hard to achieve,  Benson would  benefit  from  a  basic  obedience  class just  to know  there  are  rules  out there  good  doggies follow.  Benson  is  ready to meet  his new  person.  He is  neutered, up-to-date on shots and microchipped.  Our adoption fee  is $250  and that helps  us  to help another dog find a home  and our work to continue to rescue and save!",

My brother, Smokey and I were previous country dogs that found our way to being rescued and boy are we thankful. We we were filthy and flea infested, but that is all behind us now. We are playful, energetic pups that are learning our manners. We love to be around our humans and enjoy snuggling up for naps. We are not potty trained yet. We do sleep in a crate at night. We do not have to be adopted together. We are okay with going to our very own furever home to be the center of attention and receive lots of spoiling. Adoption fee for me is $300 which includes neuter, microchip, rabies and age appropriate vaccinations. If you are interested in meeting me, please complete an adoption application http://www.crossedpawsanimalhaven.org/cpah-adoption-application.html",

I had puppies about 6 weeks ago and now that they're growing up I'm ready to find my furever home! My foster mom says I'm a good girl. I just want to be by my people and get lots of belly rubs and pets. I'm happy to lie on the couch or my bed and play with my toys. I also will fetch my toys from time to time. I do like to chase squirrels and I love doing zoomies outside so a fenced-in yard is a must! I have learned sit, down, and come, and I'll also let you know when I need to go outside. I might do well with a doggie friend with the proper introductions! Apply at: http://Ruffhouserescue.org/apply",

He is a stereotypical shiba: independent, aloof and alert to his surroundings. His ideal adopter will understand the temperament and personality of shibas. He has a very cat-like personality. He would rather sit off to the side and keep an eye on things instead of being in the action and would prefer to get attention only when he wants it. His favorite activity has been to sit at the sliding glass door and keep an eye on the backyard. He ignores my resident dogs and hasn't initiated or returned offers to play. He also has not shown interested in toys.\n\nRen is a very jumpy and easy to spook dog. Noises and movements scare him (even things on the TV), so he would do best in a quiet home with no children. He would not appreciate a loud and busy home. Ren also does not like being on a leash and will not walk on one, so he needs a secured fenced in yard. He currently does not have any recall and definitely has \"selective\" hearing when it comes to being called. Ren is not a food motivated dog and training him to like the leash and on better recall will require patience. Ren will most likely lose all of his teeth at his upcoming dental cleaning.\n\nMust have fence, no kids under 16",

My brother, Bandit and I were previous country dogs that found our way to being rescued and boy are we thankful. We we were filthy and flea infested, but that is all behind us now. We are playful, energetic pups that are learning our manners. We love to be around our humans and enjoy snuggling up for naps. We are not potty trained yet. We do sleep in a crate at night. We do not have to be adopted together. We are okay with going to our very own furever home to be the center of attention and receive lots of spoiling. Adoption fee for me is $300 which includes neuter, microchip, rabies and age appropriate vaccinations. If you are interested in meeting me, please complete an adoption application http://www.crossedpawsanimalhaven.org/cpah-adoption-application.html",

Waffles is a super sweet and energetic dog who adores people. She has a lot of energy so will need regular exercise but will make a great dog. She will need leash work as she likes to pull. She would be so happy to find a loving family and forever home!\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

            "description": "IMPORTANT!!!   All adoptions are by appointment only going forward and are spaced 30 minutes apart. PLEASE call the shelter directly during business hours for more information (see number below).  You need to make sure that the animal in which you have an interest is still available and to set up an appointment to meet the specific animal.  Once you arrive at the shelter for your scheduled appointment, please follow the directions that you were given over the telephone. If you are running late for your appointment or will be unable to make your scheduled appointment time, notify staff immediately. This will enable them to schedule that time for another prospective adoptive family. If necessary, they will be able to reschedule your appointment to a more convenient time.  \n\nROCKY is such a sweetheart!  Look at that great smile in his happy face!  He is listed as an 18-month old Boxer/Jack Russell Terrier x dog.  His coloring is tan/white and he is short-haired which makes him easy to maintain.  He has not yet been neutered, so...that has to be done before you can take him home with you.  He is well worth the wait!  Call to schedule your adoption appointment and see for yourself.\n\nAdoption fees are $80 for dogs.  Cat adoption fees are $50. Cash or check only. Please be sure to take the exact amount with you.\n\nNOTE: All shelter fees are under review and may be changed or modified at any time without advance notice.\n\nThe shelter routinely vaccinates all healthy appearing animals upon their arrival at the shelter and deworms them.  Any animals not already spayed/neutered must have the procedure done through the veterinary clinic that contracts with the county before that animal can be released from the clinic to the new family. By state law, animals old enough to be given a rabies vaccine, must have that vaccine done, as well.  The vaccine is given by the veterinary clinic staff at a separate cost to the adoptive family. \n\nHold periods for every incoming animal vary for several reasons including, but not limited to, whether the animal came in from the Cumberland County area, or from the City of Crossville, which contracts with the county for its animal shelter services.  Check with the staff to verify the availability date of every animal for which you have an interest.\n\nFor more information on this pet, call the shelter at (931)484-8525. The shelter is open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday from 10am to 2pm. Closed Wednesday and Sunday and county observed holidays.",

Woods staff will get back to you quickly to set up our meeting!\n\nFriendly, curious, and food motivated, Peyton here! Yup, those are the top 3 traits that seem to describe me best. This whole shelter environment is totally cramping my style and I just want a family that will love, play, and relax with me. It can take me a while to show my full personality. I gotta get comfortable first. I love going on long walks and sniffing all the smells I can! I also love to play with my toys and run around in the yard. I can be cuddly when I want to, but I also just like to do my own thing most of the time. I'm a really good listener especially if there's treats involved and I'm a very fast learner. I'm looking for a quiet family that will be patient, gentle and let me become the great dog I know I can be. I'm a silly guy that will make you smile with my funny charm. I know my forever home is out there and full of treats just for me, I can smell it now. Primary Color: Black Weight: 57.3lbs Age: 7yrs 2mths 4wks Animal has been Neutered",

After raising her pups  and  being on her  own  again  she  started  building  friendships with other dogs.  Her favorite  is  Rocky James.  We  would like  nothing more  for them to tie the knot  and  stay together but we  know  the  chances  of that are slim.\nWe  know  nothing  of Mama-zzz  past  but  we  do  know  she  does  better in situations  and  surroundings  that  are familiar  to her. Loud  noises and  sudden  happenings  frighten.  She  shouldn't  be  forced  into situations  she  is  unsure  of..  time  and  coaxing  work  best She walks  well on a leash  but is  not adventuresome  and prefers  the same  familiar short walk. . Mama-zzz is more  comfortable  around woman than men. Her new  lifestyle  should  be one  that creates  a secure environment, structure  and routine.  She  is  very sweet  and  will  just  need  a patient and understanding owner  that  will build  her  confidence level.  Once  you know  her  she will win and melt your heart and  you will have  a gentle lifelong companion.  Please  inquire  at  haltrescue@gmail.com\nOur adoption fee is $250  and  helps  us  save  other dogs  and  support  our  rescue  work!",

He is a Brindle Mastiff mix, neutered male, UTD on vaccines, HW negative, house broken and crate trained, although not a fan of the crate.  \n\nLincoln is very timid and shy around people he doesn't know and will need an adopter with a sturdy fenced yard (preferably 6' solid) and lots of patience to let him decompress and become comfortable in his own time. \n\nHe has been fostered with two different packs of dogs and there were no issues with any of them.  He has been around a cat and showed little interest. He is underweight, currently about 65lbs. should probably be about 75# ideally.",

He walks very well on a leash, and loves his walks.

Presh is crate trained and loves people and pups of all sizes, and she especially loves snuggling - with dogs or with people! She's mastering potty training and basic commands, proving she's a fast learner. Presh is ready to find her furever home and enjoy sweater weather with her furever family, so fill out that app today!\n\nPresh is about 2 years old and weighs about 48 pounds.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Precious, please visit our website to learn about our adoption process and to fill out an application, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs and cats will be micro-chipped, spayed or neutered, and up-to-date on vaccinations at the time of adoption. For more photos of Willow follow us on Facebook Gateway Pet Guardians and Instagram @gatewaypets ... #gpgprecious.\n\nTo view other adoptable pets from our shelter, please visit, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nGateway Pet Guardians is proud to offer a variety of mixed breed dogs available for adoption. However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

I am not going to be huge like a Great Dane but only look the part. I am an energetic, affectionate girl. I like new people and other dogs. I love to snuggle and get belly rubs. I also like to play kissy face with my people. I am going to need a toy box full of toys because I love them. Any type of ball is my favorite thing. I am house trained, crate trained and walk well on a leash. I have never been cat tested so my people are going to say not to a home with furry felines. I have never been kid tested so if you have kiddos they probably should be older.  I like to run around and do zoomies so I might run over a little person. I would absolutely love to go hiking. Hint, hint!\n\nI am spayed, up to date on vaccines, healthy and microchipped.",

            "description": "Bart / Male / 2 Years / 20 lbs / Street Mix / Mississauga\n\nMeet Bart! Bart was rescued during a very bad storm, when he tried to take shelter in a gas station. He was malnourished at the time and in desperate need of care. Once in the loving hands of our partner shelter, Bart began to come out of his shell and thrive! Bart is a special guy and needs an equally special family to join him on his training journey. He has nothing but potential ahead of him and with the right support, will be an incredible companion.\n\nBart falls in love fast with anyone and everyone he meets. He is a social guy and loves to be around humans. Bart has never met a toy he doesn\u2019t like, and will happily play by himself or with his humans. Bart is described as playful, friendly, cuddly, curious smart and trainable. He is a very active dude and would do best with a family who shares his love of adventure!\n\nBart is friendly with people and is always up for making a new friend. He gets acquainted quickly and will want to cuddle almost immediately. He has not been tested with children but would do well with dog savvy children that are 14+.\n\nBart is a major puller on leash, his leash manners and etiquette will need continued work. Although he is obedient and eager to please inside, he is very distracted and alert while he is outside. He is reactive (barking, lunging, growling) to dogs or squirrels. He can be dog selective and needs proper introductions. His fosters have done an incredible job setting him up for success so far, but it needs to be understood that this is an ongoing journey with Bart. He is powerful when he is focused on something and will need a strong handler (no kids) to walk him. Adopters will have the opportunity to speak with our behavioural support team to discuss his current training structure.\n\nInside the home Bart is always focused on his humans. He is very smart, food motivated and loves to learn. He has already mastered sit, down, focus, stay and paw. He has perfect recall when he is indoors. Given he receives adequate opportunities to use the washroom, he is full potty trained. However he will mark inside the home if left unsupervised, so he needs consistent interruption and redirection.\n\nBart\u2019s ideal family would be home more often than not, or have a flexible schedule to suit his needs. He will need a family with dog experience and who will hire a personal trainer as needed. Bart will need a detached home, with a fully fenced backyard for him to have consistent potty breaks and a secured area to play. He is only looking for homes that are outside of the city.\n\nWhile living as a stray, Bart suffered a pelvis fracture of unknown origin. Xrays reveal the injury has healed, but it does seem to cause some degree of discomfort. He does not like to be pet or touched in the area and has air snapped when someone forgets the rules. Bart is taking gabapentin for pain management and it is recommended his adopters continue in-home physio therapy to build muscle tone.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Bart please apply at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/adoption-info#adoption-form\n\nBart\u2019s adoption fee is $700.

He weighs a whopping SEVENTY-THREE POUNDS and still has more growing left! :O\n\nBones was brought to our shelter because he's a farm dog and he was having trouble staying on the farm. His previous owner said that they tried an electric fence and a shock collar, but Bones kept running off the property.\n\nBones is a quiet boy. The other two hounds bark their heads off, but not Bones!\n\nBones LOVES to play! He either hasn't gotten the hang of fetch, or he REALLY likes the game keep-away :P Being outside doesn't really bother him, so we know when he's pawing at the door that he's ready to come back inside.\n\nWe learned Bones' first day that he loves to shred soft dog toys, so he only gets those under supervision and with a garbage bag in hand :P Bones is true to his name and loves bones :D\n\nHe's scheduled to be neutered on 3-2-21. His adoption fee is $200, and we accept cash or check.\n\nBones is up-to-date on his vaccinations, will be neutered on 3-2-21, up-to-date on his flea and tick preventative, tested negative for heartworm, is up-to-date on his heartworm preventative, will be microchipped, and is potty trained.\n\nFor more information, please call The Humane Society of Richland-Wilkin Counties at 701-672-1676. Leave a message if there is no answer.\n\nThe Humane Society of Richland - Wilkin Counties (HSRWC) reserves the right to decline adoption of any animal for any reason if it feels that the home will not be a good match.  Please understand that by answering  questions and filling out adoption forms does not guarantee the adoption of the pet, nor are you obligated to adopt the pet.  We adopt to homes that are the best fit for our animals' needs and not on a first-come/first-serve basis.\n\nPlease read our shelter policies: https://tinyurl.com/yc4hr79v",

            "description": "NAME: Lily Owens\n\nAGE/GENDER: 5 mos (estimate), Female\n\nBREED: Unknown mix\n\nESTIMATED ADULT WEIGHT: 40ish lbs\n\nADOPTION DONATION: $525.00\n\nHEALTH: Lily is spayed, microchipped, flea treated, dewormed, and is current on vaccines.\n\nTEMPERAMENT: Playful and mischievous when comfortable. Shy in new environments.\n\nHOUSE TRAINING: Not yet. She is a baby so she'll need a consistent schedule with multiple opportunities daily to go outside while she works on it. Puppies should not be considered reliable in regard to house training until 6-12 months of age. They're a lot like toddlers, who require diapers.\n\nCRATE TRAINING: Good, she's young and trainable.\n\nOTHER DOGS: Good! She will need continued socialization, like all puppies.\n\nCATS: Unknown but she is a puppy and can be trained to co-exist.\n\nCHILDREN: Dog-respectful children, 8 and older\n\nHEALTH: Lily is healthy. She is altered, microchipped, flea treated, and dewormed. She has been given vaccination boosters in our care; however, adoptive families will be responsible for the remaining vaccinations that puppies need. Your adoption donation goes toward the cost of her vet care as well as transportation and general care costs.\n\nHISTORY: Lily came to us from Mexico where she was found and saved. Motley Zoo Animal Rescue was asked to find them a great forever family and that is exactly what we plan to do.\n\nNOTES FROM FOSTER HOME: Lily is getting more active and beginning to explore her foster's home.\n\nNOTES FROM FOSTER HOME: Lily is a very shy gal who does not like being alone. She loves her people and will need training in order to stave off separation anxiety.\nLily is a puppy so she's playful and has a lot of puppy energy. She is super cute and fun, but a lot of work. Her forever family should be committed to lots of training - obedience, house training, and socialization. This will ensure that Lily grows into a confident, well behaved adult. Puppies' personalities are dependent on their environment, and the structure and training they are given, in addition to socialization. Their personalities continue to grow and be shaped by their new adoptive families. Puppy daycare and socialization classes or puppy kindergarten are highly recommended for their personal development. She will more than reward you for all your hard work with lots of love, loyalty, and laughs.\n\nAll dogs adopted from Motley Zoo come with a leash and either a Martingale collar or a harness, depending on each dog's particular needs.\n\nABOUT MOTLEY ZOO\n\nWelcome to Motley Zoo Animal Rescue. We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit animal rescue organization that is run entirely by volunteers. Motley Zoo does not have a brick and mortar shelter location. Instead, all our rescue animals are cared for in private foster homes where the animals receive one-on-one care and attention in a home environment until permanent placement is found. Please email adopt@motleyzoo.org and request an adoption application and we will work toward approving you as an adopter with our rescue so that we can set a time for you to meet!\n\nFor more information, please visit www.motleyzoo.org.\n\nThank you for considering adopting a dog in need!\n\nWoof,\n\nThe Motley Zoo Crew",

She gives great hugs and tries to keep her howling to a minimum. She would love to find a home with lots of space to run and play in addition to the ever so important loving family. She would do anything for a treat! Will you give this beauty a happy home?\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

            "description": "King is a gentle, distinguished older soul. He shows affection for his people by pushing his big head into your arms and licking your hands for continued petting. If you stop, he will often lift his paw and place on you for you to continue. King knows commands - including come, sit, down, stay, and he is learning \"place\" and \"touch\". He has learned how to take treats gently from your hand and really loves to please and work on different skills. His favorite pastime is following his foster mom around the kitchen begging for a bit of a snack.\n\nKing is crate and house trained - and actually enjoys snoozing away in his crate for a few hours during the day. He walks relatively well on leash and mostly ignores other dogs. He is mild mannered with adults and children alike. He would do fine in a home with children - he isn't jumpy or mouthy - none of that silly puppy behavior! King would thrive in a home with humans who like routine and structure.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting King, please fill out an application at:\nhttps://www.dogsaredeservingrescue.com/adoptable-dogs/adoption-application/",

I am currently in a foster home but am on the hunt for a forever home!\n\nI didn\u2019t know what to think about the cat in my foster home at first but we get along just fine now. I get along with other dogs too! My foster mom days I\u2019m a cuddler and a happy pup. \n\nI haven\u2019t met any kids yet but I\u2019m a pretty good boy so I\u2019d probably get along with them just fine. \n\nI have an appointment to\nget neutered in a couple weeks and I will be officially ready for adoption then. I\u2019m excited to find my family!\n\nYou can apply to adopt me here: https://www.dogsdeservebetterblueridge.org/adopt",

She came to PACC with her two sisters and together theyre like the lady version of the three stooges, full of playful antics and puppy shenanigans. All three pups spent time in PACCs decompression program for shy and fearful dogs, since they werent very used to human interaction. Donny has graduated with flying colors, and while she needs to take things slowly, she definitely warms up quickly and is wiggly and very very affectionate. Donny might like to live with another dog since she gets along with her siblings so well, but would do best with a resident dog who will give her a bit of time to settle into her new surroundings. In PACC playgroup, she was nervous at first but warmed up to the other pups over time and was social. Ask about Donny today!",

I have been at the shelter since Jan 24, 2021. Meet Jack Frost! This sweet, sweet boy came to the shelter as a stray so shelter staff and volunteers are still getting to know him. Personality: Jack Frost is just the nicest pup you ever did meet! He loves his sweaters just as much as he loves his snuggles! History: His history with other dogs, cats, and small mammals is unknown. We always recommend SLOW and CAREFUL introductions over time to any resident pets. Energy levels: Jack Frost may look like Benjamin Button, but he is alllll puppy! He has energy to burn and will need a fairly active family to keep him out of trouble. Ideal home: He is looking for a home that is prepared to handle all things PUPPY. He would benefit from puppy classes with a qualified trainer. His family should be prepared for his ongoing medical (possible deafness, dermatitis and resolved entropion). Since he can`t hear the volume of his own voice, Jack Frost is not suited for apartment style living. Family: Jack Frost would do best in a home that has children that are old enough to handle his puppy behavior and jumpiness. All children under 12 years should be present to meet with him. Are you ready for some Frost in your life? Come down and meet him today!",

Well look no further, Olivia is your girl. I am currently fostering this 8 month old sweetie. Olivia has some energy to burn and loves to play with her toys and go for walks. As much as she loves to play she will calm right down when asked. She enjoy's a good nap and cuddles. This girl is very smart and willing to learn whatever you try to teach her. She knows sit, shake(both paws), and she is learning down,come, stay and leave it. Olivia also walks nicely on a leash. She listens to discipline well, and she just needs someone to show her what they want. She loves everyone she meets including other dogs. She has not been cat tested. This fun loving girl is ready to find her furever family. \n\n*Olivia can jump a 4' fence",

He\u2019s shy at first with strangers but warms up quickly - a delightful poodle dog. \n\nIF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS DOG:\nPlease go to our Website: Poodlerescueofhouston.org and see the section: \"Steps 2 Adoption\". There will be a drop down menu where you must read and meet all of the prerequisites. Next, read the \"Steps To Adoption\", fill out the \"Interest Form\" and submit it online. THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO APPLY. Unfortunately, we are unable to respond to inquires made in any other way.\n\nPoodle Rescue will contact you if we feel this dog, or a similar dog in our program, matches the specifications on your Questionnaire/Interest Form. Please keep in mind Poodles and Poodle Mixes are in high demand therefore the demand for them far outweigh the supply. If you do not hear from us please re-submit your Interest form quarterly as they are not recurring. Unfortunately, we cannot answer email or telephone inquiries about our available dogs.  Please be sure you have a current phone number listed on the questionnaire/Interest Form and the best time we can reach you. Adoption Fees vary.\n\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, current on shots, parasite / heart worm disease tested (and treated if positive).  All dogs are microchipped, groomed and use a dog door at our facility.\n",

For adoption information go to: www.homewardbounddogrescue.com.  You must fill out an application online as we do NOT accept applications at our clinics.\n\nHi, I am Pugsley and guess what I am?  A PUG!!  I am a male, 1 year old and 15 pounds.  I am super sweet, great with kids, dogs and housebroken but I am a skittish boy who definitely needs to have a fenced-in yard.  I will need someone a bit patient with me while I get my bearing in my new home.\n\nWe are presently not holding our regular Saturday adoption clinics due to the Covid-19 virus.  We are operating on a limited basis until further notice, but we are still adopting dogs out. We require an approved application before we consider anyone for an adoption - so filling out the application is your first step.   Different dogs and puppies go up for adoption EVERY WEEK so please feel free to visit the site and click on the Petfinder link for updates. Puppies and dogs up to 2 years old are $350. Dogs over 2 years old are $250. 100% of the adoption fees go to help us save more dogs.",

This dog is not ready for adoption yet but please follow us theREALbark on FaceBook and @therealbark on Instagram to see updates on his progress.\n\n23 lb, 3 yr old Lusso was rescued from a canyon hillside where he had been living alone on a tattered mattress for 1 year, surviving by scavenging food. He has made a lot of progress since then but his road to emotional healing comes with a list \u201cmust haves\u201d. Lusso must go to a calm, quiet home (no children) with at least one other well-tempered dog who can help him develop his confidence and feel safe. His adopter must be very dog saavy, experienced and patient with Lusso\u2019s feral personality, providing him with structure and love. He must have a private, secure yard as he is still working on house training and can not be expected to use walks for his potty breaks for some time to come. Lusso is very scared of new people and gravitates to dogs, he has started walking on leash with another dog at his side, and is slowly working on car rides. This beautiful boy wants to be loved and wants very much to please but he needs to know he is safe at all times, and loved, in order to continue his journey to becoming a great companion. He is crate trained.\n",

He has a $150.00 adoption fee plus the cost of 6 months of heartworm prevention.\n\nNote: ARF reserves the right to deny any application that is deemed unsuitable for the animal. Please be aware that our animal adoptions are NOT on a first come- first serve basis. Our sole purpose is to find the best possible home for the animals that fall under our care.

Fully neutered and vaccinated, I am ready to go home today. I\u2019m a very good boy on the leash, and am almost fully potty-trained\u2026 but sometimes I get so nervous I pee a little. Come on\u2026 who doesn\u2019t do that? I love sleeping in my crate - it\u2019s so much more comfy than the empty lot I called home before TCF rescued me. I was skin and bones when they found me, look at me now! 50lbs of soft belly just waiting for rubs. I don\u2019t mind other doggos, as long as they stay away from my food bowl! That\u2019s all me! I even warmed up to little hoomans\u2026 but I don\u2019t have the whole cat thing figured out yet.\n    I\u2019m a happy, sleepy, and spunky boy. My favorite thing to do is sleep\u2026 bonus if it\u2019s on the couch. Although I am very submissive, I can be a little overprotective\u2026 especially if you step up to my food bowl and you are a doggo! Other than that, I have a very mild temperament and show no signs of separation anxiety. I do like attention, and it would be ideal if you can give me lots of it!\n    My paw-fect fur-ever home is wherever there is a big yard for me to sit around and sunbathe in. Work from home is not necessary but highly preferred - I want to be loved and pet all day long! Ideally, I would be the only doggo in a home, and if little hoomans must be involved, I prefer them to be 12 or older. It\u2019s nothing personal, it\u2019s just that I feel I deserve a little extra tender love and care!  My adoption fee is $300 and that includes vetting care. If you want get boo\u2019d up, please fill out the form on the website here http://www.thecantufoundation.org/adopt.html.",

I was found abandoned in a home and a little underweight. I put on some pounds and am a happy go lucky guy. I think I still have some growing to do, so I might be a larger boy. I do know some basic commands, walk decent on leash and of course I have a lot of energy. I would do best with kids over 10 years old because I tend get a little over stimulated when excited and become quite mouthy. I also get a little uncomfortable when being bothered while I am enjoying my food. Being that I came in underweight, I love my food as you can imagine! With some continued training and socialization I will turn into a great canine companion for you. I just know it! I will need a feline free home, but I played off leash with another dog I met here. We had a blast and a friend at  home to romp around with would be great for me!",

Sweetie plays well with other dogs. She has lived with 2 small dogs. All were left behind in the home for a period of time when the owner moved away and abandoned them. She has shown some interest in chasing cats in her foster home, so her foster family is working with her on it. \n\nIf interested in adopting please fill out our no obligation online application at www.puppypawsrescue.org \n\nNote: Our rescue requires that all adopter's current and prior animals are up-to-date on vaccinations (DHLPP & Rabies)  and preventatives (heartworm and flea and tick), unless there is a medical reason not allowing it. All animals in your household should be spayed or neutered unless medically indicated that they should not be or are currently still too young.\n\n",

All I know is I'm super cute and it gets me all kinds of belly rubs (which I like even more than treats, and definitely more than kibble)!\n\nI'm a quick learner, but I like to have things my way. I'll definitely let you know when I want something... I'm sweet but very persistent.\n\nI don't like big noises, and when I'm scared I forget everything I know. I'm still not sure what to think of this city life... My foster mom says we live in a pretty quiet neighborhood, but I'm not convinced. It's getting less scary every day, though, and the apartment is super cozy! I felt at home right away, even if the outside world is a bit overwhelming.\n\nI definitely miss my family in IN. I had 4 human siblings and one doggie big sis. They said I was a lot of energy for her, though, and they were always super busy so I spent a lot of the day in a crate.\n\nSometimes I do get the zoomies, but I only let them out in the yard - I'd really like a place with plenty of space to run and play. And it would be real nice to have a family to love on me again! For now my foster mom and I get along great, and I especially like that she made a spot for me where I could see out the window all day.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Bailey, please fill out an application at:\nhttps://www.dogsaredeservingrescue.com/adoptable-dogs/adoption-application/",

            "description": "Blondie is a precious 12-year-old senior female Pomeranian that weighs 9 pounds. She has a great personality and gets along great with everyone! She enjoys the company of other dogs, doesn't mind cats, and has no issues with children. She is a total lovebug that just wants to be your shadow and follow you around the house. Despite her age, she's a spunky girl that we hope has many years ahead of her. She does great on a harness/leash, rides well in the car, and is the perfect buddy to take naps with. You can tell Blondie was once potty trained, but due to her age, it can be difficult for her to make it outside in time. She uses potty pads which is great! Blondie's bloodwork indicated slightly elevated kidney levels, but that is pretty common for senior dogs. She is spayed, vaccinated, heartworm negative, had a ProHeart 6 shot, and microchipped. She is $250 plus TX sales tax with an approved application: www.recycledpomsbcs.com/adopt\n\nTexas law requires that all humane organizations (Rescues, SPCA's, Humane Societies, State nonprofit, and charitable 501c3 exempt orgs) collect and remit sales and use tax to the Texas Comptroller on their adoption fees.\n\nWe do not ship or transport our dogs. We require all adopters to meet the dog in person to ensure it is a good fit. We represent the dog to the best of our ability and since they are in rescue, we do not always get their history.\n\nPlease note: We are a non-profit Pomeranian Rescue with dogs in private foster homes. We do not have a facility open to the public. We require an approved application before a potential adopter is introduced to a dog. We contact vet references to ensure animals in the home are current on vaccinations, heart worm prevention, and sterilization. We do not adopt our dogs to homes in which an animal is not spayed or neutered. A home visit may be required.\n\nPlease visit our website for more information and an adoption application. www.recycledpomsbcs.com",

            "description": "Canelo is a handsome 5.5 year old Chihuahua/Basenji mix who is looking for a loving forever home. He weighs about 12 pounds and is full grown. Canelo has quite the personality and will make a wonderful pup for the right family/person, but he will need a family that is the perfect fit! Prior to coming to us in June 2020, Canelo had sadly spent most of his life outside and if he was ever in trouble, he was punished by not receiving affection or attention. Since being with us, he has been spoiled, loved, and has spent some time in foster homes too! Canelo warms up to gentle affection from those he trusts, but is understandably timid and standoffish with new people at first. Canelo will need a patient and loving family of adults over 18 only. Canelo loves the attention of those he trusts and can be a lap guarder towards other dogs, so he would be happiest as the only pet. However, he does love to play with certain dogs and may do well with another dog that is playful and is not a big human cuddler (dog intro required). Canelo loves to play, especially with toys and would love an active home with plenty of toys! He is great on leash and would be a perfect running or hiking buddy. He is housebroken, and knows how to use the dog door too! He is a quiet boy, only alerting when someone is at the door. Canelo was used to spending too much time outside, but is still used to having a yard to run in so he will need a home with a yard or a condo with a yard, no apartments please. Canelo can be a digger if left alone in the yard and bored, so he will need to be watched to make sure he doesn't do too much gardening. He is a sweet boy, whom with a bit of patience, will be an affectionate, snuggly, and loving boy to his person/people. He is neutered, up to date on vaccines, vet checked and microchipped. His adoption fee is $160 which includes a complimentary vet visit. To potentially adopt him, please bring everyone living in the home 2 legged and 4 to our shelter location at 1102 W Hatcher Rd in Phoenix 85021, open Tuesday to Sunday 11am to 6pm. --Covid update: To adhere to CDC guidelines, we are open for adoptions only at a max capacity of 15 people in the building at a time.

This little guy was born in December 2020 and is expected to be med/large when full grown. \n\nPlease note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppy\u2019s breed or size potential. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

            "description": "The wonderful Walker weighs 46 pounds and is estimated to be between the age of 1-3 years old.  He is the cutest!\n\nThis boy is so darn happy, his tail never quits wagging.  What to say about Walker, except that he is awesome and he would make such a great best friend. He enjoys ear rubs and closeness, he just leans in for snuggles.  He does pretty good on a leash for a hound too, it is very sweet, he likes to \"check in\" with you to get a pet, then back to sniffing he goes.  As you can see in the picture of him in the snow, he just wanted a little love before he continued!  Walker does love the sound of his own voice though, so you will have to like his baying as well!  \n\nWalker does need an experienced adopter who is knowledgeable of the breed.  This nice boy needs to be taught a few manners too, he can be a bit of a counter surfer and needs work on jumping up for attention.  He is super sweet, but may be too much for young kids. Walker will also need some type of yard containment, with his houndy nose, we want to keep him safe.  \n\nWe have exciting news to share about Walker and 3 other dogs at our rescue. They are participating in a Teacher's Pet program in which they travel twice a week to Crossroads, an at youth risk center, and are paired with a youth. They will be working with our pups on some obedience training and giving them some much needed one on one time. What a wonderful program, we are so happy about it and thrilled for our dogs.\n\nIf you are interested in Walker and are at least 21 years old, please fill out an application and we will be in touch.\n\n",

At the golden age of 11, Meatloaf is now looking for his final forever home to enjoy his golden years. He is instantly affectionate, walks well on leash, and is housebroken. Meatloaf is all around a catch! He loves affection and human attention so much, that he would thoroughly enjoy being the only animal in the home. We don't know how Meatloaf feels about kids, so any kids will have to come out for supervised visit with staff prior to adoption. If you're looking for a chunky, senior addition, Meatloaf is the man for you!",

I'm your typical laid back kind of guy that LOVES attention, watching tv, playing with my favorite horse and having someone to play with in the yard. I do get attached but love meeting new friends, 2-legged and 4-legged. I was adopted when I was 4 months old to a family with several kids but was surrendered back to my birth family because they got bored of me.

Doogie will take all of your attention but also loves his own space. He is still adjusting and learning about his surroundings. He is dog friendly but we are unsure about cats. The foster puppy he is currently living with jumps all over him and he doesn't seem to mind one bit. Doogie loves to go for his daily walk though he is working on his leash manners ( his pull can be pretty strong). Once Doogie is inside he is very laid back. Doogie is not yet neutered so he wears his belly band when he comes inside. He is very good about going in his crate! Doogie is looking for his forever family to give him nothing but love and walks! If you'd like to meet Doogie, get pre-approved at www.awesomepawsrescue.org and set up a meet and greet! (55)",

Chip is approximately 4 years old, weighs 45 pounds Chip was seen by a vet who diagnosed him to have sustained attack wounds with large degree of infection on all four legs, the most substantial on the left elbow. His one leg never healed from all the infection so we had to amputate his leg. He acts like iit doesn't bother him at all!!!. Chip doesn't seem depressed or unhappy with his situation. He is a sweet and happy boy. He is heart worm positive which we are treating. Chip is a dog who has not been well cared for -he came in covered in fleas as well which we treated. It is so sad that Chip was not cared for by his owners and so sad that Chip is having to pay for it with his health but he is on his way to recovery and iis ready for adoption! . He walks well on a leash, is house broken, and likes to play in the yard. He takes treats gently and knows the sit command. He loves to play with other dogs.",

He's healthy and now current on vaccines except for 3 that require booster shots. Here's how he's behaved with his foster.\n\n\n\tHouse broken\n\tExtremely affectionate & playful\n\tLikes to ride in the car\n\tWants to play with other big dogs, has not acted aggressively toward other big dogs \n\tSmall dogs seem to rattle him when they bark and lunge at him, but he has not bolted for a small dog\n\tBolts after cats/rabbits/squirrels -- can escape his harness\n\tBriefly wary of new adults but quickly warms up\n\tDon't know how he reacts to children but most likely will be just fine..he is so sweet!",

He needs an extra special and patient home to help him be the best version of himself \n\nDog Name: Marlin\n\nBreed: Hound\n\nSex: Male (Neutered)\n\nAge: 1 1/2 Years \n\nWeight: 35lb\n\nMedical Needs: None\n\nHousebroken: Yes\n\nCrate trained: Yes, goes right in for treats. Will sleep through the night in his crate and the foster will put him in for quiet time when he get gets overexcited\n\nGood in the car: No, becomes over anxious and will bark at everything he sees. Has vomited in the car before, most likely due to anxiety. \n\nGood on a leash: Loves to go for walks and smell everything, but quite a strong puller. He has a harness that will go with him. \n\nEnergy level: High. Will need daily walks and fetch sessions with the tennis ball, plus toys and puzzles to keep his brain and body busy. \n\nNeed a fenced in yard: Yes, likes to gallop around like a horse to burn off that energy. \n\nDog Friendly: Yes - but must be similiar energy level & temperament. Was not taught proper play as a puppy and can be quite overwhelming. \n\nDoes your foster need another dog in its adoptive homes?\nNot necessary, would be happy to be getting all the attention as an only.\n\nCat Friendly? Unsure\n\nKid Friendly: NO. Marlin was never taught proper play or received any training as a puppy, as a result he has no manners and his play style is very aggressive. He will jump and mouth for attention or while playing, and will need a patient foster to work on correcting these behaviors. \n\nSpecial traits that make your foster special or that we need to know about them?\nSweet, special Marlin his foster family loves to snuggle up with him on the couch and pet his velvety ears. He could play fetch for hours and loves to explore nature with his inquisitive hound nose. He has already learned sit stay release (the tennis ball) and is learning that mouthing human hands is not how to get attention. His adopter must be dog savvy and ready to put in the work to provide the training he was never given while younger. When Marlin gets proper exercise and stimulation, he will happily nap next to his people on the couch.",

When I came to the shelter, I was kind of a wreck with really horrible ear infections, bad teeth (I had to have 18 of them pulled!), a tick-borne illness that needed to be treated and some bad skin. Whew! That's a lot. Thankfully, I've been all taken care of and life is just great! \n\nI'm a very happy dog who loves to go for short walks, but doesn't demand a lot of exercise or playtime. I am just as happy snuggling up with my people. \n\nI am deaf or mostly deaf, but I don't let it bother me. Hey, it helps me sleep really well since I can't hear the noise around me. :) I get along with most other dogs and I am good with kids that are out of the toddler stage and will respect me. \n\nIf you are looking for an older dog who would just love to be your very best friend in the world, please apply for me!",

            "description": "Stanley is a 50 lb, 5 yr old, Border Collie mix. He was rescued from a hoarding situation in Nebraska. He is very shy and would do better with another confident resident dog. We don't forsee cats being an issue. Small children will be too stressful for Stanley. He needs a fenced in yard. He is slowly making progress in the shelter environment but he really needs to develop and gain self confidence in a home. He is very sweet. Stanley will need a home that will take time and patience to work with him, this will not be an overnight success story. We can promise you it will be worth all your hard work and patience!! We will assist you with advice and with anything you need to be successful. We don't feel house training will be a problem due to he holds it at the shelter. Due to Stanley being so matted he needed to be shaved so we have a coat on him for now to keep him warm outside. He tends to spend alot of time in the outside run. Once his coat grows out he will be more handsome than he is now. Our pleasant boy Stanley is a diamond in the ruff! We guarantee he will become a very loving family pet. If you think you would like to assist Stanley flourish in your household please contact us. \n\nThe adoption fee is $300 and covers age propriate vaccines, a microchip, and a spay/neuter.\n\n Applications are typically worked in time stamp order based on date/time of submission. If you have other dogs in your home, they must all meet the potential adoptee. It may save you a trip to bring them with you when you visit, if you are certain you want to adopt a new family member. \n\n*****We are currently operating by appointment only during the social distancing stage of quarantine. If you want to meet this pet, or are interested in adopting, please submit an inquiry or email to email@townandcountryhumanesociety.org.\n\nSomeone from the rescue will contact you and/or your family and determine, on a broad level, whether you might be a fit for the animal. If so, they will provide instructions for completing the application. Your application will be reviewed and you will be contacted to set up a time to meet at the shelter or the foster home. The introduction between you and the pet will be supervised by one of the dog counselors or the foster. If all goes well, you can adopt during the same visit.\n\nPlease be sure to follow us on Facebook to learn more about Town and Country Humane Society and our mission.",

If you have questions regarding adoption, please visit our website --> www.adoptionfirstanimalrescueky.com\nPlease do not email us asking if the dog is available. We will not respond to emails that can be answered on our website.\n*MEDICAL DISCLOSURE* Knox was brought into the vet at 5 weeks old unable to process food, he would regurgitate it. We did a work up, and radiologist said Knox had PRAA. Several months later, we scheduled surgery and did new Xrays, and a barium swallow. The barium passed straight through, and doctors do not think he needs surgery. Knox does have to eat wet food only, on a raised feeder. His issues seems to have resolved itself, but may need attention in the future. You must agree and discuss this with us as it requires financial stability.\nHey guys! My name is Knox I am a 3 month old German Shepherd mix, my foster momma says I am the best boy. I love to play with the other doggies in my house but the kitties are boring, so I just ignore them. I've had some issues with food so my foster mommy has used blueberries and bananas when we have my special training time. They are super yummy and my absolute favorite! My foster says I'm a super quick learner too. I've learned a bunch of basic commands and am almost potty trained. I would love it if I could find my forever family. I'm a snuggly boy and just want someone that is gonna love me forever. NO apartments, condos, or townhomes. MUST have a 6 foot privacy fence.\nComplete Application\nYou must complete the adoption application in full to be considered for adoption.\nHome Check\nAll adoptions do require a home check. If you are not comfortable with a home check please do not apply. We want to ensure the safety of our dogs and to make sure the adoptive family is comfortable.\nMeet and Greet\nIf your application has been approved we will schedule a meet and greet for the dog of your choice or for a few we think might be a good fit for your family.\nSign Adoption Contract\nThis must be read and signed prior to adoption.\nAdoption Fee\nOnce everything has been reviewed the adoption fee will need to be paid.

Baby is Chilita's mom and they have been together their entire lives so they will need to be adopted together.  Our adoption fee is $180 for the pair.  We are spayed, up to date on our vaccines, and microchipped.  We came to the shelter because our owner had to move and sadly where he was moving, does not accept pets.  We love each but we would prefer to be the only dogs in the house.  We did previously live with a cat so we may be alright sharing our space with a feline friend.  We are housebroken but occasionally have an accident if no one is paying attention that we need to go outside.  We perform the \"Rottweiler lean\" like nobody's business.  We both love people and may push each other out of the way to see who can get the most pets.  We are happy to share space with each other.  Baby loves stuffed toys and that she does not always want to share with Chilita but Chilita is very respectful to Baby and does not try and take a toy from her.  We do groom each other and will often lick each other's faces.  We have been excellent at the shelter and are often up in the office.  We have loved everyone we have met and have even been quite the perfect ladies during our vet exams.\n\nWe are senior ladies and have what you would expect as far as senior large breed dog issues.  We have arthritis and some lumps and bumps that may need to be removed.  We are such loving dogs and true representatives of what the Rottweiler breed should be.  (Chilita has her tail so there is even more of her to love.)  We are hoping that someone's heart is big enough to give these girls the home they deserve in their golden years.",

He does well walking on a leash. Saber loves people, playing with balls, and chewing on dog bones. He would do well with other dogs in the home. He would make a great hiking and running buddy. As long as he gets the proper exercise he will do great in most home enviroments. We have not tested him with cats, he does not seem to have a high prey drive, but we dont know.\n\nSaber is ready to have a family he can call his own. He is available for adoption now so if you would like to be making memories with this handsome boy, complete an application: http://petstablished.com/adoption_form/4362/generic",

Fortunately a caring person was behind the vehicle and was able to stop and get Petey. He wasn't hurt bad physically, but emotionally he had a few bruises. After being at the rescue for a while, he started to trust again and enjoy his surroundings. Petey is now a sweet and playful boy that loves to run and does well with most dogs. He doesn't like to be crated very much and has some food aggression. He does take his treats very gently though.

            "description": "Say hello to Chica! She's a 3.5 year old Chihuahua/Australian Shepard mix who has just joined her Muddy Paws foster family. Despite her small stature, Chica has a big personality and knows how to run the show! She grew up in a household with two large breed dogs and made sure they knew who was boss! Chica is now living with two small dogs in her foster home and we're glad to report that everyone is getting along just peachy. First impressions are that Chica is a smart, friendly little thing who is very treat motivated (hello, rotisserie chicken!), knows how to potty outside, can jump really high, knows some tricks, and is already smitten with her foster mom. Nestling into soft blankets for lots of snuggles makes this gal pretty happy! We're anticipating lots of entertaining updates about Chica and will know more about her furever home \"wish list\" over the next few weeks!\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Chica is $350. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes. \n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver. \n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months. \n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

            "description": "**WE ARE ALWAYS IN NEED OF FOSTER HOMES**  Homeward Bound Dog Rescue is an all volunteer rescue organization and all our dogs and puppies are in foster homes - we are not a shelter and do NOT have a facility where we house our dogs. For adoption information go to: www.homewardbounddogrescue.com.  You must fill out an application online as we do NOT accept applications at our clinics.\n\nHi, I am Rocco, a male Lab mix, 12 years old and 44 lb.  I walk extremely well on a leash and am housebroken. I am a sweet boy who loves it when you love on me, and I don't like being alone, but when I am, I am not destructive.  I do have a tendency to bark when I am alone.  I am a big guy but I want to be a lap dog. I am fine around other dogs.  All I really want is a place to be safe, warm and loved, is that so much to ask?\n\nWe are presently not holding our regular Saturday adoption clinics due to the Covid-19 virus.  We are operating on a limited basis until further notice, but we are still adopting dogs out. We require an approved application before we consider anyone for an adoption - so filling out the application is your first step.   Different dogs and puppies go up for adoption EVERY WEEK so please feel free to visit the site and click on the Petfinder link for updates. Puppies and dogs up to 2 years old are $350. Dogs over 2 years old are $250. 100% of the adoption fees go to help us save more dogs.",

The nice people at the rescue are getting to know me and helping me find my forever home! I am a handsome, friendly boy who may be a little shy at first but I warm up quickly. I am young so I need practice walking on a leash and a family who will take me to obedience training so that I learn what is expected of me. I also need lots of squeaky and chew toys! I would be a great fit for an active owner who likes to go on walks, hiking, and maybe even camping! I also need a big fenced yard to run and play. I may like kids and other dogs but I won't know for sure until I meet them. I know that I would be a loyal and loving member of your family.  Are you ready to meet me? If so, or if you want to learn more about me, please call Sandy at 661-824-4495 (this is a landline phone).",

As long as the pet is viewable, we are accepting applications. No matter the outcome, we will email all applicants once the pet has been adopted. Thank you for your understanding.\n\n**\n\nHi I\u2019m Buddy and smiling is my favorite thing! I look like a big boy here, but at 6 months old I'm only 35 lbs. My foster mom thinks I\u2019m the sweetest boy. I'll admit it -- she's 100% right. I love people of all sizes, so I'm glad that I live with 4 small ones right now and I am great with them. I have two siblings, one is very floofy, and the other is not, but I am the least floofy of all. Lucky Tales thinks I may be Lab mixed with some Great Pyrenees or maybe Collie. \n\nI'm also really good with cat friends and I will play all day with other dogs. I like to play tug in the backyard and chase my dog friend around and around. When I'm done being dizzy and come inside from playing, I will lay on my back for you to wipe me down. It's like a mini spa treatment.... ahhhh!\n\nIn case you haven't picked up on it yet, I'm very smart. I already learned how to sit, shake, and lay down. I am crate trained and house trained, too. I love to chew on toys and make them squeak! If it was up to me, I would lay on the couch all day and take a nap with my head in your lap. Please give me a home I love you, I love you, I loooveee youuuu!\n\nI am up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, heartworm negative, and neutered. \nMy adoption fee is $300?",

            "description": "Buddy: ~10-month-old male yellow Lab/Husky mix ~70 lbs soon to be neutered\n\nBackground: \nThis sweet boy was originally a gift to a college student, who has realized that, much as he loves him, he does not have the time to give Buddy the attention and training he needs.  So his family contacted Lab Rescue for help in finding Buddy his forever home.\n\nWhat Buddy\u2019s owner says:\nBuddy is a great dog and companion. He is very affectionate and loves to be with our family as much as possible. He is potty trained and sleeps in our home every night.   He also loves hanging out indoors with us during the day when we are around.   His favorite thing is to play outdoors.  He loves to walk, run and play with other dogs.  He also gets a great workout and has a lot of fun fetching tennis balls.   After a good workout, Buddy enjoys being washed and blow dried as well.  On a final note, one of his favorite things to do is to have me share my rotisserie chicken with him (of course in moderation).  In summary, whoever is fortunate enough to have Buddy as part of their journey in life will be filled with much love and joy. \n\n\nWhat Buddy\u2019s Rescue Rep says: \nBuddy is a super sweet, energetic young pup with all that entails! Upon first meeting Buddy, he jumped up and was a bit reserved and distant and not real sure about what was going on. Like many young dogs adopted during the pandemic, the opportunities to socialize him with humans and the outside world have been limited. \n\nHe\u2019s had some training and knows Sit, Down, Wait (all of which he does well), Stay, Come and Leave It (these are harder, and he could use more practice). He takes treats incredibly gently, loves to play fetch, did well with his food guarding and handling evals, and is super playful. He does jump up on you, and is still very mouthy, but he\u2019s eager to please and can learn to not engage in these behaviors.  He loves to go on walks (probably because they often end at the dog park, where he also loves to play with other dogs and to run\u2026.and run\u2026.and run!). \nOne of his most endearing habits is to take the leash in his mouth at the beginning of the walk, as if to say \u201clet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go!\u201d. He walks on a martingale collar and while he pulls, he does settle down after a bit. At the dog park he meets other dogs well, runs with them, bounces around and generally enjoys himself while burning off some of that puppy energy (the walk home is much better!). If a dog engages in behavior that makes Buddy uncomfortable, he disengages.  Check out these brief snippets of Buddy in action:\n\n\nBuddy starts a Walk - https://youtu.be/SBdpbfN8oLI\n\nBuddy walking calmly - https://youtu.be/2jn4m5hQpss\n\nBuddy at the Dog Park - https://youtu.be/VAvkj-Yf8v8\n\nBuddy meets dogs - https://youtu.be/FVbXE70F9xo\n\nBuddy Follows Dad - https://youtu.be/dmkW3CsZU3M\n\nBuddy Walks Home - https://youtu.be/2QRmEn2d0HE\n\nWe\u2019d like Buddy to go to a home with an experienced adopter who can help Buddy become the wonderful companion dog he is capable of being. Buddy is in the teenage stage of puppyhood, with all that entails (learn more about teenage dogs here:  https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/dogs-get-difficult-when-they-reach-adolescence-just-human-teenagers) but is eager to learn and to please. \nBuddy is a high energy dog that will need at least an hour of vigorous exercise and play each day (a tired dog is a good dog!). Currently he\u2019s accustomed to a daily walk and/or dog park visit, so that\u2019s what he will expect from his new home! This will also help with training; after a good run or game of fetch Buddy will be more relaxed and able to pay attention to his training. He\u2019ll need lots of chew and play toys to keep him occupied throughout the day.\n\nBuddy has not been exposed to small children, and given his size and energy level, his new home should not have children under the age 13. \n\nHe has been around cats and done well (he has always been supervised when the cats are around). Buddy would be fine as an only dog in an active home with someone who is around a good portion of the day (someone who works from home would be great) or in a home with a calm adult dog who could show him the ropes.\n\nMedical information: Buddy is up to date on his shots, microchipped and in good overall health. He will be heartworm tested and neutered soon. \n\nBuddy is located in: San Jose\n \nIf you would like to have a great  Buddy in your life, please contact Rescue Rep Debbi at dragonflydebbi@gmail.com (preferred) or 408-309-7830.  Please read about teenage dogs here first to be sure you are up for a teenager:   \n\nhttps://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/dogs-get-difficult-when-they-reach-adolescence-just-human-teenagers",

A home with no kids or other animals where she will be allowed on the furniture.\n\nName: Violet\nAge: Estimated 4 years old\nWeight: 15 lbs\nBreed: Shih Tzu mix\nEnergy level: Medium\nGood with dogs: Selective on leash, should be an only dog at home\nGood with cats: Unknown, but not recommended. High prey drive\nGood with kids: Adult-only home due to the bite history\nGood with strangers: Very friendly but on her own terms\nGuarding: Toys\nBehavioral issues: Yes, bites as a defense mechanism in reaction to manipulations - wiping paws or putting on a jacket. Gives cues.\nHousetrained: Yes\nCratetrained: Yes\nDestructive: Not at all\nLeash skills: Good for the most part, sometimes pulls\nMedical issues: On October 25, Violet had bloodwork done at a vet visit and it was found that she had elevated liver enzymes. At this time, she was prescribed Denamarin and a prescription diet. At follow-up testing in December, her ALT level was down to normal range, but ALP was slightly elevated. Since there were improvements in the bloodwork, our vet recommended continuing the liver supplement and diet, and rechecking in a few months. Violet will be due for the next bloodwork in early March. At that point, if still elevated, then ultrasound is the next step to help to rule out major things like mass in the liver, gall bladder issues, cyst in the liver, or whether there is pancreatitis/enteritis etc.\nIf ALP levels have improved, we suspect the current medication/food would be a long-term requirement. (medication is approximately 70$/month and special food 30$/month)\nThe bloodwork in March and further screening (if required) is covered by the rescue if done at our partner vet - medication and food at the adopter's expense",

She is heartworm negative and fully vaccinated. \n\nShe's very, very sweet toward people and is very playful. When she sees her 1 year old foster brother, she just licks his fingers and toes while her foster parents are holding him. She does fine walking alongside his stroller - though she does pull on the leash pretty strong when she gets excited.  However, this is something that can easily be corrected with training and patience. \n\nPearl was found with her puppy and therefore was protective about her when she saw other dogs, but after her puppy was rehomed by finder, Pearl still is selective about dogs, getting along with some and barking at others. \n\nPearl will do better in a home without other pets, as she has not been tested around them, or lived with them. \n\nTo meet this beautiful gem of a girl. via facetime or in person, please send an application to www.savesomesouls.com\n\nPearl's adoption fee does include her cost of transporting to Washington from Texas.",

            "description": "What can we say about this amazing gentle boy?  He came to us injured with bite wounds from being attacked(?) - the shelter loved on him and knew how special he truly is. He is shy at first, unsure at first, but once he opens up (which is quick) he just wants to be your true companion - to give love and to be loved. We are working on a jumping up issue with him, which he just does to get your attention, as if to say \u201cHey, I\u2019m right here and not done wanting some love from you\u201d. He is quick to learn, and we are teaching him to sit to be pet and loved on instead of jumping up. His response time is awesome!  We have all fallen head over heels in love with this big boy, but we know, he truly needs his forever home, where he can be inside with his new person or family. He will truly be a great companion for that special person out there looking for that very special dog as that is what he is. He is one of a kind. His gentle touch when you pet him and stop for a moment, then he puts his paw on your hand to remind you that he is still there \n\nIf you are looking for that special boy, that constant companion who is 100% LOVE, then our Rupert is your boy!  \n\nHe is approx 4 years old, Neutered, Vaccinated, Microchipped, Wormed and truly the best dog ever.  He has been in the play yard with another male dog and he just wants to play like a puppy. He is lower energy however - as he has matured past the puppy stage now, so he would do well with even an older person/couple. He is very good on a lead, so walking him is easy as well. He is patient, and like we have said, the purest form of love there is.  Not to mention how GORGEOUS he is!",

My foster parents say that I am very curious and independent. I like to tackle my sister, and even though she always ends up pinning me down, I never give up! I want all your hugs and pets, and I like to chase your feet. \n\nI am great at pooing and peeing 2-3 times each instantly if you set me outside on the grass every 2 hours! Indoors I am working on peeing on the pee pad in my play pen.\n\nPlease come and see me so I can charm your socks off and love you forever!\n\nBoba is a female Lab / Shepherd mix. Her paws suggest that she might be medium/large full grown. She is currently 4 lbs (as of 1/25) and was born around 12/5/20.",

            "description": "Due to the current situation with the COVID-19 (Corona) virus, in-person home visits are not possible at this time. Since this is a very important part of finding the best home for our dogs, we are not accepting any applications from first-time pet owners, applicants who have not had a pet in the past 3 years, or applicants who cannot furnish vet records.  We hope you understand and that you will consider applying to adopt once restrictions have been lifted.\n\nLiza Jane is a cute black Cocker Spaniel mix.  She is approximately 9 years old and weighs 35-40 lbs.  She\u2019s up to date on all vaccinations and negative for HW.  She has a very calm demeanor and loves to be scratched. She\u2019s a true Velcro dog! She does very well at the dog park with all sizes and likes going on short walks since she is considered a senior.  \n\nShe is very food motivated, loves her treats, and clears her bowl every time.  She is also crate trained, but needs a treat to get her inside.  We were told if you push her into her crate, she might snap but not truly bite, so offering a treat works best.  \n\nLiza Jane also enjoys being on the couch or her dog bed. At night she gets a little anxious so she prefers her crate with a blanket over it.  When she\u2019s lonely or anxious she will let you know by letting out a little howl.  She would do best in a home with a family who is home a lot because she wants constant company.  A family with older children would be best advised because she can be startled easily with sudden movement or loud noises.  In addition, it would be best that she be the only dog since she loves constant attention. \n\nIf you would like to meet Liza Jane, please complete our adoption application and put her name at the top.  https://dfwcockerrescue.org/adoption-process/\n\n<BR><BR>\n<b>For more pictures and information about this and all the cockers available at DFW Cocker Spaniel Rescue please visit our website at www.dfwcockerrescue.org</b>\n",

DW was brought to the shelter as a younger pup by a Good Samaritan as she was found and not using one of her hind legs. The shelter took care of her and found out she had a fracture through one of the growth plates that is pretty common in puppies. This can happen due to jumping and landing wrong, falling from something etc. Their vet repaired the fracture, and because she was so young it has healed nicely and shouldn\u2019t set her back at all in the future. She is great in her dog play group and has done well in foster homes with both dogs and cats. She has a great start to potty training, but expect to perfect this once she gets to MN. She is a love bug and is really looking forward to her forever home when she arrives on 2/6. All adoptions have a two week trial period. \n\nRequirements: Home with yard space. \n\nAdoption Fee: $475 + tax. This includes neuter/spay, current vaccinations as age appropriate, heartworm/tick testing if appropriate, deworming, microchip, and current preventatives\n\nInterested in adopting?  Fill out a preadopt application here: https://form.jotform.com/203104997748162\n\nYou can email fostersheadinghomek9@gmail.com with additional questions.\n\nThis dog is located in Minneapolis, MN\n\n",

It looks like he would be absolutely delighted to go to a home where he could have a dog Play Buddy! \nThad is such a lover boy, and can't seem to get close enough to the ones he loves! He will lean in for pets and gaze up at you with those big adoring eyes of his. Thad is trying his best to settle in at the shelter, he is a little worried and unsure, and wants to be right next to you so you can give him confidence. He likes other dogs, would need a home without cats, and he is a very big fan of people. Thad is looking for a steady home with people who can make him a big part of their life, and introduce him to all the things he may have missed out on. He is such a sweet boy, so loving, and he would be grateful every single day for his new life with you!\n*If you are interested in adopting Thad please call the shelter to set up an appointment to meet him. 509-662-9577",

This sweet boy enjoys filling his days going on long walks through the neighborhood, and romping around the backyard. He is a big fan of toys, and will happily play fetch with a tennis ball (though he isn't always so great about bringing them back yet!). \n\nMilo has great house manners, and is fully house trained. He rides well in the car, and makes an excellent errand running buddy! Milo loves to chew, and really enjoys having lots of hard chewing bones and toys around for him to entertain himself with each day. \n\nMilo is a sensitive soul who responds best to a person who will give him the time and patience needed to help boost his confidence. He can become worried about unexpected changes or new people in his environment, and needs a family ready to show him the world isn't a scary place. Tasty treats and gentle handling go a long ways in helping him feel comfortable. \n\nMilo enjoys the company of other dogs, and could do well in a home with another, confident dog to show him the ropes. He will do best in an adult only home, with a backyard for him to explore each day. This sweet guy is going to bring a lot of joy and happiness to his forever family. If Milo sounds like the right fit for your household, schedule an adoption appointment today.",

She is an energetic, enthusiastic girl who embodies all the wonderful characteristics cattle dogs are known for! \n\nRose is very playful, and a huge fan of squeaky toys. She loves to spend her days sunning in the backyard, going for jogs through the park, and patrolling for squirrels in the backyard. Rose is very bright and engaging, and would likely be the star of the obedience class with her new family! She also loves the company of other dogs, and would enjoy having a canine companion or two in her forever home. \n\nRose is working on her house manners, and is learning all about crate and potty training. At the end of a busy day, she is content to curl up at your feet to watch your new favorite Netflix show. If Rose sounds like the right fit for your family, schedule an adoption appointment today!",

            "description": "Hi, I'm Masha!\n\nDo you like other dogs? I do not have a good history with dogs and I need to be the only dog in the home.\n\nWhat do you think about cats? I lived with an indoor cat and did well. But I did like to chase the cat for fun at times. So I would need a dog savvy cat with very slow and careful introductions. \n\nSo how do you feel about kids? I did well around kids in my previous home. I can play rough at times, so I will need kids that can tolerate my play style. \n\nWhat is it that staff and volunteers love about you? I am a beautiful dilute brindle.\n\n** Here is what a volunteer says about me:\n\"She is playful, smart and has lots of energy, but also enjoys quiet time.\" **\n\nIs there anything else we should know about you? I am 6 years and 11months old and I weigh between 75-78lbs. I have a behavior waiver that the staff will discuss with you.\n\nI came into the shelter as a stray and the above information is all recommendations based on my behavior seen at the shelter. I have no known history and it is very likely that I have not shown staff 100% of my personality. Expect to learn more about me after adoption.\n\nIt is unknown how this animal will do in their new home as all animals can be different with each person. It is important to take this into consideration when thinking about adopting and making sure you are prepared to work with any potential medical or behavior issues that occur after adoption.\n\nMy adoption fee includes my spay/neuter, current vaccinations, permanent microchip identification, certificate for a free veterinary exam, post-adoption support and more!\nThank you for taking the time to learn a little about me! If you think we would be a good match come on down and ask to meet me! I'm looking for my forever home and it could be with you!\n\nADOPTION INFORMATION: If you live in the city of Eugene or in Lane County you will be purchasing a dog license in addition to the adoption fee. You will get to choose between a one year, two year, or three year license. \nThis pet is located at Greenhill Humane Society. 88530 Greenhill Road Eugene, OR 97402 (541) 689-1503. See all of the pets at this shelter by visiting www.green-hill.org.",

            "description": "Hi there! I was recently rescued by National Mill Dog Rescue, and my dedicated care team is still learning all about me. The intake team said I am scared. Please check back soon to read my biography. Meanwhile you can learn more about the organization that rescued me here: http://nmdr.org\n - - - - - -\nPrior to being rescued, many of our dogs have experienced minimal socialization. As a result, there is often an adjustment period when learning about life as a family pet. We typically do not adopt dogs to homes with young children. Homes with older children will be considered on an individual basis. Common skills such as house training and leash walking will often take a little extra time. Patience, understanding and a gentle hand are a must. The great news is, most of these dogs come around rather quickly and being a part of their rehabilitation is an extremely rewarding experience.

Our sweet Daisy embodies all that and more! She is the most lovable girl you will ever meet, and she is looking for her furever home! She will need a little work on leash, but is SO smart that it won't take her long. Daisy's ears are going to need a little extra attention, but she is worth it and more. Come on out and meet this lovely flower, and you will have to pluck her right up! Daisy can't wait to meet you, and she says, \" Happiness blooms from within, and spreads without!\"\n\nDue to Covid, we now work by appointment only and work on a first come basis.  If you are interested in making an appointment, please call the HCHS at 512-793-5463.  You can see all our available animals at HillCountryHumaneSociety.org.\nAll our adoptable dogs are treated for fleas, given DHPPV and Bordatella vaccines and are de-wormed.  \nWhen you adopt one of our animals it will be micro chipped and registered at the time of adoption.  Also, if not already altered, you will receive a voucher to get your animal spay/neutered.\nWhile we do our best to determine the breeds of our dogs, the majority are strays, and we have only general appearance, coat type, size, ear type, tail, tongue color and coat color to base breed on.  It is always possible when adopting a puppy that it will change dramatically to look like another breed.\n\n",

She has been completely vetted and ready for visitors at this time!  She is a lil' gem and sweet and happy as they come.  Loves attention!  She tolerates dogs that pretty much ignore her but sometimes snarls and 'smiles' at the ones that are too pushy, in her face.  She came from an Amish farm free range so the world is new to her but by no means is she feral....for that reason we are seeking an experienced dog owner preferrably one that has owned this breed in the past and/or now.\nHousebroken\nCrate trained\nLeash training in progress\nWill challenge certain types of fencing so this will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis but fenced yard is required!\nIf interested in learning more about Miss Shiloh please contact joniwillob@gmail.com......same contact for an application.\nPLEASE refer to our homepage here on Petfinder.com by selecting More About Us to get your questions answered about our approval/adoption process and fees.",

PLEASE LEAVE US A VOICEMAIL IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO REACH US. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING.- CCDP STAFF**\n\nHi there. My name is Noodle Bandit (Bandit). I'm about 1 year old and I weigh about 55 lbs. \nI am a sweet boy looking for a loving family. \nI am very energetic and will need a new family that can give me plenty of exercise. \nI will also need a little work with manners, but I am very smart and I pick up on things very quickly. I am good in my kennel and appear to be housebroken. \nI get along well with most other dogs and I like to play. \nIf you're looking for a sweet dog to add to your family, please consider adopting me.\n\nOur adoption fee is $150.00. The pound DOES NOT accept checks for adoption fees. We're able to accept cash for adoption OR Visa/ Mastercard/ Discover Card. A convenience fee of 2.39% will be applied to all credit/ debit card adoptions. If you intend to do a foster-to-adopt, the fee must be cash. ALL dogs/puppies adopted from our shelter will receive their parvo distemper vaccine, bordetella vaccine, rabies vaccine (if aged at 12 weeks or older), be dewormed with a 3 day course of panacur dewormer, be microchipped, receive their current Ohio dog license and will be spayed or neutered. ALL DOGS/PUPPIES WILL BE SPAYED OR NEUTERED unless a health issue prohibits the surgery from being performed. Not all dogs posted for adoption are spayed/ neutered yet. If you're driving a long distance to adopt, please verify that the vetting process has been completed and dog you're interested in adopting is still available for adoption. The above mentioned vetting is all included in your adoption fee. The adoption fee and what is included in the adoption fee is NON-NEGOTIABLE.\n\nAdoptions MUST be done at the pound and in person as there is paperwork to fill out and an adoption contract that must be signed by the adopter. This means you must be willing to travel to our shelter to adopt.\n\nIF the dog you're interested in adopting has medical conditions or injuries which require medical treatment, we ask that you help with the medical bills so we can continue to help the dogs coming in who need additional vet care.\nWe are a county run shelter, therefore we cannot control our intake or the health or behavior of the dogs that come in to our shelter.\n\nAlthough we try our hardest to place all of our adoptable dogs, there are certain circumstances in which any dog in our care could be euthanized at any time and without further notice (IE: sudden untreatable medical condition or injury, temperament or behavioral problems which may not be apparent when the dog first arrives, lack or space, etc.), therefore all dogs at our shelter should be considered urgent. The adoption of a more highly adoptable dog will mean more time for the less adoptable dog in the kennel next to him!\n\nShelter hours are: Monday-Friday: 8 am- 4 pm\nSaturday: 8 am - 11 am.\nSunday: 8 am - 11 am.\nAdoptions are always welcome during hours of operation. We will make special arrangements for adoptions in advance.\nThere is nobody in the office on Saturday and Sunday, so therefore we are unable to answer or return phone calls over the weekend.\n\nCan't adopt a dog? We would love to have more volunteers who are able to spend time with our dogs! The dogs LOVE going for walks and the socialization and exercise helps make the dogs more adoptable.\n\nContact information:\n8455 County Home Road\nLisbon, OH 44432\n(330)424-6663\nEmail: hpecorelli@ccclerk.org",

I'm Kash, short for Kashew! \n\nIntake date: 1/22/2020\nIntake type: Surrender\nPup Partners Color: Green\n\nGender: Male\nWeight:53lbs \nDOB: 6/3/2019\n\nI am: Up to date on vaccines, Neutered and Microchipped\n\nMy friends describe me as: Outgoing, Goofy, Playful, Affectionate, Smart\n\nMy energy level: High- Always ready for action! Let's go!\n\nHome with other dogs: Yes but nobody too crazy- I tend to get nervous with other dogs that can be a little crazy\n\nHome with children: Over the age 10\nHome with cats: No\n\nCrate trained & Housebroken: Yes\n\nI am a young, energetic doggo that is still a lot of puppy, and would really benefit from obedience training. My ideal home would be one that is pretty active as I need a lot of stimulation to keep me happy. But don't worry I am still the biggest cuddle bug. I can be a bit jumpy and play a little rough, that's why a home with older children would be best for me.  My favorite thing to do is play with my tennis ball outside. I am very treat motivated which makes me easy to train. My shelter family has already started working with me on manners since I came to the shelter and Iv already gotten much better. Have I mentioned that I love giving big wet, sloppy, kisses :) \n\nIf you think I'm the right doggo for you, please submit an adoption application!",

Because of their need for a high level of exercise, both mentally and physically and their need for ongoing training, only applicants with demonstrated owner/handler experience with this breed will be considered.  The vast majority of them are not best suited as family pets, but in homes with experienced handlers knowledgeable of their needs and breed characteristics.  We will not place in homes with small children or small dogs/cats.  \n\nFitz\nWe are still getting to know Fitz.\n\nIf you can give Fitz an indoor forever home, please fill out our online application on our website at http://www.savingpawsrescueaz.com/adoption-form/  \n\n We will only schedule meet and greets with an approved application. We are an all-volunteer organziation.  It may take a couple of days to process an application and complete reference checks.\n\nThank you for your interest in saving a life!",

He\u2019s a 57lb ball of energy with all the love in the world to give!\nAs a result of living chained outside by previous owners he is unfortunately heartworm positive, but it is treatable and covered by the rescue.  He\u2019s also current on vaccines, neutered, housebroken, kennel trained, and microchipped. \nHe\u2019s friendly towards everyone but would be better suited in a house with older children. \nBuck is a great car rider and would do best with a family that participates in dog friendly activities that he\u2019d be included in to help him expend his puppy energy. Currently, he is receiving training and knows \u201csit\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d continued training will be necessary to manage some of his impulsive behaviors. \nBuck is very friendly towards other dogs but cats may find his higher energy level overwhelming. \nYou really couldn\u2019t find a more affectionate boy who wants nothing more than your love and attention!\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

            "description": "Titan is a 2 - 3 yr old male Pitbull. He is a loose and wiggly guy who loves to give kisses. He is very high energy, so we recommend a home with older children. He pulls on a leash, but this can be resolved with obedience training. Titan is food motivated, and knows the commands sit and down. He is intensely interested in cats in the shelter environment. Dogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Our cat test should be used as a general purpose screening only to rule out overt aggression; we always recommend caution when introducing dogs to cats in the home. Recommendation on suitability of placement with children by their ages is based on behavioral observations including energy level and response to body handling. We never recommend leaving young children unsupervised with dogs, and we cannot guarantee the behavior of dogs with children, other pets or cats. Behavior evaluations should be considered as a snapshot of the behavior of the dog at this point in time; JHS believes all dog families need to be prepared to invest time and energy into training as well as provide common sense management of their new dog. We always encourage family to do some research on the breeds or mixes of breeds prior to adoption as many can have some unique characteristics that may or may not fit into their families. Always remember that the majority of dogs at our shelter have been exposed to or may have kennel cough. Kennel cough is contagious to other dogs, please talk to your vet if you have any questions about kennel cough prior to adoption. Please ask your adoption counselor at time of adoption if you have any unanswered questions regarding illnesses and treatments of the path that you are adopting. For more information about this dog or any others at our Shelter, please visit www.joplinhumane.org. We are the Joplin Humane Society in Joplin, Missouri. 417-623-3642. I AM SPONSORED! Thank you Darcy Robison for sponsoring me!",

Their previous owner is not able to provide them the time that they need for their energy level.\n\nJust like your typical JRT, these two are VERY energetic and have a high drive for fun!!! They are always on the go and love to play chase, wrestle, and hunt for critters! They are just about house trained, they are crate trained, EXTREMELY obedient and is always eager to please and learn new things. They are super duper sweet and friendly and loves all people, including children but because they have a tendency to get exuberant, excited, and will jump up, we recommend older children (13+) only in the household rather than toddlers and young children. They would love to have a family who will include them in your life and take them on adventures with you. But when they are not loving on you or out and about, they are entertaining themselves by playing a game of chase in the yard or catching lizards. They are great with other dogs but prefer mellow dogs rather than large rambunctious puppies and young adults. And even though they do have high motors going, at the end of the day they are quite content being lap dogs and binge watching the lastest Netflix series!\n\nIf interested in ADOPTING, please fill out an adoption application online:\nwww.hoperanchanimalsanctuary.org/adoption-application\n\nA copy of your application can be sent to us via email\n\nFor more information about Tuco and Blondie, please contact Sandra:\nCall/Text: (760) 585-5973\nEmail: sandrahoperanch@gmail.com",

I might bark at other dogs if I'm crated or behind a gate but otherwise, I get along just fine with other dogs. I also don't pay any mind to cats as long as they don't pay mind to me. I'm super sweet and super tiny!

            "description": "Meet Leo, the youngest pup to join Grey Face Rescue! Leo is looking for a very active family that can keep up with him! He is also hoping for an active puppy playmate. We can't pinpoint his breed - he was transferred to us as a Great Dane mix but we quickly learned that he is definitely in the hound family. He loves playing and running around with other dogs so we are looking for a home with another dog that is as active as Leo. He should not go to a home with cats or small dogs, as he is very high prey drive. He would do great with older kids! He is still a puppy so he's a bit mouthy - he would benefit from some additional training.\n\nDo you need a running buddy? Does your dog need a friend? If so, Leo is the puppy you need!\n\nAge: 1-year-old\n\nBreed: Hound Mix (possibly Great Dane)\n\nWeight: 60+ lbs\n\nKid-friendly: He is still very much puppy and mouthy so we wouldn't recommend small children. He does great with teenagers.\n\nDogs: Leo does a great job with playing with other big dogs! He is interested in dogs on walks, but will keep walking after a sniff. We do not recommend living with small dogs due to his prey drive.\n\nCats: We don't recommend cats.\n\nCrate trained: Yes! Leo currently gets crated at night or while his foster is out running errands. He also chooses to go in his crate for naps. He doesn't like to be crated when there is activity in the house.\n\nPotty trained: He can go at least 4 hours without having accidents. He gets up once in the night to potty, but we think he could hold it for longer!\n\nLikes: This big puppy has a lot of energy and loves to run, play, and go to the dog park! Leo loves to chew on bones, typically knuckle bones, filled with peanut butter. Leo loves to play with other dogs. He also loves chewing on squeaky toys. Leo loves to cuddle when he's tired too.\n\nHealth concerns: None\n\nAdoption fee: $425\n\nAdopters will be responsible for continued preventatives, follow-up appointments, and medications (if applicable).\n\n$50 discount for seniors (65+) and veterans. Adoption fees help pay for the dog's veterinary exam, vaccinations (rabies, distemper, and bordetella), HW test, blood panel, a microchip, and spay/neuter if needed and additional health needs specific to each animal.",

She will be spay soon as appointments have been a little slow to get because of COVID.\n\nShe is very sweet, loveable, house broken but not trustworthy off leash in an unfenced area. Her foster dad has been taking her out on a 50' leash and letting her get exercise in a country setting.   She is good on a long leash and never pulls but could use some obedience training classes to learn to walk beside someone.  She is excited about horses and other small animals. We do not recommend a home with small animals, such as cats or bunnies or horses.  She gets along currently with a male and female German Shepherd and recommend she be placed with a male dog for a permanent FUREVER home.  She is housebroken but may have an accident in a new home and will need to be watched so she can learn the signals to go out.  \n\nShe  is always friendly, gives lots of kisses, cuddles and does love to play with bones and toys.  She has learned :the following: sit, wait, stay.  You can not leave her loose over night or she may have an accident or get in to things she should .  She loves toys, bones, jolly balls or all balls.  She does not want to do a down but we think it will happen in time.\n\nShe loves car rides but has not visited any stores currently.  She has an excellent recall.  If you are serious about this beautiful Shepherd please fill out an application at www.faerielandrescue.org under resources.",

            "description": "Are you one of those people that loves surprises? Well, I am the perfect pooch for you! With my ordinary name and less than stellar good looks, I am that perfect package waiting to show that special someone how amazing I am! I was brought to the shelter by my owners as they couldn't provide me desperately needed veterinary care. They assumed I had no hope left of recovery. Fortunately the shelter team realized I just needed some minor veterinary treatment, special baths, a nutritious diet and some love! After only a short time, I am already showing so much improvement! I am a pretty easy going boy (as long as I get enough physical and mental exercise!) that is looking for a family that will continue to help me heal and show me what indoor living is like! I am housebroken, crate trained and I ride well in a car. I enjoy jumping up on people (I am working on that), pulling on leash and checking out what my people keep on counter tops. I get along with other dogs and enjoy brief romps in the yard with them and my prior owners reported I lived with cats. While I am putting on weight and recovery from a noncontagious mange, I am heartworm negative and will need to continue having regular conditioning baths (which I adore!). I am eager to please, smart, food and toy motivated and looking for someone to teach me about the finer things in life. I would do best in a home without young kids and that can continue to provide me a good routine. If you are looking for a well rounded boy that is just looking for some training, adventure and companionship, please make arrangements to meet me!",

            "description": "Ever seen a hippo wiggle? Meet Akira and you probably will. This roly-poly momma is sweet as can be. She's generally very low-key and easygoing, but when she's excited or happy to see you, you'll know it by her signature whole-body shimmy. Akira is excellent on leash and a great partner for a leisurely walk. She likes to stop and check in every once in a while, happily accepting a scratch under her collar before you continue on your way. Children make Akira a little nervous, so she needs a home without children under 12. She has done well with male dogs, but likes to be the only lady. Because she is classified as a pitbull, her home will need to have a fenced in yard (or reside in Sarpy County), so no apartments for her. If you have a quieter home and a love for dog cuddles, then Akira is your gal! Akira will be shown by appointment only. If you are interested in learning more about this animal, please fill out an application by clicking here . Be sure to include Akira A1085204 when filling out the survey. After reviewing your application, we will only be reaching out to you if the animal is a good fit for your home.",

The shelter is no place for a senior citizen (we dont even have a rec room for bingo night). Periwinkle has some typical old lady health problems, and also some side effects from untreated valley fever. The PACC clinic is getting her all fixed up, but shell need a committed owner who will continue to take care of her medical treatment. Periwinkle is an incredibly sweet girl who has become a fast staff and volunteer favorite. The shelter environment is a little bit overwhelming for her, but she is gentle and affectionate with anyone who stops by for a visit. Ask about this sweet senior today!",

            "description": "Let's start this post off with size. Jimmy is TINY! This little 5 pound toy chihuahua mix is soo small, he can only sport kitten collars. That's right! Jimmy is tiny! Jimmy is approximately 4 years old. Although he is tiny, his personality is HUGE! \n\nJimmy's loves to be held and carried. He also loves to run and play. Jimmy is good with other dogs, and cats! However due to Jimmy's tiny size, we recommend a home with no large dogs. Jimmy is crate trained and working on his potty training. His ideal home would be someone who takes him everywhere, and spends lots of time with him. However, Jimmy is just fine in his crate snuggled up with blankets if you need to run to the store. He is also good with well mannered children. \n\nWe are now accepting applications for Jimmy. \n\nInterested in adopting? Please fill out the adoption application below and send us a message to confirm your application has been received. Also let us know why you think Jimmy would be a good fit for you and your family. Please be advised that due to the high volume of interest in our dogs only approved adopters will be contacted. We have the right to deny any application for any reason. \n\nAdoption Application:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScrklSYof1T_d4WMss6X95J7IKZHf7ECjwjo5yeYIecESeXxg/viewform\n\n",

            "description": "Colin Bridgerton is a black fluffy male lab/shepherd mix. He has a touch of white on his chest and will grow up to be a large beautiful dog. His birthday was 12/16. He will be vaccinated and microchipped this week once he is 6 weeks old. He loves to play and wrestle with his brother, then cuddle and nap. They do great in the kennel and sleep through the night. Potty training is also going well for their age! This sweetheart is ready for a forever home!\n\nPlease note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppy\u2019s breed or size potential. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

I'm ready to be an empty nester and am looking for a family that will provide me with plenty of head scratches and belly rubs, comfy places to nap, and long sniffy walks. I enjoy getting out of the house and exploring, whether it's jumping into piles of snow or taking a long stroll around the neighborhood. Sometimes I push the pace on walks (between good sniffing spots of course!), so I think I would enjoy running.\n\nI love to nap and have claimed all areas of the house as my bed - why settle for only one? While I love my beauty sleep and relaxation, I choose to cuddle only when I'm in the mood. This makes my foster momma treat me extra special when I lay my head on her lap :) I've recently discovered this thing called \"toys\", and I love pouncing and playing with them. Additionally, I noticed that shoes and slippers look a lot like my toys and I really like to carry them around.\n\nI protect the house and yard from intruders and voice an alarm when I see people walking by or hear weird sounds. I might be less protective once I don't have ten pups to worry about. I'm house trained and lay by the front door to ask to go outside. I'm crate trained and snooze in there overnight without a peep. During the day, I'm trusted to be free roam in most of the house, though I'm rarely alone. I \"sit\" and \"touch\" for treats and am eager to learn more, as long as yummy snacks are involved. I get along well with other dogs as long as we're introduced slowly and do well on car rides.\n\nIn the meantime if you have questions or are interested in me, please fill out an adoption application at www.ruffstartrescue.org.\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal. Please check out our website, www.ruffstartrescue.org for more details and additional pictures on any of our animals! All Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs). Ruff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue. Animals are located in homes throughout Minnesota. We do not have a facility where animals are kept.

            "description": "Those eyes, we know!!!  So stunning!  This is Joey, a 2 year old male Husky/Labrador mix.  He has a thick golden-red and white coat with those husky ice blue eyes.  Joey is a big dog weighing 56 pounds and this is full grown.  Joey was pulled from our local animal shelter where he had been picked up as a stray and down there for several weeks with no on coming to claim him.  \n\nJoey is a little shy at first but warms up quickly to give you a kiss on the cheek.  He is like a big puppy in many ways: loves to run and romp around and loves to play with his toys.  We feel he may be too big for an apartment and would be much better suited to a place with a fenced in yard so he can have room to run and play. Plus Joey has no clue what to do on a leash and sometimes has to be carried places.  He will need some leash training!  He is not to be an outside dog only, Joey loves to be with his people too much.  Joey did well with the animals he has been around and should be fine with children 8 and over, just not real young kids he might accidentally bump over.  \n\nWe have started on his crate training.  Joey is up to date on his vet care, will be neutered prior to adoption, heartworm negative and microchipped.  He is on heartworm and flea/tick prevention.\nSuch a unique looking dog with lots of love to give \u2013 what more could you ask for when looking for your new buddy!!\n\nAll HSWA dogs are either at our Dog Adoption Facility or in foster homes. All dogs require an appointment to meet.  Please call us at 205-554-0011 or email humaneswa@yahoo.com to request an appointment to see the dog/puppy and to check availability.\n\nVisit us on Facebook! www.facebook.com/humaneswa\n\nOur adoption fee is $75.  Read more information on our adoption process at www.humanesocietyofwa.org/howtoadopt.html.  Then, if you feel your home might be the right forever home and you would like to adopt a dog, submit an online adoption application. The online applications may not work on mobile devices. If the online application does not work on your device, look to the right side of the forms page for a downloadable .PDF copy of the application.",

            "description": "Up last is our largest black and white dog from this trip. Doesn't he look debonair in his tuxedo? Scotty is a one-year-old Terrier/Mix who is ready for love and we're hoping he's looking in all the right place. With that face, we're not worried. Scotty has some sweet manners and is so smart you'll want to take extra special care to teach him even more. Scotty is one of our largest dogs at almost fifty-pounds so if you like big guys he's an obvious pick. After a doggy obedience class and some boundaries, Scotty is going to fit right in. Scotty enjoys playing with other dogs so far, has his eye on a few toys as he decides which are \"his and so far, he gets along well with people. Scotty has no restrictions as far as future living situations other than that he'll need walks and play to keep him happy. If you are up for a fun frolic around town and then a sweet snuggle afterward you'll want to come and meet Scotty as soon as possible. Scotty is up to date on vaccinations, neutered, and will be microchipped so if you like large dogs with extra love to give then please come and meet Scotty soon.

            "description": "**SPECIAL CASE**\nMeet Bumbles!\nBumbles is an approx 9-10 mth old Tennessee Mountain Cur who previously belonged to someone who loved him dearly but was unable to care for Bumbles.  Bumbles developed a severe case of demodex (non contagious) mange and a secondary bacterial skin infection.  He was underweight and in such bad condition that his face was extremely painful and a very bloody, oozing mess.  It has taken 6 weeks of intense vet care and medications,baths and TLC but Bumbles has turned a corner and is looking GREAT. \nWe will consider an experienced adopter or a 4 week foster-to-adopt period with local adopters to complete his follow up care.\nBumbles has had limited contact with other dogs while in our care.  He can get a bit overexcited with them still.  He can also be a bit scared of new people but is a silly, snuggly puppy with those he trusts.  \nHe would benefit from a family willing to help get him acclimated and start working on the training and socialization that he has missed out on.  He promises to reward your time and love with his loyalty.  He has *so* much potential that just has not been realized.  The last 6 weeks he has already started to blossom.  Bumbles loves peanut butter and being told how handsome he is.  \nBumbles' adoption fee includes his neuter, vaccinations, vet care to date and heartworm testing (negative).  If you are looking to give a deserving dog a chance, Bumbles is your guy!\nInterested?

            "description": "Roscoe came to us several weeks ago from a very difficult situation in which he did have not much socialization. The staff and volunteers have been working with him to gain his trust and help socialize him to the best of his ability. At the golden age of seven years, Roscoe is now looking for a solid foundation in a calm, patient household. He is more fond of women, so a strong female leader is something that would do him justice. Ongoing socialization, daily routine, and decompression time would highly benefit him in his new home. We are unsure how he feels about other dogs, so dogs are required to do a supervised visit prior to adoption. He would do best in a home with adults only. He did previously live with another dog and cats. If placed again with cats, we ask for a very slow, well-managed introduction. Roscoe walks well on leash, knows sit, stay and shake! If a golden senior that really deserves a second chance is something you're looking for, Roscoe may be the fella for you!",

Ruff  has  so  much  to give...  this  fun  guy is  active  and  has  a lot of  terrier  personality  so  please  be  ready  to accept  all that 'terrier-ism' that  comes  with him. He  does  well  with  dogs  his  size  or  a bit larger.  Proper introduction  is  helpful. We  prefer not  to place  Ruff  with  smaller  dogs  or  cats.   Ruff  loves  to greet  his  person so it  is  important  to  remain consistent  and  not  allow  any  jumping!  Ruff  will  excel with good  doggie  structure  and  some  basic obedience training.  He needs  an active  lifestyle where  he  is  able  to  expel his energy.  Ruff  likes  car  rides, walks well on a leash, will sit for his  food  and is  housebroken.  Ruff  probably  isn't a candidate  for a small child household due  to  his  energy. If  you  are interested  in meeting Ruff  please  email haltrescue@gmail.com  and we  will  arrange  for a meet if your a match.  He  is  vaccinated, neutered  and  microchipped.  His adoption fee is $250 which allows  us  to  save and rescue another dog in need.",

Ive heard great things about Kansas City so I cant wait to see what all the hype is about when my forever family finds me and takes me home! At 48 pounds, I am the perfect combination of fun and explorative as well as a great cuddle buddy!\nPeople here at Wayside say that I am a friendly, outgoing guy who loves to be close to people. I have been known to weave in and out of legs so I will definitely keep my new family on their toes (otherwise you might trip, ha!). I am a wiggly guy too who loves pets. When I see some of my favorite people coming down my row my whole body just wiggles and wiggles! I can't wait to hang out with them!\nIam treat/praise motivated. I love to learn new things! I am currently enrolled in a training program at the shelter where I am learning all sorts of new things. So far I know how to sit, lay down, and give a nose touch.I love to play with toys and enjoy going on walks. I also love to play with other dogs in play groups here at Wayside!\nRecently, I got to participate in Waysides Waifs Day Out program where a nice volunteer took me outside the shelter to explore the city. It was so amazing! In fact, I even got a new toy and it was really the best day ever.\nI cant wait to meet you and see if we could be the perfect match for each other!\nSee you soon!\nCash\n ...",

            "description": "Queue the 80s music station.. We are the champions, my friend! All kidding aside, did you know that Noland is an Irish name for champion? Well, we have a champion cuddler given the right opportunity! Noland is a pittie, smushy face mix around 2 years old and 52 lbs. He's a friendly boy who makes friends quickly and loves his playtime with the group mates. Strong and athletic, Noland will do best in an active family setting where he can join jogs, be your walking partner or whatever to keep you moving. Other dogs or kids would be fine with him or he'd be OK as your one and only. Noland loves being with people and will happily be your oversized lap dog.\nHe was great in the car, great on a leash, happily sleeps in his crate at night, and not very talkative\n. While he doesn't know too many tricks or commands, he responds quickly to corrections.\nHis good looks can't be completely captured in a photo, so click over to send in an application to meet Noland and he'll meet you at the gate!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

            "description": "Cooper here. Thanks for clicking on my picture so I can tell you a little about myself. I'm a handsome boy if I do say so myself. I'm around 5 years old and I'm done with puppyhood, but I still like to have a good time playing with friends. I had a nice home once and would really like to get back to the movie watching, couch napping world that I had before. I like to exercise regularly to keep myself healthy, but no need to go all out with a full out running schedule. I wouldn't mind being your only dog, but other girl dogs in your house would be fine with me. Kids are certainly welcome too! I don't mind being a work from home partner either and will sit quietly during your conference calls. If you sit down on the floor with me I'll come over and nuzzle my head into your neck to give you a loving hug. If it's okay with you, I'd love to snuggle up in bed at night if I'm invited first. I know to go potty outside, and I don't mind being brushed.\nI'd love to meet you if I sound like your kind of guy. I can be reached by sending an application to Saving Grace and scheduling an appointment. Hope to see you soon!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

            "description": "Omelette you in on a little secret.. Omelette is an amazing boy and we can't believe he hasnt been scooped up yet! He photographs bigger and older than he actually is.. this handsome baby boy is only 6 months old, roughly 40 pounds and so, so eager to please. With just a little basic obedience training and patience, he will make somebody a great companion or family dog.\n\nHe's a very social and active boy who would love another playful pup to run around and play with! Omelette tested well with cats, but if he went to a home with one he would likely need a bit of an acclimation period and plenty of time to adjust and learn the ropes.\n\nOmelette's adoption fee is $245, and he is neutered, microchipped and current on all vaccines. What do you say? Are you ready to scramble things up and add something new to the mix? Perhaps a lifelong canine companion? Omelette's your boy!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please go to our website at www.partnersforpetsil.org and fill out an online application.",

Norbert was surrendered to the shelter because his family was not able to provide proper training and exercise to keep him happy and healthy.  Unfortunately, Norbert has not had much structure in his life.  As a result, he tends to behave like an unruly adolescent.  He likes to run and play and jump all over.  Fortunately Norbert is very food motivated and loves to learn.  He just needs a good teacher.  Norbert is looking for an active home where he will get lots of daily playtime and exercise.  He will also need lots of consistent training to help him learn new things and gain obedience skills.  He is looking for a home without cats or other small animals.  He does like other dogs but tends to be a bit overwhelming to timid dogs.  Norbert would do best in a home with a playful female dog that can keep up with his antics.  If this sounds like your perfect match, come meet Norbert.\n\nAdoption Fee:  $180.00 \n",

She also enjoys other dogs but she takes on the leadership role so a more submissive housemate would work better. She may not tolerate toddlers but older kids with polite dog manners will work with Miss Independent. To meet Jaime, call 513-735-2299 to schedule an appointment.",

Chasing a ball or destroying fluffy toys are one of his favorite activities and he would do great with a family who are willing to help him expend his energy through walks and playtime. He needs a home with children 14 and over because his love of tennis balls is so intense that he doesn't want to give them up when play is over. Junior will also need to be the only pet in his new home. He doesn't like other dogs and can't live with cats but he's got enough love to give so that you won't feel the need for any other pets anyway! If you are looking for a fun, playful dog who loves spending time with his human friends please be sure to stop by and meet our favorite redhead. Junior would love to say goodbye to shelter life and find himself in his new home today!",

In fact, he is a mellow boy who settles easily and gets along well with everyone. Even though Squeeky was raised on a farm with no human interaction, he has excellent house manners and has adjusted exceptionally well since coming into rescue. He is dedicated to be part of the pack, and is quick to learn how to navigate life with his people and their habits. Squeeky has had hip surgery due to an accident, but he has since recovered well. Nonetheless, it would be in Squeeky's best interests for his furever family to continue to ensure he maintains good functioning of his joints so as to have the best quality of life as a family companion. This sweet boy is easy-going and content to hang out on a rug by your feet as you work or curl up with a good book. If you are up for it, he will be more than delighted to show you his fantastic leash manners. Will you give this boy a chance to bring you love and joy for years to come? We are pawsitive you will not be disappointed!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

I am doing my best to adjust to being an inside dog, you see at my previous home I was kept outside and the thought of being allowed inside has me a bit nervous but so far the staff have been reassuring me that it is ok and that I am allowed to be inside the cozy warmth of indoors and I am doing well with it. With that said I am now in search of my own cozy family who is willing to continue working with me getting adjusted to the luxury of being an inside couch potato. I do prefer to live as the only pet but I promise to be all that you need!Interested in adopting?

            "description": "Mia is a wonderful dog, ready for her forever home. She\u2019s been very friendly with all the people and dogs she has met. She's about 9 months old and still has a lot of puppy behavior (like chewing on things!). But she's eager to learn and is starting to recognize things that aren't appropriate chew toys. Mia is very willing to listen and is learning new commands and skills and needs an adopter looking to continue training with her. She's walking well on leash and is good in her kennel. She is not reactive around goats or chickens.\n\nMia weighs about 35 lbs and has a long tail. She's spayed, vaccinated, and microchipped. She tested negative for heartworms and is taking heartworm prevention.\n\nThanks for considering a dog from Texas Cattle Dog Rescue! We place heelers all over the state of Texas.\n\nIf you're interested in one of our dogs, please first complete our adoption application. You can download it at www.texascattledogrescue.com/adopt.html. Our standard adoption fee is $250 +tax for adult dogs, $300 +tax for puppies. Our dogs will be spayed or neutered, vaccinated and heartworm tested before going to a new home. We conduct a home visit to help match up the right dog with the right owner. For more information, visit our website www.texascattledogrescue.com.  Email adopt@texascattledogrescue.com if you have questions.",

She will also need lots of consistent training to help her learn new things and gain obedience skills.  Nina is looking for a home without cats or other small animals.  She does like other dogs and loves going for walks.  Nina would do best in a home that has lots of time and attention to share with her.

I play well in playgroup and love to interact with other dogs. The staff at the shelter say that I am an \"awesome dog!.\" My absolute favorite thing in the entire world are tennis balls and if you're willing to sit and throw one, I will chase it forever! I am a very good boy and I love to play with all other dogs, regardless of size. I have an EXTREMELY HIGH PREY DRIVE and should not be placed in a home with cats or other small animals. I could be an excellent family dog and would be absolutely able to live happily with children of any age. I could be a good pick for any adopter and I think that I would be happiest living in an environment where I would have the ability to run around freely with my new family outdoors (but must have secure fencing because if I see something to chase, I will absolutely go for it!). Whether it is a busy household or a quiet one is not important to me, as long as there are lots of people for me to play with and give love to. I love to go for long leashed walks, cuddle up on the couch and take a nice nap, and am always ready to participate in anything active.",

I love to run around and play! I'm friendly and happy and just want to get to know you. Aside from having tons of energy, sometimes I can be loud, as I don't know how to control my barking yet. You have to remember, I'm a lot like a baby and have not necessarily adapted to a schedule yet so you may find that I'm staying up in my crate at night, and sleeping during the day. I need lots of direction and training, and that doesn't just mean puppy pre-school classes. I need you to show me the right and wrong things to do. Please don't be mad if in the process I wind up chewing some of your belongings or if I have accidents in the house - I promise I will get the hang of things! I require LOTS of time, energy, and patience, but my sweet little face makes it all worth it! This is a learning curve for us both but I promise that if you put the time and energy into helping me grow big and strong, you'll wind up with a wonderful little best friend for life.",

I am a very good boy but I can sometimes be quite protective over my space and my people so I think I would benefit the most from an experienced dog owner who is going to be able to help me learn that I'm not at risk of losing anything. I would be happiest living in a home with a great big yard, or even a farm, for me to run around and play in. That being said, I would need a home with a very secure fence, because I have been known to be quite the escape artist. I am also not unfamiliar to some more negative behaviors like chewing and digging, but I think that with some help I can learn to stop doing that sort of thing. I think that I'd be happy in a busy home with lots of things going on and even though I can be protective, I am also a very friendly pup who likes to receive visitors. I may even be the type of pup that you bring out and about with you on your daily activities. I could certainly benefit from continued training, particularly as it relates to potty-training, but I have learned to love long-leashed walks during my time here at the ranch. My favorite activities include playing fetch, going for long walks or runs, swimming, playing with toys, and most definitely cuddling up on the couch with someone that loves me!",

            "description": "Hi my name is Cysialy but my foster family calls me Ladybug. I am a very smart confident girl  who is learning new things everyday. I am about 6 lbs and definitely a mix of breeds!  Because I came into the shelter at 6 weeks by myself my foster family is working very hard on teaching me to trust and the ways of living with a family. Since I did not spend enough time with my mom and siblings I do like to chew more than normal. But, every day my foster mama tells me I am doing such a good job and that I am a good girl! Because I am a beagle mix I would do best with a fenced in yard. Since I do like to chew and my puppy bites are a little bit harder than normal I would do best in a home without small kids. I would do best with someone who is experience with training dogs. Someone who will be patient with me and understand that I need extra TLC. In time I promise you I will be your best friend and love you unconditionally. My foster mom has been working with a trainer through a sound begging and I am learning so much! I am doing really well on my housebreaking as well - yay! \n\nCysialy should be in a home with a fully fenced in yard and kids 10+. Experienced owners preferred and if there is a resident dog, a balanced, calm one would be best. \n\n\n\nThe adoption fee of $500 will include spay/neuter, microchip, age appropriate/required vaccinations, treatment for heartworm and any other necessary medical treatment to assure a healthy new pup for your family.\n\n\nIMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: Although we do our best to describe breed, since our pups all come from shelters we can not and will not make any guarantee on breed or size. We can tell you that they are 100% RESCUED! And that is the BEST breed!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting/meeting , please visit our website at www.starfishanimalrescue.com or you may complete the online adoption application on our Facebook Page https://www.facebook.com/starfishanimalrescue/app/134425496630143/?ref=page_internal Once you complete and submit your dog adoption application we will set up an appointment to meet this pup!  (the Facebook application will not load from a mobile phone, you must be on a desktop or laptop for this)\n\n*please note that we are a foster home based rescue and we do home visits as part of the adoption process - we are unable to adopt to families who live outside of the Chicago and surrounding suburbs. Thank you for your understanding.",

Do you have a lot of love and time to give?  Sabrina belonged to a \"breeder\" and although she apparently didn't have a \"rough\" life, her life wasn't all that good either.  She has never learned to be comfortable on a walk but she will go out into a yard even if it is only for a short time.  She is very affectionate and at 10 years old, wants nothing more than to be loved on.  If you are interested in this sweetheart, please go to our website \"odas.org\" and fill out the adoption preliminary form.  Once received we will schedule an appointment for you two to meet.",

We do not adopt out of state and only adopt in Illinois within 50 miles of downtown Chicago.\n\nThe Landlord Grinch Who Stole the Christmas  Dog\n\nOk so there was no actual stealing of a dog. But there is a loss of holiday cheer and spirit now that another dog was evicted from the only home he knows. And yes, I wrote this story about a different dog that we eventually never got, but the story is an all to common one and didn\u2019t want to delete it.\n\nI was messaged about a dog who was a present. But I guess he wasn\u2019t allowed to live where he did. Not sure if there was a size restriction or if it just was a no dog building. Although they had him for a year, all we ever hear is the landlord changed their mind. Ain\u2019t there some type of protection against this? I didn\u2019t get too far in the convo because I know having to give up a beloved family member is hard enough. Since he was available as soon as they signed him over, our foster opted to get him within the hour. He wouldn\u2019t get sick, feel \u201ccompletely\u201d sad, and definitely has no idea what it\u2019s like to feel alone.\n\nTugboat is a 3 year old, 40 lb Pug/Corgi/Bulldog mix and my golly Ms. Dolly, where can I get one for myself in 10 years? His first night he humped everything from the couch cushions to the poor two little boys. They got an advance education on the birds and the bees. What a way to make yourself at home with complete strangers.\n\nOur impression of Tugboat is that he would do best in a quiet home with either one or a couple people, kids, and a co-existy type of dog or no dog. He was pretty barky when some plumbers came by but then he wanted to follow them throughout the house. He is still just trying to adjust, wondering where the people he loved for a year went. But even so, after only one day with his fosters, he seems to be pretty attached to the adults vs the kids. I mean the adult legs are probably more stable for the hump compared to a screaming child who is like what is going on?! He also really, really loves going for walks despite his marshmallow puffs for legs and when he does walk, he just glides alongside with you.\n\nBut yeah, you would think because the Grinch had his own dog, things could have been swept down the chimney and Tugboat could have stayed. But since this is real life, this nugget is actually available to find his new home away from Whoville. Apply to adopt Tugboat at leadrescue.org!\n",

This timid boy is about 4 years old and is medium sized. Nino is very house-trained, and is working hard to stay that way during his time at the shelter. \nNino is a very polite leash-walker, and he enjoys going for long, leisurely walks! He enjoys peanut butter, bones, good sniffs, and comfy blankets! \nNino is as sweet as can be, but is very scared in his kennel. He is also easily startled by sudden and/or loud noises inside and outside. We are working with him on gaining confidence and he is already beginning to open up a little bit at a time.\nNino has likely never known what it feels like to be safe and loved, but we have promised him that his best days are still to come. Nino cannot wait for his foster or forever family to scoop him up and take him home - could you be the one to give this sweet boy his happily ever after? \nPlease contact his penpal at costa.alexandrab@gmail.com for more information! \n\n***VIDEOS***\nNino getting some cuddles: https://youtu.be/LIrjfxgHH8Y\nNino enjoying his bone: https://youtu.be/Q9ZneDioaNY\nNino practicing skills: https://youtu.be/0WUDD-SwGrM\nNino takes treats (like the gentleman he is!): https://youtu.be/DOAFHWx9CXs\nNino walking: https://youtu.be/9HLVfsFXjjs\nNino tries out the water!: https://youtu.be/KokK_j1_5QU\n\nMedical Observations: \n1/15 (Vet Check) -- Patient has been on Trazodone and appears to benefit from medication. May consider extension for duration of stay in shelter.\n1/8 (Vet Check) -- (Visual exam only) Patient is currently on Trazodone and appears to benefit from medication. May consider extension for duration of stay in shelter.\n12/18 (Vet Check) -- Generalized erythema observed may be secondary to allergies v. excited behavior. Previous pyoderma has resolved - patchy alopecia seen may continue to improve or remain permanent. \n12/11 (Vet Check) -- Patient appears calm and easily approachable - will likely benefit from Trazodone extension\n12/3 (Vet Check) -- The patient's kennel presence has improved significantly in care. He may be benefitting from trazodone administration, or has adjusted to the shelter environment. Trazodone will be continued.\n11/26 (Vet Check) -- Patient presents with mild pyoderma likely secondary to allergies. He appeared quite nervous in the kennel (shaking and lip licking) but eventually allowed to be taken out for examination. Will benefit from Trazodone for duration of stay in the shelter.\n11/25 (Intake Exam) -- Skin irritation; yeast on belly. Tartar on teeth.\n\nBehavior Observations: \n1/14 (Per Volunteer) -- Nino and I spent the afternoon together, traveling from the shelter to Neshaminy Park (about 30 minutes), walking in the park for about 2 hours, and then traveling back to the shelter. In the car on the way to the park, Nino never barked or scratched to get out of the car, despite being unsettled in a new environment. He just paced a bit in the backseat and seemed to have trouble sitting still with so much stimulation outside. He had also just come out of his kennel, so his stress and energy levels were both high.\nOnce we arrived at the park, Nino was happy to be outside and took in ALL the sniffs! His nose was almost always down on the ground enjoying the new smells for the first 30 minutes of our walk. We walked the trails for about an hour, and Nino was on high alert for this time, noticing each stranger who passed by. I attempted to give treats and get his attention, but he was too interested in our surroundings to be able to focus or take any treats. He was still very much enjoying the walk, though, and even dipped his feet into the water when we walked to the coast! \nAfter about an hour of walking, Nino's overall demeanor noticeably shifted. He began responding to my calls for attention and began taking treats! Once I saw that he had become more relaxed, we practiced some training and played some attention games - and he showed me what a smarty pants he is! We practiced \"sit\" with the clicker, and we also worked on name recall, and he did incredibly well with both. \nUp until the last 45 minutes or so, we had not come across any other dogs. Once we were set up at a picnic table (in a grassy area removed from the paths) practicing these skills, we began seeing dogs go by, but they were far enough away that I was able to recall Nino's attention when he was becoming fixated. It was amazing to see him begin turning toward me (away from the trigger) after the first few times we tried it! We were far enough away from the triggers that once he understood that turning to me meant treats & rewards, he could take his attention off of the dog - it was amazing to watch! \nAfter we practiced for awhile, Nino enjoyed a yummy bone and some time just relaxing and getting pets - this was also a HUGE step. When I first met Nino about 2 weeks ago, he wouldn't really come near me and was extremely hand shy. To see him open up like this is such a privilege - I'm tearing up just thinking about him! \nThen we made our way back to the car for the trip back to the shelter. Once we arrived, we met Rob in the parking lot, and Nino ran right up to him for pets! It was amazing! He wasn't shy and eagerly wanted to greet him. While it always breaks my heart to bring him back, this was really a wonderful day and I can't wait for our next time together. \n1/12 (Per Foster Staff) -- Kennel Presentation: Easy to leash/social - Standing at kennel door with tail wagging. Attempted to push out several times but was easily leashed. On return to kennel, Nino jumped up on the neighboring dog's kennel and sniffed her through the door with his tail wagging. He was interested in her but handler was able to redirect him by calling him and tugging the leash gently. Entered kennel without issue. Walks well on the leash with minimal pulling, but occasionally pulls towards interesting smells or other animals (passed a cat in the parking lot and he pulled hard towards it). Loose/Allows all handling - Allowed allover handling, loves butt scratches! Solicits some attention and pets by approaching handler with tail wagging, but is timid. Engages in tag. Chased a few toys when tossed, but minimal interest. Likes busy bones and chicken jerky treats -- will sit for tasty treats. Evaluated gold. Recommend Playgroup - Had a positive interaction with his neighboring dog in the kennel.\n12/22 (Per Staff) -- At front of kennel on approach with tail wagging. Easily leashed and removed from kennel. Walks nicely on leash. In yard, takes a minute of coaxing before he will approach handler but then accepts slow pets with slightly stiff body. No issues returning to kennel. In kennel, loosens up and allows pets again with loose body. Making Available.\n12/18 (Per Vet) -- very excited, able to take out of kennel without issue\n12/13 (Per Staff)-- He was timid coming out the kennel but allowed himself to be leashed easily. He walked outside and did not pull on the leash, he did not solicit pets and when a volunteer handler first reached out to have him sniff him, he slinked back a little but then sniffed. With some time he warmed up and walked well on the leash and participated in the photoshoot. He was returned easily to the kennel, allowing for pets and for the leash to be easily removed. \n12/11 (Per vet) -- calm, tail wagging; no barking and panting\n12/6 (Per Staff) -- On walk, encountered dog and was reactive, lunging and hard barking.\n12/6 (Per Staff) -- Kennel Presentation: Easy to leash/social. Loose and wiggly at front of kennel. Easy to leash and remove from kennel. Easy to return and unleash.\nLeash Skills: Pulls Moderately On Leash\nHandleability: Tense/Allows all handling. Allows handling all over but tense throughout interaction. Does lean into handler when getting his rear scratched.\nTag: Engages in play\nToys: No interest\nColor Level: Blue\n12/3 (Per Vet) -- Calm at kennel front, wagging tail. No barking or growling\n12/1 (Per Staff) -- Nervous. Shaking when handler approaches but does approach kennel front. No interest in treats. Does not retreat when handler opens kennel door and presents leash. Easily leashed but does not move forward to exit kennel immediately. Allows handler to sit in kennel opening with him and then approaches to sniff handler. Handler moves to floor and, after initial hesitation, Nino follows handler out of kennel. Returning to kennel, Nino follows handler in and is easily unleashed. Leash Skills: Pulls Minimally On Leash\nHandleability: Tense/Allows all handling. After urinating and defecating in yard, explores yard and then returns to handler. Is still shaking and tense but allows pets all over starting slowly from rear and then up to front of body. After two to three minutes of handling, starts to lean into pets and loosens up a bit. Tenses at loud noises from the street.\n11/29 (Per Staff) -- Shaking and whale eyed in kennel when approached. No interest in treats either from hand or dropped on kennel floor. Refused to approach when leash was presented and kennel door was opened. Remained tense, shaking, whale eyed and growling but did not move towards or away from handler. Ended interaction.\n11/26 (Per Vet) -- nervous, shaking and lip licking in corner of kennel but allowed to be taken out of kennel for examination; tolerated examination but remained cautious\n11/25 (Per Vet) -- Friendly; fearful; BAR.\n11/24 (Per Owners) -- Bite case, protective of toys, aggressive.\n\n**BITE DETAILS** \n11/24 -- The victim took mail from the dog when she attempted to give the mail back to the dog he bit her right hand.",

I was scheduled to be EU'd for space that afternoon when TLP magically found a way to save me. I am so glad they did, because I am truly the world's happiest girl and I have so much love to give.\n\nI adore everyone I meet. I might be a little shy at first, but I'll still come up and ask for love. I especially like to have my belly rubbed! I'm extra extra playful, so I would do best with bigger kiddos who can handle my size.\n\nI'm a real dog's dog! I looooove my dog pals -- big, small, male, female -- they're all my best friends, as far as I'm concerned. My favorite thing is to spend the morning romping around with other dogs, then curling up with (OK, on top of) them for a nap. I'm currently being treated for heartworms, so it's super important that I don't play too hard right now. I'm especially curious about chasing kitties ... I probably shouldn't go to a home with cats.\n\nI love to go on adventures, as long as you promise to let me ride shotgun. There's nothing better than getting to look out the window as the world rolls by. I'm awesome on the leash (I might pull if I see a squirrel, but it's easy to get my attention) and I'm an angel in my crate. I don't mind snoozing in there for hours while you're away! I'm a smart lady and I know all my basic commands -- and then some! I even know roll over (I figured out fast that \"roll over\" is an excellent way to get more belly rubs). \n\nI have the goofiest ears, but I'm sooper srs about cuddling. In the evenings, I'm all about getting those couch cuddles!! I love to get up on the couch with my foster family and snuggle for hours. \n\nDog-friendly, playful, adventurous and super affectionate? I'm pretty much the ultimate good girl. Apply to meet me!!",

He was extremely skinny as you can see in the photographs. His ribs, hip bones and spine are not supposed to be so visible ? We will be working with him to help him put on some healthy weight and to learn that his life is about to change for the better. He is an incredibly sweet affectionate boy and loves to get attention from his people. We have a feeling he got none of it from where he came from. We will be posting updates as we get to know more about his personality and what we feel would be the best type of home for him. Walter is almost 2 years old and is a mixed breed. He probably has several adorable breeds mixed in so it is difficult for us to know how to describe him other than SWEET! If you are interested please fill out our adoption application found at www.countryclubkennels.com, or feel free to call us at 540-788-3559.",

            "description": "Delilah is a 9-week-old mixed breed rescued from a high-kill shelter. This dog is current on vaccinations, microchipped, and spayed/neutered. This puppy is currently in foster care learning home etiquette, kennel training, and housebreaking. We would love for you to meet this puppy and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: While we typically host weekly Saturday adoption events, in order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment and/or adoption handoff. Appointments and handoffs are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, adoption appointments and handoffs are only offered for individual animals. When adopting at an appointment, please be aware that you will be taking the animal home that day. We can not hold animals to be picked up at a later date.\n\nDue to CDC's recommended COVID-19 protocols, we are highly encouraging foster homes and adopters to speak with one another via phone or video chat to ensure compatible matches and limit in-person contact. If meeting in person, our foster homes are encouraged to wear masks, socially distance, and choose an outdoor meeting spot. Should you want to proceed forward with the adoption, all adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees are to be completed electronically. Quick and low-contact animal handoff is also being encouraged amongst foster homes and adopters. As always, we include a one-week trial period with all our adoptions.\u00a0***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption! If you would like more information on our organization please visit our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org.",

She is up to date on her vaccinations, spayed, house trained, crate trained, microchipped and heartworm negative.  Millie loves little kids and does best with calm dogs or as an only pet.  We are unsure of her behavior around cats.  Millie is strong on a leash during walks but does well with her harness.  She enjoys a fenced in back yard where she can run, play and explore.  Millie is easy to own and easier to love and snuggle!  If interested in adopting Millie, please complete an application today at www.secondchanceforpets.com.\n\n**NOT ALL PETS LISTED ON OUR WEBPAGE ARE IN OUR FOSTER HOMES.

            "description": "Sweet Pea is a 1 year old female Boxer/Shepherd mix. She weighs 47 pounds. Back in July 2019, Sweet Pea was adopted from the Collierville Animal Shelter when she was a 9 week old puppy. Her former owners recently surrendered her because they couldn't care for her any longer. This wonderful girl is a little heartbroken and is learning to trust people again after being back in the shelter. For this reason, she can be shy when meeting new people. She is very gentle and if you sit beside her, she will lay her head in your lap and lick your hands. Everyone in the shelter is in love with her.  Although she is dog friendly, she does not like sharing a home with another dog. For that reason, she will need to be the only pet in the home. \n\nUpdate: since being at the shelter for a few weeks now, she has really opened up and has become super outgoing and playful! She seems to be housebroken and walks well on a leash.\n\nADOPTION HOURS: \n\nWe are currently adopting out animals by appointment only Tuesday through Sunday 1:00 P.M. through 4:00 P.M. with an approved application. To fill out an application, please go to: https://collierville.com/departments/animal-services/animal-shelter-pet-adoption and email it to: casinfo @colliervilletn.gov\nOnce your application has been approved, we will call you to set up an appointment.\n\n\n\n\n",

She will be a great addition to her forever home when she finds it! \n\nIf you would like to meet Reba, the first step in the process is to complete an application.

            "description": "Posted 1/25/2021. Hugh came to Furry Friends Network from a shelter after he was found as a stray.  He is thought to be 4-5 years old and is neutered and up to date with his vaccinations.  He is crate trained and housebroken.  He enjoys playing tug , chewing on bones and going for hikes. He lives with two adults, one cat and two 10 year old dogs.  Hugh would love for the resident dogs to play with him and is respectful, but the dogs have no interest.  He is learning basic commands and walks generally well on a leash.  He does get excited when he sees another dog but can be re-directed with treats.  Hugh has skin allergies that require bathing 1-2 times a week using a medicated soap and using an ear rinse 1-2 times a week.  He has been very well behaved in his foster home and is allowed total freedom.  He would love a yard and another dog to play with since he still has some young dog energy.  Give this guy a chance at finding a forever home!\n\nAdoption application, home visit and adoption fee required.

Now don\u2019t let my age scare you I have plenty of energy for some walkies which I definitely need so that I can lose some weight but I also love a good cuddle on the couch ? I am just a ball of happiness just waiting for my forever family! I am good with both large dogs and small dogs or id be perfectly okay as an only dog because well that just means more attention for me ? I am house trained and need to be let out a few times a day just like any normal dog. The crate is not my favorite place to be and I will cry a little but eventually I learn to settle. \n\nSince I am older in age I only eat soft food as I had to have a dental and lost a few teeth so it\u2019s just easier for me. \n\nI am up to date on my shots, microchip and fixed for the adoption fee of $150.
