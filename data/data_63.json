He must be able to sleep with his person, he does sleep under the covers. He is great with dogs, just not dogs over say 20lbs. He is good with kids just as long as they give him space. He loves the yard, loves to wrestle. He would love a fur friend. He has had a full dental. He will mark so belly bands are used until he figures out the rules.\nIf you meet his requirements and feel you could give him a life long home please apply at Someone2love.org",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Yahtzee! I was rescued by an animal shelter in Georgia before arriving at the Big Dog Ranch Rescue. But then I was brought to the Big Dog Ranch and Rescue, along with my very best friend Bingo, and I'm hoping that they can help me find a new forever home here! Bingo and I became good friends while at the shelter because he was sad about his owner surrendering him so I helped him feel better. We were always told that we are just the SWEETEST boys! They describe me as a \"big goofball.\" I love to ride around in the car, eat lots of food, and just want to be your best friend. I'm not quite potty trained yet but I'm getting there! I don't mind being walked on a leash but I absolutely love to play in a fenced in area and would be perfect for a home with older children, since I don't always know quite how big I am. The staff at the shelter thought that I may have been hit by a car at some point in my life because of the way that my hip sticks out. You can tell that it bothers me, but it doesn't stop me from living life and loving everyone that I meet!",

            "description": "Noel is our very special little girl! Noel is about a year old and cute as can be! She is a petite, blue-eyed, busy body. We pulled Noel from the shelter knowing she had some neurological issues. We couldn\u2019t just let her sit there in the shelter confused and in need of help. What we\u2019ve seen at times is she can be a little wobbly, high steps or hops, circles to the left, etc. (I\u2019ll be real honest... it\u2019s very cute and you almost can\u2019t even tell she has an issue.). She loves to run and she\u2019s fast! Noel has no idea that she is any different than other puppies. She\u2019s alert, runs and plays hard and gets into crazy husky puppy shenanigans. Her visit with the neurologist resulted in a MRI and spinal tap showing all normal. They started her on antibiotics just to cover bases and in case it\u2019s something microscopic. He said it could be something that happened to her in utero. They want to recheck her in 6 months (July) unless things change. For now, that\u2019s just how she is.... special ?. Noel is a wild child.  She needs a home without small/young kids and no other dogs in the home.  Her idea of playing is jumping up, being mouthy and, in her mind, play biting.  It seems she wasn\u2019t socialized when she was growing up.  Noel is very reactive to other dogs.  We aren\u2019t sure if it has to with over stimulation, socialization or just how she is.  She is adorable but will need a patient adult to understand and work with her.  Noel is current on vaccines, spayed, microchipped and on monthly prevention.

I'm a cuddlebug, I learn quickly and I am always eager to please.\n\nMy foster mom says that I'm a couch potato. I do enjoy walks and playing with my toys, but I love me a good nap! I'm very playful with other dogs and I get along great with them. I haven't met any cats, but I don't try to chase small critters on walks. I'm great with kids, too!\n\nI'm still working on my leash manners, but I'm patient and smart so I'm getting better! Also, I hope you don't mind me on your couch. That's my favorite place to nap... and don't blame me if I snore a little!\n\nIf it sounds like I would make the perfect addition to your family, apply to meet me!",

He is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4482449.\n\nTurtle is a young, energetic pup that really likes people. He enjoys his walks but does pull hard on the leash because he's so happy to get out and GO!! He loves to be petted and always looking for attention. He's a smart boy too and knows \"sit\" and \"no\". He loves toys and loves to fetch. He loves his treats and takes them gently.\n\nBecause Turtle has so much energy and can be jumpy and mouthy at times, he cannot go to a home with children. He needs behavior training so he can learn his manners. He has already demonstrated how smart he is and now he needs the right adopter to show him he can still have fun in a new home. If you think Turtle would be a good fit for you, please come and meet him today!\n\nTo visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show, and we have seen that you can generally show up and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog and the shelter will squeeze you in, except from 12-3PM or closer to the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

(I\u2019m unsure of the status of the other dog). Cheyenne needs more socialization with people and loves playing with other dogs. We are getting her into a husky savvy foster home with other dogs. We hope they can show her that things will be ok and bring her out of her shell. She\u2019s a sweet girl who just needs some reassurance. Of course, this poor girl is heartworm positive and needs to be spayed. She has had vaccines, deworming and started monthly preventions. To setup a meeting with Cheyenne or find out more, please e-mail adopt@mushrescue.com.",

Bruno is a 2 year old pit bull and great dane mix who is a really sweet pup, but is also extremely strong and requires an owner who has experience handling extremely strong dogs. His previous owners describe him as very sweet and playful, but sometimes doesn't know his own size. We believe he would fit in best with a family that either has teenagers or no children at all. Bruno also thinks cats are toys, so he needs to go to a home without any. When Bruno gets home, make sure he has a LOT of toys! If he isn't kept occupied, he might turn the furniture into a chew toy. Bruno is an amazing dog who deserves an amazing home. Could he come home with you?",

            "description": "Tovi is living in a foster home. Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet him.\n\nTovi is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~3 years\nWeight: ~68lbs\nHousebroken: Working on it! He needs to be on a strict schedule \nCrate trained: Hasn't been left alone much and will require an adopter that can continue to work on him being comfortable when he is left solo. \nDog sociability: Friendly with dogs on walks - can pull hard when he wants to meet another dog. We think he would do well with a playful dog in the home.\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Not a match - he can guard resources (toys/bones/etc).\nIdeal home: Tovi would love a home that can dedicate time to training. He will do best with an adopter that is good at reading body language. He is a big, active guy that will love to go on long walks or runs and will need an active adopter!\n\nTovi is the most social dog! He jumps to greet, hug, and kiss any new human he meets, but he's not focused on one species - he would also love to be part of a dog pack, following other dogs he sees on walks and will always try to join their parties whether they are real or perceived. He also loves long runs and longer walks, but when he comes home from that he will be a pretty chill dude and might even snuggle... until anyone goes into the kitchen. Tovi is charmingly clumsy and will walk into stationary objects multiple times a day and doesn't seem to know he's not pocket-sized.\n\nTovi's adoption fee is 300. He will be neutered on a future date (1/21) and a 50 refundable neuter deposit will be required. He is up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

She was found neglected and starving on a vacant property in Baltimore with her sister, who unfortunately died. Since River has been safe in our care, she has been working hard to gain weight and overcome her fears. Through it all, her loving, sweet nature has continued to blossom and we are overwhelmed at her resilience. In this second chance of life, she needs to be the only animal in a home where she can be the one and only to a forever family who will give her all the patience and love she deserves and will be committed to helping her build her confidence.

He is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4516387.\n\nThis guy is a sweet, gentle dog that recently came into the shelter with some medical issues and some of them have been resolved. He had a hernia that was repaired by the clinic vet. This dog is leash trained and walks very well on a leash. When he was introduced to other dogs, he was social but didn't want to play too much. He is gentle with people but does get a little nervous when someone walks by him that he doesn't know.\n\nThis dog does have lameness with one of his back legs and needs to see a full service vet to determine his course of treatment. If you can help this sweet dog, please come to the shelter and meet him today!\n\nTo visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show, and we have seen that you can generally show up and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog and the shelter will squeeze you in, except from 12-3PM or closer to the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

He is friendly in his kennel and has a great smile. Hulk is treat-motivated and knows how to sit. He is so ready to find a forever home! To adopt Hulk, apply at ITVrescue.org.\n\nAll of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heartworm tested and treated if necessary.\n\nPlease realize that many of our animals are kept in foster homes. Please complete an adoption application at http://itvrescue.org/adoption-application/ in order to meet with one of our animals. There is no obligation in completing the application, but it helps us find an animal that is most appropriate for your family.  The ITV Rescue Center is open Tuesdays 12-5; Wednesdays 12-7; Thursdays 12-5; Fridays 12-5 and Saturdays 10-5.  The Rescue Center is located at 1417 N. Stockwell Road.  You are welcome to come to our rescue center during open hours to see all of our great adoptable animals. Thank you for your interest in our animals!\n\nNOTE: Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

He is the 1st to wake up and attack your feet, pull at your pant legs, or get into something new and exciting! He never stops it seems, he's up playing well after everyone else is sleeping. He picks on his brothers and sisters in an attempt to make them play. As I sit here and write this he stares at me like a cat ready to pounce - all the others are fast asleep! He is a sweetheart when he slows down!\n\nBirthday 10/16/2020 Pictures of their mom Nola are on the site also. Best guess for what they are mixed with.......chihuahua, border terrier, dachshund, and who knows what else, with that they will be on the small side. Best guess 15lbs or less. No small children, please. The adoption fee is $300 ($250 adoption includes spay/neuter surgery at our assigned vet & the $50 alter deposit will be refunded once you send in proof that you had the surgery completed.)

He is the 1st to wake up and attack your feet, pull at your pant legs, or get into something new and exciting! He never stops it seems, he's up playing well after everyone else is sleeping. He picks on his brothers and sisters in an attempt to make them play. As I sit here and write this he stares at me like a cat ready to pounce - all the others are fast asleep! He is a sweetheart when he slows down!\n\nBirthday 10/16/2020 Pictures of their mom Nola are on the site also. Best guess for what they are mixed with.......chihuahua, border terrier, dachshund, and who knows what else, with that they will be on the small side. Best guess 15lbs or less. No small children, please. The adoption fee is $300 ($250 adoption includes spay/neuter surgery at our assigned vet & the $50 alter deposit will be refunded once you send in proof that you had the surgery completed.)

I am a people lover and haven\u2019t met a human who hasn\u2019t been smitten with me.  I love to go for car rides, and I love spending time with my person.  I\u2019m looking for a family that\u2019s not too high energy that I can just hang out with, play with and love.  My foster mom thinks I\u2019m pretty mellow with other dogs too, so we could do a meet a greet if I might have a four legged sibling.  I\u2019m non-reactive with all of the barn animals at my foster home as well. I\u2019m a big boy, but have a nice energy level and when on walks, I walk nicely by your side and won\u2019t pull you around.  In fact, I\u2019m one of the dog walker\u2019s favorites!  When I am out playing, I\u2019m a good boy.  I won\u2019t take my eyes off you, and I will stay close by.  I hope you won\u2019t hold it against me, but I am missing one of my ears and no one knows what happened.  I don\u2019t hold any grudges though, I just want to be loved.  If you ask me I think having one ear makes me uniquely cute.  How may people can say they have a one eared dog?  Check out my pictures.  I am housetrained and great inside.   I\u2019m perfectly happy to cuddle quietly all day on the couch.  I may have been left alone outside for long periods in my past, because I don\u2019t care for being left outside alone for too long.  If left out for long periods by myself, I have been known to escape only to be found waiting on the porch.  LOL.  I am hoping to get a family of my very own who will love me, play with me and give me the attention I so enjoy.  In return you will get the most loyal and loving friend you have ever had.  To learn more about me or meet me in person please contact Martina Animal Rescue at martinaanimalrescue@yahoo.com or text (707) 326-6114.\nLove, Finn",

He has been with us for over a year now. \n\n?Adoption fee has been paid by a fee fairy but normal adoption process will be taken. \n\nGood with kids but may knock over little ones. \n\nNo cats. \n\nGood with non dominant females who are okay with rough play. He does well with 2 of 4 of my females and did well with the female in his foster home. \n\n?Fully vetted. \n\nApprox 3 years old and 100 pounds. ??\n\nHe needs guidance and constant supervision but he's really a good dog! I can just see him hurting himself if someone isn't paying attention. He would make a super companion though as he loves to cuddle and play. He listens well for the most part but is like having a 2 year old child on steroids. \n\nApply for adoption at leannsanimalrescue.com",

This means she is the only animal in the house, and does not socialize well. A fenced in yard is ideal, as she can be difficult to take on walks due to her dislike for other animals. She is easily redirected, but a yard is the best bet. \n\nWiggles is a high energy dog for her age, although she does wear down quickly. She would do best in a home that does not have small children around. \n\nHer perfect home would be a single adult or couple that just loves to cuddle and have a little bit of playtime each day. She is extremely loving and just needs the right person to love her for the rest of her days. ??\n\nHer adoption fee is $75.\n\nApply for adoption here: https://form.jotform.com/201864583528059",

He knows how to sit. He is very strong when on leash and smart - can figure out how to open a gate. Always recommend meet and greets when other dogs are in the home.

He is crate trained and has not pottied in his crate. We are not sure how he is with housetraining as he has only been in kennels since being rescued. He appears to not like other dogs next to him in kennel s. So he may need to be an only pet. Was cat tested at shelter and does not get along with cats. He is being treated for heartworm infection and is not contagious. It is curable and would require coming back to the rescue for three injections over a three month period. We cover all costs.

Its from a birth defect or old injury, but it doesnt slow him down.\nSam is about 5 years old, neutered, and heartworm negative. Hes got a great temperament with people and seems to love everyone.\nSam is dog selective, so a meet and greet with your dog would be necessary. He needs a home without cats. \nIf youre interested in this beautiful boy, please fill out an application",

Fiona is a little fearful of men, but once they give her a hamburger and a little time she warms up. She has been fearful of very young kids. She did not test well with cats . She's a little nervous here at the rescue and would love a nice warm place to call home. We could see her doing well with a single woman perhaps or a couple w a quiet home. She's extremely sweet once she trusts you. Text Casey if you'd like to meet Fiona 570-441-0083!",

A kind elderly lady started feeding him and asked BARL to get him to the shelter. Once we picked up, soon-to-be-named Clark, we immediately got him the care and good nutrition he needed. He now loves to play and chase tennis balls, enjoys treats, and is a real sweetie. His spirit has lifted and he is ready for a new start in life. Adoption, anyone?

We like to refer to him as the resident blockhead. Weighing in at almost 75 lbs and all muscle, Nipsey doesn't know how big and powerful he is, and all he wants to do it play. Nipsey is a complete mush who lacks any training on basic commands, leash walking, and is extremely jumpy when he gets excited. His team is working with him to establish boundaries and basic training. \nNipsey has tested well with dogs and seems to know his place with cats. At this point we are saying no to kids, due to Nipsey's jumping tendencies. \nNipsey is UTD on his shots and neutered. \nIf you are interested in Nipsey, please fill out an application online.",

Not knowing much about Maddie's past life, we can tell that she is nervous around new people and situations and will look to her handler for reassurance, but a few treats will pave the way to Maddie's heart. Once you earn this girls trust, she is longing for your affection. \nMaddie is working on practicing basic commands and her leash walking skills and learning how to play with toys. Maddie loves to go on walks and would be an ideal hiking partner. \nDue to Maddie's nervous tendencies around new people, we are seeking an adult only home or a home with children 12+ .\nMaddie needs to be the only dog as she has shown signs of aggression when encountering other dogs. \nIf you are interested in Maddie please fill out an application today.",

Apartments ok.\nSpecial Info:\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

Sweet and loyal, Hailey greets her buddies with the most excited wiggles, and she's always up for going on a walk or just hanging out and getting pets! Hailey has a nice medium energy level and enjoys taking leisurely walks on low-traffic routes and hiking trails. She'd make a great adventure buddy for someone who likes to explore the great outdoors as much as she does. Hailey has excellent manners in the home, is fully house and crate-trained and doesn't show any destructive tendencies. Hailey would love a low key and calm place to call home, where she can relax with her people after taking some fun outdoor adventures. This smart girl also enjoys learning new things and is in APA!'s Total Obedience Program (TOP), which is modeled after the AKC's Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Hailey has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help her learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! Once Hailey successfully completes all the skills on her training plan, she will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Check out a video on APA's CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Sweet, intelligent and beautiful, Hailey will make a wonderful companion to some lucky person. Come meet her, she'd love for you to pet her fluffy coat!",

            "description": "Button is aptly named because this sweet guy is as cute as any you've ever seen. Button always seems to be smiling, and his super-expressive ears perk up as soon as he sees his human friends, which is just about anyone. This handsome pup loves meeting new people and is ready to snuggle up to them immediately. Button is the perfect combination of couch potato and playmate and is down for whatever you are. But when he senses that it's playtime, Button quickly shifts into clown mode and loves to bounce around and have fun. Then when playtime is up, he's ready to snuggle again. Button is house-broken and would prefer to not have a crate - but the good news is that he doesn't need one - he is fine when left free to roam the house. He is not one for dog parks or the hustle and bustle apartment life, but would prefer a home with a yard where he can have plenty of room to show off his tricks. He's very eager to please and proving how trainable he is in APA!'s Total Obedience Program, so much so that he recently became TOP Dog Ready, which means Button has already learned all the skills in his training plan! The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC's Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. Dogs in the program learn skills including sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers, calmly walking past another dog, staying in a sit or down until told 'free,' coming when called and 'Place', which means Button will go to a specific place in your home on command. Button has worked hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA's Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with him after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA's CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Button would love an adult only home with a family that's comfortable setting boundaries. In return, he promises to be the best boy he can be. Come meet him!",

If you are really patient, feed him chicken every time he looks at you as a reward, soon he will come around and start following you. Next, he will seek out touch. BJ is a bit like a cat, if he did not ask to be touched, he will not let you pet him. BJ's owner died of COVID 19 and BJ and his sister Boots were left outside to be fed randomly for weeks by family members. They were pretty traumatized when they arrived to the rescue. Boots has been adopted. BJ just needs a safe, quiet, and unconditional home to retire to. With patience and time, he will be your best buddy.\n\nBJ is attracted to women best. BJ loves his walks and lives to go out exploring. Once he lets you put on his harness he will enjoy his daily strolls,\n\nWe supply all foster homes with a care package and food to be sure the dog has all they need.\n\nIf you have the time, space, and patience to give BJ a warm, loving home for the rest of his senior years, he will be a loyal pup. He is now on a Human grade and raw diet. BJ loves both the foods, but lives for the raw, I use it to feed him by hand and gain his trust. When BJ arrived, he looked 5 years older. The food has given him a healthy coat, clearer eyes, and better energy. BJ has trimmed down to perfect weight, has regained muscle mass, and walks well. BJ does well with all the dogs here and has recently tried to engage a few in play. I think he misses boots and will do best in a home with other small breeds who are dog friendly. He loves to go for walks.\n\nIf BJ is listed, he is available. To fill out an application to adopt Please use this link, You will need a computer to complete as cell phones will drop the application\n\nhttp://rompinpawsrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms/\n\nThe site will ask you to create a password and will send you an email. For ease of use, just use the password they create for you and save that password. This will ensure you have access and can fill out the application.",

            "description": "Hello, my name is Bonnie \nPlease take a moment to read my bio and share me to find a loving forever home. I am between 1-2 years old and was put out of my owners car and abandoned after I used the bathroom in their car. The lady who seen this happen to me was next door cleaning a business when he came over to ask her for some cleaning supplies to clean up his car. When she went back out, I was standing there not knowing where I was or if my owner was coming back for me. I was so confused why he was so mad at me and could just leave me because I had an accident. The lady got me to safety since I was standing in the middle of the road and contacted my rescue. I had also recently had puppies when I was dumped as well. My rescue told me they would find me a home where I will never be dumped out ever again and left like a piece of trash in a parking lot. My rescue feels I need to be an only dog until slowly introduced to others. I wag my tail but while doing so, I lunge and bark. I don\u2019t snap growl or try to bite so slow introductions will be the best thing for me. Someone familiar with my breed and older children will be best since I pull on a leash and very strong. I just get so excited! i was in a temp home until I went to boarding since my finder couldn\u2019t foster me. She said I am house trained as well as crate trained. I do need a yard with a sturdy high fence and it can\u2019t be chain link. I climbed the chain link fence at boarding and got stuck on the top trying to get out when I first arrived so I need at least a 6ft vinyl or wood fence that is built to the ground. I really am a good girl and just want a good home. I came into rescue before Christmas and seen lots of dogs come and go but I haven\u2019t been chosen yet. If  your interested in loving me forever, please contact my rescue through this site or send them an email to faithhopeandlove.rescue@yahoo.com\nLove \nBonnie",

I was Bob-Bob-Bobbin' along at a shelter in Kentucky for some time.See, I was picked up as a stray. Not sure how my boat went adrift but the shelter notified MARR and these nice people came down and busted me out of there. Now Im staying at this great place with a bunkandgrub, and overall, I've beensailing along with the wind at my back. My foster crew say I am happy, playful and pretty full of energy! I like all of the humans I have met so far. I am currently sailing\nalong with 2 other rotties that are females and 4 cats. I am quite passive about the cats. I just don't find them all that exciting/interesting! However, there is one that I just love to play with. We chase each other around the house and have so much fun. Even though Im a big guy, I dont hurt them at all. My crew tells me thats a good thing.I do need to let you know, I had an experience that I was not very thrilledaboutwhen we came into port\none day. I was taken off to a place called the Vet's Office.All I can say is that if you've hada cold stick put in an unmentionable place for a few seconds (humansnote dog speak for having yourtemperature\ntaken), youmight have let everyone know it most certainly is NOT appreciated. So, theyput this thing on my face at that point, and my crew took note. After we got back on board the ship,my crew started training me on getting used to that thing on my face a muzzle they call it. It says on myMaritimepapers that because we don't have children onboard,no one knows what I would think of them. I am 85 pounds so maybeolder children would be best.While I will go in my kennel or crate, I prefer to be with youversus below deck, so to speak. Since I was adrift for so long and had to scrounge for my grub; I do have some resource guarding issues and I get a little grouchy with my food. However, this may resolve with stability and gaining trust with my new crew. I do know some commands such as sit, stay, laydown/down, no, and leave it. I do need work on leash walking; I get excited and pull quite a bit. I also need some training on give. Once its mine, I dont like to give it up (you know, being on my own for so long and all). So now Im looking to drop my anchorin a differentbay. If I sound like a good mate for you and you want to bring my boat into port forever, please contact MARR. \nBy the way, this is what else my crew had to say about me: Bob loves to play outside and romp around! He is such a goofball and he does well with food motivated training. He is a very smart boy and would be a great dog for somebody who is interested in working on training. Bob would likely be best in a breed-knowledgeable home witha strong and authoritative owner who will make sure to keep him in line. He is a very good pupwith lots of potential.\nBon voyage for now,\nBob",

He was found hit by a car but thanks to some good vet care in SC, has fully recovered with only a small scar on his left chest wall. He was rescued from the Lexington shelter on his last day and what a great save he is! Such a sweet boy who takes treats very gently and loves to give hugs. He's very good with other dogs and enjoys romping with his canine cohorts. His foster in SC says he is also housebroken and crate trained. Springsteen is very grateful to be safe in a home environment but would love to find his forever home for the new year! If you are interested in meeting or adopting Springsteen, please email adoptsch@gmail.com or message the Second Chance Habitat Facebook.",

He has so much love to give and needs someone that has patience and can show him the meaning of love. He is a terrier mix so he always wants to be around humans and making sure his humans are happy and ready to play. He loves treats and knows sit on command and we taught him \"kiss\" as well before he gets his treat. \n\nHe is not much of a digger nor much of a toy player - but I'm sure he would love to play fetch outside with right family. He loves baths and will soak for you. \n\nIf you have already have a dog, we would recommend doing a meet and greet with the dogs to see if they would be compatible.

Large fur-siblings into periodic roughhousing are ideal! No small dogs or kitties, please.\n\nKahlouie Louie loves being with humans and does best loose in the house or confined in the bedroom instead of being crated when left alone. She\u2019s perfected frog-leg stretches, so be prepared to catch her lounging on your bed and couch sporting this pose. What better way to show off her toned legs and buns of steel, after all?! (Don\u2019t be jelly.)\n\nDespite her phenomenal bod, Kahlua Lua is medium-energy. A fenced yard is preferred for this stunning gal, but she\u2019s content with daily exercise via sniff walks and dog-on-dog play, too. And in her piercing blue eye, nothing tops snuggles, snuggles, and more snuggles on the enrichment list.\n\nKahlua is spayed, vaccinated, and microchipped, and she is heartworm-negative and current on flea/tick preventative. Are you ready to turn your home into Kahlua\u2019s Castle and provide her with countless nylabones, antlers, and other hard chews? Apply to adopt this intense beauty today!",

She's a little shy of new people and new dogs, especially big dogs, not as much as Zeke, it only takes her a few minutes and a treat or two to gain confidence. Quinn is still working on potty training, leash training and crate training. She sleeps through the night and is doing well free roaming in the house but still needs frequent trips outside to pee. She is a chewer and will need to be supervised so she doesn't chew on the corners of your furniture. Because of Quinn's energy level she must have a playful companion dog in her forever home. Fenced yard preferred. She will need a family committed to getting her out and about to continue her socialization training. Quinn is likely to grow to about 60lbs as an adult. Puppies are so tempting, their cuteness is hard to resist, but if you're looking for a dog that will hang out on the couch with you all day, with an occasional walk she isn't the dog for you. Her energy level will continue to increase as she matures and gains more stamina.\n\nIt is GSRA policy that we do not adopt dogs under the age of 1 year to families with children under the age of 8 years old.\n\nFor more information on our adoptable pet list please visit: Adoptable Pet List\n\nPlease join us at our next Event(s):\n\nCurrent Scheduled Events:",

He loves being at the creek, walking through the fields, and lounging on the porch, while you enjoy your coffee. . He's a bit bossy and set in his ways,  but so was your ex and that didn't stop you. \n\nHe's an old guy,  but doesn't let his 17 years slow him down much. He loves walks in the great outdoors,  his toys, and his person.  He isn't much on kids or competition.  He prefers to it to be just him and his peeps, taking on the world.

To adopt this large boy, apply at ITVrescue.org.\n\nAll of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heartworm tested and treated if necessary.\n\nPlease realize that many of our animals are kept in foster homes. Please complete an adoption application at http://itvrescue.org/adoption-application/ in order to meet with one of our animals. There is no obligation in completing the application, but it helps us find an animal that is most appropriate for your family.  The ITV Rescue Center is open Tuesdays 12-5; Wednesdays 12-7; Thursdays 12-5; Fridays 12-5 and Saturdays 10-5.  The Rescue Center is located at 1417 N. Stockwell Road.  You are welcome to come to our rescue center during open hours to see all of our great adoptable animals. Thank you for your interest in our animals!\n\nNOTE: Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

            "description": "Chase\nBelgian Malinois mix (pronounced MAL-in-wah) \nAge- around 4-5\n97lbs\nNeutered\nUtd on age appropriate vaccines\nDewormed \nMicrochipped \nAdoption fee- $425.00\n\n\n\nI am a medium-sized Belgian Shepherd dog. I arrived in Minnesota a few weeks ago. I am 4 to 5 years old and weigh about 97 lb. I have spurts of energy but also love my nap time. I enjoy playing with my fosters, chewing on toys, and love play time outside chasing a ball in the game of fetch. I am a working dog and need a sense of structure that includes a lot of exercise. I am learning a lot about being inside a home, I do very well in my kennel, and have never had an accident in the house. I love food and am working on good manners when people are eating or fixing food around me. I am very smart rated 8 in most smart breeds, so I can sit, lay down, and fetch on command but am willing to learn more with my forever family. I am good in the car but I'm very strong so being in a kennel when traveling will keep everyone safe.\n   Things I'm working on are walking on a leash without pulling, boundaries in the house, and learning how to shake. I love my humans and want to be with them most of the time. I get a little nervous when my humans are not around so I would love a family that can spend lots of time with me. I do well in my kennel when left alone, with a few toys to play with while I am by myself.\n  We will be a bit picky on choosing his furever family because of breed. If you are Intrested in this handsome boy  Visit www.Almatailsofhope.org and fill out a dog application ???\n  \n\n *Important info about breed*\n\nHighly intelligent, athletic, and muscular, and exceedingly devoted, the Malinois need to be actively engaged with his owner, both mentally and physically. This is not a dog who can be left in the backyard, and daily walks are not enough, either. Exercise, and plenty of it, preferably side by side with his owner, is paramount to the breed\u2019s happiness. To deprive a Malinois of activity and human companionship is to deprive him of his very reasons for being. Malinois make great running, hiking, and biking companions, and they excel at agility, tracking, herding, obedience.\nChase is a wonderful dog, he is very smart and eager to learn.This breed is a working breed that needs a lot of exercise each day. Chase is not a dog that is going to run around the yard and keep himself busy, he likes to play fetch and is very good at it. He needs a family that can work with him and keep him busy on a daily basis, he is not a once a week dog park dog. The forever family or person needs to be strong on commands and a pack leader when walking on a leash. The person walking Chase needs to be a strong and able to handle a dog with his power. This breed can clear a four foot fence with ease, so a fenced yard over four feet is important. He will make an excellent dog for the right family or person. There are lots of videos on YouTube of people that own this breed and can show you the examples of what makes a happy Belgian Malinois.",

            "description": "Ruby #7450 is a 1-year-old female Shepherd mix. She is a friendly, smart and shy young lady. Her favorite thing to do is sleep on a nice, comfy bed. Her favorite treats are of the human variety: cheese, steak and pepperoni. Ruby is good with older children. She is house and crate trained. Ruby needs work on basic commands and leash training; her shyness gets in the way. She is not a fan of loud noises. She should be walked in a quiet area or neighborhood without frequent passing cars or a lot of other people. Ruby prefers to be left alone while she eats. She may be good with other pets, but will need a slow introduction to ensure good relationships form. She takes a while to warm up to people, but once she does, she\u2019ll be your best friend! She is super sweet and just wants to be loved. She especially loves having her belly rubbed. Ruby is a LCAR momma and came to us with pups in tow. Her pups have all found homes, and now it\u2019s Ruby\u2019s turn! She also came to us with heartworms. We are looking for someone to continue Ruby\u2019s treatment at no additional cost to the adopter. This adoption will be considered a foster to adopt. She weighs 50 pounds and should gain a little weight. This pup is microchipped. We believe you can always teach an \u2018old\u2019 dog new tricks, so we highly recommend continued obedience training for this smart pup; it stimulates the dog's mind and establishes a good dog/adopter relationship. This pup, like all pups, should be on heartworm preventative; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If you are interested in adopting this dog, and are already approved to adopt through our organization, please contact dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with the pup\u2019s name and ID number in the subject line. OTHERWISE, please submit an adoption application online: http://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.org/adoptus.html E-mail dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with questions.

            "description": "****PLEASE READ ENTIRE BIO BEFORE EMAILING****\n\n*Name: Jessie\n*Age: 13 yrs\n*Current Weight: 40 lbs\n*Adoption fee: $300\n\nJessie is a very sweet girl who loves people, kids, and food. She\u2019s 13 years old so she spends most of her days sleeping, but since being in foster care she has started to initiate play with other dogs in the house, and will always get up for food and love! She sleeps on the first floor without issues, but she is suffering from bad arthritis so she is on pain medication and supplements to help keep her comfortable. Her adopter would need to be willing to continue these meds and supplements to help her keep her strength and mobility.\n\nJessie would do best in a home with easy access to the back and/or front yard as she struggles with stairs. She can go down a couple but she is carried down her foster's back stairs because there are 6 of them. She CAN come back up them on her own. Jessie would benefit most from a mostly flat yard or someone who just wants to take her out to do her business a few times a day. Jessie's foster home does have a second floor, but Jessie stays on the main floor since her foster family is there the majority of the day. This girl might be suffering from bad arthritis, but she is happy and sweet and definitely loving life right now!! \n\nTo apply to adopt Jessie, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n**Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an approved application.**\n\n*Health: up to date on required vaccines, spayed, microchipped, has arthritis\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

We believe the children in the home were not taught how to properly interact and respect a dog in the home. When Marshall arrived to us he had indicators that he was used to an unkind treatment. Marshall has been with us a month and has been a complete dream. He is well behaved and has had a wonderful temperament. He loves being around the other dogs. He is living with a 4 and 7 year old children who do know how to properly act with a dog. Marshall was brought to the vet for euthanasia after the child in the home jumped on him and Marshall reacted by biting his hand. The vet didn't believe he was a bad dog, but set up for failure many time, and reached out to us to take him. Even though he has been living with children fine currently, we cannot adopt him into a home with young children due to the circumstances. \nMarshall also has food allergies that make his skin irritated and have hot spots. On the proper diet his skin has done well. There may be some maintenance with medicated baths here and there to help if he seems to need it. The adopter should be aware and willing to change his diet if he begins to have reactions and go to the vet for treatment if needed and life long medications if a diet cannot address the allergies in the future. A raw diet would be best for Marshall and turkey seems to be the protein he does well on. \n \n\nPlease apply at mgarcolorado.org to get started.",

She jumps and turns around with excitement when I let her out in the mornings.\n\nShes a good car rider\n\nCrate trained, the first week I had to leash her and walk her into her crate but the last two weeks she has gone into her kennel all on her own when its time to get her spray cheese and treats. At night at one point, she started trying to get out of her crate (never during the day) but I moved her into a crate in my room and she slept as long as I did without a peep. \n\n She didnt care for the 18-month old in our house, she just steers clear of her\n\nShe seems to be scared of cats\n\nShe knows how to use the doggie door and likes to snooze on the couch\n\nShe will counter surf if things are in her reach and you arent around\n\nShe did wonderful with our lab/basset mix Maggie but it took her a few days to want to play. We always do slow intros. Penny is not aggressive at all but her time on the streets seem to have caused her to be unsure of some pushier dogs at first, she just wants to avoid them completely. She doesn't engage. Maggie doesn't have a barrier issue so we started out with Maggie kenneled and Penny was allowed to just roam the area seeing Maggie from a distance. Maggie didn't bark at her at all. After a couple of days of that, we let them meet each other leashed away from our house, went for a short walk then into our backyard for off-leash play. After a while Penny would engage Maggie to play, they loved to wrestle on the couch. \n\nShe is super submissive\n\nI have never heard her bark\n\nShe never ventured up our stairs but would follow and wait for me to come down.\nShe likes to be out in the yard but doesnt dig (unlike my dogs) (to clarify, our dogs are never allowed out in our yard when we arent home, if we are home our backdoor is open and they are free to go in out and doggie door as they please, our yard is fully fenced with wooden pickets 6ft 6in)\n\nI would recommend a fenced yard for her and a home with another dog that is a good match for her. I would crate her if she will be left unattended for periods, at first she didnt bother things but as she got more comfortable she did get into things, mostly the dog treats \n\nPenny let Maggie take bones from her etc without any issues. We do not feed any of our dogs together they all eat in their kennels but treats have not been an issue. Penny takes everything from you very gently.\n\nShe's one of the sweetest fosters I have ever had! \"\n\n \n\n*Homeownership required!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

We were freezing cold, skin and bones, and terrified. Some people kept watching for us and eventually caught us in their big metal trap. They brought us in to the shelter and now we're learning about a whole new world. We've never felt warmth and love before, so we're pretty scared. We wouldn't hurt a fly, though. We just want to know we're safe. We're both in pretty rough shape right now, but with love and good food, we will blossom into beautiful dogs. Our breed is a mystery. Neptune weighs 13 pounds right now and Natalie weighs 17. We look like we should be larger, but have probably been malnourished all of our lives. We have tan coloring and longer snouts. We're only about 7 or 8 months old, so we should be easy to train once we learn to trust you. Please, won't you show us that people are good?\n\nIf you're interested in adopting me, please don't call these nice people (I can already see that they're very busy!).

PLEASE READ ENTIRE BIO BEFORE EMAILING****\n\n*Name: Inara\n*Age: 3 yrs\n*Current Weight: 30 lbs\n*Adoption fee: $300\n\nHi I\u2019m Inara! I\u2019m looking for a family who can give me lots of love and attention. Unfortunately, I came to SNARR with 2 deformed front legs but I haven\u2019t let that slow me down. I can jump up on the bed and couch... but you will need to help me off. I love to cuddle, chew bones, and give kisses. But most of all I love to wrestle with my bestie Madison. Check her out! She\u2019s also up for adoption and looking for her forever home! Maybe you can adopt us together and make us the happiest pups ever :)\n\nDue to my special needs, I do need to be carried outside to do potty. I am on joint supplements and love to run around - especially with Madison! My foster family is currently in the process of helping me get fitted for my own wheelchair but otherwise I\u2019m comfortable just the way I am! I am house trained but can\u2019t be left for long periods of time.\n\nTo apply to adopt Inara, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n**Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an approved application.**\n\n*Health: up to date on required vaccines, spayed, microchipped, is on joint supplements to help keep her hind legs healthy and strong since she was born with a deformity in her front legs. Currently being fitted for a wheelchair but gets around fine without one!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

Boone came to us from a partner shelter that put out a plea because of lack of space. He quickly made friends with rescue staff. He\u2019s a more challenging adoption because he needs to be the only pet in the household and he\u2019s a mostly black pit mix, but we know the right home is waiting for him! If that\u2019s your home, apply to adopt Boone at ITVrescue.org.\n\nAll of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heartworm tested and treated if necessary.\n\nPlease realize that many of our animals are kept in foster homes. Please complete an adoption application at http://itvrescue.org/adoption-application/ in order to meet with one of our animals. There is no obligation in completing the application, but it helps us find an animal that is most appropriate for your family.  The ITV Rescue Center is open Tuesdays 12-5; Wednesdays 12-7; Thursdays 12-5; Fridays 12-5 and Saturdays 10-5.  The Rescue Center is located at 1417 N. Stockwell Road.  You are welcome to come to our rescue center during open hours to see all of our great adoptable animals. Thank you for your interest in our animals!\n\nNOTE: Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Please contact ridgway@illinois.edu for more information about this pet. MUST HAVE EXPERIENCE ADOPTER\nDakota is an ABCA-registered purebred smooth-coated border from working stockdog lines, born in March 2020. He is being fostered in Savoy, Illinois. He is a striking tall, dark and handsome 46-pound dog with erect ears and a gaze radiating intelligence, intensity and anticipation of the next thing to do. He is sweet and outgoing and very busy: he will need to have a job or an otherwise consistently very active life-style. He is not suited to life as simply a family companion - he will need to have consistent focused activity to be happy (and for his person to be happy!). If you are looking for a dog to cuddle by the fire or share Netflix binge-watching, this is not your dog!\nDakota was purchased as a puppy and raised in a loving home with consistent veterinary care and all preventative medications but, as a maturing puppy, he became too much dog for his home situation. Recognizing that his needs were not being met, his devoted person sought help from Come Bye Border Collie Rescue in finding him a home where his energy and focus could be indulged and celebrated. Dakota grew up with children, a cat and another small dog (a peke-a-poo) in the household, with which he played appropriately. He had free access to a yard with an invisible fence and reportedly did well and respected the boundaries of the yard. He went for leash walks in the neighborhood and played fetch in the yard as well as playing in the house with the other dog but this was not enough physical and mental release for him. His previous owner notes that his favorite game is chasing the water hose.\nDakota is a cheerful, playful dog, very smart and a good 'problem-solver'. Like all dogs, it is important for his person to shape his 'solutions' into desirable rather than undesirable behaviors - this is especially true for Dakota because he learns so quickly and readily adopts as permanent those behaviors that get him what he wants, whether that is attention, food, a toy, or, most commonly, just something to do. This also makes him a great prospect for many different dog sports or other occupations.\nDakota is very good at meeting new dogs and readily invites them to play with a series of play bows. He does play vigorously and tends to herd other dogs by 'cutting them off at the pass' when playing chase. He also loves to present his toys to other dogs to invite chase or tug and stays very even-keel even when the other dog gets ramped up. He is very tolerant of another dog's arousal and stays calm but will stand his ground if the other dog doesn't dial it back, then yield if the other dog doesn't. He has boundless energy for play that will transfer well to a job. He is good at entertaining himself with toys for a while but that does not meet his needs for physical and mental exercise.\nDakota likes all kinds of toys and loves ice. It is his delight to find that the outside water bowl has frozen - he picks it up like a weighted Frisbee and carries it until it yields for him the prize of a frozen water disc, which he alternatingly licks/chews, tries to toss it for himself or works to engage his person in icy disc-throwing. Dakota, like all the other dogs, holds that the concept of inside versus outside toys is just a figment of his foster mom's imagination so, in cold weather, the house door gets closed until the water bowl status is addressed!\nDakota is highly food- and toy-motivated. He is SUPER keen to learn and INCREDIBLY focused on his task when working or learning. He has a good nose and enjoys working scent, again showing tremendous focus and virtually no distractibility when working. He is confidently curious when encountering new situations unless he is working, then he is for the most part blind to anything other than his work. He does not seem to be bothered by noise or motion and, unlike many border collies, is not overly triggered by sudden movement. When walking on a leash, he will acknowledge people or animals but is not highly stimulated by them. He is social and will generally greet people with a polite hello - he will sometimes jump up but is learning to keep 'four on the floor' when meeting others. He does well on leash once his walk has started but is working on not pulling initially.\nDakota is solidly housebroken and will potty readily on- or off-lead (in the yard or on walks). He enjoys attention, especially belly rubs, but is usually too busy to pause for long snuggles. He has been very well-mannered in the house and has a good off-switch - he tours the inside of the house, deciding on a toy with which to retire to a dog bed, then curls up and gums the toy, watching the household activities. If another active dog is out, Dakota will not settle unless the other dog does. He is crate-trained and sleeps in a crate at night - he has learned to happily enter his crate when asked and to politely leave the crate when released. Other than a little whining when he needs to go out to potty, he is quiet in the crate unless another dog is doing something exciting and then he will bark. In the yard, he is quiet and has been completely respectful of a 5-foot fence. Dakota travels well and will jump up directly into his crate in the car. He rides quietly and shows no motion sickness. He arrives ready to take in a new adventure.\nThis is a tremendous opportunity for someone looking for a performance/working dog: a purebred border collie puppy who has a good health foundation and basic housebreaking and manners training that is otherwise is a clean slate but primed for learning and doing! With high drive, intense focus and great trainability, Dakota is an excellent prospect for SAR or a wide range of active dog sports/activities. All that, and a dog that is livable in the house and good with children, cats and small dogs! If not for already having a 7mo border collie puppy in training for SAR, Dakota would be adopted by his foster but he has far too much potential to be relegated to a second-fiddle position. Don't miss this chance for the dog of your dreams!\n\nIf you have any questions about Dakota, please contact Marcie at ridgway@illinois.edu\n\nFor additional information on our adoption application process and for an online application, go to the Adoption Info page on our website at www.comebyebcrescue.org.",

Are you cool with the idea of having a 60-pound lap dog? Then Louie may be the dog you've been looking for!\n\nLouie loves to play with other dogs of all shapes and sizes and personalities, whatever their favorite game is\u2014chasing or being chased or tug-of-war or keepaway or race to the ball. He's a get-along kinda guy, a dog park favorite. (See link to video of playtime below.*)\n\nLouie is around three years old, so young enough to need hard outdoor exercise daytime\u2014a large fenced yard is a must\u2014but mature enough to be content just hanging out with the pack in the evening, especially if there\u2019s hugging and cuddling involved. He's adoring of his own people and delighted to meet new people.\n\nLouie is tall and strikingly handsome, maybe not what you'd expect from a dog who most likely lived in a hunting kennel in the rural county where he was found. He came to the rescue group underweight and with a mild case of heartworms but has since been fully treated and filled out; he's now very fit and strong.\n\nLouie is crate-trained, very happy to spend nights and naps there, but in foster care spends more time crated than he\u2019d really like because of one peevish resident dog. Won't you consider letting Louie join your family?\n\nWe can make a date for you and your dog(s) to meet Louie at the dog park in Spotsylvania County.\n\n* To view playtime video, copy/paste this URL into your web brower: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QQSdM58IDo3juTgGX_TW-TQ9Wq7jSQAC/view?usp=sharing",

WHERE I AM FROM: AL (arrival 1/30) \n\nMY STORY: From AL foster: He\u2019s so very playful and has really enjoyed playing with the two other young dogs here.  They race around the yard, play with toys and chase the squirrels.   I think he would enjoy having a playmate in his new home.   Tramp likes to cuddle by me on the sofa for TV time and sleeps in his bed in my room.   (He would like to get in bed with me but so far can\u2019t jump that high). \n\nDogs are held for two weeks after arrival date. You are welcome to apply, but applications will be processed closer to the available date.\n\nDogs needing foster homes are available for adoption This dog does need a foster home.

He is super friends with people, ADORES other dogs and little people, unsure of cats. He's your quintessential Labrador and would do best in an active home with a couple kids to help tire him out and maybe another doggo. \n\nIf you think you might be a good fit for this good doggo, please submit an application for consideration. Details on how to do so below. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*We are NOT a shelter. We are a foster-based rescue with NO facility. PLEASE take a moment to read more about who we are and what we do at Trampled Rose Rescue & Rehab HERE: \n\nhttps://www.petfinder.com/member/us/la/ponchatoula/trampled-rose-rescue-rehab-la410/   \n\nIt outlines, in great detail, our adoption process, adoption fees, how we select forever homes and much more.\n\n*If you think you may be a good fit for one of our rescue dogs, PLEASE SUBMIT AN APPLICATION for consideration. Feel free to drop a line with any questions we haven't answered, however, ONLY SUBMITTED APPLICATIONS WILL BE CONSIDERED AND PROCESSED. \n\n*If the dog is visible to you here on Petfinder, IT IS STILL AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION, so NO NEED TO ASK. The moment a home visit agreement is signed, the dog will be marked 'Adoption Pending' and, if all goes well, 'Adopted'. If the home visit was not a success, the dog will be relisted as 'Adoptable'. \n\n*We get DOZENS (and sometimes HUNDREDS) of messages via Petfinder, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, phone, text and email about EACH of our rescues DAILY. We do the best we can to respond to them all, but ultimately there's just not enough hours in the day. If you're seriously interested in a dog, the best course of action is to submit an application and BE PATIENT. We DO go through EVERY application that we receive, on a first come first served basis, and will select the home BEST SUITED for that particular rescue. We almost exclusively deal with special needs dogs and there is an ideal lifestyle we have in mind for each of our rescues. If you DO NOT receive a call it DOES NOT mean you were forgotten or declined. We likely had a barrage of applicants before you and one of those was a clear winner. Please keep in mind, we all have full time jobs, families and fosters and permanent pets of our own, so PLEASE be patient and allow us ample time to do this volunteer work in what little free time we have. Thank you.\n\n*Applications are available on our main page here on Petfinder OR on our website, www.trampledroserescue.com/adopt. Thnx!\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.All of the animals posted on our site have been temperament tested. While not all are in the immediate area, once we have processed and approved your application, we will move the dog to our adoptive area for you to meet, greet and hopefully adopt. Sometimes we will have more than one application on a dog. That does not mean it automatically goes to another family but you should be aware of the fact that until you are approved and set up for the meet/greet.. the dog could get adopted by another applicant.Boomer is still quite young, really barely out of puppyhood, so he should have a lifetime to give you all the love in his heart. He is also ready to learn what you want him to know and smart enough to learn quickly and easily. His desire to do what you want him to do is very high, so a pat on the head and a 'good boy' will go a long way with his learning . He has a great, friendly natural temperament and has shown himself good with other dogs and children. Can you see him playing with the kids out in your backyard? Boomer is truly a family dog and best friend in the making. He has had all his shots and a thorough vetting. He is good to go!\nIf you are interested in Boomer, please fill out an application at:\nhttps://reachoutrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms/form?formid=4588 Or contact:\nrorrcanine@gmail.com\n*** Click here to sponsor this dog! ***",

            "description": "Sweet Sosy has the prettiest brindle markings! This 2 year old possibly Cattle Dog and Terrier mix is not quite 30 lbs - the perfect size for playtime and cuddles! She has both Cattle Dog energy and personality. She loves to zoom around the yard then rocket launch into her foster mom's arms and give her as many kisses as she can. Typical to her breed mix, while Sosy can be a little nervous in new situations with new people, once she knows you, you have a friend for life. She seems to like women better than men but warmed up to her foster dad with time, patience and a little dedication and enjoys getting affection from him. Like many Cattle Dogs, she has a strong sense of stranger danger so sticks close to her people. She would do better in a home that doesn't have lots of visitors coming in and out but also with a patient, already dog-savvy family that can continue working on her socialization and interaction with people. Sosy can be a little mouthy at playtime and is still learning to be comfortable around kids so for now we recommend families with no kids or only dog savvy kids over 12 years old. Sosy gets along very well with other dogs and loves to chase and play with them, but she doesn't need another dog in her forever home to be happy as long as she gets enough exercise. She thinks kitties are for playfully chasing after so will need a home with no cats. If you are looking for a super smart dog who loves to learn new things and show off, Sosy is your trick girl. She is fast and agile and would make a great agility dog. She loves training exercises and her foster mom finds different ways to work out her mind and body every day. She is a fun dog to train as she picks up training quickly and is eager to please. She has learned Sit, Down, Come, Touch, Shake, Spin, Stay and Wait commands. She is motivated by both food and pleasing her people. Sosy goes for a 2.5 mile run or several walks plus playtime, puzzles, and mental exercises with her foster family every day. Because of her tendency to bark at unfamiliar noises and her bursts of zoomies (even after going for a run!), Sosy would be happiest with a yard of her own in her forever home. She enjoys playing with toys (i.e. making the room snow with stuffing) and loves tug of war. She is doing better walking on leash, but still gets unsure if there are large crowds, people on bicycles or lots of strangers walking around. She is house trained in her current foster home and settles down well in her crate when her family is at work. She can be crated for up to 5 to 6 hours without any issues. Sosy is a silly, snuggly girl full of personality! If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting Sosy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! If you are a previous Labs and More adopter or have already been approved and assigned an adoption coach, please reach out to your adoption coach for the next steps.

I can be a little bit timid and skittish sometimes but I am truly a sweetheart with an excellent temperament. I get a little bit scared around other dogs and may be overwhelmed by children, so and I think that I would be happiest if I could be the king of my new castle and reside in an adult-only home. I'd be a good fit for an experienced dog owner who can help me learn to come out of my shell a little bit. I would be an excellent apartment dog, as I don't take up much space or require lots of land to run around on. I'd like to live a quiet lifestyle with my new owners and would really benefit from lots of one-on-one time so that I can learn to trust the love and affection of others. I can be a bit protective of my space and my people, so always introduce new things slowly and cautiously to let me know that everything is okay. I would benefit from continued training, particularly potty-training as I haven't quite mastered that yet. I have been working on learning to walk on a leash here at the ranch but am still quite afraid. I hope you can help me get over my fears and learn that I am loved and valuable in this world.",

I'm a giant sweetheart and I would really love it if I could find an experienced Malamute owner who understands my high energy level, love of the great outdoors, and specific grooming needs. I love to play with other big dogs like myself and due to my high energy level, I think I'd be best in a home with older children who understand my needs. I don't appear to have much of a prey drive so I may be able to live in a home with some feline companions. I absolutely need to have a big yard space to run around and play in to help me burn some of my endless energy. I think I could be happy living in either a busy or a quiet household, as long as we get plenty of visitors because super friendly. I think I would enjoy going out and about with you, if you'll have me. I appear to be well-trained, even potty-trained, and I love to go for nice long leashed walks!",

            "description": "Hey everyone! My name is Mona and I was rescued by Big Dog Ranch Rescue from a Georgia animal shelter. I am good with larger sized dogs and I just love meeting all new people. I am a sweet girl who has so much love to give to someone... Hopefully you! I have a TON of energy and I am very strong so I do pull quite a bit on the leash when I go for walks. I would benefit from continued training, but I do appear to be relatively potty trained. I would probably be the best fit for an experienced dog owner who can help me learn how to harness my energy and I would do best in a home with older children, who can be aware of my size and strength. The staff at the ranch say I am good at keeping my room clean. I really am a giant love bug and my favorite thing in the world is to roll over and get a good belly rub! I also Love squeaky toys!!!!!",

I'm usually very quiet and do not like to play often. I think I would be happy living in a household with older children, who are more my speed. I'd be a good pick for either an experienced dog owner or a first time adopter, as long as I had access to a large yard where I could walk around and get some exercise. I appear to have some training, but still need some work in the potty-training department. I could really use a loving new family who can help me learn to come out of my shell a little bit and learn to explore the world comfortably.",

Please be patient with me, once I learn to trust I will open up and be a ton of fun. I am good with other dogs and enjoy their company. I am a young girl with a lot of energy - so keep an eye on me, I have been known to jump fences. Oops! Loud noises scare me, so a home without young children would be best.

Please click the link on our Adopt page (by species) to make an adoption appointment.Hi, I'm Betsy. I'm a 2 year old lady who is ready to warm up your world. I am a nervous lady at first, but when I warm up I am friendly, silly, and playful. I need an experienced owner that will help with my confidence, so I can become the best doggo they know I can be. I already know my name, down, sit and drop it, but more obedience classes would be a fun bonding and learning experience. Because of my timid nature, they say I would do best in a home with no exposure to children. I'm not a fan of other dogs, so I will need to be your only pet, but I promise I will give you a ton of love!",

We are not doing adoptions to Canada at this time due to the border closure. We do not ship animals. \n\nOPHS is appointment only. All potential adopters must fill out an adoption application prior to setting up an appointment to meet the animal. An application can be found on our website  https://www.ophumanesociety.org/dog-adoption-application\n\nWe have limited staff during this time, please allow 3-5 business days for us to process your application. We are screening the applications for the first BEST fit for each animal. \n\nIf you are approved, you will be contacted by us via phone or email to schedule an appointment.\n\nNAME: Comet\nAGE: About 1 year\nWEIGHT: About 55 lbs\nBREED(S): Golden retriever mix\nREASON FOR ARRIVAL: Owner surrender\n\nGENERAL INFO ABOUT PERSONALITY: Comet is your typical friendly but very energetic adolescent dog in need of training and guidance. He will undoubtedly make a great family dog one day who will always be up for an adventure.\n\nWe are currently working on basic obedience with Comet, because he can't contain his excitement and loves to jump on people and pull hard on leash. His new owner will need to continue this work with him and setting boundaries in his new home.\n\nComet will need a securely fenced yard because he kept escaping from under the fence in his previous home. He will need daily exercise, training and an owner who will be committed to his energy needs. \n\nWe are in the process of testing him with other animals and will update when we learn more about his behavior. He has supposedly lived with other dogs and kids. We don't think he would be a good fit with cats because he seems to want to chase them.\n\nActivity Level? High\nTraining Needs? High\nHouse Trained? Yes\nLeash Trained? Yes but pulls!\nComfortable with kids? Supposedly yes\nComfortable with strangers? Yes\nHistory with other dogs? Supposedly good\nHistory with cats? Wants to chase them\n\nAdditional MEDICAL notes: None\nAdditional BEHAVIOR notes: None\n\nADOPTION FEE: $150 for an adult dog.\n\nAdoption fee includes: Spay/neuter, initial vaccines, a microchip, rabies vaccine when appropriate, and one free veterinary visit with a local participating clinic.",

I came to the Humane Society of Broward County from another shelter and they helped me find a great foster family but now, I hope you'll help me find my forever home. I'm four years old and I do well with adults and older kids. I can be timid but I'm still very sweet and I like to approach you for some back scratches. I already walk well on a leash but maybe you can help me learn even more. With time and love, my personality will shine even more brightly. Thanks to my friends @J.R. Dunn Jewelers, my adoption fee is sponsored, so I just need to meet my perfect match. The shelter opens daily at 11 AM. Please complete an adoption application on-line at humanebroward.com before visiting. If you have any questions call 954-989-3977 ext. 6",

I haven't been around cats in a really long time, so I'd need a new introduction to one. I'm part hound, so I do like to follow my nose and am intrigued by small furry creatures. I like to go for long walks and sniff everything! I haven't met many children, but as long as my size isn't a concern we should be fine. I know sit and stay with the possibility of learning so much more! I'm a very friendly guy who has won the hearts of the staff. \n\n*Adoption fee is sponsored! \n\nPlease note:\n- Our website (www.neenahanimalshelter.org) is updated in real time, so we are accepting applications for all animals that are currently listed.\n-Applications can be downloaded from our website. (http://neenahanimalshelter.org/how-to-adopt.html)\n- Our shelter no longer has open visiting hours, so a pre-approved application and scheduled appointment is needed prior to meeting any of our animals.",

He does not like to hang out in the yard--he will just run out, do his business, and come back in. \n\nZuk\u2019s \u201clittle\u201d sister Bunny is littler in age only (3 years), but slightly bigger at 120 pounds. She is a sweet soul who loves to cuddle up to you.  She is not a huge fan of long walks, but she will tolerate them. She would rather just chill on the couch.  \n\nWe are in search of a family that knows what it means to love, live with, and care for a Dane. Humans physically and financially able to provide for their needs. A fenced yard is also very high on Zuk & Bunny's wish list.\n\nOur volunteers are hopelessly and utterly IN LOVE with these super-sized angels ... they epitomize the breed's reputation as \"gentle giants\" and are just THE BEST dogs! If you have Dane experience and would like to come this dynamic duo, we are eager to hear from you.  Please visit www.STAF.org for more information on our adoption process.\n\n\u2022  All of our animals are spayed/neutered and current on shots.\n\u2022  We do not do same-day adoptions; we ask that you return for a follow-up visit before taking an animal home.\n\u2022  You must be 21 years or older to adopt from STAF.\n\u2022  We require a 4-foot-tall physical fence for homes with children under the age of 11. We also may require a physical fence for specific dogs on a case-by-case basis, depending on each dog\u2019s behavior and exercise needs.\n\u2022  Due in part to increasing coyote activity/incidents in the area and the difficulty of predicting how a dog will respond to invisible fence training, we can not adopt to homes with invisible fences.\n\u2022  We do request vet and personal references.\n\u2022  We can facilitate adoptions within a 75-mile radius of our Cincinnati-based shelter.\n",

She was found as a stray in North Carolina and was severely emaciated but loves to eat and has already gained some weight back. She is a beautiful chocolate color and has the sweetest golden eyes. She can be shy and reserved at first but is a happy, tail-wagging, goofy, playful girl once she is comfortable. She loves other dogs and shares toys and affection very well. She is good on a leash, doesn't jump or chew, and is quiet in her crate. Partridge would be best in a home with another dog and a fenced yard.\n\n**BECAUSE OF OUR REQUIREMENT FOR A HOME VISIT, WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO ADOPT TO HOMES IN THE NORTHERN VA / MARYLAND / DC METRO AREA**\n\nWe have adoption events EVERY SATURDAY from 12-3 p.m. Please note that not all dogs can attend every event, so if you are interested in meeting a particular dog, please complete a no-obligation application on our website at http://www.muttloverescue.org/application.html OR write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nUpcoming adoption events:\n\nMutt Love Rescue is doing everything we can to ensure the health and safety of our volunteers and adopters while continuing our mission to find homes for as many dogs as possible.\n\nEffective immediately, we will not be holding our weekly adoption events. Dogs available for adoption can be met by appointment only. Potential adopters should submit an online application at http://muttloverescue.org/application.html. Once we receive your application, we will contact you to let you know the next steps.\n\nWe are always desperate for foster homes, now more than ever. If you are interested in fostering during this difficult time, please complete an application... unless you are a previous adopter/foster, then you can just contact us via phone (703-988-2608) or email (adopt@muttloverescue.org) to tell us which dog you want to foster!\n\nFor information on sponsoring this dog, please write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nWE NEED FOSTER HOMES!

He seems to be a very social kind of dog who is just waiting to go on lots of adventures with his new family. \n\nHe is a small/med sized pup, and can curl up into a small ball too! He is just 2 years young. Crate trained and does well in the house. He will not do well with cats as he sees them as something to chase. He seems to get along with most of the dogs at his foster mom's place as he likes to play with them all the time. We anticipate he will do well with everyone in the family, especially the kids who are kind to him.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting him, please visit www.shelter2rescue.org to apply online. His adoption fee will include up to date vaccinations, rabies, microchip and registration. If you have questions, please call his mom Liz 214-616-612",

She's enjoying romping with her shelter pals and getting attention from our volunteers, but her wish for the New Year is a home of her own. She would benefit from some basic training and a fenced yard. If your New Years wish involves a beautiful blonde with a perky nature, let's talk! Please visit www.STAF.org to fill out an application and find out more about our adoption process. \n\n\u2022  All of our animals are spayed/neutered and current on shots.\n\u2022  We do not do same-day adoptions; we ask that you return for a follow-up visit before taking an animal home.\n\u2022  You must be 21 years or older to adopt from STAF.\n\u2022  We require a 4-foot-tall physical fence for homes with children under the age of 11. We also may require a physical fence for specific dogs on a case-by-case basis, depending on each dog\u2019s behavior and exercise needs.\n\u2022  Due in part to increasing coyote activity/incidents in the area and the difficulty of predicting how a dog will respond to invisible fence training, we can not adopt to homes with invisible fences.\n\u2022  We do request vet and personal references.\n\u2022  We can facilitate adoptions within a 75-mile radius of our Cincinnati-based shelter.\n\n",

I am a three year old mix breed with the energy and spunk you\u2019d find in a sixth month old. I love being the center of attention. I do not like cats, so no kitties please. Since I love being the most important furbaby in your life, I am very selective of the dogs I like to be around. I would do great as an only pet too! I also LOVE to play. I would prefer a home where I can get a lot of play time and exercise. A fenced-in yard would be great to get my run on! Some basic training would also benefit me and give me another outlet for my energy. There are no kids at my foster home, but an older kid visits and I do well with him, but I do jump, so older kids are preferred. If you think that I would be an awesome, energetic addition to your family, fill out an application today!\n\nOur adoption fee is $260 for dogs over 5 months of age and includes all vaccinations, spay/neuter, micro chip implantation and registration/transfer, heartworm test and much more. Puppies up to 5 months of age are $275 and this includes all sets of puppy vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip implantation and registration and more. To adopt, go to www.fosterpetoutreach.org to complete an application.\nPlease note: Foster Pet Outreach tries to limit our adoptions to an area within approximately 60 miles of Peoria, Illinois.",

Gives kisses and likes to gently mouth you. About 4 years old, calm on the leash and getting used to city noises, a perfectly housebroken gentleman, non-reactive to other dogs so far (rode in car fine with another dog but doesn't approach dogs we meet on walks or want to play), sleeps through the night in his crate. No prey drive with stray cats or birds or squirrels (which is odd for a Catahoula!) but he is obsessed with stalking flies! A good power walker and sweet goofy cuddler. <3",

NOTE: THIS IS A COURTESY POSTING ONLY! THIS DOG IS NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH BROTHER WOLF ANIMAL RESCUE\nHowdy! My name is Isabelle, though friends call me Izzy, and my New Year's resolution is to find a home! I just graduated from the BRC* and I am so excited to start my life as a member of someone's family. I gained a lot of confidence at the BRC and learned important skills like walking on leash and interacting with strangers, but it would be great to find a patient home that can continue teaching me how to interact with the world. I'm told I'm the sweetest girl, and apparently my ears look like cinnabuns when I get excited... sounds cute, right?! I also love, love, LOVE other dogs and would make a great 2nd, 3rd, or 4th doggie sibling! If you want a new partner to take on 2021 with, have your people call my people and we can set something up!\n\n*Isabelle is a recent graduate of the ASPCA's Behavioral Rehabilitation Center (BRC) in Weaverville, NC. The BRC is the first and only facility of its kind dedicated to the study and rehabilitation of extremely fearful dogs.

He is very playful and enjoys wrestling with our other dog. We are rehoming Dash because our lifestyle is just not active enough for him. He currently lives with another dog and a 3 year old, and does great with both. He is very energetic and would benefit from a large area to expense his energy. I also think he would make a for a wonderful working dog (farm, service, police, etc.) He is very eager to please and loves mentally stimulating activities. He is house and crate-trained, however he has separation anxiety. I would not recommend a family that is away from home for long periods of time. He loves to cuddle and give \"nose kisses\". He is a very quick learner and is very intelligent. The ideal home for Dash would be an area with lots of room to run, consisting of other dogs for playmates, and giving Dash a daily job to do. He will find other ways of releasing his energy (destructive behaviors) if not given an alternative.",

What we DO know is that Bart is gorgeous, weighs in the upper fifties, and is around two years old. Check back for updates as we get to know him better ... or visit www.STAF.org for an application and additional information on our adoption process\n\n\u2022  All of our animals are spayed/neutered and current on shots.\n\u2022  We do not do same-day adoptions; we ask that you return for a follow-up visit before taking an animal home.\n\u2022  You must be 21 years or older to adopt from STAF.\n\u2022  We require a 4-foot-tall physical fence for homes with children under the age of 11. We also may require a physical fence for specific dogs on a case-by-case basis, depending on each dog\u2019s behavior and exercise needs.\n\u2022  Due in part to increasing coyote activity/incidents in the area and the difficulty of predicting how a dog will respond to invisible fence training, we can not adopt to homes with invisible fences.\n\u2022  We do request vet and personal references.\n\u2022  We can facilitate adoptions within a 75-mile radius of our Cincinnati-based shelter.",

            "description": "You know that song by Thin Lizzy, \"\"The Boys Are Back in Town\"\"? Well, our favorite wild-eyed, crazy cats are back at MCR and ready to find an adoptive home.\n\nBy now, you've probably already heard about our dynamic duo. Butterbean and Ricky were transferred to MCR from two of our partner shelters in May and July, respectively. Butterbean was incredibly, heartbreakingly fearful when he arrived. And it wasn't until Ricky cartwheeled onto the scene that BB was able to cope with the world around him.\n\nNow, the pair are loving sweethearts with a mischievous streak. We'll be honest: they can be exhausting. We're thrilled that BB isn't scared of everything all the time and that Ricky is so smart that he picks up new cues in a nanosecond, but staying one step ahead of these two is a big job. We're looking for a family who can keep up with the boys' training plans and manage their behaviors in the meantime. It's difficult to leave them alone unsupervised -- and splitting them up is a nonstarter. Ricky needs a lot of attention and help meeting new people. He likes to push BB around and protect his person or items. And Butterbean still needs to learn that doorways and vehicles are not so scary.\n\nRicky is just under 1 yr of age, and Butterbean is about a year and half old. The boys have met other dogs and behaved fairly well. They've also made friends with teenagers. We don't recommend a home with small children, and small animals are still a big question mark. Based on what we learned about the toddlers while they were in a home environment, we think they'll do best with adults who have flexible, work-from-home schedules and the ability to provide physical and mental activities. Exercise, training, and enrichment will have to be part of the boys' daily schedules.\n\nOne more note: Butterbean and Ricky are charismatic, charming kleptomaniacs. They have no qualms about stealing your gloves and sprinting off through snow and rain in a \"\"fun\"\" game of keep away. Patience and a really good sense of humor will be essential if you bring these boys into your life. They'll keep you on your toes in the best way possible and reward your dedication with face kisses, gut punches, and cuddles. Seeing them learn and grow has warmed our hearts from the beginning, and we can't wait to find someone who will love (and tolerate) their quirks just like we do.\nFor more information about our adoptable dogs and/or to submit an adoption inquiry, please visit meridianrescue.org.",

            "description": "You know that song by Thin Lizzy, \"\"The Boys Are Back in Town\"\"? Well, our favorite wild-eyed, crazy cats are back at MCR and ready to find an adoptive home.\n\nBy now, you've probably already heard about our dynamic duo. Butterbean and Ricky were transferred to MCR from two of our partner shelters in May and July, respectively. Butterbean was incredibly, heartbreakingly fearful when he arrived. And it wasn't until Ricky cartwheeled onto the scene that BB was able to cope with the world around him.\n\nNow, the pair are loving sweethearts with a mischievous streak. We'll be honest: they can be exhausting. We're thrilled that BB isn't scared of everything all the time and that Ricky is so smart that he picks up new cues in a nanosecond, but staying one step ahead of these two is a big job. We're looking for a family who can keep up with the boys' training plans and manage their behaviors in the meantime. It's difficult to leave them alone unsupervised -- and splitting them up is a nonstarter. Ricky needs a lot of attention and help meeting new people. He likes to push BB around and protect his person or items. And Butterbean still needs to learn that doorways and vehicles are not so scary.\n\nRicky is just under 1 yr of age, and Butterbean is about a year and half old. The boys have met other dogs and behaved fairly well. They've also made friends with teenagers. We don't recommend a home with small children, and small animals are still a big question mark. Based on what we learned about the toddlers while they were in a home environment, we think they'll do best with adults who have flexible, work-from-home schedules and the ability to provide physical and mental activities. Exercise, training, and enrichment will have to be part of the boys' daily schedules.\n\nOne more note: Butterbean and Ricky are charismatic, charming kleptomaniacs. They have no qualms about stealing your gloves and sprinting off through snow and rain in a \"\"fun\"\" game of keep away. Patience and a really good sense of humor will be essential if you bring these boys into your life. They'll keep you on your toes in the best way possible and reward your dedication with face kisses, gut punches, and cuddles. Seeing them learn and grow has warmed our hearts from the beginning, and we can't wait to find someone who will love (and tolerate) their quirks just like we do.\nFor more information about our adoptable dogs and/or to submit an adoption inquiry, please visit meridianrescue.org.",

            "description": "Jango is a pretty low-key guy. He's about 6 years old, fond of sunbathing and snacking, and ready to settle down with that special someone. If you're a fan of dogs with unique, quirky, almost catlike personalities, then Jango might just be the guy for you.\n\nWe've taken care of Jango for over a year and a half, so we know him really well at this point. We know that he likes to play with toys, especially squeaky ones, but that he'll also tear them up and eat them if you leave him alone. We know that he likes carrots but hates snap peas. We know that he's a terrific walker, car rider, and hiker -- but a big ol' pain in the butt when it's time for a vet visit.\n\nJango's crazy about food, so he'll need to live in an adult-only home with people who understand that he needs space while he eats. He's got a documented history of resource guarding, but he's been learning skills at MCR (e.g. drop it, wait) that will help his future family to manage his behaviors. In fact, Jango excels at training and would absolutely love to keep up his behavioral work with his next family. He's currently working on husbandry/handling (to help with touch sensitivity and veterinary care) and wearing a muzzle. He's a pro at sit, down, sit pretty, touch, shake, stay, and more. He plays the name game, the counting game, and red light/green light whenever we get the chance.\n\nOur staff would be happy to talk to prospective adopters about Jango's needs and plans for his continued training. We feel that he will thrive in a home where he can spend his days lounging and relaxing independently. He's a pretty self-sufficient dude and would appreciate a human who respects his personal bubble. But don't worry: once he gets to know you, he won't be too shy to ask for a neck scratch or a belly rub.\nFor more information about our adoptable dogs and/or to submit an adoption inquiry, please visit meridianrescue.org.",

The family members of their owner knew what kind of shape her dogs were in but they didn't do anything in fear that she would be mad at them. As a result, her dogs lived in filth and were neglected for years. Ronnie is deaf and blind.  He is missing his left eye.  When we got him it was draining pus and blood.  He will need eye drops for the rest of his life but that is a small price to pay for the love that this sweet boy has for people who take care of him.  He just wants to be where you are.

His first few years of life were spent on a chain but that is over and he is ready to LOVE life. His favorite activities are playing ball, squeaky toys and getting cuddles. He likes to make us laugh with his silly antics and would NEVER turn down a snack. He is learning how to have manners. This boy has no idea he is 60lbs and is positive he is a lap dog! He is a smart boy who knows how to sit, stay, drop it and down! We are working on fine tuning his stay and learning leave it and off. He is a rough and tumble kind of guy so we recommend sturdier children and no feline friends. Mr. Enzo is heartworm Postive. He has been started on treatment and has a treatment plan! Please send us an email at wchsadopt@gmail.com for more information or visit our website wchumane.org to fill out an adoption application!

My former owner described me as sweet, playful, dominant and protective. She said I'm comfortable with both men and women. Since coming to rescue, the volunteers have introduced me to other dogs in a controlled setting to see how I do, and I'm doing well. I can sometimes play roughly with other dogs, so it's important for my play sessions to be supervised. I seem to be insecure and would definitely benefit from living with an adopter who won't baby me or feel sorry for me, but rather help build my confidence. More info to come. If you are interested, please go to adoptagsd.org and submit an online application. My adoption fee is $350.\n\nAlthough we do our best to keep our adoptable animals page as current as possible,the animals you see may already be in an adoption process.",

Annie loves her humans, is great with children and even gets along with other canines. Being a Bloodhound, it is not surprising that she follows her nose, and that can lead her to getting into trouble. Annie needs proper exercise and mental stimulation, or she will get bored and find a way to entertain herself.\nAn active owner with breed experience, the willingness to help her with her leash skills and a home where she will get lots of exercise and love is where she will do best. \n\nAnnie is all up to date on shots, microchipped and is spayed. \n\nWill you be Annie's happily ever after?\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Annie, all you have to do is submit an adoption application, which can be found on our website at www.hoodriveradoptadog.org. \n\nApplications are reviewed and approved in the order in which they are received.\nOnce your submitted application has been approved,  my adoption counselor will be in contact to discuss the next steps, answer any questions and to schedule a meet and greet.\n\nMeet and greets are only scheduled after an application has been approved. COVID-19 safety protocols are in place, and a mask must be worn at the meet and greet - no exceptions.\n\nMy adoption fee is $200\n",

DOB 11-3-17), male, 50 lbs., vetted, is or will be neutered, and micro-chipped. Prince was dropped off to the shelter by his family positive for Heartworms (has since been treated). He was incredibly scared and very submissive in the shelter; shaking and trembling. In his new world in Foster Prince is untrusting of strangers. We have no idea why this boy doesn't trust but he is very loyal and loving to his people. He is currently working on building his confidence and learning how to be appropriately socialized. Prince is quiet and laid back; and is doing well with his 4 legged foster sibling! Stay tuned for more information as Prince is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Prince please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out his Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

I need a cat free home. I am people friendly but would do best with children over 12 who understand my size. I can be a bit guarded around my food, but that is easily managed by feeding me away from other pets! \n\nApply to meet me at tailsandtrails.org.\n\n*Email info@tailsandtrails.org with questions*",

            "description": "Prince is a sweet, senior boy who came to PACC due to no fault of his own after spending 11 years with the same owner. He's house trained and since coming to PACC, has been a very good boy. In play group, he was friendly and appropriate with other dogs and staffers say he was an easy going guy who mostly did his own thing. He has been very friendly with staffers and volunteers, but is a bit more selective when it comes to dogs, so we recommend a meet-and-greet with any resident dogs. And while he loves adults, he can be a bit of a grump when it comes to kids, so we recommend Prince go to a home free from small children (there are still some of those out there, right?) Prince is a loving, senior pup who would love to spend the remainder of his golden years in a home, rather than the shelter. If you've got some room on your couch and in your heart for this sweet old gentleman, make an appointment to meet him today.",

If you overlook that, you'll see that I am just over the moon when it's my time to go out, but after a few minutes, I settle down nicely. I enjoy walks, treats and of course, lots of love. I'm working on learning basic commands, and already sit like a pro! I'll need to be your only furry companion, however I have so much love to give you won't need anyone else. I can't wait to meet you! To meet me, please make an appointment with our adoption staff by calling, 916-875-2287. The appointment phone lines are open Tuesday-Sunday from 9:30am to 3:30pm. The phones get busy, so if you don't get through right away, keep trying. We're working hard to provide each potential adopter excellent customer service!",

            "description": "Snickers turns 15 years young in January 2021. She is a beautiful dachshund terrier mix. This relaxed girl is looking for a quiet home where she can live out her golden years. She would be ok with a calm dog companion (preferably another senior) but would not do well with high energy or dominant dogs. She could also be placed with a dog-friendly cat.\n\nThis poor girl was not in good shape when she arrived- She had worms, hair loss and was peeing very frequently and uncomfortable. She has some arthritis in her back legs, but has begun taking supplements and gets around just fine.\n\nShe has had her blood work back and it's looking fairly normal, which is great given her age. She is being treated for a Cushing's and has a dental scheduled at the end of January. We expect her to be ready for adoption at the very end of January once the vet has rechecked her teeth.\n\nCould Snicker's be the perfect addition to your family? Please apply on our website to be considered:\n\nhttps://www.portlanddachshundrescue.org/adoptionform\n\n",

Apartments may be ok with very active adopters.\nSpecial Info:\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

Surrendered by her owners, she spent 4 months in a shelter in Southern Illinois until Illinois Birddog Rescue rescued her and took her up north. We are fostering her and would love to find her a permanent home!

About 48lbs\nADULT FEMALE;  Est DOB: 10/2014\nARRIVAL: December 19, 2020\nHISTORY:  Celeste arrived as a stray at a high kill shelter.  When space became an issue, we spoke up for her.\n\nEveryone LOVES Celeste!  I mean loves!  This middle age sweetheart is loving and doting and just as easy going as they come.  Never meeting a stranger,  Celeste is extremely gentle in her ways, very even keel and accepting of all.  A slow and steady off leash roamer in our fenced in areas,  she is really open to meeting/interacting with anyone who might cross her path, either human or canine.   At the top of her \u201cThings I enjoy most,\u201d  would be all over body rubs and simply chilling by her human.  Celeste also has a casual interest to run and play with balls.  She has an old soul feel about her and is not overly clingy.  She does not ask for much but gives back so very much.  Celeste is graced with a disposition which is perfectly suited for folks of most ages from younger kids to retired folks.   A very peaceful, delightful older lady!",

I love being by your side and getting pet. I sit immediately for treats and like to catch them midair! I\u2019m not jumpy, am mostly potty trained and I like to walk beside you on a leash. I\u2019m also good with other dogs and kids and so far, don\u2019t mind cats.\n\nWould you like to start the new year with a new friend? I sure would! Come on out and meet me!

We were able to get Grace off the streets of Mexico and to our vet ASAP! Sadly, x-rays confirmed damage to her rear leg that has been this way for some time. Grace will need amputation surgery to relieve her of pain and a limb that is now badly deformed. Grace is a doll, she is young and has already adapted to being a tri-pod. We are grateful we were able to get her off the streets before anything else happened to her. If you would like to make a year end donation to help with Gracie's medical care here are ways to help:\n\nFacebook: via the button on the post\n\nVenmo: @labradorsandfriends\n\nPay Pal: labradorandfriends@yahoo.com\n\nWebsite:\nwww.labradorsandfriends.org\n\nCash/Check in the mail: Labradors and Friends - 2307 Fenton Parkway #107-160, San Diego, CA 92108\n\nTax ID 32-0195297\n\nThank You Everyone for the love and support!!

It is obvious that NOW he is on his way to being a very happy boy. This is what his foster says about him: He has really warmed up to us and we love seeing his personality come out. He is so cute and loves following us around and learning all about everything we do! He has been eating his food and doing well with house training (we are on a two-day streak of no accidents, and today will be the third day!) He loves going on walks and exploring the outside. He sleeps in his crate every night, and he takes lots of naps during the day and loves to snore. Way to go Boston and your wonderful fosters!

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter. We look forward to seeing you soon!\n\nLink to the Adoption Application: \nhttps://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/adoption-application/\n\nAnimal House Shelter\n13005 Ernesti Road\nHuntley, IL 60142\n\n847-961-5541 phone\n847-961-5537 fax\n\nOpen:\n\nSunday-Friday from 11 AM to 7 PM\nSaturday from 9 AM to 7 PM\n\nConnect With Us:\n\nLike Us On Facebook\u00a0!\nWatch Us On YouTube\u00a0!\nFollow Us On Twitter\u00a0!\n\nAdoption Application:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/adoption-application/\n\nAdopt a Pet:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/\n\nDirections to Shelter:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/visit/\n\nAdoptable Dogs:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/dogs/\n\nAdoptable Cats:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/cats/\n",

This little girl will steal your heart and she is finally ready to find her forever home! Dupree was turned into the shelter by a Good Samaritan with a very, very nasty leg wound. It was bad enough that they felt they needed to amputate and they put out a plea to the rescue community to save her. I.C.A.R.E. Dog Rescue stepped up and she was immediately taken to the vet for medical care. Since she had no broken bones it was decided to see if she could heal on her own with attentive loving care in a foster home. It was a long month with many vet visits and bandage changes, but she is all healed up completely and you can't even tell any different! She is ready to find her forever family! Her ideal home will have a calm environment and she would love to be the only princess around so she can get all the love and attention!

With training and socialization, Harleen will be an obedient, loving and loyal family member. Cattle Dogs can weigh up to 40 to 55 lbs. and like many working dogs, they have high energy levels and active minds. For this reason, Harleen needs an adopter prepared to not only provide her with plenty of exercise and companionship, but also with a lot of training and socialization. Harleen's estimated birth date is 10/20/2020 and her adoption fee is $300. If you want to know more about Harleen, please complete a survey at https://furkids.org/dog-adoptions/application. Puppies require a lot of time and commitment. Please make sure your schedule can accommodate a puppy as it will be a member of your family for the next 10 to 15 years. At this time, meeting our dogs is by appointment only. After submitting a survey, an adoption counselor will contact you to give you more information about the dog you are interested in adopting and to arrange for you to meet the dog. Must be at least 21 years of age to adopt.",

After two surgeries to remove mammary tumors, heartworm treatment, and lots of TLC with her foster mom, Ellie got a clean bill of health from the vet! She is ready to find her furever!\n\nEllie's foster mom says she is basically the perfect dog! She even goes with her to the quiet office where she works most days! Ellie has the biggest and most beautiful smile and loves people. She is wonderful on leash, loves walks, and gets compliments whenever she is out walking with her foster mom. Ellie loves car rides, is totally housebroken, and does well in and out of her crate. She is a BIG cuddler, loves affection, and is always ready to shower her people with kisses \n\nEllie would do best in a calm and relaxed home, preferably with a family who will treat her like a queen all day! She does get along with calm dogs and is friendly when she meets them on walks. Playful, hyper dogs are not for her. As always, a meet and greet with resident or frequently visiting dogs will be required.\nAdoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, deworming, and flea treatment.",

My foster family said they couldn't have chosen a better foster dog if they tried!\n\nI was a little nervous when I first met my foster family but my FM said it only took a few belly rubs to win me over. I am 5 years old, but you would never know it by how much I love to play! The little foster humans make sure I get lots of play time, playing fetch and tug a war with me (I win almost every time). I love to play with toys: Balls, squeaky toys, stuffed toys, and even frisbees. When I'm not playing, you can find me snuggled up next to one of my foster family. I enjoy going on walks and my FM says I'm great on a leash. However, I get very anxious when I see other people, and I will bark at them. So, My FM brings a toy along because it seems to help calm me when I'm nervous or anxious.\n\nMy foster family has been slowly introducing me to their other fur- babies, their house rabbits. I watch them sometimes but I never try to get in the cage. My FM says I'm a very good listener and I have great manners.

My name is Ivy and I'm so excited to be part of Carolina Boxer Rescue. Throughout the last few weeks I have been settling into my foster home and I love it!! The first day or two I was nervous but after settling in I am really starting to show my personality. I love to play with the other two dogs in my foster home and run in the backyard. When you get home from work I am so happy to see you and make sure to show you by jumping in circles!! My ideal day would be taking a walk, playing in the yard, and cuddling on the couch. I do great on walks and stay right next to my foster parents. When we are at home nothing would make me happier then cuddling up on the couch. My foster mom says I am a Velcro pup!! I am very quiet and do not make much noise. I cannot wait to be the sweetest addition to your family!!\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

Our mission: To balance the health, safety, and welfare needs of Boxers in the Carolinas (and parts of Virginia and Georgia) by providing a loving and safe environment for stray, abused, impounded and owner surrendered dogs by placing them in foster homes and ultimately - forever homes.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDog's Name: Ivy\n\nDog's Approximate Age: 5 years\n\nGender: Female\n\nDog's Size: Pocket Boxer (under 50lbs as adult and healthy weight)\n\nDog's Weight: 40 pounds\n\nGood with small dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with big dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with cats?: Don't know yet\n\nGood with kids?: Don't know yet\n\nAny medical issues?: Ivy is going through heat worm treatment.\n\nCrate trained?: Yes\n\nHouse trained?: Working on it\n\nHeartworms?: Yes\n\n11/23/20:\nHello Everybody! My name is Ivy and I'm so excited to be part of Carolina Boxer Rescue. Throughout the last few weeks I have been settling into my foster home and I love it!! The first day or two I was nervous but after settling in I am really starting to show my personality. I love to play with the other two dogs in my foster home and run in the backyard. When you get home from work I am so happy to see you and make sure to show you by jumping in circles!! My ideal day would be taking a walk, playing in the yard, and cuddling on the couch. I do great on walks and stay right next to my foster parents. When we are at home nothing would make me happier then cuddling up on the couch. My foster mom says I am a Velcro pup!! I am very quiet and do not make much noise. I cannot wait to be the sweetest addition to your family!!\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures. Learn about our adoption process too!\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________",

When he first came into the rescue, he did not bark at any other dogs; he just looked around. From what we were told, Zeek lived with 2 small dogs at one time and is good with children. Since he has been with us at the center, we have seen that Zeek tends to be a nervous dog with new people and surroundings. We recommend him in a quiet, adult home where visiting people come in multiple times to meet him. Zeek would do best in home with a fenced backyard and with an owner who is willing to be patient until trust is gained.",

He\u2019s already around 60 lbs and so will be a good sized adult, and is fully vetted, microchipped and neutered. He does take a little bit to open up (he spent 10 mins terrified to come out of the crate at his foster's initially - but then after that, he relaxes and is fine) but then once he's comfortable, he is very chill. He does enjoy walks but seems to prefer to just chill on the couch and relax, chewing on his bones and toys. He does still have a lot of that puppy chew energy, so he needs to be kept busy with toys and appropriate things to mouth - he is just a giant puppy and would benefit from some training classes and maybe another relaxed older dog to show him the doggy ropes). He's housetrained and crate trained and working on basic commands. He should be fine around kids, but would be best not around really young ones or ones who aren't able to give him space as he acclimates to his forever home. His foster reports he is just a big goofball who has no idea of his size. He's not yet cat-tested. Contact us for more details as we continue to get more information from our foster.\n\nAdoption fee covers: all vetting to age (including deworming, deflea etc ), spay/neuter (to be done at 6-8 months of age if not already done and included in adoption fee,  free 30 days of pet insurance, 6 week obedience course (or reimbursement for positive-based classes), and lifetime support of rescue.\n\nPlease fill out an application here for consideration: Tinyurl.Com/appshdr\n\n* During this COVID-19 crisis, we are essentially doing only virtual application processing and meetings are using social distancing practices. We will not have any open hours until further notice and doing meet and greets by appointment with the utmost caution for personal safety. We are not a shelter so there are NO DOGS AT THE SHOP unless we have open hours. All our dogs are in foster care and are available to be seen by appointment.\n\nNOTE: If a dog is listed as Adoptable, he or she is still available at that time. Also, our adoption area is within a several hour radius of us in Rochester, NY (NOT including Canada - sorry!)",

Well, I just joined the adoptable doggy crew at Providence Animal Center after being scooped up from ACCT Philly and am waiting for a wonderful person or family to adopt me! I'm all set to move into my 'furever' home - already neutered, microchipped & up to date on vaccinations.\n\nThe staff think that I would fit right into a quieter home with an active family & children aged 5 or older - as long as there is a quiet space so I can have some 'me time'. They also think I'd love a doggy roommate to be pals with - but cats, not so much, can't quite figure them out.\n\nI was able to spend some time with a wonderful foster and they have the following to say about me:\n\n\"Mutt Damon is very friendly and loves meeting other dogs. He plays great with my dogs -- both big and small. He's an excellent co-pilot and enjoys tagging along for errands. He has good leash manners. He's food motivated, so I think he would be a great training partner! When meeting new people, he is a bit shy, so I think he is often misunderstood. The trick is to give him treats when first meeting him! He will warm up quickly. He loves having his belly rubbed and enjoys cuddling. He will cuddle with dogs and then come over to cuddle with me. He is the sweetest dog. He quickly became my best friend and I loved having him. His new family will be extremely lucky!\"\u00a0\n\nI am lucky enough to be staying with one of PAC's fabulous foster partners, Perfect Pooch in King of Prussia, while I wait for my forever family to find me.  If you are interested in more information about me including my most up-to-date status and/or would like to set up a meeting with me, please contact the fabulous staff at Perfect Pooch today at 610-337-7698! We hope to hear from you soon!  XOXO, Mutt Damon\n\nP.S. Someone is so excited for me to find my fur-ever home, that they have sponsored my adoption fee! That means I can join your family today for FREE! Woohoo!!\"\n\n\n-------\nDuring your appointment, you will be able to meet a selection of pets in the Kennels or Cattery that day. New pets are arriving daily!\n-------\n\nProvidence Animal Center relies on adoption fees and donations to save pets! Adoption fees vary per pet. To find out this pet\u2019s adoption fee or for more information, please call the Adoption Center with this pet\u2019s ID number.\n\nCan\u2019t adopt? Consider fostering or donating!

            "description": "Topher (short for Tofurky) & gal-pal YamYam were surrendered to an overcrowded county shelter right around Thanksgiving. Having spent the better part of their young chiweenie lives being used/abused as a breeding pair, they are now happily retired from that business and in search of a home to start over as dogs of leisure. \n\nTopher is around six years old (just a kid in little dog years!) and tops out around 13 magnificent pounds. For our volunteers, it was love at first sight ... those expressive ears, that ever-wagging tail, and his perky little personality. He was in dire need of dental work when he arrived at our shelter but, 12 less teeth later, he is a much happier boy. And will do anything for a snack :O)\n\nWe believe Topher was treated poorly in his previous life. He cowers when you reach for him, and doesn't like hands over his head or having his harness put on. While he is initially guarded around strangers, it only takes a little patience and a proffered lap for him to reveal his sweet, snugly side. After years of being conditioned to expect rough treatment, he is learning to accept kindness from humans.\n \nTopher is crate trained and good on leash. He will benefit from continued confidence-building and socialization. Topher and Yam-Yam can be adopted as a pair, but would be equally fine going their separate ways. Each would be perfectly happy being your one-and-only furbaby, or might possibly be willing to consider sharing your love and attention with another dog. As is often the case with chihuahuas and especially factoring in his background/trust issues, Topher requests the his inner circle be limited to adults and older kids who can understand and respect his limits and sensitivities. Please visit www.STAF.org for more information about our adoption process.\n\n\u2022  All of our animals are spayed/neutered and current on shots.\n\u2022  We do not do same-day adoptions; we ask that you return for a follow-up visit before taking an animal home.\n\u2022  You must be 21 years or older to adopt from STAF.\n\u2022  We require a 4-foot-tall physical fence for homes with children under the age of 11. We also may require a physical fence for specific dogs on a case-by-case basis, depending on each dog\u2019s behavior and exercise needs.\n\u2022  Due in part to increasing coyote activity/incidents in the area and the difficulty of predicting how a dog will respond to invisible fence training, we can not adopt to homes with invisible fences.\n\u2022  We do request vet and personal references.\n\u2022  We can facilitate adoptions within a 75-mile radius of our Cincinnati-based shelter.",

Once animals are posted, we immediately begin receiving applications. With one volunteer available to review all applications, we appreciate your patience as you wait for an email response. Adoption appointments are scheduled in the order that approved applications are received. You can find our adoption procedures and online application at warmhearts.org/adopt.\n\nOpal transferred in from another shelter, so we don't have any background information. She came to us with substantial hair loss but look at her now! She is ready to move into her forever home and receive lots of TLC. Opal is very affectionate and loves attention from her human friends, but she does not seem to share that love with other dogs. Opal's estimated DOB is 11/22/2018. She weighs about 62 pounds and is most likely done growing. We cannot be sure that Opal is house trained.\n\nHSPC's adoption fee is seventy-five-dollars through December 31, 2020, unless stated otherwise within the pet's description. At times, our adoption fees are lowered during special events that are posted to our website or Facebook page. Every pet that is available for adoption has been spayed/neutered, microchipped, and is up-to-date on vaccinations including heartworm preventative (canines). Adopters are required to schedule a wellness exam with their veterinarian at their cost within 7 days of adoption.\n\nPlease only submit one application. Once you are contacted by email, you will have an opportunity to provide us with any additional animal(s) under consideration.",

Once affectionate once out in yard. Knows the sit command. Sits for treats and takes them gentley. Not interested in toys. JS01/15/20 15:30 took her out to play yard for pictures and videos. Sweet girl but seems to be a little on the scared side. Other tech pulled down the hose to rinse where she had gone to the bathroom and she slowly tip toed away from where she was and hid under and behind my legs, peaking her head out to see when it was safe to leave her safe zone. When the hose was put away, again she slowly came partially out but then decided, she liked being scratched more than exploring and stayed. ml 01/07/21 07:56 Update: 12/31/20 15:49 Temp tested A508462 female pit bull with A508465 male Chihuahua Basenji mix. The tail on the female pit bull seemed happy and not too energetic. Her hackles weren't up, but she was very focused on the other dog. After starring at the littler dog for about 30 seconds she began to pull towards him and growl. The smaller dog was frozen until she started to growl and then he began growling as well. At this time, she did not pass her dog to dog temp test as she did show aggression. ml 12/22/20 10:25 Update: 12/21/20 11:25 Very nice dog and did well when moving her to general population. Allows me to enter kennel and pet her head. Stays clean in her kennel. when approaching her she will come to the front of the kennel. Ym",

My name is Harper and I was picked up as a stray in South Carolina. Living on the streets without a family was tough. My skin & hair suffered from not having the proper nourishment. Now that I am in a loving foster home, I know my skin & hair are going to improve soon. Upon arrival to my foster home, I checked out every room and the yard. There are so many new sights and smells here! I really like other dogs, so I quickly made friends with my foster mom's 8 year old boxer named Castle. My foster home also has a three year old child and I like him too. I am a pretty calm girl so I know my manners when it comes to kids. I settled in and adjusted to my new foster home really quickly. I love breakfast and dinner time and I really love getting treats! My foster mom was delighted that I knew how to sit, and she was really surprised that I knew how to shake paw. My foster mom takes me on daily walks with Castle. I'm pretty good on the leash and easy to handle. After our walk, I love to take a nice long nap on one of the many doggie beds here. I like to be in the kitchen to watch my foster mom cook dinner, but she created a barricade to keep me out because she said the kitchen is too small. I still watch her from the dining room beyond her barricade. Ha! Ha! I am affectionate, I like to give hugs, and I like to follow my foster mom around to see what she is doing. I really am enjoying being in a home and getting taken care of.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

She's quite active and playful and would benefit from lots of daily exercise or a backyard where she could run and run and run.

My name is Harper and I was picked up as a stray in South Carolina. Living on the streets without a family was tough. My skin & hair suffered from not having the proper nourishment. Now that I am in a loving foster home, I know my skin & hair are going to improve soon. Upon arrival to my foster home, I checked out every room and the yard. There are so many new sights and smells here! I really like other dogs, so I quickly made friends with my foster mom's 8 year old boxer named Castle. My foster home also has a three year old child and I like him too. I am a pretty calm girl so I know my manners when it comes to kids. I settled in and adjusted to my new foster home really quickly. I love breakfast and dinner time and I really love getting treats! My foster mom was delighted that I knew how to sit, and she was really surprised that I knew how to shake paw. My foster mom takes me on daily walks with Castle. I'm pretty good on the leash and easy to handle. After our walk, I love to take a nice long nap on one of the many doggie beds here. I like to be in the kitchen to watch my foster mom cook dinner, but she created a barricade to keep me out because she said the kitchen is too small. I still watch her from the dining room beyond her barricade. Ha! Ha! I am affectionate, I like to give hugs, and I like to follow my foster mom around to see what she is doing. I really am enjoying being in a home and getting taken care of.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

It wouldn't be fair to adopt her, keep her through her youth and return her when she needs medical care. \n\nTrix came in through an animal control so there's not much background info but any family willing to commit to her forever, potential medical needs and all, apply today.

Comet is around 2 years old and we think he\u2019s a chihuahua mix. Comet is working on his crate training. Right now, he barks and whines a bit, so we feel a single-family home is best. He\u2019s fine with other dogs but takes the protection of his bones and toys quite seriously so resident dogs should be content with leaving him be. He prefers to snuggle with his humans and would do well in a home with older kiddos. If you\u2019re looking for a lap dog to ease your winter blues, apply today at www.milehighcanine.org. His adoption fee is $400 and he\u2019s in foster in the Denver area. REQUIREMENTS: 1. Single family home 2. Willing to crate/house train 3. No dogs or resident dogs that aren\u2019t too in his business 4. Kids 6 +.  You can apply for Comet at https://milehighcanine.org/forms-and-applications/mhcr-adoption-application/.",

He knows most basic commands, and in typical Pyr fashion, he listens to them when he feels like it :) There\u2019s two things Benny loves...his humans and his food! He\u2019s not crazy about the idea of sharing either of them. Benny has gotten along with other dogs in the past, except for when food or human attention is involved. Benny is looking for a patient family, that understands him and will put him in a position to succeed in these situations. Benny is a typical Pyr in that his main purpose for being on this earth is to protect. He is on high alert for any incoming threats. Benny loves belly rubs and cuddles. He was shaved due to matting but his gorgeous coat will grow back again soon. He loves playing fetch in his yard, even if he isn\u2019t the most graceful. Despite his clumsiness, Benny will impress you with his unfailing ability to catch a flying piece of food in his mouth! Benny desires love more than anything else in life and he promises to not let you down. He\u2019s looking for the same commitment from his new humans. If you are the family that can commit to helping Benny live up to his full pawtential, apply for this sweet, loving, goofy boy today!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

I am around 2 years old and a possible terrier pug mix, but my foster momma says I'm the best mutt. She also says I am the best boy with a face only a parent could love. Do you love my snaggletooth face? Maybe you're destined to be my new parent!! \n\nI am house and kennel trained, walk on a leash okay (but only with a harness on). I love to cuddle and be up next to you ALL THE TIME and I live for playing with kids!! I do okay with other dogs, but am not sure about cats. \n\nI am neutered, am current on shots, have a microchip, and have been heart worm tested and on preventative. \n\nFor a steal of an adoption fee of $150. I can go on a home visit with you for 1 week! If interested in adopting Drago, send an email to adoptions.spspca@gmail.com",

Presented at front of kennel with four on floor. Easy to return to kennel. Moderate pulling on leash when first walking, but pulling decreased on the way back (very hot outside).

After a little bit of time does begin to engage with handler on her own. Engages in tag by running behind handler, does not get jumpy or mouthy at all and disengages when handler stops running. No issues returning to kennel or removing leash. \n(7/11) Per Vet Staff -- friendly\n(7/11) Per Previous Owners -- Loving and great with people and children. Playful with dogs her size.

            "description": "Ace is a black Labrador Retriever mix who weighs about 60lbs. He is sweet, goofy guy. He lived on a chain prior to coming into rescue without any veterinary care, but he is current now. We were initially told that he was 10 years old, but he is very active, has very good teeth so we think he is younger and maybe 5-6 years old. Ace had done a great job learning manners and house training. He is learning also basic commands like sit. He loves to be with people and to please his people.\n\nAce is an active dog and would like a home that will play with him or take him for walks and on new adventures. At this time we are recommending a home with no other dogs so that Ace can shower his love on his humans!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Ace please submit an inquiry directly with Greater Charlotte SPCA by visiting charlottespca.org/adopt. ***Because our rescue is composed entirely of volunteers and we require a home check for each of our adoptable pets prior to them going to their new homes, local applications will take precedence. We will accept out of town applications, but any family further than 60 miles from Charlotte is responsible for finding a representative of a rescue local to them that is willing to perform the home check. All out of town applicants will also have to be willing to drive to Charlotte to meet/pick up the pet as soon as the application is approved.***",

He was taken in as a stray by a family that cared for him, but their house burnt down and they could not take him to their new home. He was left to live in a chicken coop where he was fed 3 times a week. No local rescue would take him because he was a pitbull and at the time had two very large masses on his legs.\n\nRico Pet Recovery took him in. He has been vaccinated and neutered and the masses have been removed from his legs. The vet says there is a small chance the masses will come back (<25%)\nHe is very playful, loves his belly rubbed, loves toys and is getting better every day on the leash. He does not have accidents in his kennel, but has not been in our house. He is good with other dogs and kids, but likes to chase cats.\nApply for Cinder at ricopetrecovery.org",

Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet him.\n\nAvocado is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~7 years\nWeight: ~52lbs\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate trained: Has done well with free roam while his foster's have been away for brief periods of time. \nDog sociability: Selective with his dog friends. May be a match for some, but not all. Does best with slow introductions over time with calm dogs that do not get into his space.\nCat sociability: No cats, please!\nKids: Unknown, but resources guards food/bones occasionally so older kids/teenagers only\nIdeal home: Avocado would prefer to not live in a high-rise/elevator building but is pretty adaptable to most other living environments! \n\nDon't let his Resting Grumpy Face fool you - Avocado is a happy, fun-loving guy! He does kiss on the first date but does so like a gentleman. His wiggle-factor is off the charts and he's the first in line for a cuddle session. The way he bounces down the stairs will actually make you want to go outside during Chicago winters. Avocado loves a good marrow bone or lickimat smeared with some peanut butter. He's done great with the other dog in his home and overall is such an easygoing guy. This boy is ready for his forever home!\n\nAvocado's adoption fee is 150. He is neutered, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. Avocado will be due for a dental cleaning and extraction of a fractured tooth after adoption which will be the adopter's responsibility.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

She\u2019s great with other dogs, and we\u2019re not sure about cats.  \nShe\u2019s spayed, heartworm negative, up to date, and on preventatives. \nShe\u2019s very energetic, so she will need a home who has space or will be able to exercise her properly.  \nCrate trained and working on potty training.  \nThis sweetheart is ready for a forever home!\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

I love playing tug, too. (I usually win because I\u2019m very strong.) I have a thing about rocks and branches \u2013 they just appeal to me and I like to carry them around. I also like to jump and I\u2019m very good at it! Just watch my video!\n\nI love getting attention from my people. I will curl up next to them or on them, if they let me. (I\u2019m not that heavy!) I like being hugged. I\u2019m good at letting my people know when I have to go outside.\n\nI\u2019m working on my outside manners, like walking nicely on leash. There\u2019s just so much interesting stuff out there! I love going for car rides, and sticking my head out the window. I sometimes have a hard time controlling my enthusiasm, so my foster mom is teaching me the Wait command. And I know it\u2019s hard to believe, but I\u2019m a little nervous meeting new people. But after a little while, I\u2019m asking them for pets and belly rubs.\n\nI have a lot of energy, so need a family that will spend time playing with me and helping me be the best dog ever!\n\nPlease consult our ADOPTION FAQ (http://www.pgspca.org/adopt/frequently-asked-questions/)  before contacting us.

She arrived at the shelter dog friendly and very kind. However, as the days went by and she kept getting overlooked, her behavior around dogs became uneasy. We welcomed her into our family with hopes of getting her back to the way she was before.\n\nShe is a HUGE cuddle bug who absolutely LOVES her humans! It will take her some time to get comfortable, but once she realizes you have nothing but love to give, she becomes the BEST companion ever! She enjoys napping to her people, watching TV and lounging outside. She is also a very smart pup who knows basic commands such as sit, down and stay!\n\nHer foster family definitely has made her confidence go up, but she still needs work around pets. Because of this, Lucy will need someone who has NO pets in the home and/or someone who is willing to work through her trauma.\n\nLucy is only missing a little love in her life. We are sure that with the right family and dedication, Lucy will grow to love other dogs again!\n\nShe will do best in:\n-A FENCED IN HOME!! \n-A home with NO pets\n-Someone willing to TRAIN\n-Someone ready to cuddle ALL DAY!\n\n**A note from her foster: \"Lucy is very loving. She may need time to trust at first. Once she knows you love her she will open up and thrive.\nI believe Lucy will overcome any issues with lots of love.\"\n\n!!DO NOT APPLY IF YOU LIVE IN AN APARTMENT!!\n!!DO NOT APPLY IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO TRAIN!!\n!!DO NOT APPLY IF YOU HAVE CATS!!\n\n--YOUR APPLICATION WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED IF YOU LIVE IN AN APARTMENT OR HAVE CATS--\n\nIf you believe LUCY could be your pawwwfect match please fill out an adoption application: https://form.jotform.com/93263081961156\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE EMAIL INFO@MERCYFULLPROJECTS.ORG",

            "description": "It's galloping Gulliver! This guy is a real leggy goofball, a noodly wiggly dork. Gulliver is just bursting with excitement to get out on walks each day, and regularly entertains with his bouncy exuberance. He also has a curious and playful streak, and from the way his whole butt wiggles when he's greeting friends, an obviously big heart. A lot of his energy seems to be from feeing off the busy atmosphere at the kennel - we suspect that once he gets to unwind and settle into a routine in a home, he'll also budget plenty of time for folding his twiggy self up on the couch for some cuddles. Earnest Gulliver is around 2.5 years old and weighs around 50 lbs.\n\nVisit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog to set up a meet!\nDue to COVID-19, CITY DOGS is currently doing adoptions by APPOINTMENT ONLY. Please visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog to request a meet and greet! \n\nQuestions? Email: citydogs@city.cleveland.oh.us | Call: (216) 664-3476\nVisit: 9203 Detroit Avenue Cleveland, OH 44102\n\nHours:\n10 AM - 3 PM Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday\n10 AM - 6 pm Tuesday & Thursday\n\nFee: $61 | Includes spay/neuter, shots, microchip, license, 30 days free pet insurance (when registered upon adoption)\n\nThe CITY DOGS mission is to increase adoptions from the City Kennel by changing the image of the pit bulls who make up the majority of the kennel population, by preparing all adoptable dogs in the kennel for lives in loving homes and by creating as many opportunities as possible for the public to meet and get to know our dogs for the terrific pets they are meant to be.\n\nOur Adoption Process...\nHere's a little about how things work:\nAll of the CITY DOGS posted for adoption are available for direct adoption from the kennel, unless noted otherwise. You must schedule a meet with a dog in advance - we are not currently accepting walk-ins. Please look online first to see if there are any dogs you think would be a good fit for your home before scheduling a meet. To get the process started, visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog and fill out the form. One of our adoption counselors will get in touch to schedule and confirm your meet! At the kennel, an adoption counselor will introduce you and your family to the adoptable dogs, share information we know about them, and discuss our suggested ways for successfully integrating a new dog into your home. You are welcome to meet multiple dogs. If the dog you adopt is already fixed, he or she may leave with you that day - otherwise, the dog can go home after receiving the spay or neuter surgery.)\n\nAbout Our Dogs: All available dogs have gone through a behavioral and medical assessment. This assessment is a snapshot of who the dog is at that given time. We cannot make any guarantees with regard to behavior, temperament or health of any City Dog once they are in the home. Most of our dogs are picked up as strays, so we do not know what kind of home environment they were living in (i.e. with kids, other dogs or other cats), nor do we know if most of them are house trained. Everything we know about them is based on volunteer and staff observations. We do have some dogs in foster homes, where they will have more information about how the dog is in a home environment. It is very hard to tell with certainty whether or not a dog will be good with kids, cats or another dog. If you have kids in the home or another dog, we do require that they be present for a meet and greet with the dog you are considering for adoption.\n\nHeath/Vaccinations: Dogs that are adopted directly from the kennel need to go to your personal vet within two weeks of leaving the kennel. All dogs receive their DAPPL, Rabies, and Bordatella vaccines, though you may be required to get follow up boosters. All dogs come microchipped and with a Cuyahoga County license.?  \n\n\n\n \n",

Our mission: To balance the health, safety, and welfare needs of Boxers in the Carolinas (and parts of Virginia and Georgia) by providing a loving and safe environment for stray, abused, impounded and owner surrendered dogs by placing them in foster homes and ultimately - forever homes.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDog's Name: Sugar and Oakley\n\nDog's Approximate Age: 3 years\n\nGender: Female\n\nDog's Size: Medium (50lbs to 70lbs. as adult and healthy weight)\n\nDog's Weight: 54 pounds\n\nGood with small dogs?: No\n\nGood with big dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with cats?: No\n\nGood with kids?: Yes, all ages\n\nAny medical issues?:\n\nCrate trained?: Don't know yet\n\nHouse trained?: Yes\n\nHeartworms?: No\n\n12/17/20:\nHello everyone\n\nMy name is Sugar and this is my sister Oakley. We have been with Carolina Boxer Rescue a few weeks now and ready to find our forever home. My foster mom says that she is sure we will find a home that loves us just as much as she does. You see we come as a pair and she says its great because you get twice the love. Before coming into the rescue we had a very loving family, but sadly they couldn't keep us anymore so they did what they thought was best and reached out to the rescue. We are sure glad they did because we are getting super spoiled here with out foster parents.\n\nThey have a huge basket of toys here that we can play with when ever we feel like it. Sometimes we sneak them outside and play chase with them. We both love to run and play outside. I am a little quicker than my sister but I make sure to slow down so she can stay by my side. I would have to say my favorite toys are the ones with the squeakers but my sister Oakley loves nylon bones. You see, she can not hear the toys because the vet says she is almost deaf. Don't feel sorry for her though. She can be just as feisty as me. We both love car rides and like to see where we are going. If we see the leashes come out it is game one and the crazy excitement of out wiggle butts happen.\n\nWhen it is down time just know I love to snuggle and they say I have no concept of personal space. I want to make sure you know I am right there by your side. As for my sister she is happy just laying at the foot of the bed or in her own dog bed. During the day since it has been so cold we been laying around in front of the fireplace and I have to say it feels great. Don't get me wrong we love to be outside but if we had a choice, in front of the fireplace it would be.\n\nWell I am going to go now. I think I hear them calling my name for a treat.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

            "description": "Carolina Boxer Rescue is a volunteer run, 501(c)3 non-profit organization. Our mission: To balance the health, safety, and welfare needs of Boxers in the Carolinas (and parts of Virginia and Georgia) by providing a loving and safe environment for stray, abused, impounded and owner surrendered dogs by placing them in foster homes and ultimately - forever homes.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDog's Name: Sugar and Oakley\n\nDog's Approximate Age: 3 years\n\nGender: Female\n\nDog's Size: Medium (50lbs to 70lbs. as adult and healthy weight)\n\nDog's Weight: 54 pounds\n\nGood with small dogs?: No\n\nGood with big dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with cats?: No\n\nGood with kids?: Yes, all ages\n\nAny medical issues?:\n\nCrate trained?: Don't know yet\n\nHouse trained?: Yes\n\nHeartworms?: No\n\n12/17/20:\nHello everyone\n\nMy name is Sugar and this is my sister Oakley. We have been with Carolina Boxer Rescue a few weeks now and ready to find our forever home. My foster mom says that she is sure we will find a home that loves us just as much as she does. You see we come as a pair and she says its great because you get twice the love. Before coming into the rescue we had a very loving family, but sadly they couldn't keep us anymore so they did what they thought was best and reached out to the rescue. We are sure glad they did because we are getting super spoiled here with out foster parents.\n\nThey have a huge basket of toys here that we can play with when ever we feel like it. Sometimes we sneak them outside and play chase with them. We both love to run and play outside. I am a little quicker than my sister but I make sure to slow down so she can stay by my side. I would have to say my favorite toys are the ones with the squeakers but my sister Oakley loves nylon bones. You see, she can not hear the toys because the vet says she is almost deaf. Don't feel sorry for her though. She can be just as feisty as me. We both love car rides and like to see where we are going. If we see the leashes come out it is game one and the crazy excitement of out wiggle butts happen.\n\nWhen it is down time just know I love to snuggle and they say I have no concept of personal space. I want to make sure you know I am right there by your side. As for my sister she is happy just laying at the foot of the bed or in her own dog bed. During the day since it has been so cold we been laying around in front of the fireplace and I have to say it feels great. Don't get me wrong we love to be outside but if we had a choice, in front of the fireplace it would be.\n\nWell I am going to go now. I think I hear them calling my name for a treat.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

This dog cannot be adopted out of state. Please see our home page for a list of our Saturday adoption sites. Every potential adopter is required to fill out an adoption application and the dog is placed in the home that would be most suitable for the dog. We do not place our dogs in homes with unfenced swimming pools. Generally we don't release the dogs at the adoption site that day except on occasion to former adopters.For an application, please fill out the online application at www.FCIAnimals.org.",

Our mission: To balance the health, safety, and welfare needs of Boxers in the Carolinas (and parts of Virginia and Georgia) by providing a loving and safe environment for stray, abused, impounded and owner surrendered dogs by placing them in foster homes and ultimately - forever homes.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDog's Name: Sally\n\nDog's Approximate Age: 3 years old\n\nGender: Female\n\nDog's Size: Medium (50lbs to 70lbs. as adult and healthy weight)\n\nDog's Weight: 55 pounds\n\nGood with small dogs?: Don't know yet\n\nGood with big dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with cats?: Don't know yet\n\nGood with kids?: Yes, older only\n\nAny medical issues?: None\n\nCrate trained?: Yes\n\nHouse trained?: Yes\n\nHeartworms?: No\n\n12/21/20:\nSally has been with us for a couple of weeks, and is a joy to foster! She's a spunky gal who loves to snuggle and give kisses, but also loves to play. Stuffed toys are her favorite, with nylabones and antlers a close second. She is good in the crate, but can also be left out if you put away her temptations- anything food related (like the garbage can) and writing implements (she just thinks they're for her!). She has learned how to go out the doggie door here, but prefers to be inside with her people. She loves to go for car rides and walks, but she is still working on her leash skills. She gets a little spooked by noises and new things on walks, so we are working on desensitizing her and helping her realize she's safe and it's okay. Our home is very quiet and she does great- we think she would do better with older children because she gets a little wild at times and doesn't realize how big she is. She also takes a bit of time to warm up to new people so needs a patient family who can give her that time. She will be spayed the beginning of January, and then will be ready for her forever home!\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

            "description": "Carolina Boxer Rescue is a volunteer run, 501(c)3 non-profit organization. Our mission: To balance the health, safety, and welfare needs of Boxers in the Carolinas (and parts of Virginia and Georgia) by providing a loving and safe environment for stray, abused, impounded and owner surrendered dogs by placing them in foster homes and ultimately - forever homes.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDog's Name: Sally\n\nDog's Approximate Age: 3 years old\n\nGender: Female\n\nDog's Size: Medium (50lbs to 70lbs. as adult and healthy weight)\n\nDog's Weight: 55 pounds\n\nGood with small dogs?: Don't know yet\n\nGood with big dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with cats?: Don't know yet\n\nGood with kids?: Yes, older only\n\nAny medical issues?: None\n\nCrate trained?: Yes\n\nHouse trained?: Yes\n\nHeartworms?: No\n\n12/21/20:\nSally has been with us for a couple of weeks, and is a joy to foster! She's a spunky gal who loves to snuggle and give kisses, but also loves to play. Stuffed toys are her favorite, with nylabones and antlers a close second. She is good in the crate, but can also be left out if you put away her temptations- anything food related (like the garbage can) and writing implements (she just thinks they're for her!). She has learned how to go out the doggie door here, but prefers to be inside with her people. She loves to go for car rides and walks, but she is still working on her leash skills. She gets a little spooked by noises and new things on walks, so we are working on desensitizing her and helping her realize she's safe and it's okay. Our home is very quiet and she does great- we think she would do better with older children because she gets a little wild at times and doesn't realize how big she is. She also takes a bit of time to warm up to new people so needs a patient family who can give her that time. She will be spayed the beginning of January, and then will be ready for her forever home!\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

He is shy when meeting new people but with the right treats, he warms up quickly. Oscar was found in Mexico and is still working on adjusting to being inside with a family. He needs a family that will work with him to overcome his insecurities and work on basic obedience skills. He is also very camera shy so we haven't been able to get a good picture of this happy boy. He will need some work on housebreaking and marking. \n\n\n<p>We suggest a home with children over the age of 10 for this dog. This dog cannot be adopted out of state. Please see our home page for a list of our Saturday adoption sites. Every potential adopter is required to fill out an adoption application and the dog is placed in the home that would be most suitable for the dog. We do not place our dogs in homes with unfenced swimming pools. Generally we don't release the dogs at the adoption site that day except on occasion to former adopters. If you are interested in adopting this dog, please complete the online application at FCIAnimals.org..</p>",

            "description": "Animal Profile: Kiera is Shepherd mix (best guess) that was rescued from a high kill shelter in San Bernadino CA. She is estimated to be around 1 year old and joined us on December 13th. Our volunteer transporter reports that she is timid at first and will benefit from decompression time.\n\nFoster Update: Kiera is settling in well, definitely timid initially and takes her a bit to warm up but then is very sweet and playful. She is pretty good with other dogs and has done well walking with other dogs for intros and passing them. She has shown some signs of resource guarding towards other dogs so we are looking at placing her in a home without other dogs. Kiera does ok in her crate, she's doing a lot better when switching up the routine when leaving.\n\nKiera would do well in a home without small children, someone who has some patience to give her time to warm up and work with her on her confidence. We also think she would make for an excellent agility companion given her willingness to jump on any playground equipment.\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $500, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, and heartworm test. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue. Apply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org\n\nAnimal History: This dog was rescued from euthanasia at a high-kill shelter in California and will be available for adoption in Seattle, once evaluated in a loving foster home in the greater Seattle area.",

Our mission: To balance the health, safety, and welfare needs of Boxers in the Carolinas (and parts of Virginia and Georgia) by providing a loving and safe environment for stray, abused, impounded and owner surrendered dogs by placing them in foster homes and ultimately - forever homes.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDog's Name: Rose\n\nDog's Approximate Age: 2 years\n\nGender: Female\n\nDog's Size: Pocket Boxer (under 50lbs as adult and healthy weight)\n\nDog's Weight: 41 pounds\n\nGood with small dogs?: Don't know yet\n\nGood with big dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with cats?: Don't know yet\n\nGood with kids?: Yes, all ages\n\nAny medical issues?: None\n\nCrate trained?: Yes\n\nHouse trained?: Yes\n\nHeartworms?: No\n\n12/30/20: Hi, I'm Rose. I hope this doesn't take me too long to write because I have lots of playing to get to. So my FM says I have to write a little about myself and she told me I have to mention my size and energy. My FM calls me a \"trial size\" boxer. So I'm small, big deal. I really like this place I'm staying. There are three other dogs and kids to play with me and I love to PLAY. I love balls and ropes and sticks I find in the yard. I can make a toy of anything. My foster family says I play with intensity and purpose. I don't know why you'd do it any other way than that! I have gotten used to the routine around here and even appreciate when its time to get in the crate. I can't play hard if I don't rest hard. My foster family also seems to think its great that I don't bark at the people and dogs walking down the street like my foster brothers and sister. I don't know why I'd bark at them if I want them to play with me. They may like the way I act in the backyard, but they say I need to work on walking on leash. I don't understand why they won't just walk faster. I think this is their problem that they can't keep up with me. I am really good with kids but I can get overly excited if a human doesn't call me off. I do listen to commands, but I need reminding when I get excited. I am not food aggressive but I will eat out of the other bowls if the other dogs don't eat fast enough. I'd really like a forever home that has a playmate (or two) for me and a fenced backyard. And I need humans who want a snuggle. I haven't mentioned it, but I really like snuggling up after a round of play. My foster mom says all boxers think they're lap dogs but I may be the closest in reality to one because I fit in her lap. I'll update more later, but I have some tennis balls that need tending to outside.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

This has been diagnosed as alopecia which doesn't effect his health or wellbeing, its cosmetic. The vet recommends melatonin as an optional treatment.\n\nCrate trained?: Yes\n\nHouse trained?: Yes\n\nHeartworms?: No\n\n12/19/20: Olaf has settled in well, he is a very easy going boy who loves to follow you around and get plenty of attention. He is great with our children who are 6 & 11. He has now been introduced to our resident boxers (female 7 & male 3), although you can tell he hasn't been socialized much with other dogs because he is very submissive and isn't quite sure how to be a dog and play. He is learning and just yesterday started to run around playing with my two and joined in with tossing a tennis ball around so he is definitely getting more comfortable with it.\n\nOlaf is fully house trained and crate trained, the only continued training he needs is consistent work on his manners. He is young and excitable so will jump up if you let him however, he is responding well to our technique of turning our back to him and walking away when he jumps up. Telling him to sit before petting and making a fuss of him will be key to improving his manners.\n\nOlaf had a visit to the vet today, he got all his vaccinations up to date, a negative heartworm test and clean bill of health. We learned that the sparse patches of hair either side of his rib cage is canine flank alopecia, which is no detriment to his health- purely cosmetic and melatonin is the recommended treatment.\n\n12/9/20: Olaf only just arrived with us so we have lots to learn about him, what we do know so far is that he is a young, fun and energetic boy who loves to play and get plenty of cuddles.\n\nHe is very excitable so we are working on his manners to stop him from jumping all over you to say hi. He knows his sit command and once you get him to focus he will sit to then get pets nicely. With how responsive he has been so far means he will improve on his manners quickly.\n\nOlaf is house trained, great with kids and loves to play fetch.\n\nWe crate train in our home and so far we have had no issues from him sleeping in his crate at night and also spending some quiet time during the day in there.\n\nOlaf has been dog tested before arriving to our home he has yet to be introduced to the resident boxers here. Once he has had more time to settle in we will start introductions.\n\nOlaf has a natural tail (not docked) and it appears that his happy wagger has been rubbing at the hair on his sides as he whips it side to side. We'll be keeping an eye on it to see if that is some that can be better managed for him.\n\nLook out for more to come on as Olaf gets settled in.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

Our mission: To balance the health, safety, and welfare needs of Boxers in the Carolinas (and parts of Virginia and Georgia) by providing a loving and safe environment for stray, abused, impounded and owner surrendered dogs by placing them in foster homes and ultimately - forever homes.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDog's Name: Rose\n\nDog's Approximate Age: 2 years\n\nGender: Female\n\nDog's Size: Pocket Boxer (under 50lbs as adult and healthy weight)\n\nDog's Weight: 41 pounds\n\nGood with small dogs?: Don't know yet\n\nGood with big dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with cats?: Don't know yet\n\nGood with kids?: Yes, all ages\n\nAny medical issues?: None\n\nCrate trained?: Yes\n\nHouse trained?: Yes\n\nHeartworms?: No\n\n12/30/20: Hi, I'm Rose. I hope this doesn't take me too long to write because I have lots of playing to get to. So my FM says I have to write a little about myself and she told me I have to mention my size and energy. My FM calls me a \"trial size\" boxer. So I'm small, big deal. I really like this place I'm staying. There are three other dogs and kids to play with me and I love to PLAY. I love balls and ropes and sticks I find in the yard. I can make a toy of anything. My foster family says I play with intensity and purpose. I don't know why you'd do it any other way than that! I have gotten used to the routine around here and even appreciate when its time to get in the crate. I can't play hard if I don't rest hard. My foster family also seems to think its great that I don't bark at the people and dogs walking down the street like my foster brothers and sister. I don't know why I'd bark at them if I want them to play with me. They may like the way I act in the backyard, but they say I need to work on walking on leash. I don't understand why they won't just walk faster. I think this is their problem that they can't keep up with me. I am really good with kids but I can get overly excited if a human doesn't call me off. I do listen to commands, but I need reminding when I get excited. I am not food aggressive but I will eat out of the other bowls if the other dogs don't eat fast enough. I'd really like a forever home that has a playmate (or two) for me and a fenced backyard. And I need humans who want a snuggle. I haven't mentioned it, but I really like snuggling up after a round of play. My foster mom says all boxers think they're lap dogs but I may be the closest in reality to one because I fit in her lap. I'll update more later, but I have some tennis balls that need tending to outside.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

This has been diagnosed as alopecia which doesn't effect his health or wellbeing, its cosmetic. The vet recommends melatonin as an optional treatment.\n\nCrate trained?: Yes\n\nHouse trained?: Yes\n\nHeartworms?: No\n\n12/19/20: Olaf has settled in well, he is a very easy going boy who loves to follow you around and get plenty of attention. He is great with our children who are 6 & 11. He has now been introduced to our resident boxers (female 7 & male 3), although you can tell he hasn't been socialized much with other dogs because he is very submissive and isn't quite sure how to be a dog and play. He is learning and just yesterday started to run around playing with my two and joined in with tossing a tennis ball around so he is definitely getting more comfortable with it.\n\nOlaf is fully house trained and crate trained, the only continued training he needs is consistent work on his manners. He is young and excitable so will jump up if you let him however, he is responding well to our technique of turning our back to him and walking away when he jumps up. Telling him to sit before petting and making a fuss of him will be key to improving his manners.\n\nOlaf had a visit to the vet today, he got all his vaccinations up to date, a negative heartworm test and clean bill of health. We learned that the sparse patches of hair either side of his rib cage is canine flank alopecia, which is no detriment to his health- purely cosmetic and melatonin is the recommended treatment.\n\n12/9/20: Olaf only just arrived with us so we have lots to learn about him, what we do know so far is that he is a young, fun and energetic boy who loves to play and get plenty of cuddles.\n\nHe is very excitable so we are working on his manners to stop him from jumping all over you to say hi. He knows his sit command and once you get him to focus he will sit to then get pets nicely. With how responsive he has been so far means he will improve on his manners quickly.\n\nOlaf is house trained, great with kids and loves to play fetch.\n\nWe crate train in our home and so far we have had no issues from him sleeping in his crate at night and also spending some quiet time during the day in there.\n\nOlaf has been dog tested before arriving to our home he has yet to be introduced to the resident boxers here. Once he has had more time to settle in we will start introductions.\n\nOlaf has a natural tail (not docked) and it appears that his happy wagger has been rubbing at the hair on his sides as he whips it side to side. We'll be keeping an eye on it to see if that is some that can be better managed for him.\n\nLook out for more to come on as Olaf gets settled in.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

            "description": "SPECIAL NEEDS boy ... this amazing little guy is Wimble. He has overcome a lot and is a sweet, friendly dog who needs a special home to be loved forever. As of 1/1/21, Wimble is 20 weeks old (5 months) and approximately 21 lbs. He has limited vision in both eyes, but he gets around his foster home just fine and will adjust to your new home too in time, and with a slow acclimation process.\n\nWimble was found in a parking lot, completely malnourished and with a likely traumatic, brain injury. His finders didn't think he would survive that first night, and the next couple of nights either, but with lots of TLC, proper vet and medical care, he did. Today, he is an energetic, love bug who loves people, other dogs, cats and playing! \n\nWimble is affectionate and friendly. He is working on crate training and house training, but slow and steady wins the race! He hasn't started leash training yet, but he has a big yard to play in right now with other dogs, so walking in the neighborhood isn't a high priority! \n\nWimble loves to play with other dogs and his toys. He enjoys balls, ropes and stuffed toys. He also likes to snuggle with his humans. He will do best in a home when a human is home with him a fair amount of time. As he ages and continues to learn more about training, he will improve and do better being left alone for errands, etc. \n\nDon't pass up this great dog due to his disability. Give him a chance to thrive and blossom. He will likely be the best dog you have ever owned.\n\nIf you are interested in this dog, please contact volunteer Amy at amyh@rescuednready.com or at 918-688-0755.\n\nADOPTIONS ONLY TO PEOPLE LIVING IN THE NORTHEASTERN OKLAHOMA AREA.  \n\nThe adoption fee is $200.00 and includes all current vaccinations, negative heartworm test, worming, microchip, and spay/neuter surgery.  Go to www.rescuednready.com to learn about our adoption process and download our application.  \n\nCALL or EMAIL US TO MEET ONE OF OUR ADOPTABLE DOGS! Call Amy at 918-688-0755 or email at amyh@rescuednready.com.\n\nLIKE RESCUED 'N READY ON FACEBOOK!!",

Don't let her age fool you though- this girl is still full of pep and enjoys a long walk in the park. Daisy shares her kennel with her pal Reggie, and also did well when meeting other dogs in PACC playgroup. She was noted to be easygoing, social, playful and waggy. She's a bouncy, happy lady who says age ain't nothin' but a number! Daisy is hoping her stay at PACC is short, so please ask about her today!",

In addition to the outdoors, he enjoys being inside and laying by a warm fire. He is fully house-trained and slept quietly through the night (in bed after being invited up). Other than when treeing cats, he did not bark and he does not seem to have other bad habits (no food aggression, no chewing and no damage to the house). He has a great calm personality and would make and excellent pet for someone who wants a big dog that looks tough, but is really just a cuddle buddy. He's done great around young children!",

He\u2019s learning a lot in his foster home, such as realizing that not all humans are bad, and that he likes other dogs and cats. He\u2019s picking up on commands quickly.  \nPedro should not be in a home with young children, as they scare him.  \nPedro is ready for his furever family!\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

He will need an adopter that is willing to continue his basic obedience and puppy training. He is already kennel trained!\n\nJefferson is wary of strangers; however, he tolerates a slow and polite approach. He will do best in a calm home, that does not have new people coming and going on a regular basis. We would recommend that he be kenneled whenever you have new people into your home.\n\nJefferson has had good interactions with other dogs (he does well with those that he knows) but would need proper intros. He will not do well in a home with kids.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Jefferson, please visit our website for our online application, www.underdogaz.com",

Our mission: To balance the health, safety, and welfare needs of Boxers in the Carolinas (and parts of Virginia and Georgia) by providing a loving and safe environment for stray, abused, impounded and owner surrendered dogs by placing them in foster homes and ultimately - forever homes.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDog's Name: Pluto\n\nDog's Approximate Age: 3 years\n\nGender: Male\n\nDog's Size: Medium (50lbs to 70lbs. as adult and healthy weight)\n\nDog's Weight: 55 pounds\n\nGood with small dogs?: No\n\nGood with big dogs?: No\n\nGood with cats?: No\n\nGood with kids?: Yes, older only\n\nAny medical issues?: Has kidney disease, which requires prescription food and dog door\n\nCrate trained?: Yes\n\nHouse trained?: Yes\n\nHeartworms?: No\n\n12/30/20: Hi all,\n\nMy name is Pluto and I have been searching for love in all the wrong places. I am a 3 years young, super handsome, playful and loving if you ask me!\n\nMy ideal match would be people who will make me their one and only. I am not crazy about sharing my love with other furry ones.\n\nI have learned some great tricks like sitting on command and I am a great listener. I would love to show you what a gentleman I am learning to become!\n\nI do need the luxury of a dog door and a six foot fence. My kidneys are not fully functional, but that doesn't hold me back from being active and my vet professional says I can have many years of love to share. I just have a special type of food I require and check ups with my doctor occasionally.\n\nSo really that's about it. I give you tons of love, snuggles and my silly playful self in exchange for a warm bed, my special food and a dog door with a fenced yard.\n\nOh and I really love to go on long walks and rides in the car too. Maybe even a trip to Lowes? If you want to get a little wild one day.\n\nExcited and waiting to hear from you to see if we are a good fit for each other. Paws up! Pluto.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures. Learn about our adoption process too!\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________",

I am food motivated, which will help in that category.\n\nI do love to smell; I may follow my nose. I will require a physically fenced-in yard. I came to the shelter with little information, they can only go off what behaviors they observe while I\u2019ve been here. They tell me I am sweet, and my tail never stops wiggling.\n\nPending a meet and greet, I may be okay with another dog. I have not been tested with cats at this time.\n\nDo to my size and limited information, I am recommended with children 8-10 years or older. This is pending observed interaction. I am a little timid in new situations, which could be due to poor training techniques with my previous owners.",

            "description": "Kimmie is a very special girl, if you know anything about French Bulldogs they\u2019re all very unique. However, Kimmie is a 4 year old girl who suffered a back injury that has caused her some issues. We have been working on treating these issues and they have greatly improved, but she\u2019s still and always will be a special needs dog. She needs a family who can be committed to her success, she\u2019s very loving and enjoys cuddling. She likes to play ball and chew on her stuffies. Kimmie would do best in a home where someone works from home or is retired and isn\u2019t left alone for long periods of time. We will not consider adopters who leave for long amounts of time as it is not in Kimmie\u2019s best interest. Kimmie is a complete sweetheart who loves hard, plays gently, and with the right family/commitment will thrive unbelievably. \n\nLocal adopters only. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in Kimmie, please apply online at www.PawsCrossed.dog",

Whoever put her there did not care about her at all. She was scared, confused and unsure how to trust. Second Chance answered her rescue plea from the shelter. Nessa had surgery to repair her elbow by one of the best in Tampa and she has fully healed up.\n\nHer emotional scars are still there. She is not fond of children and the sound of kids makes her uncomfortable.\n\nShe likes to chase/play with the cats in her foster home and has made lots of doggie friends there too - so much so,\nNessa will need another dog in her forever home.\n\nBeing on crate rest for months has limited her exposure but we are working on that. She enjoys walks in the neighborhood, playing with toys and running in the back yard so a fenced yard is a on her wish list.\n\nNessa also likes to cuddle on the couch and watch a good movie. We are looking for the very best home for her that will give her the love she deserves. Nessa is 7 months old and 35lbs.\n\nAvailable Tampa, FL - Adoption fee is $250.00\n\nFully vetted, chipped, HW Negative and spayed. Fenced Yard a must.",

            "description": ",Due to COVID-19, all adoptions will be by appointment only. To adopt, complete our online adoption application and an Adoption Counselor will contact you within 48-hours to schedule your adoption appointment. Adoptions for any pets in foster will be completed offsite at our PetSmart Claiborne location on a case by case basis. The safety of our foster parents and community is of utmost importance to us and it will be at the foster's discretion if they'd like to meet at this time. Thank you for choosing adoption! \n\nPanda is a bouncy, happy goofy little girl who loves attention.  She would benefit greatly from basic manners training.  She is affectionate and very playful.  She is a social girl who now just needs a family she can call her own.\n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

If you are interested in saving this pet, please reach out by phone asap to the Dog Savers hotline (480) 331-4188.\n\nUnderdog Rescue does not physically have this dog in it's possession. He/She is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4512411.\n\nHi, I'm Sid! I was found roaming on the freeway and am very nervous being in the shelter. I'm estimated to be 6 years old and a German Shepherd mix. I have been submissive with a female dog in the shelter, but overall I have not been very socialized so its best that I am the only dog in the home. Sid has enjoyed being in the yard, but he is not a fan of being on a leash. If you are looking for a more free-spirited companion, then Sid is your guy!\n\nSid (MCACC A4512411) is not available for adoption to the general public, but can be saved by a New Hope Partner.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

Flynn is a shy boy and it takes him a bit of time for him to trust you. He is strong on a leash, so we think a fenced backyard would be best for him to thrive in. He would do best with a young active family who will run, jog or exercise him often as he has lots of puppy energy. At this time, we recommend him as the only pet in the home.",

I get so excited sometimes that other dogs and I don't always get along... So I will thrive in a quiet environment where I am the only dog. I am good with older children, as I like to relax in peace. Please do not be shy, you can ask for me once you stop by! Please email adoption@lynchburghumane.org for more info, or feel free to stop by the center to meet me!",

They are Obsessed with bones and toys, especially squeaky ones! They still have puppy play behavior, which is cute!\n\nThey love to play with each other which can sometimes be kind of rough play but its nothing abnormal. They were found together hovered over each other in a ditch, so they are bonded and they are there for each other. Theyve grown a lot with confidence and they continue to grow. \n\nMateo and Mila can be kind of hyper when you first get home and bring them in because theyre excited to see you, but in about 15 minutes they settle and lay down and cuddle. \n\nThey come up to you for love, it is precious. they want you to hold them! They love to be next to their person. \n\nThey do not know any tricks but could certainly be taught! \n\nThey get nervous at first when new people come over to the foster home. The foster dad has visitors give a treat then the dogs seem to calm down and feel normal around the new person after a few minutes. \n\nThey have not shown any aggression towards other dogs while in our care. \n\nMateo is more confident meeting other dogs and people. Mila is very submissive. \n\nThe worst they do is bark in the yard when someone comes up to the fence. This is the only time they bark at the foster home. \n\nThe cutest thing is the way they love each other. They cuddle together like a cinnamon roll! \n\nOn leash they need a little work with pulling and recall. \n\nIn the car theyre curious looking out the window or they just lay down. \n\nThese are precious rescued dogs! They deserve the best! \n\nEmail Alayna@threelittlepittiesrescue.org with questions but best thing to do is to go ahead and fill out an application.\n\nThe adoption fee is $650 for the bonded pair. He/she is up to date on vaccines according to age, has received proper deworming, and comes with additional dewormer if needed. This pet is microchipped, spayed/neutered, comes with 2-6 months of Heartworm preventative, and one month free trial of pet insurance if registered by adopter with insurance company. All animals receive a health certificate (stating that a licensed veterinarian saw the pet and deemed it healthy for travel, but is not a promise of perfect health.) Our transports are USDA certified and the cost of transport is included in adoption fee!\n\nHe/she may currently be fostered in Houston, Tx but will be traveling to the PNW as soon as he/she finds her perfect home or may be traveling to a foster in the PNW soon. \n\nDue to the Covid-19 crisis we are experiencing a dramatic influx in inquiries and adoption applications. If you have questions regarding a pup you are interested in please fill out an adoption application. Once received it can take up to a week to complete our review. Be assured we have received your received your application! If you need more information regarding a pup you are interested in, the process of filling out an adoption application is still required prior to answering detailed questions. We value our potential adopters time and appreciate your patience as our staff navigate through the blessing of an overwhelming response for adoptions.\n\nPlease inquire by submitting an application to Alayna@threelittlepittiesrescue.org\n\nApplication link: https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/19753/generic\n\nPlease go to our website to see more about our rescue and what we do! We are very proud of our hard work in saving as many animals as we can, giving them what they need, and matching them with the right families.",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

Evangelina LOVES to run around the backyard and play with her foster brothers and sisters. She will need a home with a backyard where she can do her zoomies and get some exercise! This sweet gal has a lot of puppy in her so we are working on some house manners and some basic commands. She\u2019s incredibly smart and she's learning all of her sign commands. Evangelina likes all the belly rubs and scratches she can possibly get from her people! She will be fully vetted, vaccinated and microchipped prior to adoption.\n\nWe will require Evangelina to be in training within 10 days of adoption. Basic obedience training is crucial  for young pups like Evangelina to mature and grow into wonderful companions! It\u2019s also a great opportunity for Evangelina and her new family to bond with each other.\n\nFor more information about our adoption process and an application please visit www.whitekissesgreatdanerescue.com/adopt\n",

You would take him home (leash walks only for about 5-10 minutes) and keep him as calm as possible and then for his treatments you would bring him back in and pick him up the next day. When treatments are done, he would be yours.\nPlease call Maury Co Animal Shelter to set up an appt to meet him, if you have other dogs please bring for a meet and greet.  931-375-1402",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

            "description": "Hi my name is Gnocchi! I\u2019m 2 years old and 45-50 lbs! I was found with my four puppies in an abandoned trailer.  Luckily, ODHS rescued me and they have taken care of me ever since. My foster family has taken me from a skinny gal, to one that looks super healthy.\n\nHere are some things to know about me:\n1. I love my humans and getting pets, snuggles,  and attention.\n2. I take treats like a lady and I am very gentle overall.\n3. Good about telling my family when I need to go outside for potty time.\n4. Learned the command \"sit\"\n\nThings I am working on:\n1. Being crated (I don't like it so far and this is probably because I have never been crated before).\n2. Learning to be a \"dog\" after being neglected at an early age.\n\nYou can come adopt me or even join our foster program to help the humans learn all the awesome things about new dogs like me! Learn more on our website! \n\nHope to see you soon! \n\nWhat breed am I? Mixed mutt! ODHS does not breed label (unless there\u2019s official paperwork), as studies show it is nearly impossible to tell the exact breed of each dog based off of their appearance.\n\nEducational articles:\n3/3/3 Rule;\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturdays. \nOur adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience.  Currently, the average timeframe for a response to your application is 1 week.\n\nLike us on Facebook \"Old Dominion Humane Society\"\nand be a part of promoting forever homes for dogs in need.\n#Adopt #Donate #Foster #Volunteer \n\nNote: ODHS only adopts to Virginia and surrounding states (including D.C.). A $50 out of state fee applies.",

Oh well, I will just pick myself up and dust myself off and look for a new family! I have all of my vaccinations, I am heartworm negative, I have a microchip, and I have been spayed. You know I am still young and I have lots to learn about good doggie manners. The volunteers say I am off to a good start! Come adopt me and let\u2019s finish up with my good manners training.

I know a variety of basic commands, walk great on a leash, and am house-broken as well as crate trained. Although, my foster mom doesn't crate me because I'm so well behaved.\n\nAn experienced alpha owner with an all-adult household is preferred. Unfortunately, I cannot go to a home with children because I do have food aggression issues and kids are a bit too unpredictable for me. My foster parents are working on this with me, and my new parents will have to continue the work.\n\nI get along well with other dogs, like to chew bones (just don't put your hands near my mouth while I'm chewing) and absolutely love being outdoors. I'm very cuddly, love being pet and will become your new shadow.\n\nI'm a really good boy (my foster mom says so) and would love to be your new best friend! \n\n\n\nEmail: dogs@almosthomefoundation.org\n\nAlmost Home Foundation's adoption requirements:\n(1) Be at least 21 years of age;\n(2) Have the consent of all adults living in the household;\n(3) Have approval from the residence owner;\n(4) Have valid ID with current address;\n(5) Be approved by Almost Home Foundation as a suitable adoptive home; and\n(6) Live in the suburbs surrounding Schaumburg (Illinois Residents only)\n*** Please note that Almost Home Foundation accepts only cash or checks for adoption fees; we do not accept debit or credit cards. ***",

            "description": "SAY HELLO TO DAVE, a gorgeous, happy, fun-loving 11 month old, 50lb pitbull mix looking for a loving forever home with an experienced and active dog guardian. He is very energetic and loves to run so he would pair well with a jogger, power walker or avid hiker. He is in a terrific foster home and they share the following:\n\n\"Dave is a very friendly and good nature boy... he is an absolute love bug. His favorite thing in this world is cuddling up with his person and being petted, especially tummy rubs. He is generally quiet and calm when indoors, He loves playing outside, chasing balls and zooming around the yard. At the shelter he was good with all the dogs and he is good with my friendly boy when we walk together. He's still decompressing so that's all the interaction they have for now. He hasn't been around cats so we don't know what he thinks about them. When he first arrived it was apparent he hadn't received any training and he was pretty unruly.... jumping at me and mouthing me, racing around the house and acting like a silly puppy doing all those cute things he did as a puppy that aren't so cute anymore. Using basic force free training techniques, he is learning some good people manners... and he is doing better. He is a smart dog and loves to please but he has been allowed to rule the roost. Continued basic obedience training, lots of physical exercise and canine enrichment exercises will be essential to help him grow up to be a happy, well adjusted dog. He's housebroken, crate trained and has good leash manners. He will do best in a home with an active, experienced guardian familiar with the breed who will employ positive reinforcement techniques to teach him good manners. In return he will give you all his love.\"\n\nDAVE is nuetered and up to date on all shots. If you are interested in adopting this handsome fellow, please fill out an app request at https://www.lulusrescue.org/app-request.\n\nHis adoption fee is $425.00. Please note that training is highly recommended for all young dogs. As with all rescue animals, breed determination cannot be validated without genetic testing.\n\nThanks for adopting and saving a life! You are DAVE'S hero!",

            "description": "Mac is an old yellow lab in need of a loving caregiver. He suffers lameness in his rear legs and incontinence (issues holding his bowels and bladder) that may be related to alzheimer's. He has also shown issues with separation anxiety in the home. Mac is currently on three different medications and will likely have to be on them for life. Our vet has suggested a medication to help him with his separation anxiety at night time once he goes into his new home. Although his owners claimed him to be around eight years old at the time of surrender, our vet believes he is 12 or older. All that said, Mac is a really sweet guy, and still has the energy to play in our Big Yard. He gets along well with other dogs and would likely do well with kids.Animal meetings and adoptions by appointment only. Please go to kenthumane.org/adoption-applicationOnce approved we will call you to set up an appointment!",

This little girl who is around one year of age is more than ready to have a nest of her own, and she wants one with you! With a wagging tail and friendly smile, this bright girl will be the pawfect addition to your life. Birdie would fit best into an active home with children over 12 years old, where she is the only pet. Call our office and come check her out! ~ All of our dogs and puppies go home spayed/neutered, microchipped, heartworm tested (if at least 7 months old), and up to date on age-appropriate vaccinations. ~ We do our best to update information on adoptable pets as frequently as we can. If you're interested in a specific pet, we recommend that you call the shelter and ask if he or she still is available. Adoption questionnaires are processed in the order in which they're received.\nFor current adoption fees, please see our website, www.dearbornanimals.org. Adoption fee includes: age-appropriate vaccinations, spay or neuter, microchip, ID tag, fecal / worming, basic physical and behavior assessment. Dogs (6 months and older) receive an occult heartworm test. For an additional $20, cats (12 weeks and older) can be tested for FIV (feline immunodeficiency virus) / FLV (feline leukemia).",

Donte is super skinny right now but he is on his way to getting back to his proper weight of around 56lbs. \n\nWhen he started the program, Donte had some resource guarding issues that we have been working on and he's working through that very nicely. If he didn't want to give up his toy or whatever he was chewing on he wouldn't. He does know how to take advantage of his handler if they let him... but its always a game to him. He is super smart and already very clicker savvy. He is curious and not afraid to try new things and offer new behaviors.\n\nIf he gets bored he will chew on his harness or leash, so that may transfer to your house. He will need lots of exercise and things to keep his brain occupied. He knows lots of commands because he is such a quick study.\n\nDonte is early in his training so we will update his bio as he develops. But you can Apply for Donte today!

He loves to hang in his crate or just lay around on his place mat. He has never chewed up anything except his bones... he loves chew bones. Yote gets along with all the dogs who like him. Yote came in with his buddy Donte. Donte is also with us and available for adoption. \n\nYote has learned so many things already. He is working on completing his training curriculum and already walks well on leash, knows his name, sit, down, place and many other tricks and commands. He loves to gather all his \"babies\" (stuffed toys) from around the room and bring them to his bed to hang out with him.\n\nYote would make a great companion. He's a very confident dog and He loves to be loved. Oh and he doesn't shed!\n\nYou can apply for Yote today!

            "description": "Little Truffles is just a darling. She was wondering the streets of Lockhart full of fleas and suffering from mange. Her early neglect can also be seen in the terrible gum and front tooth issues she has. THIS however does not keep her from taking treats! :) We don't have current pictures of Truffles but we will take more when she goes to get spayed in January. Her coat has come back beautifully and she looks happy and healthy now. Here is what her handlers have to say about her:\n\n\"Truffles is a very gentle, sweet, old girl. She doesn't really care for toys much but loves to be petted and touched. She knows sit, down, come, and place. She loves her crate and runs to it when you say \"Go to Bed\". She also knows some cute tricks. She walks really good on leash. She is a very smart little girl. She does not get on my bed so she would be good being allowed on or off the furniture. Her favorite place is on her bed by your feet. But she don't like the cold floor or the wet grass....She's a little prissy :)\"\n\nTruffles is only 20lbs and would be great for an apartment. She gets along with most of the dogs in the dorm but she is a little bossy. If she doesn't like a dog approaching, she lets them know.\n\nTruffles should be getting spayed in January. She can not be adopted until she has recovered from that, so probably by the end of January. But you can apply for her today!\n\nFind us at www.pawsinprison.com Facebook: @pawsinprison Instag: @pawsinprisontx and on YouTube: Paws In Prison - Lockhart,TX - YouTube",

            "description": "This gentle giant Casanova came strolling up to the Lockhart fence during rec one day, flashing is piercing blue eyes. Seeing how much fun the dogs were having inside he decided he wanted in. Weeks later while walking through the Animal Control, there he was waiting for rescue. We got there just in time.\n\nRanger is super friendly to everyone he meets and is as gentle as can be. There are some dogs he's not fond of in the program, otherwise he's very chilled and laid back. Ranger loves to play ball outside but he's just as content spending lazy days inside. And if you need him to kennel up, he's happy to comply.\n\nWorking through the curriculum, Ranger has done remarkably well in a very short time. He is a great walker, loving to be by your side. He even knows a few tricks!\n\nRanger could get adopted at the beginning of January. We will be exposing him to kids and cats soon and will update his profile. But you can apply for ranger today!\nCheck us out on Facebook @pawsinprison or on Instagram: @pawsinprisontx Subscribe to our YouTube Channel: Paws In Prison - Lockhart,TX - YouTube Visit www.pawsinprison.com for more ways to help!",

This unbearably handsome creature doesn't see too well, nor do we think his hearing is great. We also suspect he's in the beginning stages of dementia. However, all that aside, Earl is as gentle and sweet as can be. He'll let you snuggle and love on him as much as you want; cuddling is his favorite past-time! When he's not being swooned over by staff, he can be found spooning with a fellow canine friend for a restful afternoon nap. Earl won't leap at the opportunity to take a long walk in the park, but he does enjoy getting outside to bask in the rays of the sun. He's a mellow man of very few words, but would be great company for the right person. Won't you please consider giving our beloved pal the loving forever home he so deserves?",

Although she was quite energetic when she first arrived, she's calmed down a bit as she's acclimated to her new space. Not only does she have the cutest face and most exquisitely colored coat, she also has a great personality. Her temperament is a good balance of mellow and lively. Toolie is great with her canine pals; even showing mama-like patience with the rambunctious youngsters. She also seems to sense the seniors who need a little extra love, as she's usually cuddled up with them for an afternoon nap. As much fondness as she has for her Pug pals, her favorite place to be is with a human. If you dare to sit down around her, she'll be in your lap in no time. Whether it's for pets or to curl up for a nap, she will gladly take all the snuggles and adoration you have to give. When looking for your next forever friend, please consider our beloved companion, Toolie. We know she'll make a loving and loyal side-kick to just about any family.",

            "description": "Oh Pookie...this precious creature was relinquished to us in the most horrific condition, staff couldn't believe their eyes. His skin was in such bad shape, it was almost difficult to touch him. Thankfully, with some good quality food and meds, he's on the mend and is starting to heal. Pookie is a great boy and oh-so-sweet! Although not always certain how to accept human affection, he's learning. Sometimes we even hear him cry until one of our staff members goes to him and offers love and attention. He will definitely need a family willing to be patient with him while he adjusts to receiving such adoration. \"\"Pook Pook\"\" is friendly and kind with his Pug pals, as well as inquisitive about everything! Riding in the car isn't really his thing - it makes him a bit nervous. However, he does enjoy getting outside for a sniff of fresh air and some sun. Pookie is as cute as a teddy bear and with a little time, we're almost certain he'll become incredibly comfortable with accepting the love and attention you give. Please consider our special boy as your next forever family member.",

To arrange a meet and greet with a dog, you MUST fill out the adoption application so that it can be sent to the foster parent for review to determine if your home is a match for the dog. If a dog receives multiple applications, we operate on a best-fit basis, not first come first served.***\n\nHi, my name is Demi! I am a young girl, somewhere between 1 and 2 years old. I was found running down the middle of the road by the Dog Program Manager of Second Chance. When she found me, it was clear that I had recently been breastfeeding. She tried to find my puppies but couldn't. She even called out a professional to help find them, but again, no luck. She concluded that I had likely been dumped which made her sad. If only she could understand me, she would've known that getting dumped was the best thing that ever happened to me. I mean, how lucky am I? I was found by the Dog Program Manager of a local rescue! \n\nShe has been fostering me ever since and I am now a healthy gal! She told me I'll never have puppies again, which is awesome because it hurts to breastfeed once those suckers get teeth! I really love foster mom, but I am definitely more nervous around men. I bark at them to let them know they make me nervous, and I need time to get used to their presence. I will either need to go to an all-women forever home, or to a forever home with a patient man that is willing to help me overcome my fears. Since I am so nervous, foster mom says I also need a home with no small kids. An adult only home would be preferable, but older, respectful kids may also be fine. \n\nI have not been tested with cats, but I can be upon request. I am good with my foster brother and foster sister, but I do get a bit nervous/protective when I meet new dogs. Having a playmate would be awesome, but I will need time to feel comfortable. But let me tell you, once I warm up I am an AWESOME playmate for a playful pup that needs a friend :). Having a confident fur-friend would be great for me. \n\nI am so full of love, but I do need help learning how to be the best version of myself. \n\nI am spayed, up-to-date on vaccinations, microchipped, have been dewormed, and am current on my monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventatives. My adoption fee is $300. If you think I could be the one for you, please fill out an adoption application on our website: www.secondchancenc.org. Thank you!",

She's the poster girl for Athletic Dog of the Year! She loves getting her cardio in with long walks on her Gentle Leader. She enjoys working out her big brain by practicing her commands, Sit, Down, Paw, Other Paw, Stay, Touch & Leave It. She enjoys play/life balance too and is the perfect home office dog, just lays next to you while you work. She's potty trained, can use a dog door and, oh yes -- LOVES car rides. Come meet her and see for yourself. \nCheyenne is a young, active girl who will benefit from a structured home. She's reactive to other dogs currently, but with work, improvement could be made as she is very responsive to training. Chey would do best in an adult only home as the only animal.",

I came up from Houston just before New Years Eve and Im so thankful for everything to come in 2021- mainly, my own forever family. A little bit about me: I LOVE playing. I am super curious, but not extremely brave- I need a little time before I acclimate to new surroundings. Once I do though its party time! I love being outside chewing on sticks, exploring, playing with my sister and big foster dog siblings, playing with my human foster siblings, taking walks- the works! I am crate trained and sleep happily there all night, and am working hard at house training. Im a sweet little snuggle bug once playtime is over. I will be the best new family member for a house with people and pups around to keep me company- please come meet me and youll fall right in love! \n\n*Homeownership required!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Thank you for your interest in adopting one of our foster animals! The first step in the adoption process is submitting an application. Please visit our website for more information and a link to the application: www.kgarl.org/info/adoption\n\nHello World!! Are you ready for 2021? I absolutely am! We have all had a difficult 2021 and I was no exception. I found myself in the shelter, injured and missing part of my leg. I honestly don't remember what happened; I've pretty much blocked out all of the negative things that 2020 brought! I am, however, trying to remember the positive that has happened. The nice people at the animal shelter contacted KGARL for help since they know KGARL has a soft spot for hounds (who can blame them ... I mean, we are adorable ) and KGARL immediately said yes. They found a foster for me and I was ready for a new beginning.\n\nHowever, 2020 ... the leg had to be amputated. The recovery took a long time and I was miserable. My foster mommy took really really good care of me. After battling pain, infections, multiple visits to the vet and a couple of surgeries, I am all healed ... take that 2020!\n\nNow on to 2021! I am so ready to start a new life. I am a sweet girl that loves all humans. I am about 2 years old, housebroken, good with kids, cats, dogs, pigs, and every other animal I've met on my journey. Even though I am a tripod, I am active and like to play and exercise. I would prefer a home with someone that is not gone for long periods of time because I like the company. I can sleep in my crate but prefer not to . I am a really good girl, so If you are looking for a new family member to help you forget 2020 and start a great 2021 together, that is me!!!\n\nAdoption Application can be found online here : https://www.kgarl.org/info/adoption\n\nAdoption process\n\nOnce your application is received, the application process begins. We will review your application, check your references, check with your vet (if there are other animals in the household), speak to a landlord (if you rent), and arrange for a home visit.\n\nSubmitting an application does not guarantee a specific dog or cat. We strive to match the personality and needs of our foster dogs and cats to a family who will best fulfill those needs. If a family is not approved for a particular pet, it does not mean they will not be a good pet owner, it just means that their needs and the needs of the particular pet don't match. We do not adopt on a \"first come, first serve\" basis.\n\nPlease note that we do not do same day adoptions. If you are applying for a popular animal (such as puppies, small dogs, or special breeds), it can take several days for our volunteers to reach a decision that is best for the animal. We understand that it's difficult to wait, but please don't email us multiple times a day to check on the status of your application. We are a very small group and the same people that are reviewing your application are also replying to hundreds of emails and facebook messages. We are all volunteers and have full time jobs outside of KGARL, so any time spent replying to emails/messages is time we are not reviewing your application.\n\nOnce your application is pre-approved (meaning, we don't see any red flags based on our preliminary review of your application), the applicant may be invited to meet their potential family member at a location convenient to the foster family (usually at the King George Petco). Adoptions will NOT take place at the meet & greet, this is just a chance for us to get to know you and for you to spend time with our animals. After the meet and greet, we will ask that you spend some time thinking over your decision and we will do the same.\n\nAfter the application review process is complete (meet & greet with animal, home visit, reference/vet checks, background check, etc.), if all is acceptable to both adopter and KGARL and we all agree to move forward, we will schedule a day/time to finalize the adoption. The adopter will be asked to sign the final paperwork and we will collect the adoption fee (cash, check, or paypal are all acceptable). At this time, you can either pick up your pet, or schedule a time to do so. Adopters will be required to schedule an appointment with their veterinarian of choice within 10 days of taking your new pet home.\n\nAll Adoptions Include:\n\nLifetime of free advice from KGARL!\n\nSpayed or Neutered Pet\n\nHeartworm, FIV, Feline Leukemia Testing\n\nComplete medical records\n\nUp to date on core vaccines\n\nOn Flea/Tick Preventative\n\nMicrochipped\n\nSample of Pet Food\n\nAdoption Fees (unless otherwise noted in the pet's description):\n\nSpecial Breeds of Dogs: See pet's description\nPuppies: $400\nAdult Dogs : $350\nAdult Hounds and Beagles: $250\nKittens: $125\nAdult Cats: $100",

Now, she's sharing their couch with them, cuddling and sleeping on their laps while they watch TV. When she asks for a belly rub and gets it, she's probably the happiest dog in the world. This curious, energetic lady loves going for walks and exploring as much as she can, sometimes picking up sticks and carrying them along the way. She can pull on her leash and react to other dogs, but her behavior is getting better. At home, she loves chewing and tossing her Kong toys around (and would like to chew almost anything). She's a smart girl who's learned to obey 'sit' and 'up' and is working on 'go to bed.' And she's a house-trained girl who does well when left home alone, usually napping on her bed. Masey would love to be the only dog in a home so she can get all of her human's attention. She'd also love a home with a backyard she can run in. Come meet this super friendly, affectionate girl. Her tail will wag and wag!",

Trooper came to ASR as every vet said he was \"unadoptable,\" due to being incontinent, and he was sadly facing euthanasia. Fortunately, they reached out to ASR as his last hope! When he arrived at ASR, he was immediately scheduled with the Neurology at VSH to diagnose his spinal issues and the cause of his incontinence.\n\nTrooper was found in Mexicali after being hit by a car and left to die. A rescuer found him lying there helplessly and rushed him to the vet for help. For Trooper's case, the spinal cord severed just enough to make him incontinent ,but enough that he can still walk. Trooper has been prescribed medications to help with any pain and incontinence ,but spends most his days happily lounging in the sun.\n\nTrooper will always be incontinent (not able to control his bladder or bowels. This is easily managed with diapers and/or belly bands that he doesn't mind wearing at all! Trooper is apart of our our lifelong foster program where his medical and needs are covered for life by ASR, all he requires from you is love and some assistance! He currently loves the a good squeaky toy and hanging with the other dogs and of course, treats!\n\nIf you are interested, please fill out the Interest Form linked, please fill out the Interest Form application link here\n\nhttps://amazingstraysrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms/form?formid=5860\n\nThe adoption fee covers vaccinations, Rabies, spay/neuter, and microchip.\nAmazing Strays Rescue Team\nW: https://www.amazingstraysrescue.org E: info@amazingstraysrescue.org\nFacebook",

He gets along great with the other 4 legged friends in the house and it great with our 3 kids ages 4-9. Tracker is very smart and is learning basic commands like sit and stay. We are working on potty training and he knows to go to the back door when it is time to go outside. He walks well on a leash and enjoys walks around the neighborhood. Once his leg is healed he will love to run around the back yard. Once full grown Tracker will be large and will need lots of room to run and play.\n\nTracker will be up to date on all shots, neutered, microchipped and free of his leg cast!\n\nTo apply to meet Tracker please complete an application to adopt on epicanimalrescue.org. The fee to adopt is $325 and includes neuter, 3 rounds of vaccinations, deworming and microchip. Tracker's surgeries to repair his leg have also been covered by generous donations to our organization.",

            "description": "Seattle Foster Update 1/30:\n\nShug is a sweet, gentle pup with a beautiful, soft red coat. She's a perfect size at 25 pounds. She loves playing with the resident dog and squeaky toys, sniffing around the yard, gazing out the window, and snuggling. She is very dog friendly, and MUST HAVE another confident balanced dog in the home. She knows sit, crate, come, no, and she gently taps on the door when she needs to go out (she's never had an accident in the house). Shug is doing better on the leash, but will need a confident person to help her continue gaining confidence.\n\nShug is the easiest foster we've had because she listens so well and has excellent house manners (other than occasionally stealing socks). She loves her crate and sleeps quietly throughout the night. She crates herself when she is feeling overwhelmed. She likes to vocalize when playing and communicating, but is overall very quiet. She is not an alert barker.\n\nShe came to us very scared of humans and it took a long time for her to feel safe with us. Now she is an excellent family dog, and she is making great progress with strangers. She keeps her distance when new people arrive, but will warm up enough to cautiously accept a treat.\n\nOverall, Shug is a hidden gem. A family will be very lucky to have her!\n\nSeattle Foster Update :Shug would prefer a home away from the hustle and bustle of the city with someone familiar with this breed. Shug would prefer to have a balanced doggy companion in her forever home-- someone she can look to for confidence and how to \"dog\". Shug is food motivated and very smart-- she will learn quickly with strong calm leadership. No first time dog owners.\n\nShe is very sensitive and a good listener. She wants to be a love bug (total sweetheart). Dog\n\nrespectful kids are ok, prefer older than 7.\n\nShe's started hopping around happily and wagging when family members come back from being out of the house, but she still darts away if we approach her. When we do trick her into snuggling, she loves it. She will be a\n\nsnuggler when she gets past her shyness.\n\nShug is\nExcellent around the resident dog and dogs walking by our yard. VERY cautious around people, but curious, and doesn't want to be left alone. SLOWLY warming up to our family. Very\n\ntypical of the breed.\n\nShug would like to\n\nPlay-all-day if she can, but does settle nicely. Uncomfortable in the house, but not klutzy. She doesn't chew stuff, doesn't knock things over, hasn't had a accident. Shug is\n\nExcellent at night in the crate. She is Fine in the crate during the day if someone is home. We are looking for a home with someone at home even post Covid.\n\nShug, like most cattle dogs , is a talker, lots of little whines and yaps for communication, but *so far* not an alert barker. Shug isn't good on a leash.. yet! We are working on it She is currently Very scared to ride in a car and we are working on that.\n\nShug Loves to play! Likes plush toys, confused a\n\nbout balls. Plays chase and gentle wrestling with the resident dog until the resident dog gets tired. Very agile. (Would probably be excellent running partner/agility work dog.)\n\nAnimal Profile:\nShug is an estimated 2.5 year old female heeler/terrier mix who will be joining us from Texas on December 16th. She is a former street dog and can by shy at first. She does warm up quickly and enjoys attention and petting. She gets alone well with other dogs and would do best in a home with a resident dog. We will post more info as we get to know her.\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $500, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, heartworm test, and flight from Hawaii. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue.\n\nApply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org\n\nAnimal History: This dog was transferred from our Texas rescue partner. This dog will be available for adoption in Seattle once evaluated.",

Fun fun fun is on his adjenda so he'd do really well with another dog to play with. Duke is good with children but can easily knock small children over and can be a handful himself. He would do well with taking a basic training class like every puppy should.\n\nDuke came into rescue with a heart murmur and has had his consultation and echo cardiogram with a cardiologist at the Oakland Veterinary Referal Services in Michigan. He has been diagnosed with a grade V/VI systolic murmur over the left and right thorax and the great news is that Duke doesn't currently require any medication and his activity doesn't need to be monitored. Duke's cardiologist doesn't feel that he'll need any type of heart surgery or heart procedure in the future. He might need to go on a diaretic at some point in his life but they don't feel that he'll need other heart medications. Duke will need to be rechecked by a cardiologist in 9 months to 1 year.",

He is quiet and happy and seems to be a fine little dog who goes with the flow.  The best home might be one with a dog pal.  The photos are pre second eye removal when he arrived at the rescue.  He might be part long haired chihuahua but also with his colouring and size part pom or peke.",

Even at his weight, he can run so fences are important.  He loves walks and can go for miles.  He has only one good eye but sees well and for 11 years is in good shape and handsome albeit overweight.  He is quiet and gets along with everyone, loves car rides and will insist on long walks; he must get in better shape.  He was returned for causing the adopter to have problems with her allergies so we cant vouch for any hypo allergenic safety net.  This dog is located in our California Rescue.  His mother was a shih tzu but since his grooming we see Cocker Spaniel making him the size he is in addition to the weight.",

He has made doggy friends on walks. He likes to play in short bursts, goes for short and long walks. Has successfully mastered sitting in the car. In foster care he is only crated at night and when left alone in house. He quiets right down at night. He would make a perfect work from home buddy as he settles right down beside you while you work and will not the hog the Zoom limelight.\" Risken is an all over super-sweet little dude. He can be a tiny bit shy meeting someone new, but it isn't too long before he warms right up. He has a great balance of energy for walks, but very content to snuggle up by your side at home. He is going to make an awesome addition to a family looking for a true companion!\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $500, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, and heartworm test. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue.\n\nApply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org\n\nAnimal History: This dog was rescued from euthanasia at a high-kill shelter in California and will be available for adoption in Seattle, once evaluated in a loving foster home in the greater Seattle area.",

With one volunteer available to review all applications, we appreciate your patience as you wait for an email response. Adoption appointments are scheduled first come with approved application, first served. (See our adoption procedures below.)\n\nMy name is Casey. I came from a not-so-great situation with little experience with people. I've come a long way though and am learning to trust. Staff and volunteers have been very good to me. In time, I'll warm up to you too. Because of my former situation, I require a secure privacy fence to keep me safe. My estimated DOB is 12/1/2017; I weigh just over 42 lbs.\n\nHSPC's adoption fee is seventy-five-dollars through December 31, 2020, unless stated otherwise within the pet's description. At times, our adoption fees are lowered during special events that are posted to our website or Facebook page. Every pet that is available for adoption has been spayed/neutered, microchipped, and is up-to-date on vaccinations including heartworm preventative (canines). Adopters are required to schedule a wellness exam with their veterinarian at their cost within 7 days of adoption.\n\nPlease only submit one application. Once you are contacted by email, you will have an opportunity to provide us with any additional animal(s) under consideration.",

Indi looks to be around 6 years old and weights about 45 lbs. Going for long walks is her favorite activity along with being pet and hugged by her foster mom and visitors. Indi has shown a bit of aggression with some of our dogs so she'd be best as the only dog in the home. She does, however show no interest in our 10 chickens. This girl has been spayed, microchipped, vaccinated, and is current on flea, tick, and heartworm prevention. Her adoption fee is $150 to reimburse us for our veterinary expenses. Applications to adopt are at kathisk9s.org.\u00a0 meet greets are scheduled only for approved applicants",

Through luck and his darling personality, he has mostly avoided bad people, and has made friends with everyone he meets.  Because of these two circumstances, Daniel does not come with a lot of the abuse and behavioral baggage that many rescued dogs have.\n\nDaniel LOVES all humans, big or small. He's great with other dogs his size or larger. He's healthy as an ox but may have seasonal allergies. Daniel is VERY energetic \u2013 after playing outside, he relaxes and has lovely indoor manners.\n\nDaniel is currently being fostered in Houston, TX. We have adopted to many happy families in your area and can provide references. We use an amazing ground transport that goes to the PNW twice a month.\n\nDaniel is about 60 pounds, potty trained & crate trained, neutered, up to date on shots, and microchipped. Please email goodlif3adoptions@gmail.com or fill out an application on our website www.goodlif3bullyrescue.org/adoption-application-1 if you're interested in Daniel.",

Through luck and his darling personality, he has mostly avoided bad people, and has made friends with everyone he meets.  Because of these two circumstances, Daniel does not come with a lot of the abuse and behavioral baggage that many rescued dogs have.\n\nDaniel LOVES all humans, big or small. He's great with other dogs his size or larger. He's healthy as an ox but may have seasonal allergies. Daniel is VERY energetic \u2013 after playing outside, he relaxes and has lovely indoor manners.\n\nDaniel is currently being fostered in Houston, TX. We have adopted to many happy families in your area and can provide references. We use an amazing ground transport that goes to the NE twice a month.\n\nDaniel is about 60 pounds, potty trained & crate trained, neutered, up to date on shots, and microchipped. Please email goodlif3adoptions@gmail.com or fill out an application on our website www.goodlif3bullyrescue.org/adoption-application-1 if you're interested in Daniel.",

Daniel is VERY energetic \u2013 after playing outside, he relaxes and has lovely indoor manners\n\nDaniel is about 60 pounds, potty trained & crate trained, neutered, up to date on shots, and microchipped. Please email goodlif3adoptions@gmail.com or fill out an application on our website www.goodlif3bullyrescue.org/adoption-application-1 if you're interested in Daniel.",

I love to play with my furry friends but I come on strong and excited and not all dogs like me so I would do best as an only dog in the home just to be safe. I'm told I'm 1 1/2 years old, neutered, up to date on shots, and microchipped, whatever that means. I'm just ready to play or taking a walk sounds nice. Game of catch? I'm up for anything fun.\n\nI'm currently being fostered in Houston, TX. The nice people that are helping me find a new family have adopted to many happy people in your area and can provide references. They even use this amazing ground transport that goes your way twice a month\n\nWant to learn more about me? Email goodlif3adoptions@gmail.com or fill out an application on their webiste www.goodlif3bullyrescue.org/adoption-application-1 and they will get us in touch. I guess that means we're going to be best friends FOREVER! Can't wait to meet you.",

Extremely thin, scabby and brittle fur. At some point in his early life, someone did a butcher job on his ears and one was clearly infected. He is the sweetest boy, but very timid and shy at first. He is being fostered with another dog and doing well, but it will take him a big moment to build his self esteem to be able to be comfortable in packs of dogs. Percy now weighs 56 pounds. He will need a family that will be patient with him while he gets comfortable and trusts. \nAll dogs in our program are current on all their shots and micro chipped.  Also included is one FREE group session with our amazing trainer to his Street Obedience Class is included and not to be missed.We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them. An adoption fee, application, and contract are required. All our dogs can be met with an approved application.  We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them. Thank you for looking at a rescue dog for your next family member!

I love to play with my furry friends but I come on strong and excited and not all dogs like me so I would do best as an only dog in the home just to be safe. I'm told I'm 1 1/2 years old, neutered, up to date on shots, and microchipped, whatever that means. I'm just ready to play or taking a walk sounds nice. Game of catch? I'm up for anything fun.\n\nWant to learn more about me? Email goodlif3adoptions@gmail.com or fill out an application on their webiste www.goodlif3bullyrescue.org/adoption-application-1 and they will get us in touch. I guess that means we're going to be best friends FOREVER! Can't wait to meet you.",

As far as being with other dogs, if they are big dogs then they have to show that they are nice and he will be nice too, but if they aren't he gets protective. Rocky LOVES all people, hes honestly an easy dog, he just likes to hang out and be next to you! He loves to cuddle and wants to always sleep right next to you. He has a silly personality and will do anything for a treat!!\n\nRocky is is currently being fostered in Houston, TX. We have adopted to many very happy families in your area and can provide references. We use an amazing ground transport organization that goes to your area.\n\nHe\u2019s 2 years old, neutered, has all of his shots, and is microchipped.

            "description": "Jelly Bean is one big love bug that will make the best companion! She enjoys the finer things in life - like a comfy bed, a delicious meal, cuddling, and playing with her toys. Jelly Bean listens well and learns so quickly - she's eager to work on her basic manners, and will work hard when rewarded with a tasty treat! Jelly Bean is not a fan of small dogs or cats, a home with an experienced adopter, kids 12-and-up, and where she is the only pet would be a dream come true for this lovely lady. \n\nBeans weighs 60 lbs., about 5 years old and is spayed, current on vaccines and micro-chipped.  She is crate and potty trained. Jelly Bean has been waiting a long time for a furever home of her own. Are you that special someone?\n\nPlease email goodlif3adoptions@gmail.com or fill out an application on our website www.goodlif3bullyrescue.org/adoption-application-1 if you are interested in learning more about Jelly Bean.",

She loves to play and loves to learn--especially if treats are involved! We may not know her backstory (or why doorbells scare her so much), but we do know she is a great walker/runner, has excellent bed manners, and is exceptionally crate-trained. Allie is leery of human strangers, but is dog- and cat-friendly. Once she bonds with a human, she will protect and love them forever...even if they are using that evil vacuum cleaner.\n\nOur adoption fee is $260 for dogs over 5 months of age and includes all vaccinations, spay/neuter, micro chip implantation and registration/transfer, heartworm test and much more. Puppies up to 5 months of age are $275 and this includes all sets of puppy vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip implantation and registration and more. To adopt, go to www.fosterpetoutreach.org to complete an application.\nPlease note: Foster Pet Outreach tries to limit our adoptions to an area within approximately 60 miles of Peoria, Illinois.",

She had also lived outside and had little socialization. \n\nCharlie Girl is still typically wary of new people and as a result can be nippy, but warms up given time; she is cat friendly,  dog friendly, sweet natured, loves to cuddle and sleep in the sun. Would not recommend a home with small children. \n\nHer spay was delayed as a result of the infections she had, then the COVID shutdown delayed further.  She is due for spay and chip 2nd week of January. \n\nShe is HW NEGATIVE, UTD on vax and Rabies and on preventives.  Now that she is healthy she is ready for her forever home .\n\nCharlie Girl certainly has had a rough life and is so deserving of a warm and loving home where she can sleep on a cozy bed and get lots of cuddles. \n\nIf you think you are the right fit for Charlie Girl, please fill out our application:\n\nhttps://www.australianshepherdsfurever.org/adoption-application\n\nAll adoption fees are used for future rescue efforts.",

She is super sweet and loves people and other dogs. She does not like cats. She is recovering from nerve damage in her hind legs which occurred during her spay surgery. She is currently doing physical therapy once a week at St. Francis Animal Hospital in Woolwich Twp, NJ. She was paralyzed for a few weeks after her surgery but is now walking again. However, her gait is not 100%. She hops and wobbles. We are hoping after the nerves heal she will walk normally again. However, Dr's are not sure at this time. Nerve damage takes months to heal. She does love therapy though and does seem to be improving.",

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN APPLYING TO ADOPT, PLEASE DO NOT REPLY VIA PETFINDER, INSTEAD GO TO  www.arizonapoodlerescue.org TO THE \u201cAdopt Me\u201d SECTION TO FIND OUR ONLINE APPLICATION.  WE WILL NOT ADOPT OUR DOGS OUT OF STATE.   PLEASE RESPECT OUR PROCESS AND OUR TIME AS WE ARE ALL VOLUNTEERS.  WE WILL BE GLAD TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS DOG ONCE WE HAVE AN APPLICATION IN HAND.  PLEASE NO PHONE CALLS! \n\nWindy is a 1-yr-old, 14 lb terrier that came from the shelter along with her brother Dixon.  She is sweet and loving. She loves to wrestle at full speed with Dixon and any other young playful dogs. She also enjoys cuddling with Dixon and especially with her humans. Windy has dry eye in one of her eyes.  We have worked with the vet to find a medicine that works for her.  She will likely need to have prescription eyedrops in her eye every day for the remainder of her life. Windy almost does not shed at all.  A good brushing schedule will keep her from shedding. Windy gets along well with other dogs; we don\u2019t know about cats.  Windy would probably do well with dog savvy children who would play with her. Because she is a young terrier, she will look for things to do and could get into mischief if left alone for longer periods of time.  Windy has learned to use the dog door and will mostly do her business outdoors.  She needs another young playful dog in the home.\n\nThere is an application and possible home visit or reference check prior to adoption.   Applications can be found on our website www.arizonapoodlerescue.org.   Click on the \"Adopt Me\" tab.    Windy is being fostered in C.  Her adoption fee is $350.\n\nArizona Poodle Rescue is an all volunteer non-profit organization.  We do not have a shelter.  Our dogs are currently being fostered in private homes generally located in the Phoenix and Tucson area.",

            "description": "Bear is a senior love bug who came into rescue when his owners were no longer able to care for him. He was living outside most of the time, received no vet care and was in pretty bad condition. He is estimated to be between 10-12 years old and is ready to live out the rest of his years in a loving, quiet home! Bear spends most of his day napping, eating and going on walks. His foster mom has said he is a pleasure to host! Bear is currently being fostered in a home with another dog and gets along well just fine with his foster brother. Previously, he was in a home with cats so it is known that Bear would do just fine in a home with cats. \n\nBeing a senior Bear comes with arthritis of his back legs and occasionally will need help getting up if he is laying or sitting for to long. His foster mom has been using a sling and it has been working great. After doing bloodwork on Bear it has been known that he has some elevated liver enzymes and is currently on a liver supplement. He is also on joint supplements and nerve pain medication to help with his arthritis. Other than that, Bear is a healthy senior who is eager to find his forever home! \n\nThe ideal home for Bear would be with someone who is home most of the time and can provide Bear with company throughout the day. He is a gentle boy who loves to have his people around but will do well with being alone for shorter periods of time. Bear's forever family should be willing to walk Bear short lengths throughout the day to help with his joints/arthritis. They should also be willing to keep Bear on a schedule..with his food, medications and supplements! \n\nBear is pretty much potty trained but will have occasional accidents if not let out often. \n\nOverall, Bear is a sweet senior boy who deserves a loving home to call his own. \n\nIf you are interested in making Bear a forever part of your family..please fill out an adoption application on our website www.roversretreat.org\n\nBear's adoption fee is $300 and he is being fostered in Chatsworth, CA.",

As the photographer surprisingly discovered, some of the non-Husky Humane Society canines were overjoyed at having an opportunity for a frolic in the snow- covered bark park. 2-year-old Duchess used the winter precipitation for an enthusiastic romp as she went sliding, skidding, sledding and maybe in her mind, a little bit of skiing during the snow adventure. Even during the escapade, Duchess displayed good eye contact, kept a nice focus on her human and came quickly to him when called, performing a respectable sit on request. Duchess is strong of stature and has yet to learn to walk gently on leash. She is a fun-loving canine who would prefer to be the only dog in the family. Duchess has a totally housetrained skill set.",

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN APPLYING TO ADOPT, PLEASE DO NOT REPLY VIA PETFINDER, INSTEAD GO TO  www.arizonapoodlerescue.org TO THE \u201cAdopt Me\u201d SECTION TO FIND OUR ONLINE APPLICATION.  WE WILL NOT ADOPT OUR DOGS OUT OF STATE.   PLEASE RESPECT OUR PROCESS AND OUR TIME AS WE ARE ALL VOLUNTEERS.  WE WILL BE GLAD TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS DOG ONCE WE HAVE AN APPLICATION IN HAND.  PLEASE NO PHONE CALLS! \n\nDixon is a 1-yr-old, 14 lb terrier that came from the shelter along with his sister Windy.  He is as sweet and loving as he is cute. He loves to wrestle at full speed with Windy and any other young playful dogs. He also enjoys cuddling with Windy and especially with his humans, sleeping right up against them at night.  Dixon almost does not shed at all.  A good brushing schedule will keep him from most shedding. Dixon gets along well with other dogs; we don\u2019t know about cats.  Dixon would probably do well with dog savvy children who would play with him. Because he is a young terrier, he will look for things to do and could get into mischief if left alone for longer periods of time.  Dixon has learned to use the dog door and will mostly do his business outdoors.

My puppies are finally old enough to get adopted so that means I am too! My foster mom and her friends spent months trying to catch me. You can see on my side I got a bad wound (healed!!) and thankfully my foster mom caught me right in time before that got worse and right before I had my puppies. I'm pretty shy and a little skittish of new people but once I learn to trust you all I want are pets and attention! I'm fine around other dogs (I live with both big and little dogs) but I haven't decided if I actually want to play with them yet. I've been pretty focused on my puppies. Now that they have gone to their forever home, my true personality can come out and shine! I don't really like the crate but I'm not destructive when left out, plus I'm house trained using a doggy door. If you adopt me I'll be sure to give you lots of love!",

            "description": "RC is a total love bug who just wants to be a dog. He did not have a good life prior to coming to MCAS. He now is a happy boy, he will sit for treats. He needs more time and training but he is a quick learner and responds great to correction. He walks on leash and is very food motivated. He doesn\u2019t like other dogs to be around his food. He will sit and wait for you to put his bowl down and when it\u2019s empty he happily lets you take it. We are continuously working with him    and he\u2019s making good progress, with some more TLC and a family RC would be the best dog. He is so loving and playful. He just needs a home to call his own with a loving family.\n\nPlease click link to fill out an application for adoption and someone will contact you.\nhttps://form.jotform.com/202108953737155",

She will make a fabulous partner.\n\nKiKi loves other dogs, all humans and does well with other animals. Her exuberance and herding instincts mean she would do best in an active household without very young children. This lovely girl, is playful, affectionate and eager to be friends.\n\nPoor KiKi was found under an abandoned house all alone when she was about eight months old and that's not the worst part  - her left front leg was broken. Luckily, she was rescued and got the vet care she needed.  The vet was able to save her leg, but she does have a slight limp. It doesn't slow her down one bit, though.  \n\nKiKi is housetrained, crate trained, up-to-date on her vaccinations, spayed, microchipped and heartworm negative.\n\nPS We're guessing on the breed(s) but think, based on appearance and temperament, that they're pretty good guesses",

She had also lived outside and had little socialization. \n\nCharlie Girl is still typically wary of new people and as a result can be nippy, but warms up given time; she is cat friendly,  dog friendly, sweet natured, loves to cuddle and sleep in the sun. Would not recommend a home with small children. \n\nHer spay was delayed as a result of the infections she had, then the COVID shutdown delayed further.  She is due for spay and chip 2nd week of January. \n\nShe is HW NEGATIVE, UTD on vax and Rabies and on preventives.  Now that she is healthy she is ready for her forever home .\n\nCharlie Girl certainly has had a rough life and is so deserving of a warm and loving home where she can sleep on a cozy bed and get lots of cuddles. \n\nIf you think you are the right fit for Charlie Girl, please fill out our application:\n\nhttps://www.australianshepherdsfurever.org/adoption-application\n\nAll adoption fees are used for future rescue efforts.",

She is super sweet and loves people and other dogs. She does not like cats. She is recovering from nerve damage in her hind legs which occurred during her spay surgery. She is currently doing physical therapy once a week at St. Francis Animal Hospital in Woolwich Twp, NJ. She was paralyzed for a few weeks after her surgery but is now walking again. However, her gait is not 100%. She hops and wobbles. We are hoping after the nerves heal she will walk normally again. However, Dr's are not sure at this time. Nerve damage takes months to heal.

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN APPLYING TO ADOPT, PLEASE DO NOT REPLY VIA PETFINDER, INSTEAD GO TO  www.arizonapoodlerescue.org TO THE \u201cAdopt Me\u201d SECTION TO FIND OUR ONLINE APPLICATION.  WE WILL NOT ADOPT OUR DOGS OUT OF STATE.   PLEASE RESPECT OUR PROCESS AND OUR TIME AS WE ARE ALL VOLUNTEERS.  WE WILL BE GLAD TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS DOG ONCE WE HAVE AN APPLICATION IN HAND.  PLEASE NO PHONE CALLS! \n\nWindy is a 1-yr-old, 14 lb terrier that came from the shelter along with her brother Dixon.  She is sweet and loving. She loves to wrestle at full speed with Dixon and any other young playful dogs. She also enjoys cuddling with Dixon and especially with her humans. Windy has dry eye in one of her eyes.  We have worked with the vet to find a medicine that works for her.  She will likely need to have prescription eyedrops in her eye every day for the remainder of her life. Windy almost does not shed at all.  A good brushing schedule will keep her from shedding. Windy gets along well with other dogs; we don\u2019t know about cats.  Windy would probably do well with dog savvy children who would play with her. Because she is a young terrier, she will look for things to do and could get into mischief if left alone for longer periods of time.  Windy has learned to use the dog door and will mostly do her business outdoors.  She needs another young playful dog in the home.\n\nThere is an application and possible home visit or reference check prior to adoption.   Applications can be found on our website www.arizonapoodlerescue.org.   Click on the \"Adopt Me\" tab.    Windy is being fostered in C.

He was living outside most of the time, received no vet care and was in pretty bad condition. He is estimated to be between 10-12 years old and is ready to live out the rest of his years in a loving, quiet home! Bear spends most of his day napping, eating and going on walks. His foster mom has said he is a pleasure to host! Bear is currently being fostered in a home with another dog and gets along well just fine with his foster brother. Previously, he was in a home with cats so it is known that Bear would do just fine in a home with cats. \n\nBeing a senior Bear comes with arthritis of his back legs and occasionally will need help getting up if he is laying or sitting for to long. His foster mom has been using a sling and it has been working great. After doing bloodwork on Bear it has been known that he has some elevated liver enzymes and is currently on a liver supplement. He is also on joint supplements and nerve pain medication to help with his arthritis. Other than that, Bear is a healthy senior who is eager to find his forever home! \n\nThe ideal home for Bear would be with someone who is home most of the time and can provide Bear with company throughout the day. He is a gentle boy who loves to have his people around but will do well with being alone for shorter periods of time. Bear's forever family should be willing to walk Bear short lengths throughout the day to help with his joints/arthritis. They should also be willing to keep Bear on a schedule..with his food, medications and supplements! \n\nBear is pretty much potty trained but will have occasional accidents if not let out often. \n\nOverall, Bear is a sweet senior boy who deserves a loving home to call his own. \n\nIf you are interested in making Bear a forever part of your family..please fill out an adoption application on our website www.roversretreat.org\n\nBear's adoption fee is $300 and he is being fostered in Chatsworth, CA.",

As the photographer surprisingly discovered, some of the non-Husky Humane Society canines were overjoyed at having an opportunity for a frolic in the snow- covered bark park. 2-year-old Duchess used the winter precipitation for an enthusiastic romp as she went sliding, skidding, sledding and maybe in her mind, a little bit of skiing during the snow adventure. Even during the escapade, Duchess displayed good eye contact, kept a nice focus on her human and came quickly to him when called, performing a respectable sit on request. Duchess is strong of stature and has yet to learn to walk gently on leash. She is a fun-loving canine who would prefer to be the only dog in the family. Duchess has a totally housetrained skill set.",

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN APPLYING TO ADOPT, PLEASE DO NOT REPLY VIA PETFINDER, INSTEAD GO TO  www.arizonapoodlerescue.org TO THE \u201cAdopt Me\u201d SECTION TO FIND OUR ONLINE APPLICATION.  WE WILL NOT ADOPT OUR DOGS OUT OF STATE.   PLEASE RESPECT OUR PROCESS AND OUR TIME AS WE ARE ALL VOLUNTEERS.  WE WILL BE GLAD TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS DOG ONCE WE HAVE AN APPLICATION IN HAND.  PLEASE NO PHONE CALLS! \n\nDixon is a 1-yr-old, 14 lb terrier that came from the shelter along with his sister Windy.  He is as sweet and loving as he is cute. He loves to wrestle at full speed with Windy and any other young playful dogs. He also enjoys cuddling with Windy and especially with his humans, sleeping right up against them at night.  Dixon almost does not shed at all.  A good brushing schedule will keep him from most shedding. Dixon gets along well with other dogs; we don\u2019t know about cats.  Dixon would probably do well with dog savvy children who would play with him. Because he is a young terrier, he will look for things to do and could get into mischief if left alone for longer periods of time.  Dixon has learned to use the dog door and will mostly do his business outdoors.  He needs another young playful dog in the home. \n\nThere is an application and possible home visit or reference check prior to adoption.   Applications can be found on our website www.arizonapoodlerescue.org.   Click on the \"Adopt Me\" tab.    Dixon is being fostered in Chandler.  His adoption fee is $350.\n\nArizona Poodle Rescue is an all volunteer non-profit organization.  We do not have a shelter.  Our dogs are currently being fostered in private homes generally located in the Phoenix and Tucson area.",

My puppies are finally old enough to get adopted so that means I am too! My foster mom and her friends spent months trying to catch me. You can see on my side I got a bad wound (healed!!) and thankfully my foster mom caught me right in time before that got worse and right before I had my puppies. I'm pretty shy and a little skittish of new people but once I learn to trust you all I want are pets and attention! I'm fine around other dogs (I live with both big and little dogs) but I haven't decided if I actually want to play with them yet. I've been pretty focused on my puppies. Now that they have gone to their forever home, my true personality can come out and shine! I don't really like the crate but I'm not destructive when left out, plus I'm house trained using a doggy door. If you adopt me I'll be sure to give you lots of love!",

He needs more time and training but he is a quick learner and responds great to correction. He walks on leash and is very food motivated. He doesn\u2019t like other dogs to be around his food. He will sit and wait for you to put his bowl down and when it\u2019s empty he happily lets you take it. We are continuously working with him    and he\u2019s making good progress, with some more TLC and a family RC would be the best dog. He is so loving and playful. He just needs a home to call his own with a loving family.\n\nPlease click link to fill out an application for adoption and someone will contact you.\nhttps://form.jotform.com/202108953737155",

She will make a fabulous partner.\n\nKiKi loves other dogs, all humans and does well with other animals. Her exuberance and herding instincts mean she would do best in an active household without very young children. This lovely girl, is playful, affectionate and eager to be friends.\n\nPoor KiKi was found under an abandoned house all alone when she was about eight months old and that's not the worst part  - her left front leg was broken. Luckily, she was rescued and got the vet care she needed.  The vet was able to save her leg, but she does have a slight limp. It doesn't slow her down one bit, though.  \n\nKiKi is housetrained, crate trained, up-to-date on her vaccinations, spayed, microchipped and heartworm negative.\n\nPS We're guessing on the breed(s) but think, based on appearance and temperament, that they're pretty good guesses",

A little bit shy at first, but eager to connect with you and follow your lead, Atticus has the makings of the perfect friend.\n\nAtticus is looking for his human who will confidently guide him through life, he cannot hear, so body language is very important to communicate with him. Once you have established a connection with him and understanding of each other, together you can enjoy the fun and games which are a very important part of the Atticus lifestyle. Playing fetch is way up on the lists of musts but so is a nap on the cot. Extremes aren't for Atticus. He enjoys his treats and his car rides as much as his walks and naps.\n\nAtticus just needs a human of his own and a place to call home. He is incredibly deserving of your commitment and kindness, this boy is ready to blossom with all the direction and attention you can provide him.\n\nStructure and security will help Atticus become the dog he was meant to be. A smile that\ngorgeous and those soulful eyes are worth the effort. A buddy for life is just the beginning of a\nwonderful adventure with Atticus.\n\nAtticus is 2 years old, 87 lbs, and ready for his forever home!

            "description": "** Please Note: we are looking for a home for Mossy with NO other pets.\n\nMossy is a beautiful, blue-eyed, blue merle aussie. She is a little on the smaller side, weighing a little less than 40 pounds. She just turned 5 years old, but still shows puppy energy when she gets excited. Mossy can be very timid around new people so she prefers to have a small inner circle of humans because too many at once can be overwhelming. \n\nAlthough Mossy seems to get along with most dogs, she is a very dominant female. She can be possessive of toys and food, and tends to get jealous when her humans are paying attention to other dogs. Her foster home thinks she would do best as a single dog so she can get all the attention she craves.\n\nMossy has not been officially tested with children, but because she can get overwhelmed by too much at once, we suspect she would do best in a home without children under 10. She barks at cats and has a bit of a prey drive. She walks good on the leash, likes to play fetch for a bit, and enjoys chewing on bones and toys. Mossy is very athletic and would probably make an amazing agility dog. \n\nMossy is a sweet, well-mannered dog looking for an active family who can give her all the love and affection she deserves!\n\nMossy is being fostered in Philadelphia PA.\n\nIf you have no other pets and you are interested in applying for Mossy, please visit www.ns4ar.org",

            "description": "Gunner is a sweet 3 year old male who has many wonderful qualities. He loves his side and chest rubbed once he is done with his breakfast and dinner. Since he was crate confined during the HW treatment he has a solid routine and doesn't mind going to his kennel. He actually goes on his own when done with his food and trips outside.\n\nHe has wide paws and steps hard when he walks and doesn't mind standing on your foot while getting love. At 80lbs that can be a bit uncomfortable. He is a stout solid boy and a bit of a bull in a china shop so he would be best in a home with NO SMALL CHILDREN, or kids in under the age of 13 years.\n\nHe warmed up to his female and male foster siblings. However, Gunner was not welcoming to a new foster his foster mom brought in, which was an unaltered male. Gunner made it very clear that his future home doesn't need to have an alpha male. We are also unsure of how he would react to small dogs under 50lbs and he has not been cat tested so we would suggest a home without cats. \n\nHe enjoys treats, which mainly consist of pure coconut oil, eggs, pure pumpkin and standard  all natural dog treats, especially the blueberry ones. He doesn't like bananas or green beans. \n\nHe enjoys his kong time, or his chewy bones. He is indifferent to plush toys initially and will like them, but only for the day. He is house trained, knows sit and kennel. \n\n\nGunner came to us HW positive with an enlarged heart. The HWs were so bad the damage to his heart had already been done, not reversible, so at this point we have to manage his heart issues with daily medication. His pills aren't a big deal to him as long as you sneak them in some goodies. They are very inexpensive too. \n\nIt is unfortunate that such a young boy has experienced so much in such a short period but he would like nothing more but to find his forever family and spend the rest of his days. \n\nIf you think you can give Gunner the home he needs and deserves, please visit our website for an application. The application link is below for your convenience:\n\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/12l4wzbGOZi5GfvfuMjUuRPFW4DeqAkA_wFxa4l6wgDU/viewform?edit_requested=true",

He was a mouthy puppy so is listed as having a bite history and therefore will not be allowed to be adopted into a home with children under the age of 10. Peanut is not dog reactive and would probably enjoy a fellow canine as a companion; however a dog meet would be required as per  policy. This beautiful goofball has plenty of energy, and will need some basic manners training. He definitely loves his human friends and is patiently waiting to meet you. He is currently in foster in Connecticut and coming along nicely with his manners.",

            "description": "Novah is a handsome 3yr old red-bi male neutered Aussie, and as a special added bonus: a tail! Weighing in a compact 50 lbs, he is not too big to snuggle on your lap (one of his favorite activities).\n\nNovah deeply wants someone to connect with. He is very loving, calm and, on the velcro scale of 1-10, he scores 11. Novah can only be adopted by an experienced, Aussie-savvy household. His tendency to resource-guard is the reason he is back in the program (he resource guarded his favorite human). In our experience, he has gravitated toward females in the household. He has done very well in the foster home, but took a little time to warm up to the foster dad. The foster mom is the center of the universe for him. He does well with a calm, non-chaotic environment. He does not enjoy hustle and bustle. We prefer he go to a home without children or with children over 12. Novah is very polite and a pleasure to walk on a leash. When on walks, he can be reactive and barks at people and dogs but he is easily distracted with treats. Novah is an excellent back seat driver and loves to ride in the car. He is crate trained and potty trained. He will chew a toy but nothing else. He is an expert at \"sit\" and is learning other commands.\n\nHe does some resource guarding with toys and the resident dogs. He gives them a low growl to warn them to back off. This is improving but will need to be monitored and managed. He does not guard his food. He has a tendency to herd. He is a typically super-smart Aussie and needs activities to help him build his confidence. Obedience training, herding, scent work or agility would be great ways to help him to feel good about himself. He has been cat-tested, and while his interest was not intense, it was enough that we would recommend a cat-free home for Novah.\n\nNovah is fostered in Rochester, NY.\n\nIf you are interested in applying for Novah, please visit our website at www.ns4ar.org",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 12/30/2020\nReason for being in rescue: Owner Surrender\nFoster location: Foster Home in Pacolet, SC\nSpecial Needs? Bonnie is a young dog. She will not be spayed prior to adoption. She will be adopted on a spay/neuter contract requiring you to spay her at your expense within the first 6 months. Bonnie does shed. BONNIE WILL NOT BE ADOPTED TO A HOME WITHOUT ANOTHER DOG IN IT.\nWeight: 15 lbs and growing. We expect Bonnie will be 50+ pounds when full grown\nHeight: 18 in and growing\nSpayed/Neutered: No\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? Yes\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Bonnie is a young dog who had a tough start to life. She must have an experienced owner with another young, confident dog that Bonnie can learn from. BONNIE WILL NOT BE PLACED WITH A FIRST TIME DOG OWNER OR AS THE ONLY DOG. We do not recommend a home with cats for Bonnie. Bonnie needs an active home that can keep up with her energy and antics.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Can you say ears! Bonnie was surrendered by her owners when they realized that puppies are a lot of work and they didn't have time to devote as needed. Bonnie is as cute as a button. She has a personality as big as her ears. And a heart even bigger. But as cute as she can be, Bonnie is also full of mischief.\n\nWe suspect that Bonnie was not well socialized as a young puppy. As a result she has some behavioral quirks that require an experienced owner and another well mannered dog for her to learn from. Bonnie is extremely greedy with her food, water, personal space and bed. She is living in a foster home with a pack and doesn't like to share. This is not to imply that Bonnie needs to be the only dog. In fact it is quite the opposite. She needs another dog to show her manners and to consistently learn from and model behavior after.\n\nBonnie has finally accepted crate training in her foster home. She is now working on leash training. Cats are a work in progress. She barks non-stop at them. When it isn't time to eat, drink or sleep, Bonnie really enjoys being with other young, active dogs. This cutie has so much love and life to share with an experienced rescuer!\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Friendly\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Bonnie's owner estimated her at 5 months old. Given this we have given her a birth date as 7/15/20.\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

She needs a very active home.\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet, SC\nSpecial Needs? none noted\nWeight: 32 lbs\nHeight: 11.5 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? No\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Maggie Molly is a sweet, happy young hound mix (best guess is basset, dachshund, or beagle) who would thrive in a female-centric environment that can shape her energy and give her lots of exercise. Don't let those short legs fool you. She would be an awesome walking and hiking partner. She's solid and she is dependable. Maggie Molly must go to a home with experienced dog owners - no exceptions.\n\nMaggie Molly is VERY cautious with men. She is timid when meeting men and will nip at your ankles if you approach her too quickly. This is a fear response. We do not know why she is this way, but we are doing our best to help her overcome her fears. At this time, we are only adopting Maggie Molly out to a female-only household.\n\nNo cats please! True to her hunting dog heritage, Maggie Molly has decided that cats are things to be chased. She needs to be in a cat free home.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Maggie Molly enjoys other dogs and often romps with the big dogs as well as the small dogs. She would love to be in a big, happy kitchen, family milling around, kids at the table doing homework and Maggie with a bone or toy, in the middle of it all. She loves to run and play and loves to be with her people. She is not \"clingy.\" She does not whine for constant attention. She wants to simply be in the middle.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Barks a hello and happily accepts a treat.\n\nOther tips and tidbits: We are estimating Maggie at about 2 years old with a birth date of about 8/1/17. She is hoping to go home with her new family this year, the family that will care about where she is and makes sure that she is always where her heart is - with you.\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

            "description": "Hank, 2.5 years, 45 lbs. proper intro with dogs key but he does want to play and have fun! Yard and quiet home will suit him best. Loves adults, nervous around kids. No cats..\n\nHank is an adorable, unique and highly-coveted mix of dachshund and staffordshire, amazingly enough! Such a handsome and loving boy. This angel has been in and out of shelters his entire life and we are so glad to have him now and help him get onto a loving home who will help him be confident so he can settle in. He is affectionate and loves his adult friends. Kids scare him, so that is a no.\n\nA lot of training and love has been put into Hank so following the lessons is a requirement of having this gem of a boy be yours. All of his training has been positive and we will only adopt to a family or person who only believes in positive training and will practice to it. This dear boy has already been through enough. He is learning to enjoy being with doggies his size and we want that to continue. We are seeking a home to commit to him and can financially provide that stable environment.\n\nAs you can imagine, even with daschund in him, he is 45 lbs of low-riding strength. He will go to a home with an owner that can walk him well and have fun along the way. We can help with the right harness set up.\n\nHank thrives with direction and training and is a smart boy. He will do better in a more quiet home and neighborhood so he isn't distracted. Moreover, the right owner is key. An apartment won't work well for him as he needs room to stretch. He needs to be the only dog in the home, as he can guard toys and food from other dogs.\n\nThis smarty pants knows so many commands, over 20!\n\nHe is now updated on all shots, neutered and chipped! His adopt fee is $395.\n\nWe cover the medical to prepare the pet for adoption and the adopt donations go directly to cover those costs and range from $295-$495. Thank you for stepping up to save a life!\n\nTo expedite to meet with this dog, please go to our site at www.savinggreatanimals.org and fill out an application. We look at the first applications to arrive, so we hope to hear from you soon!",

She loves attention and is good with other dogs and cats....\n\nThis poor girl was found starving on the side of the road on the reservation with vultures circling above her. Kind travelers rescued her and brought her to Denkai where she was thankful to get a loving foster home, nutritious food, and a quiet place to rest. \n\nKara is super scared and weak, but still loving and gentle.\n\nShe will be available for adoption once she gets a bit healthier. \n\nInterested in adopting this beautiful and resilient creature? \n\nCurrently fostered in Aurora colorado\n\nPlease go to www.denkaisanctuary.org/adopt to fill out adoption application.",

She is not fond of cats, so not cat friendly. Maggie is not fond of a kennel, and is dealing with minor separation anxiety. Maggie does well with other dogs. She is not a fan of being alone and will howl some before settling down to relax. \n\n \n\nWe are a foster based rescue based out of Muskegon, MI. We have an application process for adopting our pets. We have an application on our website www.caninesrescue.com. PLEASE DO NOT EMAIL US WITH YOUR APPLICATION INFORMATION.

All our dogs are up to date on shots, microchipped, been dewormed at least once, and sterilized. All meet and greets are APPOINTMENT ONLY.

Not available for adoption until all vetting is completed and after our foster home learns more about this great Doberman, we are, however, accepting applications. Stay tuned for more information!\n\nDuchess is a pretty girl who is very shy. She takes a long time to warm up to new people, but once she does she is a love and she will give you smiles all day long! Duchess does not like the cold at all and will want a path made for her in the snow for her to do her business! Duchess does not do well with young children at all, they make her extremely nervous and uncomfortable, she needs to be with older dog savvy kids/teenagers that will respect her space. She would do best in being in a home that is quiet and she can be the queen! Duchess does like to be the queen pooch in the home, but will do well with a submissive dog. Stay tuned as her fosters learn more about her.\n\nThis fabulous foster is a Doberman Rescue Minnesota foster dog.\n\nPlease read all adoption steps and policies carefully on our website. http://dobermanrescueminnesota.com/adoption-steps/\n\nQualified adopters are within the approved adoption area, and Adopter will be requested to visit this foster dog at the foster family home. Our foster families are generally located within a 250 mile radius of Minneapolis, MN.\n\nAll DRM dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, health checked, microchipped, 4DX tested, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention.",

Nick is 38 lbs with wrinkles in all the right places and unusually soft fur. Balls that squeak and bounce are his favorite thing, and he loves to welcome you home with a ball in his mouth and an exuberant happy tail. This little gentleman is very obedient and eager to please. Nick can sit, stay, shake, lay down, and \u201cgo to your place.\u201d He likes to spend most of his time inside with his people, but for sure will chase a squirrel around the back yard. Its very important he has a secure fence so he can get his occasional zoomies out. He also does well with BIG KIDS, but NOT SMALLER  dogs or cats. He is shy by nature, but will be your best friend in 5 minutes. He is house trained and likes his crate when he needs a safe place, but prefers to sleep on the floor next to his owner. He is fully vetted, neutered and up to date on all his shots. Please contact Alisa.evans@loli.org or 817-913-6378 if you think you can give Nick his forever home.",

He has the most adorable underbite and one of his front legs is slightly shorter than the other giving him this sweet little walk that melts your heart. He is about 1-1/2 year old. His smile is huge and so is his heart. He's house trained 100% but not leash trained. He needs to eat alone as he is food aggressive with other dogs but not people. He is crate trained and he prefers to eat in his crate where he feels safe but don't leave with a blanket or a towel cause he will rip it up. He loves cats when he is the only one but he will chase is another dogs chases first. He is AMAZING with children from newborn to 13. He would be best with dogs his size and bigger or could be happy as a solo dog. If you want to give this wonderful boy a forever home, please visit www.apsofpc.org and fill out our \"Rescue a Pet\" Adoption Application. Adoption fee is $250",

WE are a high intake No Kill Shelter ran by a staff of 4 and do not always have time to answer every question asked by so many. If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced. It is never our intention to ignore a request about an adoptable animal in our facility.\n\nSandy Brown, Director, PAW Animal Shelter\n\n319-372-2274",

I was rescued in May from TJ streets, heavily pregnant and very emaciated. After my puppies were born, I started receiving treatment for TVT and some other injuries from my past. I was found deaf and my rear leg is a bit stiff at times, but I enjoy life to the fullest without any pain. My pups are all home now and it's mama's turn to be happy forever! I have been spayed, and have been declared fit and fine by the awesome vets!\n\nIn terms of training, I have been a good girl and picked up a lot of good manners with routine and structure. I truly am eager to please! I have just graduated from Board and Train to work on obedience and reactivity and have learned recall, place, long duration down stays, and leash manners around other dogs and out in public. My deafness has made me rely on vision and my training has been per that. I have been muzzle trained and remote collar trained, and my remote collar will be included with my adoption. \n\nAt home, I am a total snuggleball! This dogess loves to frolic a bit and then nap real hard! I am a loyal girl and like to be around my family. But when left alone, I simply nap away. I have a gentle streak and even treat my toys as such. I love food and treat motivation makes me want to please everyone! The routine that I mentioned earlier? It follows my food times, always! ;) Regarding dogs, I am always happy to see my babies who keep n touch with this mama! But I would prefer being the only queen. I do have dog-selectiveness. I do adore my 12 year old kiddo foster brother and we have the best cuddles together!\n\nI will thrive in a mellow home without a lot of visitors where I can be the only pet to soak up all the love! I'd appreciate a yard and walks through a quiet neighborhood. With a family willing to continue my training and shower me with love, Ill finally be able to put my street dog days behind and enjoy the rest of my life as a beloved member of the family. If you think we could make a perfect team, hit me up! My adoption fee is $300 and that includes spaying/neutering, shots, and microchip. If you want to take me home, please fill out the form on the website here: https://theanimalpad.org/adoption-application/",

We are working on Sit, Stay and Come. He loves to eat and sleep but he definitely has more energy than a typical EB. He did well with the two small dogs in his previous foster home.

            "description": "IN VERMONT\n\nMeet Ernie fka Tucker! Here is a video of his story:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/St_hQ8nMJ7w\n\nErnie is 4 years old (approx. DOB 11-5-16), male, 33 lbs., vetted, is or will be neutered, and micro-chipped. Ernie is an eternal optimist. He sees the good in every situation and is always happy. And this young boy KNOWS that his life was saved and he is THANKFUL! He has a high desire to please and needs minimal correction. He loves people and like to be close, but he is not clingy or needy. He takes his job as companion very seriously. He faithfully accompanies his person and waits patiently outside the bathroom door at 2am, on the rug in the kitchen during dinner prep, on the chair in the office during endless phone calls and all night on his dog bed in the bedroom. Wherever you are, Ernie is there. He likes to sit close and LOVES to be petted and cuddled, but he will also give you space when you tell him to \"get down\". He has lived with 10 dogs between 5 lbs and 100 lbs and he gets along with everybody. He has done well with kids and is potty trained. He also shared his original foster home with 3 cats and although he is interested in them, he didn't harass or chase them. As far as energy level Ernie is either on 100% or off 100%; there's not a lot of middle ground with him. He can go from being super excited and pacing around to snuggling like a baby in no time. He would do well as the only dog or with a companion. Ernie doesn't really recognize personal space and will make himself at home on your lap, face, neck, head, computer, wherever! Ernie's best home Older kids (8+), another dog to play with, a place to snooze in the sun or by the fire (a southern-born dog, Ernie LOVES the heat, will practically lay under the wood stove and will follow patches of sun to lay in both outside and inside), one where he can get in some good hikes/or free outside runs plus plenty of snuggle time. He has a sense of humor and loves to make his person laugh.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Ernie fka Tucker please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out his Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Zeus and I am about one year old. Can we talk? I am full of energy and love to go for runs and walks. You know what they say; a tired dog is a happy dog. An active on the go family with an active canine companion around my age and weight would be my main stay for the best home ever. I am a big boy with lots of puppy energy, and on fast forward until it is time to take a break, which means I may not be compatible with a small dog, senior dog, or small children. After a couple of walks/runs a day and time playing with my canine companion, I am happy to settle on the couch with you for some down time, hanging out on my pillow, helping with the barbeque on the patio. I enjoy putting my head in your lap and having you rub my belly and scratch my head.\nI am very human focused and do not like being away from my humans, my foster mom and dad have been working on helping me with my separation anxiety in this area. I have on occasion gotten out of my crate and am nicknamed Houdini (whoever that is). Because I am over the top intelligent, I can be known to test your boundaries if you have not trained me on mine. I am house/crate trained and sleep through the night dreaming of another exciting day to come. I walk on the leash like a pure gentleman, love seeing other dogs out walking and occasionally some wildlife. I enjoy playing with my resident canine sibling, her name is Luna, and she gives me a run for the money with her energy and is a blast as we take time chasing each other. I am not sure how I feel about felines; my preference is canine brothers and sisters. I\u2019m a very loyal boy and would be attached to your hip if I could. I take treats nicely from you and really enjoy having goodies stuffed in my toys and interactive puzzles. I do love food especially bell peppers but I\u2019ll eat anything honestly! I\u2019m up to date on all vaccinations, microchipped, neutered and heartworm negative. Hope to hear from my future furever family home soon! \n<p>Please visit <a href=\"\"http://www.austingermanshepherdrescue.org\"\">Austin German Shepherd Rescue</a> for more information on this pet!</p>",

Nara was found as a homeless stray in NC. The shelter staff said she is very friendly, walks well on a leash, and is good with other dogs! She does not care for the crate nor being restrained at the Vet (understandable). Nara would do best in a rural setting and husky experience is a bonus! She is incredibly sweet! Stay tuned for more information as Nara is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Nara please fill out an Application at\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out her Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

I want you to know that although I am hearing impaired, it has not slowed me down. I am very aware of what goes on in my foster home and have a blast playing with my resident canine sister, Luna. I like other dogs and would like a canine buddy to keep me company. I enjoy attention from my humans and taking walks around the block. I really like spending time with my human on the couch snuggling. I am very smart, both house trained and crate trained, I know how to use a doggie door.\nI am a super dog; just ask my foster dad who brags about me all the time. He has taught me the commands of Sit, No, and back up with hand signals. I am always alert and eager to please. Just like a dog who hears, I will need time and patience to become familiar with my new home. I will learn quickly from your facial expressions, body language, and hand signals. To know me is to love me and I will be your loving companion until the 12th of never and beyond.\n<p>Please visit <a href=\"\"http://www.austingermanshepherdrescue.org\"\">Austin German Shepherd Rescue</a> for more information on this pet!</p>",

If you'd like a cuddle buddy to watch Netflix with you, or need incentive to go for a daily walk, then George is your guy! George can be shy meeting new people, so would not be best for anyone with very young children but older children are fine. George warms up very quickly and once he feels safe, he is very devoted. He weighs about 10 lbs and is neutered, fully vaccinated and chipped. George is being fostered with other dogs, but is fine being an only dog as well.  If you live in the Los Angeles area and would like to meet George, please complete our adoption application found on dexterfoundation.com Adoption donation $200\n",

She and her sister, Bonnie, were found as puppies on the side of the road.  They had one owner until he passed away this past summer.  The girls lived their entire lives in an outdoor\nkennel. She is spayed, HW negative, current on vaccines and at a healthy weight of 40 lbs.\n\nBetty was the more outgoing and friendly of\nthe two and had been chosen to go to a local rescue, but she began having seizures (possibly due to the separation from her sibling), so that rescue took Bonnie\ninstead.\n\nBetty is currently on meds and we have not witnessed any seizures since getting her medication regulated.\n\nBetty has a slight outward turn on her right front paw.  The vet does not think\nthere are any broken bones and may be due to an old injury or defect.  It does\nnot bother her or affect her gait. She is a happy and healthy girl.\n\nBetty is a very sweet and loving dog!  She plays well with another male dogs and has shown no aggression toward people.  She has been in the care of the Mercer County Humane Society since October 7, 2020.\n\nIf you think Betty is a good fit for you, please email Mary at: mlfensom@suddenlink.net or call: 304-320-3835",

He was found by animal control, abandoned, tied to a tree, in the Baltimore area. We don't know how long he was there. He wants affection, but is also scared. He is about 4 years old, just 10 pounds.\n\nBORIS is up to date on shots, neutered, and house broken. He seems protective when he is in his crate, maybe that was his safe space from his abuser. Who knows what this poor boy has been through in the past. What we DO know is what he needs NOW -- an experienced dog owner who will give him time and space to find his confidence and gain trust.. No other dogs. No kids, No cats. A very quiet home. \n\nBORIS has made tremendous strides since being in his temp foster home for the past two weeks.  He is decompressing and his happy little self is on full display!   He is also doing much better with not guarding his crate. \n\nBORIS is not a city dog; it would be too noisy for him. BORIS is currently in Phila. in a temporary home, but really needs to settle into his new home where he can get the love he deserves. \n\n Please contact Christine at christinerescueexpress@gmail.com",

MAYA was found under a car on a very hot day in Bakersfield, California.\nA wonderful gentleman got her out from under the car and took her to his house where he gave her water and fed her and reached out to his daughter for assistance on what to do with her next. We contacted shortly after the man contacted his daughter and asked to help with getting MAYA medical assistance. MAYA upon arrival to this gentleman\u2019s house appeared to have recently had puppies. Her nipples were still full and leaking, but there were no signs of puppies anywhere near where she found. MAYA was also covered in wounds and scars and had an injury on her left front leg that appeared to be a dog bite that had either never healed or was a broken bone. After we were contacted, transport and networking got to work, and we got MAYA into our physical care quickly. We got in her into the vet right away and thankfully found out that most of her scarring was superficial, her leg appeared to be an old injury that never had the opportunity to heal properly and overall, she was in great health.\n\nMAYA since being in our care and after a couple of weeks of bed rest to help her leg recover, has really come out of her shell. She is a bit of a wild woman. MAYA is always very happy and energetic. There are several training things that we would like to work on with MAYA prior to her being adopted but as with any dog, training is something that should be a lifestyle, meaning that MAYA is fully ready to meet her adoptive family now with hopes of a bright future. She will not be spayed until early December which does slow down her adoptive process a tiny bit, but again she is ready to meet any potential forever home. MAYA Is a very sweet girl, always smiling, and very playful. As of right now, we think she\u2019d do great in a home without small children, cats or other dogs. MAYA deserves a happily ever after, after what our best guess would be that she lived the life of a backyard breeding female until she was no longer useful. \n",

Heartworms can be fatal to dogs and since it\u2019s an expensive treatment, it\u2019s vital to keep them on regular doses of Heartworm prevention. \n\nIf you\u2019d like to meet Dasher, the first step is to complete and submit an adoption application on our okwestierescue.com website and we\u2019ll get the process started. \nPlease allow 1-2 weeks to finish processing your application, but please know our volunteers are working hard on it. \nDasher\u2019s adoption fee is $300 and is tax deductible. \n\nNOTE: You must complete and submit an application and be approved to adopt prior to being able to meet the dog.\u00a0\u00a0The requested tax-deductible adoption donation is $400 for our puppies, $300 for up to age 7 and $150 for ages 8 and older.\n\nWe do not ship our pets.\u00a0\u00a0Be prepared to travel to Tulsa, OK, or Oklahoma City, OK, or the location where this dog is fostered to pick up your dog in person if your application is approved.\u00a0\u00a0Once you are approved, you may adopt any of our dogs that is a good fit. \n\nWe are a non-profit organization that spends our adoption fees and donations on vaccinations, surgeries, various medical tests, medicines, food and supplies needed by our dogs. Our fees do not cover the overall expenses incurred by the care of our dogs, but they do help defray the costs involved.\u00a0\u00a0We thank you for your support. \n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always try to select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dog\u2019s needs and try to find the best match for both dog and human.\nWe leave a dog\u2019s profile online until either it has been adopted, has received several applications, or is not able to be adopted for some reason.",

He loves cuddling, playing with his toys, and gets VERY excited to meet new dog and people friends. He does need some socializing and we are continuing his leash training to help him gradually get used to interactions with others. He hasn't met or played with many other dogs yet and the more he can socialize with them, the more he will learn to \"dog\" but that'll be a gradual process. Getting him neutered shortly will be very helpful as well. He is house trained, crate trained (he now goes into his crate to sleep on his own), and knows \"sit\", \"down\", \"stay\" (as long as there aren't many distractions), and is really good at \"give\" when playing fetch. He's not very food or treat motivated, however he does love toys, being pet & massaged, belly rubs, and is a very smart and fast learner. He grew up around kids and has the playful energy that would work great with children, however since he is a big boy, does tend to be a bit of a clumsy bulldozer sometimes. One of the most adorable things about Diesel is his Spiderman blanket that he cuddles and sleeps with every night. As soon as he's tired, he'll get his favorite blanket, fluff it up, and rest his head on it in the most adorable heart-wearming way.",

The individual who rescued COCO off the streets of Mexico reached out to a Southern California rescue to take him in to their care. Shortly after he was transported to the rescue in Southern California, he was then transported to our rescue here in Northern California during the middle of March 2019.\n\nCOCO has spent the past year learning how to be a household dog. While he is crate trained, this is something he is still working on. He is also potty trained and gets along very well with several of the other dogs he is currently fostered with. COCO has a goofy, fun and playful personality. He will definitely put a smile on your face. He occasionally likes to snuggle and is happy to lay down and relax. He has wonderful leash skills and listens to corrections and commands fairly well. COCO is looking for a calm home that is happy to help him keep learning. He would prefer a home no small children or animal companions. If you are interested in meeting COCO please don\u2019t hesitate to fill out the contact form below.",

            "description": "Date of birth:  11/08/2016\n\n12/30/2020: Sasha is a beautiful Akita mix!  She is 4 years old and weighs 75 lbs.  \n\n\u2022 Sasha is very playful and silly! She loves playing with toys and with other dogs.  She\u2019d love to have another dog to play with in her new home. She\u2019s got a lot of energy and plays hard, so she\u2019d need a doggie playmate who has a similar energy or they\u2019ll get irritated with her. She may do best with male dogs. If you have a dog, we\u2019d ask you to bring your dog to meet Sasha to see if they could be buddies.\n\n\u2022 Sasha needs a house with a fenced yard.\n\n\u2022  Sasha is very friendly and likes people.  She has an independent nature, however. When you meet her, she\u2019s not going to cuddle up and declare her love for you. She\u2019ll like you just fine, but chances are she\u2019ll just kind of ignore you.  She\u2019s got things to do and places to explore! If you respect that and are okay with it and ready to go along and have some fun, she could be a great match and a very fun companion. If you\u2019re looking for that instant love connection, she is probably not the right dog for you.  \n\n\u2022 If you have treats, you will get Sasha\u2019s attention! She\u2019s very food motivated and she enthusiastically knows sit, down and shake.\n\n\u2022 Sadly, Sasha lived outdoors on a chain before coming here.  We expect that she\u2019ll have some adjustments to living in a home, which we see in most former chain dogs, understandably.  She\u2019ll need an experienced dog parent who\u2019s equipped to help her transition and work with any issues she may have. She wouldn\u2019t be a good match for someone who is looking for their first dog as an adult. \n\n\u2022 We don\u2019t want to place Sasha in a home with young kids\u2014 teens should be fine. \n\n\u2022 Sasha loves to go for walks. She walks nicely on a leash and loves to stop and smell everything.  She also rides nicely in the car.\n\n\u2022 She\u2019s polite, keeps her kennel clean, and doesn\u2019t guard her toys.  \n\n\u2022 Unfortunately, Sasha tested positive for heartworms.  She\u2019ll be starting treatment soon, and then she will need to be restricted to limited activity and short leash walks for several weeks.  If you are interested in fostering or adopting her, we can fill you in on her treatment plan and what it involves. The treatment is done at our clinic and all costs are covered. Once she\u2019s done with treatment and recovery time, she\u2019ll be able to run and play without restriction again. \n\n\u2022 Sasha has been spayed, vaccinated and microchipped.  She\u2019s a lot of fun!  We\u2019re so happy she\u2019s no longer on a chain, and look forward to her being in a loving home and having fun adventures.  \n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE:  PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU.  Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info.\u00a0\n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.521.2339\nhsgkc.org",

            "description": "Date of birth: 1/28/2020\n\n12/30/2020:  Dawson is a super cute Boxer/American Staffordshire Terrier mix!  He\u2019s about 11 months old and he currently weighs 56 lbs. He should gain a little more weight and fill out before he\u2019s fully grown. \n\n\u2022 Dawson is a very friendly and playful pup! He\u2019s a big happy puppy with lots of energy.  He\u2019s very good natured and loves people. \n\n\u2022 He will need a house with a fenced yard due to his energy level.\n\n\u2022 Dawson has been taught some manners, but he gets so excited when he sees people that he forgets to be polite! He jumps up a lot and gets a little mouthy. He\u2019ll need a home with someone who has dog experience, is patient and will work with him on basic obedience training and manners.   He is very treat motivated and bright, and he loves attention\u2014 a good combination for training!  He enjoys training sessions.\n\n\u2022 Dawson is too rambunctious for young kids at this time.  He\u2019d be fine living with teenagers.\n\n\u2022 Dawson likes other dogs and loves to play in the yard with other dogs. He plays rough and rowdy, so he\u2019d be a good match for another energetic dog who plays that way.  If you have a dog we\u2019d ask you to bring your dog to meet Dawson to see if they could be buddies.\n\n\u2022 Dawson loves Kong toys! He tears up stuffed toys and other smaller toys and has swallowed pieces, so he needs supervision with those.  \n\n\u2022 Sadly, Dawson was subjected to neglect and cruelty in his prior home before being removed by Animal Services. He lived on a tie-out and it tangled around his body causing wounds.  Then he broke with parvo virus.  We treated the parvo and he\u2019s healthy now, and his wounds have healed but with scars. The poor guy had a rough start as a puppy, but he\u2019s a happy fun-loving boy and, with a little work on his manners, he will be a wonderful companion!\n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE:  PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU.  Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info.\u00a0\n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.521.2339\nhsgkc.org",

She will be potentially available for adoption toward the end of January if someone is willing to accommodate her leash restrictions until March. She would be a good fit for a home with kids, she loves kids - but she may do best with older kids that are walking around on their own as she is 90 pounds and full of boundless energy. She could accidentally knock over small kids as she is very hyper. She does like some other dogs, but would do best in a home with one other small dog or by herself. She does get jealous when it comes to treats and toys with other dogs. But she also loves to play. She requires a fenced in yard as she will run if there is not a fence. She absolutely loves to play fetch and would chase a ball all day. Please email kylie@wildthunderwars.org for an application or for more information.",

BLUE\u2013 Dogs in the BLUE category will need experienced adopters. Ideally, adopters of dogs in the BLUE category will be knowledgeable in the area(s) the dog will be challenging; therefore, adopters should be willing to participate in a training plan to further the work staff and volunteers already have started. \n\nDogs are assigned to color categories using any previous owner notes, general handling, as well as staff and volunteer observations. As we continue to get to know the dogs and gather further insights into their personalities, colors may be adjusted accordingly.\n\nRancho Coastal Humane Society remains temporarily closed to the general public, but we have companion animals in our care that are ready for adoption BY APPOINTMENT ONLY, and our staff is ready to make that happen! Please visit our website for updates and more information. Thank you for your interest. \n\nAdoption Hours: Monday-Sunday; 11 AM to 4:30 PM\n\nAddress: 389 Requeza Street, Encinitas, CA 92024\n\n",

Zelda is a one year old collie/heeler mix, she had no training but her foster has been working with her and in a very short time, she has learned a lot.  She wants to please and is exceptionally smart; she will be an amazing addition to an active family who has the time and patience and also knowledge of high energy breeds.\n\nUnfortunately, people get high drive, active dogs when they have no idea what it takes to own a dog like Zelda.  Zelda will need to continue with her training  and socialization; training a high energy breed should be a life-long commitment because they can become easily bored, they need to be mentally and physically stimulated to stay healthy and happy.  Dogs like Zelda love to learn and are eager to please, you just need to be committed.\n\nZelda has been let down once before so we will ONLY consider a person/family who will put in the time to train her.  Zelda gets along with other dogs, loves everyone she meets but small children would not be the best fit as she does jump up and is very strong.\n\nIf you are experienced with dogs like Zelda and have the time and the patience to commit to her, please go to our website at www.aarflove.org and complete an application.\n\n** PLEASE NOTE that due to the overwhelming amount of applications we are receiving for every pet we rescue, we will NOT be able to respond to everyone who applies.",

Due to this, Monk is more on the timid side, and would definitely need a patient family who is open to working with him. He would most likely require multiple meet and greets, just to get him used to you before he were to go home. Monk is good with other dogs, but would definitely prefer someone who can match his calm energy. Our ideal home for Monk would be a low traffic home, that can give him the time he needs to come out of his shell!",

He is very large but thinks he's tiny. He will sit on your lap if you let him.\n\nHe loves running around the yard and playing in the kiddie pool. A typical lab he loves the water. He currently lives with a female lab and they get along great, but males are questionable. He loves to go riding in the car. His favorite thing to do is play with his jolly ball in the yard. He is also a great snuggler. Porter would do best with a family without small children because he doesn't realize his size and possibly a female dog companion. If Porter sounds like a great addition to your family, applications can be found on our website\nwww.onedogatatime.us\n.",

            "description": "Dakota is a male, neutered, Black and Tan 7 year old purebred German shepherd who is papered. He is very sweet, loves people, calm, likes naps, walks and playing. Dakota is not used to strange dogs, gets along best with female dogs, not sure about cats. He is good with children who are over 5 years old. His owner has had him since he was a puppy, unfortunately due to some recent life events she can no longer keep him. Dakota needs a good home as soon as possible because of circumstances unrelated to anything about him.  For more information please call Meghan at home 530 474-1729 (no early morning or late evening calls please). \n\n* note - if you call and get no answer and no voicemail, it means our power is out due to high fire danger or winter storms. Please try again - our power is normally restored within 1-2 days.",

Zeus was owner surrendered to Pet Rescue by Judy as his owner is having a baby and their home was too small for both Zeus and the baby. We were informed that Zeus is housetrained, ok with other dogs, and enjoys walks. When you first meet him, he is cautious and is going to require time and patience in getting him to trust you. Once he does trust you, he is worth the wait. We think he will be a velcro dog who will love to lay on the couch. He will need a quiet home with little or no traffic as making new friends is not fun for him. Zeus loves to play fetch and give lots of hugs and kisses once he feels comfortable with you. If you feel you are the one for Zeus, please fill out an application for him!",
