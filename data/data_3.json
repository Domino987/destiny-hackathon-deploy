Penny is a lowrider who is solid. A Corgi mix. She is Super Sweet and just wants to cuddle. You get the complete package with this girl! She is well trained. She knows basic commands, she's spayed, she house broke, Microchipped, has all of her shots. The Sweetest most genuine soul ever! If you are interested in adopting Penny please reach out to me at mtngirl4ever60@gmail.com or text me at 856-285-8502. I will send you our application. Please Do Not Fill Out The Misfit Angels Adoption Contract on Petfinder as it belongs to a rescue partner in MN. I will not receive it. Thank You!",

The leash/collar scares me but in time I have learned to trust it. \nI am a very endearing and charming lad but make no mistake I am a project dog.\nI would love a home with other dogs but the most important thing is a person who will listen and give me time to learn and trust. \n\nI'm around 7 years old and I weigh 22 lbs\n\nNo Kids, please. \n\nFor more info please visit www.apurposefulrescue.org",

            "description": "What could possibly be better than a quiet, well mannered Shih Tzu? . . . Why . . . Two quiet, well-mannered Shih Tzu!! . . .  Well . . . quiet and well-mannered might be a stretch but at least I got the Shih Tzu part right!!  Meet Crissy and her son Clippy; two adorable tail-wagging sweethearts.  They arrived at the Safehouse on 05/26/2020 along with four of their brothers and sisters.  All six dogs came to us from a Missouri puppy mill (listed as one of the 50 worst mills in the country by the HSUS).  Mommy Crissy, born 04/12/2012, has a beautiful non-shedding cream coat with light tan markings and weighs 18 pounds.  Clippy, born 07/11/2018, has a soft thick non-shedding white coat with gray markings and weighs 20 pounds.  One of his eyes is drying up and shrinking; don\u2019t know why . . . he could have been born that way or (more likely) injured by an infection at the mill.  His other eye is just fine; he finds the treat in my hand with perfect aim!!!  Adjusting to the good life has come easily to Clippy.  In addition to care and comfort, Clippy has discovered LOVE.  Imagine, in his two years of life, he never felt kindness or the gentle touch of a human hand.  Clippy will stand on his hind legs, wrap his front legs around my leg and look up in begging anticipation.  You can\u2019t help but want to love him back, his gratitude is so apparent.  I reach down to massage his back, his kisses are non-stop (literally) and then he falls over for a tummy rub!  Lively and friendly, Clippy is the more outgoing of the two; Crissy, is quieter, just as friendly but more reserved, she prefers to hold back until Clippy sends the \u201call-clear\u201d and then she joins in on the snuggles; a happy little girl with a very busy waging tail.  She has made wonderful progress and will come to me for hugs and body rubs. She loves to snuggle into a warm soft pile of blankets or a big fluffy pillow.  Crissy enjoys playing with stuffed toys, always checking the toy box, exploring the big yard, curious about everything.  Her favorite pastime is burying her toys, inside under beds and blankets or in corners and outside under leaves and dirt or snow.  Hurray for snow, toys buried in mud need constant washing.  Crissy and Clippy are lively and playful and thrive on affection.  They soak up love like a starving dog vacuums up food.  Having never worn a collar or harness, they do not know how to walk on leash and have never been exposed to the noisy rush of traffic; training will take time and patience.  Since all dogs need healthy exercise, going for walks will be one of the first learning experiences to be shared with their new family.  They are, of course, crate trained, but having lived their entire life locked in a barren wire cage, expecting them to spend hours in a crate is unfair; if you cannot find an alternative to crating them, then please do not apply to adopt them. They are doing well with house training (using wee-wee pads and a doggy door) but will need assistance adjusting to a normal household and schedule.  In a fenced-in yard without a leash, they will run and jump and even go potty but if a mill dog gets loose outside a secured area, it will likely run until it drops; catching the dog would be quite a feat.  They get along with small dogs, but have never experienced cats.  They will do best in an active adult\u2019s only home or one with older children; living in a home with young children would be too overwhelming, but the attention of older children would definitely be welcome.  Clippy and Crissy are quite a pair, always together, if you hug one you have to hug the other (dog rules!).  Mill rescues really need to go into a home with another dog in residence; that is how they learn to be dogs but these two have developed a strong bond (mother and son) and will be adopted together. They have a lot to learn about being dogs but I have their TRUST and they have my love and hopefully, soon, a very special adopter to participate in one of the most joyful and rewarding experiences of your life . . . teaching a frightened being to love and trust, to play, enjoy the comfort of a soft bed, good food and that life is ok and humans are good. Clippy and Crissy are spayed/neutered, microchipped, current on all vaccines, heartworm and flea/tick preventative, and they have had a complete physical and dental.  Their combined adoption fee is $500. These two MUST be adopted together; they have a bond that we will not break",

            "description": "I am a young girl at just a 5 months old and 34 pounds. Rumor has it, I'm a Labrador/Border Collie mix. But who really knows. I LOVE to snuggle and cuddle and enjoy playing with the other dogs in my foster home. I'm sweet, smart, fun and am the submissive one! My ideal home will have another playful dog and a fenced yard to play in. Because I am still a pup I need an active family who is home more often than not and would enjoy taking me on adventures! Children over 8 years old are just fine. Dog friendly cats are just fine too. \n\nTo adopt Birdie visit our website for more details regarding our adoption criteria and complete the easy online no obligation adoption application at www.dsda.org/adopt. \n\n* Adoption Fees:\n\nPuppies (12 months and under) - $325 (includes tax)\n\nDogs (over 12 months) - $275 (includes tax) \n\nQualifications for Adoption: No dog is alike and each dog has different requirements based on breed, age, energy level and life experiences. DSDA is very careful to place our dogs in homes that we believe are the best fit for the dog based on our experience with each dog. All of our dogs live in foster homes which allows us the opportunity to learn about their individual needs. \n\n\n\tMust be 21 years or older with identification showing present address.\n\tMust have the knowledge and consent of all adults living in the household.\n\tVet checks are required. All resident animals must be spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations and on monthly heartworm and flea/tick preventative (if applicable).\n\tMust receive proof of pet deposit and lease allowing pets if renting.\n\tWillingness and capacity to spend the time and money necessary to provide training, medical treatment and responsible care for a pet.\n\tApplicant is home more than not.\n\tAny poisonous plants must be removed from the yard before the home visit.\n\tHome visit is required. For this reason, we adopt locally in the Dallas and immediate surrounding areas.",

Sweet, laid back, and shy at first, she will quickly become your best friend forever. LIlly loves other dogs, playing with toys and chewing on her toys. She's already crate and house trained, spayed, microchipped, and up to date on her vaccinations. Our best guess is that Lilly is a German Shepherd/Mastiff mix. If you are looking for a gentle giant to keep you company on the cold Montana nights, Lilly is your girl. \n\nPlease visit our website www.rezqdogs.org/adopt to review our adoption policies and to fill out our adoption application.",

For the past couple of years, they have both been living on the streets, so she was with him 24/7...and she liked that. She was hearbroken as was he...she cried quite a bit. But, Katie is resilient and she's a glass is half full gal who is already starting to bounce back. She's a pretty spry, but a bit overweight, 10+ year old senior. She loves bonding with her person and we are confident she'll be able to bond with you. When she's unhappy, she will bark, but she tends to be very happy when she's with her person...so if you're someone who is retired or simply home most of the time, Katie could brighten up your life! We were told she is not spayed, but at her age the vet suggested we not put her through such rigorous surgery.",

She is guessed to be an Australian Shepherd mix, potentially with some shepherd or other herding breed. She is so sweet and loves everyone she has met, kids especially! She is amazing on the leash and loves to go for walks with her people. She will need an active family with a yard that can provide her with all the mental and physical stimulation she desires. She is still a puppy and her new people will need to continue to guide her to help her become the best girl she can be! \n\nIf you are interested in meeting her please complete an application at https://www.circle2rescue.com/dog-adoption-application/ The adoption fee of $325 includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, microchip and dewormer.\n\nPlease note, Circle 2 Rescue cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have limited history prior to them entering the rescue. We make every effort to ensure the dogs are healthy.",

            "description": "Diamond is a 1-year-old mixed breed rescued from a high-kill shelter. This dog is current on vaccinations, microchipped, 4dx/heartworm tested, and spayed/neutered. This dog is also tested with other dogs, kennel-trained, and housebroken. \n\nDiamond has been diagnosed with a congenital (present from birth) heart abnormality known as subaortic stenosis (SAS). This condition is due to the abnormal development of the heart tissue lying below the aortic valve. The abnormal conformation of this area causes the aortic valve to be leaky. Even though Diamond\u2019s SAS is diagnosed as mild, her cardiac veterinarian recommends rechecking her echocardiogram in one year. Animals affected with SAS of this degree usually live a very normal life, and no treatment is needed at this time. Diamond\u2019s cardiac veterinarian recommends feeding a diet that meets the WSAVA guidelines (Purina, Royal Canin, Eukanuba, Iams, or Hillls Science Diet).\n\nWe would love for you to meet this dog and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: While we typically host weekly Saturday adoption events, in order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment and/or adoption handoff. Appointments and handoffs are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, adoption appointments and handoffs are only offered for individual animals. When adopting at an appointment, please be aware that you will be taking the animal home that day. We can not hold animals to be picked up at a later date.\n\nDue to CDC's recommended COVID-19 protocols, we are highly encouraging foster homes and adopters to speak with one another via phone or video chat to ensure compatible matches and limit in-person contact. If meeting in person, our foster homes are encouraged to wear masks, socially distance, and choose an outdoor meeting spot. Should you want to proceed forward with the adoption, all adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees are to be completed electronically. Quick and low-contact animal handoff is also being encouraged amongst foster homes and adopters. As always, we include a one-week trial period with all our adoptions.\u00a0***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption! If you would like more information on our organization please visit our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org.",

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please download and complete an Adoption Questionnaire from our website and email US at K-9adopt@k-9lifesavers.org\nYou can learn about the adoption process and find a Word, PDF and ONLINE version of the questionnaire by visiting: http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/howtoadopt/.\nDog's Name: Barney\nEstimated Breed : Labrador Retriever Mix\nApproximate Age: 4 years\nApproximate Weight: approx. 63 lbs\nCurrently Living at: Boarding\nAdoption Fee: $300\nDOG'S DESCRIPTION\nBarney is a handsome active boy who is ready and waiting for his forever home. Barney absolutely loves car rides and will gladly jump in and go on any adventure with you. He is also sweet and affectionate once he gets to know you. Barney loves being near his people, but isn't constantly in your face but would make a great bud for your home office. He barely snores during your Zoom calls. Barney does ok with other dogs on leash, and around them, but has gotten into a scuffle in his foster home over a door bell and high excitement situation so he would prefer to be your one and only!\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

            "description": "Meet Toby! Toby is a beautiful 10 month old male Blue Heeler. He weighs around 36lbs and we believed he was dumped out in rural MS. He came up to a woman's house looking for refuge and refused to leave. The woman had many outdoor cats and he scared them all off, so she threatened to shoot him if no one came to get him. Our rescue partners picked him up and he has been loving life in a foster home, where he is being given food, attention and a safe, warm place to sleep. Toby is house trained, has a medium energy level and is projected to be no more than medium sized when fully grown. His foster mom says, \"He is a great dog. He will make a very loyal companion as he likes to be with his people. He will stay close when walking outside and he goes to the door when he needs to go potty. He is super smart and is learning commands.\" He is slow to warm up to other dogs, but had a proper introduction with the female dog at the foster home and they play together. He doesn't like dogs that get in his face or run right up to him. Toby is fully vetted and neutered. If you're interested in adopting this loyal, sweet boy, please apply at www.charliescrusaders.org",

To see her strut about on her stubby legs, no one would argue her adorableness. She wears a fawn coat, and it looks like black lipliner has been applied to her mouth. She was surrendered as a chow mix but looks more like a miniature Old Yeller type (small black mouth cur). Whatever she is, her muggy face is as cute as it gets.\n\nOur Veterinarian estimates her to be about 8 months old, and she weighs in at 37 pounds, the perfect package-a small medium. She tested positive for Lyme Disease and is being treated now. Dixie has behaved friendly toward the other dogs at Almost Home, and when visiting the Vet's office for her exam, she had a great playtime with a few dogs there. When she met with our cats (in cages), her attitude was inquisitive but respectful.\n\nDixie likes all people and is always ready for a good game of chase. Toys make her get spunky, and when she gets the zoomies and goes flying around the yard at full speed, occasionally tagging you to play too, you can't help laughing out loud at her pure unbounded glee. This girl is very athletic and deceptively strong for her size.\n\nIf you are searching for a Valentine to lavish love upon, I don't think you'll find anyone more receptive than Dixie. She is waiting to give her heart to someone who wants puppy love that will last for a lifetime.\n\nDixie will do best with young folks, or active people, willing to teach her the things she needs know to be a good housemate and a well-mannered doggie citizen.\n\nNOTE: All animals are spayed/neutered as soon as practical after arriving at our facility unless there is a medical issue that may cause a delay or they are too young to be spayed/neutered. VOLUNTEERS and DONATIONS NEEDED. Visit our website for more info: http://nelsonspca.org",

Little Miss Dot weighs 6 pounds of pure sweetness. Dot is pretty much the perfect dog. She never barks, she gets along with everyone, she's dog door trained, loves to go on walks and does great in the car. Why would anyone give up this sweet girl? Sadly, Dot was turned into the shelter by her family with no reason given. Dot does have some hair loss, but with her new diet and a few baths, she has grown back a good amount of hair. Dot is looking for a quiet home, with no big dogs or children. She's a tiny gal and needs a quiet home.\nDot's adoption fee:$150 We do not have a kennel or facility to visit, all dogs are kept in foster homes until their forever homes are found.Adoption Process: Once an approved application is on file, we will then set up a home visit. At that time we will bring the dog to the home in which you will all be sharing. We ask the entire family to be there that day.

My name is Marley,  and I'm a male mixed breed dog born in June of 2019.   \n\nMy adoption fee is $175.\n\nHanover Humane will only be adopting me to a home in Hanover County, Virginia or a locality that is part of the Richmond, Virginia metropolitan area.\n\nI'm an energetic, social, active, and playful guy and I'm seeking an energetic, social, active, and playful owner to keep me company - NO COUCH POTATOES. My favorite activity is to play tug - but I'm up for pretty much anything as long as I can be with my people. Unless you live a very active lifestyle and are willing to take me on multiple long walks daily, I'll probably need a fenced yard to burn off my energy(but you still gotta play with me).\n\n I've been neutered/spayed, am current on all of my vaccinations (DHLPP, Bordetella and Rabies), tested for heartworms (and am negative) and put on heartworm preventative, and microchipped.  My new owner will receive a month of free pet health insurance at adoption. \n\nIf you are interested in me or want to meet me, please submit an adoption application at www.hanoverhumanesociety.org and you will be contacted to schedule an appointment.",

Being a young pup, Luca will need an active home with plenty of time with his humans and space for excercise, play and socializing. His approved adopter will need to have time, patience, financial resources and interest to care for, provide proper veterinary care and work on positive reinforcement training to teach him all he needs to know to be a perfect little gentleman: potty training, crate training, leash walking and general good dog manners.\nCARE's adoption fee is $250 for dogs/puppies and $100 for cats/kittens and an additional $150 neuter deposit will be required for any animals adopted prior to their spay/neuter surgery (and the deposit will be refunded when the approved adopter brings the animal to his/her CARE vet appointment in COLUMBUS, INDIANA once scheduled). All CARE animals arrive in their forever homes current on age appropriate vaccinations and preventatives, as well as microchipped and spay/neutered (or scheduled for the same). If you are interested in adopting or meeting a CARE animal, the FIRST STEP is to complete and submit an online adoption application through care.rescuegroups.org.\n\nCARE is an all-volunteer and foster-based rescue organization. We do not have a shelter facility and do not have any employees monitoring inbound applications and emails. Applications are reviewed by each animal's volunteer foster home. It may be several days before you hear from this animal's foster home. Thank you for your patience and understanding as our foster volunteers work to navigate a very high volume of inbound adoption applications.",

We cannot imagine why someone was not looking for him, he is a great dog! He is a little shy when he first meets you but once he is comfortable, his tail never stops wagging He is good with other dogs, doesn't seem to mind cats and would be great for a home with kids. He is working on learning basic commands and appears to be crate trained. Georgie is up to date with shots, neutered, on heartworm prevention and crate trained. If you would like to adopt sweet Georgie, please submit an adoption application at www.myhstc.org\n\nAdoption fee is $85\n\nWe prescreen all applicants prior to a meeting. To be screened, please submit an application at www.myhstc.org\n\nWe do allow out of state adoptions, however, do not ship nor transport sight unseen pets for many reasons. We do reqire travel in person adoptions.",

If a dog/puppy is still listed on Petfinder- we are still accepting applications for them***\n\nJesse is in Houston TX and can transport to the PNW mid February \n\nJesse, male, 4 years old, pitbull, 43 lbs. We found out about Jesse when one of our friends called to say he was being given away at a gas station. Thankfully our friend's son was able to scoop him and give him a safe place to crash. \n\nJesse is very playful and has a lot of wiggly butt energy. He is very playful and has a lot of energy. He is also very cuddly and loves to snuggle. \n\nHe walks well on leash, but tends to pull. He can also get mouthy in a puppy/playful way and will need some training in this area. \n\nJesse is a great listener and is highly trainable. He loves riding in the car. He is crate trained and house broken. When he first arrived to the foster home he had some accidents. With routine and consistency he learned to do his business outside. It's possible after transport he could regress and have a few accidents. Once he learns the routine in your home this will quickly resolve. \n\nJesse is dog friendly and has been around dogs of all sizes. He would very much like to play and would love a four legged friend. He can get a little carried away when he plays and can play rougher so we think he would do best with a dog around his size or larger. He has never hurt the small dogs in his foster home but he gets super excited. \n\nJesse has been around a 12 year old child and does really well. He is jumpy and has a lot of energy. We recommend a home with kids 10 years and older. \n\nJesse is a really sweet boy despite the transitions in his life. He is looking for a family who can be patient and work on basic training. He is very friendly and wants a forever home.\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. ***\n\nThe first step in our process is filling out an application. We will review your application as soon as we are able- there are two of us and we do the best that we can. We review applications on a first come first serve basis and look for the best fit/match for the dog and applicant.\n\nhttps://heartoftheunderdog.org/adoption-application\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Thanks for your interest in a pet from A.R.F.! If you see a pet here, they are still available for adoption and you should apply through our adoption application on our website at https://www.arf-il.org/adopt/application/\nOlive is a 1 year old female miniature beagle who weighs in at 16 pounds. She is a very sweet and affectionate miniature beagle. Playful, young and curious, she enjoys exploring and meeting new people and other animals. Olive does fine in her crate, where she spends the night since she is still working on being house trained. So far she does not bark, but will bay mournfully if you leave the house or to be let in from outside. Olive comes when she is called and is eager to please. She will follow you around the house but loves lap time and couch time best of all. Snuggle up with this sweet companion any time of the day she'll keep your heart warm as well as your lap.\n\nOlive is micro-chipped, up to date on all vaccinations, and spayed. Her new family will be required to complete a basic obedience course of their choosing.\n\nOlive's adoption fee is $350. A meeting will not be scheduled until you have an approved application, so if you're interested in adopting Olive fill out an Online Application today!\n\nOnce your application has been approved, an ARF volunteer will contact you to arrange a meeting.\n\nThank you for considering a rescue pet from A.R.F.-Animal Rescue Foundation! We are\nbased in Wheaton, IL and conduct adoption events in the DuPage County area. If you are interested in adopting one of our pets, please submit an adoption application at https://www.arf-il.org/adopt/application/\n\nAdoption appointments are scheduled based on the order of applications received, so submit your application early! Submitting an application does not commit you to any animal but does get you a head start with the adoption approval process. Due to a high volume of applications, we are often unable to respond to questions or schedule meetings until your application has been approved. More information about our adoption process can be found on our website here: https://www.arf-il.org/adopt/\n\nAs an all-volunteer, foster home-based organization, A.R.F. Animal Rescue Foundation does not have a facility where applicants can visit our animals. Please visit https://www.arf-il.org/events/ for a list of our upcoming adoption events.\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt, not shop!",

            "description": "What could possibly be better than a quiet, well mannered Shih Tzu? . . . Why . . . Two quiet, well-mannered Shih Tzu!! . . .  Well . . . quiet and well-mannered might be a stretch but at least I got the Shih Tzu part right!!  Meet Crissy and her son Clippy; two adorable tail-wagging sweethearts.  They arrived at the Safehouse on 05/26/2020 along with four of their brothers and sisters.  All six dogs came to us from a Missouri puppy mill (listed as one of the 50 worst mills in the country by the HSUS).  Mommy Crissy, born 04/12/2012, has a beautiful non-shedding cream coat with light tan markings and weighs 18 pounds.  Clippy, born 07/11/2018, has a soft thick non-shedding white coat with gray markings and weighs 20 pounds.  One of his eyes is drying up and shrinking; don\u2019t know why . . . he could have been born that way or (more likely) injured by an infection at the mill.  His other eye is just fine; he finds the treat in my hand with perfect aim!!!  Adjusting to the good life has come easily to Clippy.  In addition to care and comfort, Clippy has discovered LOVE.  Imagine, in his two years of life, he never felt kindness or the gentle touch of a human hand.  Clippy will stand on his hind legs, wrap his front legs around my leg and look up in begging anticipation.  You can\u2019t help but want to love him back, his gratitude is so apparent.  I reach down to massage his back, his kisses are non-stop (literally) and then he falls over for a tummy rub!  Lively and friendly, Clippy is the more outgoing of the two; Crissy, is quieter, just as friendly but more reserved, she prefers to hold back until Clippy sends the \u201call-clear\u201d and then she joins in on the snuggles; a happy little girl with a very busy waging tail.  She has made wonderful progress and will come to me for hugs and body rubs. She loves to snuggle into a warm soft pile of blankets or a big fluffy pillow.  Crissy enjoys playing with stuffed toys, always checking the toy box, exploring the big yard, curious about everything.  Her favorite pastime is burying her toys, inside under beds and blankets or in corners and outside under leaves and dirt or snow.  Hurray for snow, toys buried in mud need constant washing.  Crissy and Clippy are lively and playful and thrive on affection.  They soak up love like a starving dog vacuums up food.  Having never worn a collar or harness, they do not know how to walk on leash and have never been exposed to the noisy rush of traffic; training will take time and patience.  Since all dogs need healthy exercise, going for walks will be one of the first learning experiences to be shared with their new family.  They are, of course, crate trained, but having lived their entire life locked in a barren wire cage, expecting them to spend hours in a crate is unfair; if you cannot find an alternative to crating them, then please do not apply to adopt them. They are doing well with house training (using wee-wee pads and a doggy door) but will need assistance adjusting to a normal household and schedule.  In a fenced-in yard without a leash, they will run and jump and even go potty but if a mill dog gets loose outside a secured area, it will likely run until it drops; catching the dog would be quite a feat.  They get along with small dogs, but have never experienced cats.  They will do best in an active adult\u2019s only home or one with older children; living in a home with young children would be too overwhelming, but the attention of older children would definitely be welcome.  Clippy and Crissy are quite a pair, always together, if you hug one you have to hug the other (dog rules!).  Mill rescues really need to go into a home with another dog in residence; that is how they learn to be dogs but these two have developed a strong bond (mother and son) and will be adopted together. They have a lot to learn about being dogs but I have their TRUST and they have my love and hopefully, soon, a very special adopter to participate in one of the most joyful and rewarding experiences of your life . . . teaching a frightened being to love and trust, to play, enjoy the comfort of a soft bed, good food and that life is ok and humans are good. Clippy and Crissy are spayed/neutered, microchipped, current on all vaccines, heartworm and flea/tick preventative, and they have had a complete physical and dental.  Their combined adoption fee is $500. These two MUST be adopted together; they have a bond that we will not break",

If a dog/puppy is still listed on Petfinder- we are still accepting applications for them***\n\nJesse is in Houston TX and can transport to the PNW mid February \n\nJesse, male, 4 years old, pitbull, 43 lbs. We found out about Jesse when one of our friends called to say he was being given away at a gas station. Thankfully our friend's son was able to scoop him and give him a safe place to crash. \n\nJesse is very playful and has a lot of wiggly butt energy. He is very playful and has a lot of energy. He is also very cuddly and loves to snuggle. \n\nHe walks well on leash, but tends to pull. He can also get mouthy in a puppy/playful way and will need some training in this area. \n\nJesse is a great listener and is highly trainable. He loves riding in the car. He is crate trained and house broken. When he first arrived to the foster home he had some accidents. With routine and consistency he learned to do his business outside. It's possible after transport he could regress and have a few accidents. Once he learns the routine in your home this will quickly resolve. \n\nJesse is dog friendly and has been around dogs of all sizes. He would very much like to play and would love a four legged friend. He can get a little carried away when he plays and can play rougher so we think he would do best with a dog around his size or larger. He has never hurt the small dogs in his foster home but he gets super excited. \n\nJesse has been around a 12 year old child and does really well. He is jumpy and has a lot of energy. We recommend a home with kids 10 years and older. \n\nJesse is a really sweet boy despite the transitions in his life. He is looking for a family who can be patient and work on basic training. He is very friendly and wants a forever home.\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. ***\n\nThe first step in our process is filling out an application. We will review your application as soon as we are able- there are two of us and we do the best that we can. We review applications on a first come first serve basis and look for the best fit/match for the dog and applicant.\n\nhttps://heartoftheunderdog.org/adoption-application\n",

            "description": "Beautiful Jenny found herself in GA all alone and scared. As soon as I saw this baby I knew I had to Rescue her. Jenny made her way to NJ Jan 22, 2021. She had to finish her shot series and now that is behind her she is looking for her forever home. Yes, you read it correctly - She is a German Shepherd / Chihuahua mix! She is fully grown or almost there and she weighs in just around 20lbs. She is fluffy like a German Shepherd and Super Sweet as well. She only wants to be loved and cuddled. Jenny gets along and is non reactive to the cats in our household. She is just about housebroke and loves to play. She is Super Speedy and would need a fenced in yard in order to do her daily zoomies. Sable in color. If you are interested please email me at mtngirl4ever60@gmail.com for an application. DO NOT FILL OUT THE MISSFIT ANGELS APP ON PETFINDER. This is for another rescue partner in MN. We are located in NJ. You can also feel free to text at 856-285-8502",

If a dog/puppy is still listed on Petfinder- we are still accepting applications for them***\n\nJesse is in Houston TX and can transport to the PNW mid February \n\nJesse, male, 4 years old, pitbull, 43 lbs. We found out about Jesse when one of our friends called to say he was being given away at a gas station. Thankfully our friend's son was able to scoop him and give him a safe place to crash. \n\nJesse is very playful and has a lot of wiggly butt energy. He is very playful and has a lot of energy. He is also very cuddly and loves to snuggle. \n\nHe walks well on leash, but tends to pull. He can also get mouthy in a puppy/playful way and will need some training in this area. \n\nJesse is a great listener and is highly trainable. He loves riding in the car. He is crate trained and house broken. When he first arrived to the foster home he had some accidents. With routine and consistency he learned to do his business outside. It's possible after transport he could regress and have a few accidents. Once he learns the routine in your home this will quickly resolve. \n\nJesse is dog friendly and has been around dogs of all sizes. He would very much like to play and would love a four legged friend. He can get a little carried away when he plays and can play rougher so we think he would do best with a dog around his size or larger. He has never hurt the small dogs in his foster home but he gets super excited. \n\nJesse has been around a 12 year old child and does really well. He is jumpy and has a lot of energy. We recommend a home with kids 10 years and older. \n\nJesse is a really sweet boy despite the transitions in his life. He is looking for a family who can be patient and work on basic training. He is very friendly and wants a forever home.\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. ***\n\nThe first step in our process is filling out an application. We will review your application as soon as we are able- there are two of us and we do the best that we can. We review applications on a first come first serve basis and look for the best fit/match for the dog and applicant.\n\nhttps://heartoftheunderdog.org/adoption-application\n",

Unfortunately Jojo\u2019s dog buddy at home has a permanent injury that makes it impossible for them to be together and so Jojo isn\u2019t getting the inclusion in the family that she loves so much. Jojo is an American Bulldog, spayed, up to date on all vaccines and heartworm treatment. She has had annual exams and has no medical issues.\n\nJojo loves running and is a good jogging partner. She loves toys/bones to chew on. She has medium energy, enjoys lounging around in the sun but will play fetch in an instant. She has grown up with another female dog in the house and has never had any issues. She is a little picky about her other doggy friends but tends to do best with other females. She has never had any toy/food aggression. We can freely take things in and out of her mouth without worry. Even my 3yr old can and she doesn\u2019t bat an eye.\n\nShe is goofy, uncoordinated and HAPPY. She does not like cats or small animals. She LOVES children and would do best in a home with children 12 yrs old and up mainly because she isn\u2019t aware of her size and at 70lbs her playing can easily bump most small children to the ground and scare them. Jojo loves belly rubs and will lay on the couch all day if you let her.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting JoJo please contact her current owner Paige (owner) 757-769-1315 paigerosekopf@gmail.com\n\nA small rehoming fee is required and will be donated to a local rescue.",

She was brought to us from an overcrowded shelter down South. Karmen was once a mommy herself and her puppies all found their forever homes. She would prefer a nice quiet and calm home, and would enjoy the company of children above the age of eight. Karmen is a playful and social gal with other male and female dogs that are smaller than her. She really would benefit from having a fenced in yard where she can run and play on a regular basis. If Karmen sounds like the perfect addition to your family, apply for Karmen today!",

            "description": "02/02/21 Maggie was returned to the shelter after a short adoption. The owner could not provide the excerise Maggie needs. Maggie is used to going on daily runs and would love someone to go skiijoring, bikejoring or just plain running with her. She is a very intellegent dog that knows many commands! She has been through multiple dog training classes and loves to learn new things. Maggie is said to love going to the dog park and gets along well with the other dogs. 01/20/21 Maggie, previously known as Artemis, was surrendered back to the shelter after biting a child in the home. She is said to to have many husky characteristics like digging, jumping on people, and rough when playing. She is housebroken. Maggie also loves going on car rides! Maggie has a lot of energy and enjoys going on long runs; she also recently started skijoring training. Maggie is very intelligent and needs an owner that will keep her body and mind active! In her previous home Maggie completed several basic and higher level obedience classes! She is said to be nice with children just has a low threshold, she is wary of men and is more friendly with women. Although Maggie likes people she also enjoys her space and that is something that her new owners should be aware of and respect. Maggie is said to not be the nicest with other dogs, especially other female dogs, and has a high prey drive. Because of her previous history Maggie is restricted to live in a house with no children 12 and younger. 09/17/19 (Maggie) Artemis was originally brought to the shelter as a stray so not much is known about her past. While at the shelter Artemis has been friendly with her animal tenders and the general public. She seems to be a high energy dog who enjoys digging complex holes in her yard, so she may be able dig her way out of a yard! Huskies are a very high energy breed who can often times get themselves into trouble by chewing up things that they shouldn't and being quite excellent escape artists! They need a lot of strenuous daily exercise to keep them happy and content!",

I enjoy being with people and can be outgoing, but there are times when I just want to have some me time by exploring my surroundings or binge watching my favorite show. Right now I will need a home without children under the age of 12. I would also be better suited for a home with a fenced in yard rather than an apartment. Tiger is a Diamond Dog and will be shown by appointment only. Diamond Dogs are dogs that are currently receiving special training from staff and volunteers through our behavior modification program. If you are interested in learning more about this animal, please fill out an application by clicking here . Be sure to include Tiger A1362415 when filling out the survey. After reviewing your application, we will only be reaching out to you if the animal is a good fit for your home.",

This pup will require guidance and supervision learning to use the bathroom outside only, but our staff can give you tips to help with this.",

Cullen is a superstar! He loves his crate and sleeps there perfectly through the night, he\u2019s great on a leash and hasn\u2019t had any accidents in his foster home. For the most part Cullen is pretty laid back. He\u2019s been very sweet with his fosters, and even a little shy since coming from the shelter, but has been opening up. He gets very excited when he meets other dogs on walks that he can play with. He loves other dogs his size and smaller. It\u2019s been great watching this boy blossom and grow more confident around his fosters, and we can\u2019t wait to find his forever home.\n\nApply to adopt at rescuecity.nyc/adopt! \n\nWe are currently facilitating safe adoptions with COVID-19 protocols and adopt out to NYC and surrounding states only - NY CT PA & NJ. \n\n**If a dog is listed on petfinder as available then we are still accepting applications for that dog. We urge you to apply as soon as possible to be considered to adopt the dog you\u2019re interested **\n\nThank you for wanting to give one of our adoptables a loving home!

He LOVES people and just wants someone to share a couch or bed with. He is an easy going dog. He hates crates which isn't a problem cause there is no reason for him to be crated. Tyson won't destroy your house or have accidents, he just wants to sleep in your bed. He loves belly rubs and does well with submissive dogs his size or larger. Please consider adopting Tyson he has many years ahead of him and deserves a home to call his own. Let's share Tyson's story and help him find his way home.\" Missy Morgan",

He is happy to return it, place it at your feet or even in your hand if you don't feel like bending over to pick it up. He will oblige with panache and that look (see above). \n\nWe're not exactly sure of his breed make-up, but he has the play style, intensity and sensitivity of the herding breeds (Border Collie, Kelpie, etc.). Speaking of sensitive, Cauldron can be a little shy and wary of new people at first, but once he gets to know someone, he shows his playful and affectionate side. When he is unsure of someone or something (sometimes other dogs) he gives 'the stare' which can be intimidating for the receiver. Because of these traits: sensitivity, shyness, wariness and staring, we would NOT recommend a home with children. Signals could too easily get crossed and messages misinterpreted.\n\nEven so, Cauldron is a fairly straight forward kind of guy, and although it might take him a little time to open up, he shows great potential for learning and should blossom out with continued training and engagement. He shows true promise and as he matures, he might just make the perfect canine partner.\n\nHe was released from our search dog training program because of indications of arthritis (elbow) on his x-rays. The search work that our dogs train for requires lots of high-impact physical activity (jumping up and down from heights, running on uneven surfaces, lateral moves and other activities hard on joints). He shows no outward signs and other than limiting high impact activities, he would benefit from lots of physical activity such as hiking, walking, swimming, toy play and any low-impact dog sport.\n\nThis seriously amazing fetcher is waiting for you to throw the ball for him!\n\nCauldron is one year and two months old and weighs 44 pounds. He will be neutered before he is released and is up to date on all vaccinations.",

Starr need to learn how to meet humans in a way that is safe for everyone. This complicated girl is a work in progress and will need an adopter who is committed to taking on a \"project dog\" and continuing our work.\n\nStarr comes with a Handsome Dan's Rescue Take My Lead Training grant for FREE private training.

Our veterinary partner estimates that Torey is 8 weeks old at the time of intake in January 2021. Torey is good with people of all ages and other dogs. This adorable little guy was surrendered to a kill shelter in New York because he required medical care that his owner elected not to provide. So the kill shelter called Rescue Dogs Rock NYC and asked if we would take Torey into our rescue and give him the chance at life that he deserves. So that's what we did and now Torey is at our veterinary partner receiving the medical care he requires. And soon he will be ready to start a do over of his life and this time it will be happy. If you are looking for puppy love, kisses and cuddles, Torey is looking for you! Please apply online to adopt Torey (NY) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n\nName: Bruno\n\nDOB: 12/22/2011\n\nWeight: 20 lbs\n\nAdoption Fee: 125.00\n\nHi! My name is Bruno and I'm a 9 y.o. schnauzer-poodle mix. I have a schnauzer body and poodle hair, so I'm likely hypoallergenic (though not 100% guaranteed). Don't let my age fool you, we can live to 15 years old, so I have many good years ahead of me. I did lose one eye last year and I'm still getting used to life without it, so I prefer a quiet house without too many sudden movements (no young children or dogs who want to play). I live with an energetic Chihuahua now and I don't mind him because he leaves me alone, but I would prefer to be an only child (though I could learn to live with another quiet dog). Slow intros with any dog (resident or not) is a must.\n\nI've been living with my foster family for about four weeks now and it took a couple weeks, but I fell in love HARD. I now follow them everywhere, quietly lay at their feet when they're working, and cry quietly for about ten min whenever my foster mom or dad leaves. After that, I just go lie down and wait for them to come home, even if they're gone a few hours. So you don't need to worry about me destroying anything and I haven't had a single accident in the house. My little tail wags so fast when they come home, sometimes I think it will wag right off! Loyalty and affection are my superpowers.\n\nI've only been in MN for one year, and I have secrets from the before times that make it hard for me to warm up to you. So please be patient with me - no pets for the first couple weeks to be safe, just let me hang out around you. I'm totally fine with visitors to the house, I just ask them not to pet me (even if I'm staring up at them forlornly, practically begging for pets). If someone pets me who I don't trust, I might growl at them and I've even bitten before. My foster family started me on anti-anxiety meds recently and they think that will help a lot! Once I trust you though, it's game on! I want you to pet me ALL the time. I'll cuddle up next to you on the couch and be your best friend, I promise! I just need a forever family who is willing to be patient and allows me the space to love them on my own terms. I get attached easily, so it should only take a couple weeks until we're best friends.\n\nI don't like to be approached from under the chin, so my foster momma gently twists my collar around so my leash can be attached on the top (I'm not a fan of harnesses yet - but maybe someday!). I LOVE walks, but I get a little jumpy and growly around other dogs, so we try to cross the street if we see another dog coming (the meds may help with that too!). I also love, love car rides, so if you want to take me to a less populated place to walk sometimes, I would love that! I'm 9 y.o. so I don't need a ton of exercise, but you'd be surprised how much energy I still have! A forever home that could walk me one mile every day, or two miles every other day, would be perfect. Exercise helps with my little bouts of anxiety.\n\nIf you're willing to take a chance and love me, I will return that love to you 100 fold. Because I'm a little slow to warm up, my foster momma would prefer you to meet me a couple of times, maybe go for a walk with me around our neighborhood. I live in S. Mpls now, so local applicants (or those willing to drive to come meet me at least twice) are preferable.\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal.\n\nAll Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs).\n\nRuff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue. Animals are located in homes throughout Minnesota. We do not have a facility where animals are kept.\n\nRuff Start Rescue Adoption Policies:\n\nhttp://www.ruffstartrescue.org/info/display?PageID=11744",

Chipster loves to snuggle underneath the covers and also likes to sometimes sleep in. He is good around other dogs. He is very playful and loves to chase and play with toys. Chipster loves walks and will race you to the door. He also enjoys car rides. After one verbal correction when starting to lift his leg inside, he hasn't attempted it again and hasn't had any accidents inside. If you meet this boy, you will fall in love with all 10 lbs.\nHe is heartworm positive and is on medication to fix that. He is neutered and microchipped and ready for his forever home.\n$150 adoption fee.\n\nTo make the best possible match for you and the pet, please click below to complete the Adoption Application. \n\nOnce your application has been processed, we'll be in contact. \n\nWe cannot schedule a meet and greet without a completed application. \n\nIf you are viewing this page through PetFinder, Adopt-a-Pet, etc., please go to http://ootwrescue.org/adoption.html to fill out an application or review our Adoption Process.",

No cats here\nHouse trained: yes\nCrate Trained: yes\nEnergy level: medium\nCan be touched/ handled: yes\nBarker: not really but is vocal when she wants attention\nFlight Risk: medium initially, loves people\nFood Aggressive: none, she has been fed by herself, takes treats nicely, have petted her while she was eating and put hands in food bowl\nCurrent Food: Purina ProPlan Sensitive Skin and Stomach, salmon 2.5 C twice a day plus an extra cup when I am home in the middle of the day\nWalks on a leash: yes, reluctant to potty on leash\nLeash reactive to dogs or people: no\nRides well in the car: was crated in car, seems to want to get in my car and ride\nDestructive: no, has chewed some small holes in her blankets\nNeeds a home with a yard: yes, particularly until she potties well on a leash.\nNeeds a home with another dog: no. She is fine with dogs but much more focused on humans.\nCan live in an apartment: no\n\nThis statuesque girl is beautiful inside and out. She leans into you when you pet her and really likes attention. Since she wants to please and is treat motivated, she learns quickly. She has not been mouthy but does like to tug on toys. We have been working on \u201cdrop it\u201d and then having her move away from the toy before I pick it up to throw it again for her to fetch. She fetches balls and rubber stick toys.\nShe is not high energy but does take her a little bit to settle down. If you move your hands quickly or fuss, she ducks her head and looks concerned. She can jump like she has springs in her legs and her tail is like a whip. Her tail swings about the height of a toddler\u2019s face.\nAfter the first night, she has been great in her crate. During a recent thunderstorm, she was distressed but settled nicely when I moved her crate where she could see me. She does like to drag her blankets out of her crate and around with her. She had enjoyed a chew toy that incorporates some wood in it and she usually has it in her crate.\nHere she is on a schedule to potty, especially mornings and evenings. She goes out to potty in the am, gets fed and then back out to potty in ~ 30 minutes. She goes out again mid-day. She goes out when I get home, gets fed and then back out in about 30 minutes. Tonight, as I was writing this, I realized I had not taken her back out after feeding her and she was standing by and looking at the doors so she may give you some cues. She also goes back out before bed",

            "description": "Meet Winter! This handsome boy is a 2-year-old, 60 pound Shepherd/Husky Mix who is great with other dogs and loves outdoor adventures!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWinter\u2019s foster family says that he loves to lounge around and is very chill in the home for the most part. Winter equally loves going on long walks in any weather, and being a couch potato all in one! Winter loves all dogs, no preference on gender, age, size, etc, and would do amazing in a home with another dog, he is on his best behavior when he has at least an hour or two of playing in the morning. He gets very attached to his humans but has started to venture around the house by himself. He does sleep in this crate but only if it\u2019s in the bedroom with someone being around. With baby steps he is getting better with being left alone, and alone in his crate but will need a patient adopter who will continue to work with him on his separation anxiety. When he is nervous or over stimulated he starts chewing and getting mouthy (very much in a puppy way) but he is easy to train, understands commands and is treat motivated. Winter is goofy, talkative  an can be stubborn, very much like a Husky, but he is very smart and eager to learn, like a German Shepherd. He LOVES to play both by himself an with people/other dogs but can lounge all day on the couch once he's had enough physical and mental stimulation. Winter is the perfect pup to help you get some pep in your step but then come home and cuddle up with you for back to back nights of Netflix and chill!\n\nApply to adopt at rescuecity.nyc/adopt! \n\nWe are currently facilitating safe adoptions with COVID-19 protocols and adopt out to NYC and surrounding states only - NY CT PA & NJ. \n\n**If a dog is listed on petfinder as available then we are still accepting applications for that dog. We urge you to apply as soon as possible to be considered to adopt the dog you\u2019re interested **\n\nThank you for wanting to give one of our adoptables a loving home!

She is a loving, long-legged girl who loves to chew on her toys, play, cuddle, and prefers to sleep with her humans, instead of in a crate. She answers to her name(s) Tinkerbell, Tink, and Tin-Tink. She gets along with other dogs both large and small, loves playing with them. She is curious about the cats and will bark at them but she doesn't chase. She's also played well and enjoyed children ages 4-11. Tinkerbell is doing great with potty training and will go outside with you, but she isn't completely trained yet. Tinkerbell will be available for adoption thru Eleventh Hour Rescue.\n\nApply to adopt TINKERBELL LONESTAR at www.EHRdogs.org!",

I can get very overexcited to see you because I want to play! I think it\u2019s a hilarious game to jump on every person I see, chase their shoes, and give them playful nips. I don\u2019t really understand how to walk on a leash yet, and usually try to bite the leash or jump up on the person holding it. I need a forever home who is experienced with high energy dogs and has plenty of time and patience to help me learn my manners and practice calm, appropriate behavior. My home will need to have no children or cats, and large securely-fenced yard where I can run and play. \n \nMy adoption fee is $150 (+ $20 county dog license, if residing within Jefferson County). I have been neutered, am up to date on my rabies and DAPP vaccines, and have been micro-chipped too! IF YOU ARE SEEING MY BIO, I AM STILL UP FOR ADOPTION - PLEASE FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS BELOW.\n\nADOPTION PROCEDURE: HSJC is currently CLOSED to the public due to the pandemic. We are accepting applications for Buck, and you can submit one via our website here: https://hsjcwa.org/adopt-a-dog\nWe do not ship animals, and due to COVID and border issues cannot adopt to Canada at this time.\n\nIf we find an applicant who seems to match Buck well, we will contact you to schedule a time for you to meet her at our facility. If you have trouble submitting your application, please send an inquiry and we can email you one! Thank you!\n",

            "description": "BENTLEY is 10 years old and weighs 17 pounds.\n\nI am a true beagle, and as a beagle I reserve the right to be inquisitive (I won't pry into your private affairs however), about yard smells, other animals and the whole, great world out there. After all, curiosity is the sign of intellect, and if there is one thing I am, it's intellectual. If I was a human being I think I might be teaching at Harvard. I also reserve the right to bay at the moon occasionally and certainly bark at other dogs until you let me sniff them. I'm fairly quiet and calm after I get to satisfy my curiosity. \n\nMy main interest, after checking the world out, is to sleep - but, in comfortable places and boy am I good at finding those. The best places are: \n1. the couch \n2. the bed\n3. under the covers in the the bed\n4. in a 2-legged's lap \n5. on the dog bed with my 4-legged foster brother\nTold you I was smart. When not napping I just lie quietly and watch the world around me with interest. I am a calm guy and will settle down quickly - even in a crate though, as I stated earlier, the bed is preferable. In fact, if I see you getting ready for bed I will be up there waiting for you - hahaha. I am great in the car too, but let me choose me own place to ride. And, as we know, never put me in the driver's lap. I value my life too much for that. \n\nI enjoy all manner and ages of human life forms. I am rather partial to men - don't know why. Maybe because I am a man too so can relate better to all that manly stuff? I was at the vet recently getting my teeth cleaned, my body vaccinated and chipped, they did something the people in the white coats called neutering. Not sure what that means, but parts of my undersides are sore now and the vet said something about my manhood. Hope it's all good whatever occurred down there.\n\nWell, that's me: smart, curious and calm (after my curiosity is satisfied). I am now curious about my new forever home. Will it be you?\n\n\n \nINTERESTED in BENTLEY? The first step is to fill out our online Adoption Application (address link below)\n\nNOTE: All of our dogs live in foster homes so it is not possible to setup a meet and greet prior to submitting an adoption application. Filling out an application doesn't obligate you to adopt, but it does save your place in line if there are multiple people interested.\n \nADOPTION APPLICATION (Type or cut & paste the below website address into your browser): http://www.sdroregon.com/adoption-application.htm\n \nIf our Adoption Coordinator determines you are a good match they will contact you. This is a great opportunity for you to find out more about BENTLEY and decide if you would like to setup a meet and greet.  \n \nADOPTION FEE is $150, and there\u2019s a 10% Discount for Senior Citizens and Veterans.\n \nLearn more about the ADOPTION PROCESS here (Type or cut & paste the below website address into your browser): http://www.sdroregon.com/adoption-process.htm\n \nWe apologize, but we are not able to answer individual questions about our dogs. We are a small, all-volunteer organization and we receive hundreds of inquiries. If you want to learn more about a particular dog, then please submit an Adoption Application. If your application is chosen, you will have the opportunity to meet the dog and to get answers to all of your questions. Thank you for your understanding.",

Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet him.\n\nTony is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~4 years \nWeight: ~61lbs\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate trained: Working on it - takes some time to settle, but overall doing well with crate training\nDog sociability: Selective with his dog friends and may be a match for some, but not all. He lives with a dog in his foster home and has done well with her, but is leash reactive on walks when he sees other dogs or people. He will benefit from a confident handler and continued leash training.\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Has done well with teenagers in his foster home. He's mouthy (play bites) so not recommenced for kids under 12.\nIdeal home: Tony would love to live in a quieter neighborhood where he doesn't have to pass by a bunch of people or other dogs. He would love an adopter committed to working on training and helping to continue safe socialization. \n\nIf you are looking for a sweet pittie baby, Tony is your man! He LOVES to cuddle and will curl up next to you all day and night if you let him. He is still young so he has some puppy energy and will need occasional play breaks. Tony is still working on playing politely, and can mouth when he gets too excited and can't contain himself. If you even look at the leash for too long he will start dancing around wanting to go for a walk. He can be food motivated and goes wild for meat but will also take any food like a refined gentleman if offered to him. Tony is a very loving dog and once you are his human he will love you blindly. He will follow you around the house, sleep next to you at night, and keep an eye on you when you go out together to make sure you are safe. Tony is looking for a home that will take his accepting love and give it back to him tenfold because that is what this sweet boy greatly deserves.\n\nTony's adoption fee is 300. He is neutered, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. He will need a dental cleaning in the next 6 months which will be the adopter's responsibility. \n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

He does very well when given daily mental and physical enrichment.\n\nXander is a happy go lucky, quick-learning, playful teenage pup looking for his forever home! He came to us from a shelter in Texas after he was found as a stray. He is truly the jack of all trades - housetrained, doing well with his crate-training, and likes to meet other dogs - what more could you ask for? Xander enjoys learning new tricks (he's learned sit, stay and down in a matter of a week!), going for walks around the neighborhood, cuddling up next to his human during his daily afternoon nap, accompanying people on car rides and watching himself in the mirror...can't blame him, he's pretty handsome! He is still a bit of a teenager and working on his table manners and learning what is and what is not a dog toy, etc. so he would do best with someone excited to train an intelligent pup!\n\nXander's adoption fee is 300. He is neutered, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. \n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications.

She was pretty scared, as that environment does to the dogs.  But, she's been moved to a foster home and settling in nicely.  She's 20#, good with other dogs and seems to like all people. Flora is a little 'too' interested in the cats so may do best in a home without cats.  She's crate trained and working on housetraining.  Her adoption fee is $300 to help cover the medical costs of getting ready for adoption. For our application, please email rescuebc@hotmail.com  Include your location and a phone number for future communication.\nThe first step in our process is to submit an application for review. Once approved, we will contact you to arrange a meeting at our next Meet and Greet event. Our pets are fostered in private homes and will be brought to Frederick, MD to meet approved adopters.\nPLEASE ALLOW 24-48  HOURS FOR A RESPONSE.",

They appear to be house broken at ourOur story:We were rescued in a hallway of an apartment with newborn puppies I animal control. on a five day stray hold then transported to this rescue thankfully:) where we felt safe and spoiled and our puppies thrived. The rescue after a few days found out we were rescued together so they put us back together in the same room. First they put us outside and when we saw each other we jumped up and down with joy! We ran around the yard kissing each other's faces our tails wouldn't stop wagging! Because we are so bonded and went through so much we want to be adopted together. We are very affectionate and friendly with our foster. If you want to add love & lots of fun in your life - Adopt us!PLEASE GO TO: www.tlcwithpups.com for more info. and my adoption fee that is on my main profile at my rescue's website. I have been given all my age appropriate vaccinations and dewormed. I may need more depending on my age, puppies continue to get their vaccinations and dewormings up to 14 to 16 weeks. If I am a puppy, I will have an appt. to be altered (at our vet) my alter fee is included in the adoption donation fee. I have been treated with Frontline for fleas & ticks. Thanks soooo much for making adoption your first option - so many of my buddies need to get adopted too... so tell a friend to visit our website and help in the goal to have more pups find forever homes. If you are viewing me on Petfinder or one of the other rescue portals - please go to our main website: www.tlcwithpups.com - where you can find our adoption fees and our main profiles.

Much like the breed, Kaya is very smart and is a very active dog. She enjoys working on commands, going on walks and romping around outside. Kaya is social and loyal! She enjoys being pet and cuddled and she is always observant and alert. Kaya seems to gravitate more toward women than men but does fine with both. She also prefers other dogs that are submissive and easy going compared to dominant, loud in your face dogs. We are not sure how she does with cats! If you are looking for a great companion and family dog, Kaya is your girl!\n\nDue to COVID-19, Friendship APL is performing adoptions BY APPOINTMENT ONLY from 9:30am - 3:30pm, Tuesdays through Sundays. WALK-IN VISITORS ARE NOT PERMITTED. To schedule an adoption appointment, please email adoptions@friendshipapl.org.\n\nIf you have kids in your family and are interested in adopting a Friendship dog please bring them with you for a meet and greet.\n\nAll dogs receive one or more vaccinations, a basic veterinary examination, are dewormed, heartworm tested, and spayed or neutered.

He loves hiking and going to the beach as well as playing at the local dog park. Rocco will need an active family to keep up with him and help him burn his energy.\n\nRocco will require lots of mental stimulation in addition to physical exercise. He would benefit from dog sports (agility, nose work, trick training, etc.) as well as using puzzle toys and feeders as home. Rocco will keep you on your toes as he shows off his intelligence!\n\nRocco shows no signs of resource guarding or separation anxiety in shelter or in his previous home. He has not lived with other animals before but could live with dogs. He has no experience living with children but has done okay when visiting children, his bouncy exuberant behaviour does put him at risk of knocking kids down however it is not intentional.\n\nWe are still getting to know Rocco as this time, please check back for more information as we better understand his needs!\n\nThank you for your interest in adopting from us! Due to the high number of applications we receive for our animals, we will only be contacting potential adopters to further review their application.\n\nPlease note, due to the current COVID-19 pandemic our adoption process has changed. Please visit our website https://spca.bc.ca/adoption/how-to-adopt/ for more information and to apply for the animal you are interested in. All adoptions are by appointment only once we have received and approved an application. Primary Color: Black Weight: 34kg Age: 1yrs 0mths 0wks Animal has been Neutered",

He was found as a stray in Cle. and was never claimed by his owner. Phil is missing all of his teeth and is a little on the skinny side, weighing in at only 7.5 pounds. Phil is going blind and deaf so will need a owner experienced with this. Phil wasn't fixed when coming to us but was recently fixed, he has to wear a belly band in the home because he will have accidents and pee on things, this could also be due to old age. Phil is a very sweet boy, he loved to be held, loves to cuddle, and be right next to you on the couch or at bed times. He does great in a crate when he needs to be crated. Phil is currently on a wet food only diet, but can eat softened hard kibble if preferred. His adoption fee is $200 he will be fixed, up to date on vaccines, microchipped and current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention.",

He is a sweet loving dog. He does not jump up, however puts his paws up on your leg if he wants attention. He doesn't seem to sit very well to get his leash on. Rather he rolls on his back so you can rub his tummy. When he does sit, he sits like a puppy. He is a definite, definite lapdog will spend evening sitting with you or alongside you with his head in your lap.\nHe is not a begger, so no worries about your dinner plate! No whining or begging. What a good boy!\n\nScottie is a smart boy who can open doors if they are cracked just a little bit! He loves sniffing for walks and is past the puppy 'zoomies' stage. He loves sleeping in bed and will even cuddle under the covers! Perfect for a cold MN night for sure!\n\nScottie will go in a crate though he has a definite preference for a larger wire one vs a plastic crate. Once he's settled into the crate of preference, he's a 'very chill dog' and does fine.\n\nHe will bark when someone comes to the door, at sirens and loud trucks...and people walking along the sidewalk, however if he doesn't have access to a front window near a busy sidewalk, he's quiet. He only will bark if he can see people. :o)\n\nHe does fetch , that is a slow run, with toys and balls. He enjoys exploring new places and does well meeting new people. He's very respectful with his people and seems to intuitively know if he is welcome on a lap or should just reside in a vacant chair.\nInterested in meeting this great little dog?

The breed(s) listed are our best guess and are in no way guaranteed. Sometimes the pets appear to be a particular breed(s) in the pictures we receive from our rescue partners and when they arrive we are surprised to see an entirely different breed(s) in person! If you choose to DNA test your adopted pet, test results may vary from company to company and our breed guess may not be reflected in those results as it is just that, our best guess. It is with deep longing that we wish there was a breed called \"cute\" as we believe all of our dogs would fall under this new breed classification!\n\n//",

Once we receive it, we'll forward it to the foster family for follow up. We are 100% foster based, so we don't have a facility. Review the process FAQ at our website.\n\nAdoption applications can be found here: http://labrescuefresno.org/available-labs/adoption-application/\n\nAdoption Fees Adult Dog (10 mos. - 7 years): $250.00 Puppy (9 mos. and under): $350.00 Senior (8 yrs. and up)/Special Needs Dog: $100.00\n\nJake - Black Male, Age 18 Month, 60 pounds\n\nAre you looking for a handsome cuddler to add to your family? Do you want to look at beautiful, soulful brown eyes? Look no further than Jake (also known as Jake-y poo at his foster home).\nJake came to us when a good Samaritan in Tulare County picked him up as he was running in fear from other dogs. LRRF once again sprang to the rescue and saved this sweet boy. We do not know Jake's upbringing or background but from his time in his foster home we have learned Jake will need a special forever home. Jake is still a young dog and has not had much human contact. Jake is learning in his foster home how to communicate properly. He will need a family that has a strong human pack leader dedicated to his continued training and daily exercise.\nJake is a very smart boy; he has learned to potty outdoors, can walk nicely on a leash and is crate trained. He knows \"sit\", is working on \"off\", and is a quick learner who is attentive and inquisitive. He has lots of Lab energy but above all, he is a cuddler and would love nothing more than to rest his head on your lap and want to be with you wherever you goincluding the bathroom if you forget to close the door.\nJake will do best in a home with older children, and without cats or small dogs. He loves dogs his own size. This loving guy is ready for his forever family.\nIf you feel you are that strong pack leader and you'd like to add lovable Jake-y poo to your family, please fill out an application at www.labrescuefresno.org\n\nIf you are interested in adopting through Labrador Retriever Rescue of Fresno, you must first fill out an Adoption Application located at our website www.LabRescueFresno.org All dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines including rabies; flea/tick topical drops, heartworm tested and microchipped. Thank you for opting to adopt!!\nAdoption FeesAdult Dog (10 mos. - 7 years): $250.00 Puppy (9 mos. and under): $350.00Senior (8 yrs. and up)/Special Needs Dog: $100.00",

He enjoys walks outside and would likely make a great hiking buddy! He can be a bit dog selective, so he would need a slow introduction to new dogs. He loves treats and is always eager to learn some new tricks to show off. If there are kids in the home, he would prefer kids ages 10 and up. He is a goofy guy looking for his forever home. \n\nIf McIntosh looks like the apple of your eye, give our adoption counselors a call at 234-212-9843 to schedule an appointment to meet him today!",

The best part about toys is that I'm really good at entertaining myself! Sometimes I forget I'm a big guy and may end up in your lap sometimes! I'm a little clumsy and a little jumpy, so I'd prefer to live in a home with humans middle school age and older. I'm a bit selective about who my doggy friends are, so please bring your doggy to the shelter to meet me! I haven't even met you yet and I love you already! See ya soon!\n\nI'm Beemer's Buddy! Thanks to Champman BMW Camelback, you can take me home for free!\n\nMake an appointment to meet me at AAWL's Main Shelter!\n\n25 N. 40th St\nPhoenix AZ 85034\n\nhttps://aawl.org/content/appointment-based-adoptions\n\nAAWL recommends I live with humans MIDDLE SCHOOL AGE and OLDER.\nAAWL thinks I am MUST MEET all dogs in the home prior to adoption. Please bring your dog here to the shelter to meet me!\nAAWL thinks I am a DAILY WORKOUT, needing lots of exercise..\nAAWL does not know if I can live with cats at this time.",

            "description": "Sophie is a 1 year old spayed female lab/terrier mix who weighs about 34 lbs. Sophie was rescued from an overcrowded high kill shelter after being dumped by her owner. Our hearts broke for this sweet girl as we saw the fear she experienced in the loud shelter. Now that she is safe with us we are beginning to see glimpses of her true self. Sophie is incredibly sweet, but is still very shy. She will need a patient family willing to give her time to settle in and learn that she is safe. It's clear she has never been on a leash and doesn't understand how it works. Sophie really lights up when she sees other dogs and loves meeting new doggie friends. She would love a confident canine pal in her forever home to help show her the ropes. With a little patience, kindness, and a lot of love we have no doubt this brindle beauty will flourish in her forever home; all she needs is a chance. Please help us find Sophie the forever home she's been dreaming of!\n\nInterested in adopting?

Fill out and submit our online Adoption Application.\n2. Please only submit ONE Adoption Application. (Our Application is for general pre-approval, not for a specific adoptable animal).\n3. Once received, the Allen County SPCA will review your application. Applications are reviewed in the order they are received.\n4. We will contact you to let you know your Adoption Status and schedule an Adoption Appointment. Applications may take up to 1-2 days to process. Please give us a call at the shelter at 260-744-0454 if you have not heard back from us within 48 hours.\n5. If you haven't found your perfect match at the shelter, that's okay too - pre-approved applications are valid for 6 months!\n\nCome prepared! Please bring proof of a current rabies vaccine for all pets living in the home. If you have another dog, you are welcome to bring him or her with you so that we can safely perform a dog interaction.\n\nUnfortunately, animals cannot be held for you.\n\nA Special Note from the Allen County SPCA:\nRemember, pets are a lifelong commitment. We at the Allen County SPCA ask that you take adding a furry family member to your home seriously, and do your research on the different breeds before adopting. We also ask that you are able to keep up on yearly vaccinations, monthly preventatives, a good diet, daily exercise, training, and most of all, LOVE. If you ever have an issue with a pet that you adopted, please contact us right away; we may be able to help, or we can put you in touch with someone who can. All set? Come in and adopt today!",

Chewy can most often be found laying on his bed or loping around the yard outside with his kennel staff friends. Although Chewy is a big boy he really likes to cuddle.

Meet Chance, a six year old Boxer/Mt Cur mix that will need you to stop in a few times to visit before he will be able to head home. Building trust and comfort ability takes some time but once he is sure you are his friend he sticks close and loves affection. Once warmed up this guy is full of puppy energy and will bring a smile to your face as he romps and plays outside!! Chance has lived in a home with cats and enjoyed their company greatly in his previous home. He can also be shy around other dogs but with the right dog friend he might benefit greatly with his confidence. We think Chance would do best in a home with adults and kids over the age of 8. If you think you would love to give some confidence to this guy in your loving home apply for our Chance today!!",

My name is Leigha and I hitched a ride to WI all the way from TX. \n\nI'm a little shy at first but once you get to know me I will shower you with hugs and kisses. I love to play and wrestle with my little sister, Raven, cause sometimes she needs to be reminded that I am cuter!\n\nThis little 8lb, 3 month old Chihuahua Mix won't be around forever. Run and put your app in now! She is working on housebreaking but her foster mom says she is doing very well. She is good with kids of all ages and loves other dogs.\n\nLeigha is UTD on age appropriate shots, and her adoption fee is $425 will include her spay, if done through a Biggie Paws approved vet and microchip.\n\nLocated in Kenosha, WI\n\nhttps://us18.sheltermanager.com/service?account=gd2427&method=online_form_html&formid=32&fbclid=IwAR0yWT5_sd0HeUlPdH_vPgYrZnx5toDUwE1GNPf4rTdlqgJsHncS-1XNziADATCP # 494550",

            "description": "Taco-Chihuahua male, ~ 1-2 yr. Special Needs (Jan. 2021)\n\nTaco came to the Rescue when he was left with Animal Control in a small rural community Shelter.  He's been waiting at the Shelter for a new home to be found. He's a friendly boy, good with all the staff and volunteers. He's about 10# and will be a wonderful companion. Taco has a birth defect in his back leg/knees. He gets around find, but has a 'bowed leg' look to him that is obvious.  It certainly doesn't slow him down or change his sweet nature.  He is fine with other dogs and loves belly rubs!  His adoption fee is $300 to help cover the medical costs of getting ready for adoption.  For our application, please email rescuebc@hotmail.com  Include your location and phone number for future communication \nThe first step in our process is to submit an application for review. Once approved, we will contact you to arrange a meeting at our next Meet and Greet event. Our pets are fostered in private homes and will be brought to Frederick, MD to meet approved adopters.\nPLEASE ALLOW 24-48 FOR A RESPONSE.",

The volunteers tell me I'm their favorite so I give them lots of hugs. I love all the people I meet, but I have been called a \"ladies man\". I only want human company, not other animals. I am good on leash, but I do need to keep working with my foster mom to learn to ignore other dogs on walks. I have very good manners, and am completely house trained. I will need to find a family who will continue my positive reinforcement training. Luckily, I'm very food motivated, so my training will be fun! Besides walks, playing with my toys, and snuggling in bed, I really love car rides. I would be a great road trip buddy! If you're looking for a big lovable dog to share your life with, fill out the application so you can meet me: hsnb.org/adoptions. Not to brag, but I will be an amazing best friend! PS. My adoption fee is only $75. Thank you. Primary Color: Tan Secondary Color: White Weight: 90lbs Age: 3yrs 5mths 2wks Animal has been Neutered",

I do have a big scar healing up on my back where my growth was removed, but every scar tells a story and mine tell a story of perseverance! My medical history aside, I'm an incredibly sweet and playful little guy. I can be pretty vocal when I want attention, I love to run, and I LOVE my food! Feed me and love me, and this is the start of a beautiful friendship between us. Think you have what it takes to be my new family and give me a much needed new lease on life? Apply for me today!",

She, and her sibling Lucy, are thought be born in September of 2020. They are believed to be a mix of Lab / hound mix with their medium sized bodies, stunning eyes and beautiful fur. She is currently about 25 pounds and should be 40 - 45 pounds full grown.  Lexie is a bit of a \"snuggler\" and just loves those belly rubs.  She is so very sweet and smart.   She will be an amazing family dog and loyal companion.\n\nThey are very healthy, active and love to play. They will have 2 rounds of shots and have been dewormed upon arrival. They would be a perfect addition to any home.\nTheir adoption fee is $495, which also includes transportation and their two rounds of vaccines.Their adoption fee is $495, which also includes transportation and their two rounds of vaccines. \n\nIMPORTANT: This puppy has not yet been altered. For any dog or puppy that is not able to be spayed/neutered prior to adoption, SNARR requires a $125 deposit in addition to your adoption fee, as well as a signed Spay/Neuter Contract stating you will have this dog altered within 6 months of adoption. The $125 deposit will be returned once the contract has been fulfilled. \n\nIf they are listed on Petfinder, they are still available. We do not go on a first come first serve basis, but on best fit for the family and most importantly, the puppy.  We are taking our best guess on breed and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's physical appearance.  \n\nPlease visit snarrnortheast.org for the applications to adopt.  If you are interested in adopting any of the puppies our adoption fee is $495 and we do suggest putting a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application\n\n**** The first step in adopting a puppy through SNARR Northeast is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org.  Please understand that at this time we are currently experiencing increased interest in our adoptable dogs/puppies, so if you are interested in adopting in a dog, the best thing to do is submit an adoption application ASAP. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. Please make sure to receive a receipt of confirmation after submitting your application to ensure that it has come through properly.****",

            "description": "Meet Lovable Lucy who was rescued from a rural area in North Carolina on private property.   She will arrive just in time to be your Valentine xoxoxo.   She, and her sibling Lexie, are thought be born in September of 2020. They are believed to be a mix of Lab / hound mix with their medium sized bodies, stunning eyes and beautiful fur.   She is currently about 25 pounds and should be 40 - 45 pounds full grown. Lucy is a bit shy and takes a few minutes to warm up and let loose.  She is so very sweet and a bit on the timid side.  She will be a lovable family pet and loyal companion.  \nThey are very healthy, active and love to play.  They will have 2 rounds of shots and have been dewormed upon arrival.   They would be a perfect addition to any home.  \nTheir adoption fee is $495, which also includes transportation and their two rounds of vaccines. \n\nIMPORTANT: This puppy has not yet been altered. For any dog or puppy that is not able to be spayed/neutered prior to adoption, SNARR requires a $125 deposit in addition to your adoption fee, as well as a signed Spay/Neuter Contract stating you will have this dog altered within 6 months of adoption. The $125 deposit will be returned once the contract has been fulfilled. \n\nIf they are listed on Petfinder, they are still available. We do not go on a first come first serve basis, but on best fit for the family and most importantly, the puppy.  We are taking our best guess on breed and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's physical appearance.  \n\nPlease visit snarrnortheast.org for the applications to adopt.  If you are interested in adopting any of the puppies our adoption fee is $495 and we do suggest putting a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application\n\n**** The first step in adopting a puppy through SNARR Northeast is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org.  Please understand that at this time we are currently experiencing increased interest in our adoptable dogs/puppies, so if you are interested in adopting in a dog, the best thing to do is submit an adoption application ASAP. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. Please make sure to receive a receipt of confirmation after submitting your application to ensure that it has come through properly.****",

He is great with some dogs and demanding and annoying to others. He is young and eager for a family that will guide him to grow and learn. He knows how to use doggy door and loves playing with toys .His house skills are pretty good, until there is food around.  Tony is not yet great with crating. He only uses it when food is being prepped. He is fed separately from other dogs. He shares the bed with his foster humans and siblings when it is bedtime. We are hoping for a dog savvy family with no children under 10 or an adult only home and fenced yard needed Tony would love a family who will continue working with him and learning with him.\n\nTony is spay/neutered, microchipped, current on vaccines, heartworm tested and on prevention. Adoption fee for Tony is $275. If you are interested in adopting Tony, please fill out an adoption application http://www.furgetusnotrescue.org/application.html .",

Sometimes the pets appear to be a particular breed(s) in the pictures we receive from our rescue partners and when they arrive we are surprised to see an entirely different breed(s) in person! If you choose to DNA test your adopted pet, test results may vary from company to company and our breed guess may not be reflected in those results as it is just that, our best guess. It is with deep longing that we wish there was a breed called \"cute\" as we believe all of our dogs would fall under this new breed classification!\n\n//",

I will come running to say hi as soon as you walk through the door with my skipping style. I am very energetic and love fluffy toys. I can push a ball around and am smart enough to learn tricks. I am very sweet and will curl up in your lap as you are working, or sit by your side. I love a warm blanket to lay on or a big stuffed animal to call my bed, I like to be spoiled. I'm a big eater and I love treats! Overall I am a very very sweet boy and will definitely make a good partner for your home. Apply to adopt me so my friends at Adopt&Shop can have us meet virtually!",

            "description": "WALKING ON SUNSHINE! KATIE\u2019S STORY: For almost a year, senior KATIE, age 11, has waited at a shelter. She was given away by her family in late 2019. Only a few months later, in March 2020, KATIE was found alone in West Babylon and brought to Babylon Animal Shelter. Her owners were tracked down but the woman caring for her had broken her hip and her adult son didn\u2019t want KATIE. For the second time in only a few months, she lost her home.\n\nKATIE had us from her first approach. She led with an adorably wonky head tilt and bobbed like a boat riding gentle waves. She stepped as though delicate flowers were underfoot, laying each paw down gently in a prancing trot her body had adopted to balance a neurological trauma. Despite recently losing her lifelong home and navigating a physical disability in a shelter environment, KATIE is what might happen if sunshine were mixed with sugar.\n\nThe last of four long time shelter dogs we brought into our #OneLuckyPup program from BAS, we put KATIE through a day of testing, assessment and MRI at The Animal Medical Center, led by neurologist Dr. Abbie Lebowitz, where we learned KATIE had a stroke. This traumatic event left her with some sweet signature moves, but no serious damage. A CSF tap confirmed lack of disease and supports this diagnosis. Over 60% of dogs like KATIE who experience a stroke lack an identifiable cause and no increased risk of future strokes. What does this mean for KATIE? Well, nothing really. KATIE is just a senior dog in need of a loving home to live out her many golden years left. \n\nKATIE, mildly active, would enjoy a calmer home. She didn\u2019t engage with other shelter dogs, likely because she feels physically limited, so her home should have no other pets. KATIE enjoys walks, being talked to, hanging with her peeps and cream cheese.\n\nIf you like Sunday morning bagels and can spare a schmear, head to mrbonesandco.org/adopt or email elli@mrbonesandco.org with questions. We\u2019ll consider homes within a 5-hr drive of NYC or Wash DC, where her foster will take over in a few days. \n\n#AdoptKatieMBC",

            "description": "Refined and cultured is how my four legged friends describe me. The humans call me calm and well behaved. Either way, I'm a catch that will bring class and style to your home.\n\nHe is a wonderful dog that is super sweet and playful. He is good with cats and dogs. He loves his tennis ball but doesn't understand the concept of fetch yet. He enjoys laying down with his squeaky toys but does not chew on them for very\nlong and hasn't ripped any up. He does great on a leash and doesn't pull unless he really wants to sniff something in his path. When seeing other dogs on walks he doesn't even acknowledge that they are there he just keeps on walking. We have only heard him bark once, but he can be vocal if he is kept in a crate when nobody is in the room. We have only ever put him in the crate for training reasons. He is left out to roam free when there is nobody home and never tore up anything. The longest he was left home for was about 3 hours multiple different times. He is potty trained and shouldn't have any accidents as long as he is let outside. The only big issue we have had with him is that he will bolt out the front door. He has tried several times even with someone standing in the doorway. You must hold him or have him on a leash before opening the door. He ran from the kitchen out the front door in half a second and started walking down the neighborhood\nbefore I caught him. He will not listen to you if you call him back. We did start training him using the words sit and wait before opening any door (bedroom, back, & front) and he did good, again make sure he is on the leash when opening the front door even when training. We also started teaching him \"come\" and he picked it up rather quickly. He is a stubborn dog and will require a bit of training just like any other dog, but he has the basics down and is willing to work for his treats. We have a 3ft chain link fence in the backyard, and he has not tried to jump over it or mess with any of our neighbor's dogs. He loves being outside. If you let him stay out there for hours he would lay down in the grass and enjoy the cold breeze. He sleeps in the room with us next to our bed with the door closed all night and doesn't make a peep. He does not scratch at the door or bark to be let out, as long as you are in the room with him he has zero problems. He will jump up in bed or on the couch and cuddle up next to you. He does very well\naround food and does not try to sneak anything off your plate or beg at your feet. Iwould suggest he be with another dog that he can play with or a family that can play with him and take him on walks every day. He is a very good boy and will make a perfect dog if you are willing to give him the time he needs.\n Primary Color: Tri Color Secondary Color: White Weight: 55.5lbs Age: 2yrs 0mths 2wks Animal has been Neutered",

Noel had lived her short life constantly on a chain and she lived under the house. The owner knew that surrendering her was the best thing to do for the pup. \n\nNoel was then placed into one of our loving foster homes. With some time and a little love, Noel has completely healed. She has been completely vetted and is now spayed. She loves all people, does great with children, and gets along with other dogs. \n\nSince being with us she has been on flea/tick prevention as well as heartworm prevention. She has been tested for HW and is HW-. \n\nShe is completely house trained and loves to snuggle up on the couch at her fosters house. \n\nIf you are looking to add a furry member to your family, please consider Noel.

They are 6 weeks old and will be ready to go to their forever home in a few weeks. The mother is a Jack Russell Terrier and the father was a Chihuahua. There is a picture included of the parents. They will stay small under or around 15 lbs. They are social and playful. The pups are exposed to other dogs in the household. From time to time they are around children as well. They would fit well into most any home that is looking for an outgoing, active, opinionated, and extremely loving home. These dogs are bound to have big personalities. They need to be socialized and obedience as they grow so you end up with a nice adult dog.\n They are located in Racine WI in a Foster.\nIf interested please go to ruffluckdogrescue.com and fill out an application.",

PLEASE READ ENTIRE BIO & FAQs BEFORE EMAILING THE RESCUE****\n\nHoss's owner reached out to SNARR NE to help rehome him safely.  His owner was very sad about rehoming him, but she has  5 other dogs, both male and female. Hoss has always gotten along with all of the other dogs in the house without incident, except for the latest addition to the family who was an unaltered male dog. Although Hoss gets along well with the other male dogs in the home, we will only be placing Hoss in a home without  another male dog. Hoss has lived in a home with racoons, skunks and opossums (his former owner is a wildlife rehabilitator). He also shared his home with a cat. Hoss is estimated to be 7 years old, but he still has playful spurts, especially when he sees kids. Because of his large size (he weighs just under 100 pounds), and his playful nature, we will not be adopting Hoss into a home with children. \n\nHoss loves to lounge on a couch with his people. One of his favorite things to do is to go on a car ride. \n\nHoss is heartworm positive, but has been on heartworm treatment. \n\nTo apply to adopt Hoss, visit www.snarrnortheast.org/applications and submit an application. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING \n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder,  there are sometimes discrepancies between the breed that is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

I immediately got treatment. I was able to kick Parvo's booty. Then I came down with bronchitis,  I have finished my antibiotics and am feeling great!!! I have a foster sister(female pit) that I love to play with and also live with two 13 year olds humans that love to snuggle with me. I learned that if I sit pretty I get treats, and I really love treats. I am working on going potty outside. I still have accidents in the house, but I dont potty in my kennel.  I am ready to find my forever home. If you want to meet me let my foster mom know and we will set up a meet and greet. \nOdessa Mo. \n Fixed and up to date on vet care. Also microchipped $175.  \n  Bruno is said to be German shepherd and Pit mix, but we really don't know. He is is a doll! Super sweet personality.  Adopters need to be fully ready for puppy stage and training.\n Please fill out an application. You can find it on our website friendsofthefriendless.co",

She's super energetic and active. She's feisty and loves to play with her toys. She's confident and outgoing. She's very loving, affectionate, and cuddly. She gets along well with other dogs but plays rough and can be too much for little dogs. Be aware that she's a puppy and chews and has sharp teeth and nails. Zena will need to go to a home with a fenced in yard or to a large SAFE property where she can get the exercise she needs.\n...................................If you would like further information or would like to request an adoption application, please e-mail us directly at hss@cablelynx.com.

He is a very friendly boy, good leash manners, rather laid back, BUT if he gets loose he may bolt and has selective hearing so then not come back to you. This means he must have a well-fenced yard to keep him safe. Good with other dogs.\n\nADOPTION FEES Dogs & Puppies.....$100.00 . This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more.\nThe first step to do an adoption is to do our Adoption Application here: https://www.elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html\nIMPORTANT - we respond to your emailed applications and queries via email back to you. Please make sure you have either added our email (hselco@bellsouth.net) to your contact list or that you routinely check your SPAM folder for our response just to be safe. If we do not receive a timely response we simply move on to another applicant.\nYes, there are sometimes exceptions to our normal fee for older dogs or special cases. Some of our pets have also been lovingly sponsored by caring people and we will let the approved adopter know about that at the point of adoption. Visit our Website at: http://www.elmorehumane.org The staff would also like to remind you that for faster response to inquiries about adoptable animals to have the animals ID#, name & description. This way your questions will be answered in a timely manner.\nAll pet adoption websites & our shelter management software require that we choose a primary and/or secondary breed for our dogs. While our staff is quite breed knowledgeable, in many cases we are truly making our best guesses as to their breed(s) based on many factors but cannot promise that what we have said is accurate. So taking into account your own parameters for things such as size, coat care, activity level, etc please come and get to know our dog(s) as individuals to see if their personalities and yours are a forever match.\nPhone: (334) 567-3377 Fax: (334) 567-8774 E-mail: hselco@bellsouth.net",

I ended up being pregnant again (surprise!) and had 6 more adorable babies. They have all found their homes and now its my turn. When I first came into rescue I was really scared and shy. I was also very protective of my babies, so it made it difficult to work on socializing me. But the past few weeks I've really been coming out of my shell. Turns out I LOVE dogs! I love to play chase, and wrestle - I have a fairly rough and rowdy playstyle with another dog that plays the same way - but also tone it down and just throw playbows at the more mellow dogs. I prefer female humans, but am learning that the male ones aren't too bad either (as long as they have lots of treats). I am very food motivated which is helpful. I am trusted loose in the house, and am a really good girl inside, I usually just sit and stare out the window. But then as soon as we go outside, playtime is on! I'm looking for a loving home that will be patient with me as I continue learning and socializing. Another friendly dog my size would be great too!\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thegooddogrescue/videos/1844508895705399\n\nDue to the current events, the rescue is not able to host adoption events.

Sometimes the pets appear to be a particular breed(s) in the pictures we receive from our rescue partners and when they arrive we are surprised to see an entirely different breed(s) in person!

Sometimes the pets appear to be a particular breed(s) in the pictures we receive from our rescue partners and when they arrive we are surprised to see an entirely different breed(s) in person! If you choose to DNA test your adopted pet, test results may vary from company to company and our breed guess may not be reflected in those results as it is just that, our best guess.

I\u2019m a part of the Northern Outreach Initiative here at Animal Services. I\u2019m such a sweet girl! I love people so much! I\u2019m just a bundle of fun! I\u2019m very wiggly and active. I can\u2019t wait to have lots of outdoor adventures with my new family. I think I could fit in well with just about anyone. Please ask about me today!\n\nLeash: Needs some work\nObedience: Needs training\nContainment: A fenced in yard\nWith other Dogs: Appears ok\nWith cats: Unknown\nWith small children: Unknown\n\nAdoption comes with:\n\n* Mandatory spaying/neutering\n* First license\n* Veterinarian check-up\n* First vaccinations\n* Tattoo\n* Microchip implant\n* 6 weeks of free pet insurance\n* Small bag of dog food\n* De-worming for young pups\n * Literature on responsible pet ownership.\n\n------------------------------------\n\n** IMPORTANT NOTICE **\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, dog adoptions are currently being done by appointment only. Contact 311 to schedule an appointment. Thank you!\n\n______________________________\n\nCome Meet Our Adoptable Dogs...\nWinnipeg Animal Services Agency\n1057 Logan Avenue\nWinnipeg, Manitoba, Canada\nR3E 3N8\n\nPhone: 311 - outside Winnipeg dial 1-877-311-4974 \n\nEmail: animalservicesagency@winnipeg.ca\n\nOur hours for adoption are Monday to Friday from 11:00 am - 5:30 pm\nSaturday & Sunday from 12:00 pm - 4:30pm.\nAnimal Services is closed on statutory holidays.\n\nBACKGROUND\nAlmost all the dogs at Animal Services are picked up as strays running loose on the streets of Winnipeg and therefore they come to us with no known history. For this reason, we are not sure how they will interact with other dogs, cats or how they are with children. We would suggest that if you have younger children you bring them down with you to meet the dogs. We also have an outdoor play area where we can do introductions with any other dogs that live in the home.\n\nAll locally adopted dogs come with a 7 day home trial. If you return the dog within this time period, you will be refunded your adoption fee less the non-refundable deposit.\n\nPlease feel free to meet all the dogs and puppies outside of their kennels, just let the kennel attendants know that you would like a meet and greet with the dog outside of his pen. The dogs are much more relaxed when outside of their kennels. They would love to meet you!",

I am a little shy, but I do get comfortable quickly. While you're getting to know me, it wouldn't be a bad idea to keep me on leashed walks only. My foster says I am mostly housebroken, but I need a quick refresher course in a new home and might have a few accidents while I adjust. I would prefer to be the only pet in the home, but if you have another calm, mellow dog we can arrange for a meet-and-greet with them to see how I'll do.",

Leo's foster mom will post more once he arrives (if not already adopted), but here is what we know! Leo is a young male probably large breed puppy - guessing a Shar pro/ shepherd mix. He was born on/around 9/15/2020 - so he is just shy of 4-5 months old. As a young pup, Leo will need an active home with plenty of time with his humans and space for excercise, play and socializing. His approved adopter will need to have time, patience, financial resources and interest to care for, provide proper veterinary care and work on positive reinforcement training to teach him all he needs to know to be a perfect little gentleman: potty training, crate training, leash walking and general good dog manners.\nCARE's adoption fee is $250 for dogs/puppies and $100 for cats/kittens and an additional $150 neuter deposit will be required for any animals adopted prior to their spay/neuter surgery (and the deposit will be refunded when the approved adopter brings the animal to his/her CARE vet appointment in COLUMBUS, INDIANA once scheduled). All CARE animals arrive in their forever homes current on age appropriate vaccinations and preventatives, as well as microchipped and spay/neutered (or scheduled for the same). If you are interested in adopting or meeting a CARE animal, the FIRST STEP is to complete and submit an online adoption application through care.rescuegroups.org.\n\nCARE is an all-volunteer and foster-based rescue organization. We do not have a shelter facility and do not have any employees monitoring inbound applications and emails. Applications are reviewed by each animal's volunteer foster home. It may be several days before you hear from this animal's foster home.

I love adventures like meeting new people, playing with other dogs, and going on lots of neighborhood walks or hikes! I am crate trained, potty trained, and leash trained. I am very smart and I'm picking up tricks very quickly like sit, down, and paw - I'm eager to continue my training! My foster mom says I am very playful, but at the end of the day I love to cuddle on the couch with her and my canine foster brothers. She also says I'm always a happy pup! Do I sound like the perfect boy for you? If so, apply to adopt me at buffalocares.org\n\nAdoption Fee: $375 + $50 Training Deposit RR048\n\nAll dogs come fully up to date on shots, microchipped, heart worm tested, de-wormed, on flea and heart worm preventative, and spayed/neutered. If interested in learning more or adopting please fill out an application on our website at www.buffalocares.org.\n\nRegistration No.: RR048",

            "description": "Charlotte was a stray she is almost 80 pounds of love and affection. Charlotte seems to be a goo with the flow type of girl.  She walks well on a leash, but does not know any commands.  Charlotte does not jump up on you and love to curl up on her bed her.  She is around 4 years old.  Charlotte is looking for a relaxing life where she can chill and watch Netflix.  She loves getting affection and will stand and get any love she can.  She is gentle and easy going.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out an online application at  http://guernseysheriff.com/dog-shelter/  Completed adoption application does not guarantee adoption approval!! \n      Thank you for looking at dogs from the Guernsey County Dog Warden Dept. We are a county run facility in Cambridge, OH, We are NOT a no kill shelter! Unfortunately we must euthanize due to illness or aggression. Adoption fees are $125 for Guernsey County adopters and $160 for dogs adopted out of Guernsey County and Cell Dogs are $185. This includes spay/neuter, first shots, rabies, and microchip!  Most dogs will be required to be  spayed/ neutered before leaving shelter or a appointment will be scheduled before leaving the shelter.   Please talk to shelter staff for more information. \n     We only accept cash. We cannot take checks, debit or credit cards. You may also call the shelter between the hours of 9-5 Mon through Fri and 9-4 on Saturday, for more information and our fax number if you would like us to fax you an application.  You can also visit the shelter between the hours of 11-4 Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.  If coming from out of town, please call first to make sure the dog you are interested in is still available. Approved rescues also welcome!!!!",

First, dogs just want to be happy and feel loved. Living inside and being a part of the family is really important to us. A lot of the things you need as humans to stay happy and healthy, us dogs need too. We depend on you for things like vet visits, nutritious food, clean water, social and play time with people and other pets, training classes, toys, and of course, lots of love and attention! Regular baths, nail trims and grooming help us to look and feel our best, while monthly flea and heartworm prevention help us to stay healthy. Did you know that depending on our size and breed, dogs can live up to 20 years? Just think of the wonderful life we could have together!",

We are still getting to know Bronco since he came to us from another shelter, but from what we have seen so far this young fellow loves to play be it with toys or his people. Bronco is young and full of energy, plus he has size to go with that energy weighing in around 75 pounds. If you think you would like to potentially make Bronco a part of your family please email the Canine Department at jrein@carrollcountymd.gov to request an application for approval. Once we have approved applications received for him we will reach out to the approved adopter to set up a meet and greet. Bronco does still need to be neutered so he would go home as a foster to adopt until his neuter surgery. Bronco's adoption fee is $200.00 which will also cover his neuter surgery. Since Bronco came in to the other shelter as a stray it is unknown how he would do with children, cats or other dogs.",

Duke can be a little afraid of new things but he is really a brave boy underneath... he just needs you to show him that it's all okay. He's discovered that riding in the car is pretty awesome, and hiking is fun (as long as there are lots of water breaks!). Duke is also a toy connoisseur and while he prefers rope toys, a squeaky toy will do just fine! Oh, you'd like to play tug of war? Yes! And there are treats in your pocket? He's happy to sample them! Is it snuggle time already? He is happy to oblige! If you'd like to follow Duke's adventures, his Instagram handle is: https://instagram.com/adoptable_duke/ Duke has been living it up in foster and his absolute, without a doubt, #1 thing to do is play with his foster doggy sister! We know that it's important for Duke to have a doggy companion who likes to play as much as he does, and we also know he'd love a yard to run around in. Duke would likely be too much doggo for younger kiddos, but some active teenagers would be great for him! Duke is a member of the Orange Dot Crew (a volunteer advocacy group at Austin Animal Center) so he will go home with their support, as well as a crate, goody bag, and a free training voucher. Please reach out to his foster dad if you would like to learn more about Duke: aelonge11@gmail.com Click here to view my paperwork.",

They drove around looking for a ranch that I may have come from, but there was nothing. After two days they noticed I was lethargic and vomiting, and brought me to the Summit County shelter. I was brought to a local vet clinic, and my diagnosis was parvovirus. UGH! I may die! I took another truck ride to a hospital in Denver, and I stayed, under their care, until I was out of the woods. I came back up to the mountains, and have been living(INSIDE!), and leaning how to walk on leash, and pottying outside. I am approximately 6 months old, around 40 pounds, and fearful of the big wide world. I met another dog at my foster home and cowered and belly crawled. I am now not shedding the virus, and will be getting vetted on Thursday. Then I can find my perminant home. Call the shelter if you want to meet me in my foster home.",

            "description": "Meet Jackie!\nThis sweet lady has had a rough go since she was a small puppy. She originally  came from Texas and was a shy  little girl. She was with another rescue and they worked to find her the perfect home for almost a year. When they finally thought they  found it they noticed she started to limp on one of her back legs. They brought her to their vet and found out she had bad hip dysplasia and bilateral locating patellas (mobile knee caps). This caused extreme instabilility  and discomfort in her rear end. When they were given the quote for surgery they  simply could not swing it. They reached out to us for help and we transferred her to our rescue. They knew that she was super shy and would do best with them as the foster. We have done surgery to correct both knees. Her hips should be just fine know that her knees have been corrected but she will need to be on joint supplements long term. She also needs to remain on the thin side. She is now ready  for her forever home! Here is what her foster has to say about her and what they feel would be the best fit for this 30# beauty!\n\"She's still awfully timid in new places, or new places with new people, but she's done exceptional meeting strangers in our own home so I'm confident an understanding and somewhat patient family can earn her trust quickly. \nShe has a crazy amount of energy and she's very picky about pooping outside on a leash (another trait her mom and all siblings share too ?) so I personally would require a fenced yard. She's does great with cats and loves to play with them but occasionally needs reminding when she's in a cat's face who isn't into it. She's done well with every dog she's met and she pretty much needs a companion for her play time and energy lol. \nShe has destructive tendencies, especially when left alone, even if we go to another floor of the house without her for 15+ minutes. More space and time to get her energy out will likely help. She tolerates the crate and we prefer having her in a wire pen when we do leave and she does well there. \nShe definitely needs a family who is into having the dog on the bed because she is constantly up, moving, getting into trouble all night long, unless she's up on the bed, where she'll sleep like a baby typically at the foot of the bed all night.  She can't jump very high so we have to lift her into the car or on the bed but she can handle the couch. \nUltimately I think she'd do best with a family who is willing to earn her trust and lead her safely through her fears, are aware of her medical history and future, isn't out of the home for long hours (<8 hours a day for sure until she consistently potties outside), and have a fenced yard that will help with her house training, working off her belly, getting all her energy out, and destroying less. Having a current doggy that enjoys wrestling with other dogs would be a huge plus. \nOverall, Jackie is timid and has some behaviors to work on but she has a huge heart and is happiest when she's snuggling and licking her person. Oh yeah, adoptive family MUST love kisses, because she will shower you with them, even when you least expect it ?\nAdoption applications available at rpaw.org\nAdoption fee is $225",

The adoption fee includes the following: OH license good for this calendar year, DA2PP, Bordetella vaccine, Heartworm testing, dewormer, and spay/neuter.  Flea treatment will be provided if fleas are noticed.  All dogs will be spayed/neutered and microchipped before leaving the facility.  An e-collar may be purchased for $15.00.  Because most of our dogs were picked up as strays, we have no knowledge of any behavior or health issues.  Stray dogs are held for 72 hours so that the owners have a chance to redeem them. After that time they are vetted and placed up for adoption. We welcome and encourage the cross posting of our dog's pictures to increase adoptions.",

Chipotle is 1 year old and fully grown at 22 lbs. His breed mix is a mystery. He has a medium-length coat. Maybe some Brittany? Beagle? He's likely a mix of multiple breeds. Chipotle is a timid little guy who needs a patient adopter who will help build his confidence. He's house broken and crate trained, fine with other dogs and cats. He's best suited to a home with another friendly confident dog and a physically-fenced yard. He would be okay in a home with older kids but no small children because they make him nervous. Chipotle is not well suited to apartment living. If you'd like to meet Chipotle, please fill out a foster to adopt application at\ndreamhouserescue.org.\nGreater Cincinnati adopters only please. We will ONLY consider applications from adopters with another friendly dog and a physically fenced yard. No apartments.\n\nAll of our fully-vetted adoptable dogs go to prospective homes for a one-week trial foster-to-adopt period to make sure the dog and home are the right fit before an adoption is finalized. We only adopt dogs into homes where all current pets are spayed/neutered and current on vaccines and heartworm and flea and tick prevention. We do check veterinary references to make sure adopters are compliant with standard veterinary care.",

Sara is great with people and had no problem warming up to the shelter staff. She may need time to adjust in a new home and is FULLY HOUSE BROKEN! Sara DOES NOT LIKE DOGS OR CATS and we do not know how she would do with kids but we always offer trial adoptions! Sara weighs about 67 pounds and is HEARTWORM NEGATIVE as of 2-2-21.\n\nHer adoption fee is $61.50 and she can be microchipped for $8.25. Due to the outbreak of Covid-19 our adoption policies have changed. All adoptions are by appointment only. Call to set up an appointment to meet the animal. Dogs are $61.50 and puppies are $59 unless otherwise noted. All cats and kittens are $44 unless otherwise noted. Our system automatically updates petfinders every two hours.

He's favorite activity is going to the dog park and playing with the other dogs. Scooby is currently working with a trainer to work on his energy level. At the moment, he would do best in a house with older kids, 10+ . The adopter needs to have a fenced in backyard so scooby can run around and play. Scooby is not aggressive with other cats but does chase them, so no cats in his future home. Scooby gives nothing but kisses and love, but who will love him back?",

He can be timid at times and is scared of bigger dogs so would do good in a home with small dogs and/or cats. He's a very happy dog with so much love to give. He's crate trained and potty trained.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/2066450886955417/posts/2824853581115140/\nPlease visit our site at http://zoosrezcue.org for more information on how to adopt.

He can be a couch potato most of the day, but ready anytime for a run, walk or to play fetch with his beloved ball. Most people actually think he\u2019s still a young pup, despite being 6 years old. \n\nHis recent bloodwork was excellent and he recently had his teeth cleaned. Murphy is very healthy, up to date on vaccines and heartworm negative. He has been kept on Nexgard and Heartgard Plus each month. \n\nHe\u2019s okay to be alone, uncrated in the house, while someone is out or at work. He\u2019s completely house-trained, doesn\u2019t ever touch any possessions in the home\n and has never been destructive. He won\u2019t even touch food left on the counter. He's the perfect gentleman in the home! \nMurphy knows his commands and will sit and stay when guests arrive at the door and will even sit and stay while given his meals. \n\nMurphy has a submissive personality around other dogs but he is also good as an only pet. All told, he could easily win the \"best all round\" category \nin the world of dog superlatives. He's a wonderful family pet!  If you are interested in learning more about Murphy, please email  adoptsch@gmail.com. \n",

            "description": "Please meet Sheeba!  This pretty Border Collie mix pup was surrendered by her owner after she began chasing their chickens\u2026.just couldn\u2019t help the herding instinct.  Sheeba is now happily living in foster care (where there are no chickens\u2026lol) and receiving lots of TLC while waiting for a place to hang her leash forever.\n\nSheeba is 6 months and weighs in a 46 pounds.  Her mix is a best guess, but considering her size at this age there\u2019s likely a larger breed in her DNA.  Typical of border collies, she is an energetic, smart girl and will do best in an active home where she\u2019ll get plenty of regular exercise and stimulation.  She is house trained and crate trained.  Also enjoys going for rides and is very well behaved in the car.\n \nThis lovable, happy  girl gets along great with other dogs.  She doesn\u2019t seem to know what to think about cats.  She might do okay with a dog-savvy kitty; however, with that herding instinct, she\u2019d probably chase a cat that runs.  There are no children in her foster home but she\u2019s a very affectionate pup who loves her humans so we think she would love to be part of a family with kids 8 or over.  Though she would not intentionally harm anyone, playful, energetic pups can accidently knock little ones down.\n\nSheeba has been spayed and is up to date on vaccines.  She\u2019s also micro-chipped and on monthly flea/tick and heart worm preventative.  Her doggy bag is packed and she\u2019s all set to head for her forever home.  If you have the time to devote to an energetic playful pup like Sheeba, please email Chris at rescue3@earthlink.net for an application.  Her adoption fee is $400. \n\nLike us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/pawsclawsnewengland\nFollow/tag us on Instagram: @pawsclawsne or #pawsclawsne \n",

            "description": "Teddy is a sweet lovable terrier with a big heart! He loves his canine friends and shows some interest in cats. His favorite pastime is playing with toys, wrestling with his foster siblings and taking other dogs for walks (no really, he walks them). Teddy is a young man at only 12 weeks. He is a bit mouthy and would do best in a home with kids age 8+. He knows sit and to go potty outside, uses pee pads for accidents, and sleeps through the night in his kennel. Teddy does like to be adventurous and stick his nose into things. He needs a home that is clutter free and can provide lots of dog toys. He is eager to learn and even more to please. Teddy is in foster in Englewood and his adoption fee is $500. Req: Kids 8+ Time and commitment to train a puppy.  You can apply for Teddy at https://milehighcanine.org/forms-and-applications/mhcr-adoption-application/.",

She enjoys cuddling and snuggling in a warm blanket.  We think shelby is around 5 years old.  She has not had much to say about being her.  It is definitely stressful for her and she has not been eating very well.  Shelby is looking for love and companionship.  \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out an online application at  http://guernseysheriff.com/dog-shelter/  Completed adoption application does not guarantee adoption approval!! \n      Thank you for looking at dogs from the Guernsey County Dog Warden Dept. We are a county run facility in Cambridge, OH, We are NOT a no kill shelter! Unfortunately we must euthanize due to illness or aggression. Adoption fees are $125 for Guernsey County adopters and $160 for dogs adopted out of Guernsey County and Cell Dogs are $185. This includes spay/neuter, first shots, rabies, and microchip!  Most dogs will be required to be  spayed/ neutered before leaving shelter or a appointment will be scheduled before leaving the shelter.   Please talk to shelter staff for more information. \n     We only accept cash. We cannot take checks, debit or credit cards. You may also call the shelter between the hours of 9-5 Mon through Fri and 9-4 on Saturday, for more information and our fax number if you would like us to fax you an application.  You can also visit the shelter between the hours of 11-4 Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.  If coming from out of town, please call first to make sure the dog you are interested in is still available. Approved rescues also welcome!!!!",

Ollie can be a shy guy who needs time to warm up to new people, but is so sweet once he does get comfortable with you. Ollie does well with other dogs, cats and children. He does need a home with structure as he can sometimes get overprotective of his people, and needs reassurance that everything is fine and that he does not need to always be the protector. \n\nWhile the shelter is currently closed due to COVID-19, we are setting appointments for adoptions. Please call 812-376-2505 or email animalcareservices@columbus.in.gov.\n",

This sweet girl was brought in by her family who could no longer care for her.  Missy loves doing zoomies in the backyard while throwing her toys in the air.   She enjoys having doggie friends to run around with.  Missy will need a family or couple who will take her on hikes or do outdoor activities with her.  She would do well with a fenced yard.  Missy does great with kids and dogs.  She would love to also meet her new family when she arrives up north this weekend.  She might not know exactly what snow is all about, but she is ready to learn about it and pounce around in it.  Let's give Missy her forever home she deserves.  She has lots of love to give!!!!\n\nIf interested in Missy, please email to inquire at: SCREENING.FETCHINGHEARTS@GMAIL.COM OR COPY LINK BELOW TO APPLY AND FILL OUT AN APPLICATION: https://www.fetchingheartsrescue.org/adoption-form-online\nto fill out an application.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, all dogs adopted through Fetching Hearts have received the following before being available for adoption:\n\nThorough veterinary examination.\n\nAll routine annual vaccinations, including Rabies, DHLPP, Bordatella (Kennel Cough), Heartworm Test, Fecal Test, Deworming, Microchip, Flea and Tick Prevention and Heartworm Prevention.\n\nSpay/Neuter.\nAll dogs are quarantined for two weeks outside of the shelter (puppies four weeks) to ensure they don't break with disease.\n\nVETTING NOTE: Fetching Hearts Rescue completely vets our dogs thoroughly to the best of our knowledge based on communication with our Southern Vets.

Since we currently can't meet you in person, if you are interested in meeting this pet, please email information about yourself, family, residence and current/prior pet experience. If it is a good fit you will be emailed an application. Once that is approved, arrangements will be made for a meeting. Thanks for your understanding!\n\nWatson is an approximately 12 week old male Jack Russell (?) Mix who we believe will stay under 25 lbs as an adult. Watson has a short naturally docked tail. Unfortunately we don't know either parent so we can't say for sure what breed mix they are and ultimately what size they will be but this is our best guess. Watson and his littermates were rescued from a Kentucky shelter when their time was up. His adoption fee is $399 and includes his neuter, vaccinations, microchip and routine labwork. Please email us to start the adoption process.\n\nFor puppies 6 months and younger you must live within 50 miles of Oswego, IL.\n\nEmail inquires can be directed to availablepets@gmail.com\nAdoption donations for adult dogs range from $59 to $299 and puppies from $159 to $599. This includes: \n-  Spay or neuter surgery\nVaccines current to the date of adoption*: \n  -  Rabies vaccine\n  -  Bordatella vaccine\n  -  Booster for canine Distemper, Adenovirus type 1 & 2, Leptospirosis,\n      Parainfluenza, Parvovirus, and Coronavirus (DHLPPC)\n  - Canine Influenza vaccine\n-  Fecal test\n-  1st worming \n-  Heartworm test (+6 months old) \n-  Capstar flea treatment\n-  Microchip identification implant\n* Boosters required for puppies and kittens (depending on age) POST adoption are the responsibility of the pet owner.\n \nHeartworm prevention must also be purchased at the time of adoption and prices vary depending on the size of the animal being adopted.  Puppies under 6 months old are required to sign up for a puppy obedience class. ($89 deposit required, refundable upon completion)\n\nCome Ready to Adopt: \nIf you rent or live in a condo/townhouse with an association, bring your lease/bylaws indicating pets are allowed and if there are any restrictions. We require vaccinations and tests to be up to date for the protection of your current pets. Bringing their vet records can help speed the adoption process. All adults in the household must be present and co-sign the application.",

            "description": "*Please research Cushing's Disease prior to applying for Heidi. She has a life long medical condition that requires daily medication.* \n\nMy name is Heidi and I have a story to tell. A little over a year ago I was found in a home with another dog, abandoned by our family. Luckily, we were rescued shortly after and made our way to a rescue group. I was then brought to Wisconsin and placed in an adoptive home. Unfortunately, it wasn't the best match and I was surrendered to the Neenah Animal Shelter. \nIt's difficult to see in the photo, but I am almost entirely bald with a few hair scruffs on my head and back. This is also my first time exploring the outdoors in almost 7 months since I was puppy pad trained in my previous home. The shelter feels I'm too big to potty inside, so they make me go outside. I will need help with potty training and frequent bathroom breaks (every couple of hours).\n\nI went to the vet for a check up because NAS knew that my lack of hair was a sign of medical concern. Well, after an 8 hour testing process I was diagnosed with Cushing's Disease. I won't bore you with all the medical details, but basically my pituitary or adrenal gland are not working correctly which is causing an overproduction of cortisol in my body. This causes hair loss, bloating, and increased thirst/hunger, and a few other things.\n\nWhat does this mean for me? I will be on a medication called Vetoryl for life and will need to maintain a close relationship with my veterinarian as blood work rechecks will be needed regularly to monitor the disease. Aside from that, I will live a happy normal life. \n\nNow, more about me and not my disease. To put it simply, I am a 20 pound potato that must sit on your lap at ALL TIMES! I am not exaggerating when I say that I will be glued to your hip. I am happiest when my people are home with me, but I can survive for a few hours on my own. I only bark when I know someone is nearby and not paying attention to me. I get along well with cats and other small dogs (haven't met too many larger ones). I haven't been around children much, but as long as they have a lap to sit on I'm sure we'll get along. I will admit that keeping my Cushing's in check can be expensive because of the medication and frequent vet visits, but I promise I am worth every penny. \n\nPlease note:\n- Our website (www.neenahanimalshelter.org) is updated in real time, so we are accepting applications for all animals that are currently listed.\n-Applications can be downloaded from our website. (http://neenahanimalshelter.org/how-to-adopt.html)\n- Our shelter no longer has open visiting hours, so a pre-approved application and scheduled appointment is needed prior to meeting any of our animals.",

Snow came to us when her previous owner was not able to take care of her, so she found her way to us so that we can set her up with her forever family! Snow has lived with cats and is said to be very friendly and playful with other dogs. She is so incredibly smart, and even though she is just a pup, she already knows most basic commands. Snow needs someone who is going to be able to handle her energy and provide her with an active lifestyle so she does not get bored. In her previous home she did have a tendency to be destructive when left alone. However, with the proper attention and mental stimulation, she is well prepared to be your best friend ! Snow is nervous around new people and we do not know if she has lived with children, we are recommending she go home to children 10 and up as well as no apartments so she can roam around and get some of her energy out! If you are interested in this sweet girl, please contact a kennel technician.",

He is a snuggly guy and has wonderful companion manners. He would enjoy a large living space with space to romp around roll about. He may do well with another canine friend and whilst appropriate with cats, will be very forward and may need some feline correction! \n\nLeonard is currently hanging out at the shelter while waiting for a foster home. See instructions below on how to send in an application to come meet him.\n\nTo meet Leonard, send an application (found here) http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/AnimalShelter/Dog%20Adoption%20Questionnaire_Fillable.pdf to animalcare@seattle.gov - thanks!",
