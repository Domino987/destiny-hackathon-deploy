Cannoli is a wonderful middle aged boy who is still up for walks and adventures, but is calm enough to enjoy a relaxing day at home with his family too. Cannoli gets along well with other dogs and wouldn't mind a social, friendly dog in his new home. But more than anything Cannoli loves affection and treats! \n\nCannoli is very treat motivated and is eager to learn some new tricks with positive reinforcement training. He would love a family that will help him learn a few new skills and take him on plenty of walks.",

            "description": "Marius\nBreed: Catahoula Mix \nAge: 2-3 years +/- Neutered Male\nWeight: 58 pounds\nDogs: Would be best as only dog\nCats: No\nKids: 12+\nCrate Trained: Yes\nHouse Trained: Yes\nLocation: Pennsylvania \n\nHi, I'm Marius. First thing you should know is I love being outside. The entire world is fascinating, and I want to sniff every corner of it. I love hiking and going for long walks in new places. When I see something I like, I am VERY determined to get there, though I'm working on having more self-control.\n\nAt the moment, I don't mind walking on a gentle leader, only occasionally giving a tug to smell something. This skill hasn't quite transferred over to a flat collar yet. True to breed, moving objects get all of my attention when I'm outside. I am reactive to bikes, skateboards, squirrels, really any fast moving objects, and, while I'm working on it, I would need someone to help continue to show me a better way to handle myself.\n\nInside, I am a completely different dog. I can be relatively content laying on the couch, or at your feet, as long as you're nearby. Sometimes I'm quite snuggly, putting my head in your lap as we lay on the couch, but other times I can be aloof. Occasionally when I'm in the mood, I enjoy chasing squeaky balls around the house. I also like using my nose indoors. I play \"find it\" for treats, and I would enjoy doing nosework as a way to pass time. I'm pretty smart and can learn tricks quickly if you give me food that I REALLY like, however I get frustrated and bored if I'm unsure what you want me to do. I am housebroken and know my basic obedience commands (Sit, Down, Stay/\"Wait\", Come) however they could be proofed a bit more, as I forget some of them when I'm excited. I will sleep in my crate and consider it to be a comfy place, as long as the door is open. With a little coaxing, I'm sure I could learn to adjust to having the door closed for longer periods. The biggest thing is I need help learning that it's okay to be alone sometimes. I need someone to show me how to be calm and have fun on my own when I can't be with my human.\n\nWhen it comes to others, I would probably do best as an only dog for now. I am reactive on leash to other dogs. Although I've been working on controlling my reactions, I need someone to continuously and consistently show me the best way to behave. While I haven't been tested with cats, it might be best to avoid them, as my prey drive is pretty strong. I could probably do okay with teenaged children, however small children are just too active for me. Other humans, I'm relatively neutral towards on first meeting, however when I find someone I like, I get excited to see them!\n\nI'm looking for an experienced and dedicated owner who will help me to become the best version of myself that I can! It would be best if this person also had some land or a large yard I could burn my energy off in without being exposed to some of my triggers!\n\nIf you are interested in fostering Marius, please email sln2310@yahoo.com and request an application. Once your application has been received and reviewed, you will be contacted via email or phone by one of our volunteers.\nIf you are interested in adopting Marius, please email sln2310@yahoo.com and request an application. Once your application has been received and reviewed, you will be contacted via email or phone by one of our volunteers. After your application is approved, the foster parent for the dog you have selected will contact you to answer any questions you may have and determine if that dog is a good match for your family. \n\nIf you have no particular dog in mind, we will be happy to keep your application on file and notify you if the right dog should come into rescue. Catahoula Rescue of New England is an all-volunteer group. Dogs in our program are fostered by volunteers. The foster homes care for our dogs as if they were their own. All dogs have received vaccinations appropriate to age and are spayed or neutered. \n\nMarius\u2019 adoption donation is $350 which includes Rabies, DHLPP, Bordetella, fecal test, heartworm test when appropriate and is on preventative, microchip, and neuter. We do not have a physical shelter, all of our dogs are fostered in individual foster homes across the New England and Canada.\n",

He was being used as a sheepdog but sometimes has a tendency to chase the sheep, so that is probably not the life for him. Curly has been around children and has a sweet temperament but he is really shy because he is accustomed to a ranch lifestyle and being around people he knows. \n\nCurly would love to have a home this winter where he can become a beloved pet. He will need some time to get used to the easy life but he is such a wonderful boy and very friendly. Curly is good with other dogs. He will make a wonderful running or hiking buddy. Will you give him a happy New Year? \n\nCurrently fostered in lewis colorado\n\nPlease go to www.denkaisanctuary.org/adopt to fill out adoption application.",

He has beautiful markings and the cutest white-tipped tail. He is very chill and loves to shadow his humans. He is content in just about any quiet area. The kitchen is a favorite hang out while his humans cook/bake. Morning is his active time with zoomies galore. He is a gentleman inside and out; house and crate trained yet mature enough to roam the house. He would love a home with another dog to help show him the ropes. \n\nIf you are looking for the perfect companion Boston is your guy. Please inquire about Boston today!!",

He is a sweet and gentle boy who loves to cuddle and please you.\n\nHe is housebroken and knows a few commands already -he is a fast learner. He enjoys going for walks, running in the yard, and playing with his foster dog-sister. He is soft and gentle and wants to sit right on your feet! He gets nervous when he can't see his people and doesn't like to be left in a crate. Tomas is NOT suited to apartment/condo living. Tomas\nis neutered, up to date on vaccinations and microchipped.\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $350 which includes routine vetting and spay/neuter.\n\n***Please note that our first step is submitting an application (it does not commit you in any way but allows us to discuss with you if you and the dog are a good fit). In addition, an important step in approving adoption applicants is to complete a vet check. Vetting of current and past pets is very important to us, thus we will be speaking with the vet(s) listed on your application to ensure that your current and previous pet(s) are kept up to date on vaccines (including rabies), spayed or neutered, maintained on appropriate monthly preventatives and examined annually by your vet.***\n\n**If you're viewing this on Petfinder, please visit www.lovepawspg.org to complete our non-binding application.**",

He is rather new to the rescue so right now he is learning to not be scared. Right now he isn't crazy about being picked up but when he does come to you he really likes to snuggle and get lots of belly rubs. Brewster has found out he really really likes toys and will pile them all up just so he can lay on them. Sorry people, this rescue does not adopt outside of Michigan. If you are interested in BREWSTER you MUST completely fill out a adoption application. Any application not filled out in full will not even be considered for adoption. This rescue is ran by volunteers and it takes us time to get to the applications so please be patient with us. PLEASE NO PHONE CALLS OR TEXTS.\nAPPLY TO ADOPT BREWSTER AT\nWWW.MARYTSCHIS.COM",

            "description": "First, you'll be drawn in by Orion's looks. We can't resist his smokey eyeliner, auburn coat, and extra wrinkles. Once you get over how ridiculously good looking he is, you'll be wowed by his quiet, sweet demeanor. Orion knows basic commands and takes treats oh so gently from your fingers. He has very little interest in toys and prefers being right next to you and leaning in for love. He requires some time to adjust to new environments so he will need a family who will be patient with him. Orion needs continued work on his dog skills so would do best as your only dog so that he can soak up all the attention for himself. Orion completed a 6-week board and train with the Paws for Life prison program! This amazing program helps LA City homeless dogs by giving them all the basic training, socialization, and the structure they need to be successful. Orion will also be eligible for post-adoption training support through the Paws for Life program after they complete the program. You can learn more about the program here: https://pawsforlifek9.org/paws-for-life-prison-program/?fbclid=IwAR0gadA6_QY0KAN0GGAJB9kHtkZUlKjarFuj6BTikUjEjh0YliY18vE89N0If you are interested in meeting this dog, go to la.bestfriends.org/adopt, fill out our Dog Adoption Survey and our team will reach out to you!",

An older guy like me just needs someone who will love me forever and ever. But don't worry; I've been told I don't act my age. I'm still young at heart! Take me home already! I currently weigh ~51 lbs. but I need to gain some weight to look and feel my best. *I recently completed treatment for heartworm disease - please speak with an adoption specialist for details.* Cats/Dogs/Children? Unknown. Housetrained? Working on it. Training needs? I know sit, but want to learn more with you! Energy level? Medium. How did I get here? Came in as a stray to Scotland County Animal Shelter. Something extra? My portrait was created by an animal advocate who believes that I'll make a great pet! ~My adoption fee is $95.00.~",

I am a 2-year-old shepherd from down south. They ran out of space for me down there, so I'm looking for a fresh start up north. I am a nervous guy, so I'm yearning for a patient, quiet home. I was not socialized well, so I'm dreaming of a family that will be active, and work on my confidence. I love food, so training should be pretty simple, and would be a great bonding activity. I do not like other animals, and would do best in a home with teenagers or in an adult-only home. I would also do well with lots of exercise to help keep me busy, and to help me see that the world isn't a scary place.",

What a cute guy, happy, energetic and good with other dogs. We think that he is either a Heeler or Border Collie mix. A home with a safe fenced yard, maybe a dog girlfriend and an active owner.\n\nCharlie Brown's adoption fee of $350.00 includes a vet exam, current vaccinations fecal tests, wormer, neuter, and microchip. Sadly, his heart worm test is positive but, after a month of antibiotics, he will get treated.\n\nIf you live in the Austin area and are interested in adopting, please go to www.ForgottenFriendsTX.org and fill out an application. \n\nPlease be aware that we rarely have information on our dogs being good with cats as most of our foster homes don't have them. \n\nAdoption decisions are based on the best overall match and not done on a first-come-first-serve basis.",

If you wish to fill out an application for other dogs that may come into rescue please feel free to do so.\n\n\n\nSweet Izzy is a four year old Frenchie mix (we do not know what she is mixed with). She is a small girl at less than 15lbs. As you can see from her picture she currently has some skin issues. Unfortunately her prior owner, who has passed away, didn't keep her on flea/tick meds and she ended up with fleas and lost all her fur as a result. We are currently working with the veterinarian on getting her all fixed up. She is on some skin meds and is getting medicated baths.\n\nIzzy came from a home with another dog and a cat and she currently is in a foster home with several other dogs so she is fine with both. We have been working on her housebreaking and if you take her out she will go outside but if you depend on her to go out on her own she will sometimes go in the house. We are working on it and know she is catching on!\n\nIzzy is heartworm negative and current on vaccines. She will be spayed and microchipped prior to adoption but the vet wants to wait until we work on her skin.\n\nAlthough Izzy is not currently available for adoption we feel she will be very soon so please feel free to fill out an application for her at www.pawsitivelypugs.org.\n\n",

ADOPTED! ADOPTED! ADOPTED! ADOPTED! ADOPTED! ADOPTED! ALL OF MY PICTURES ARE AVAILABLE BELOW! MY ORIGINAL INTAKE INFORMATION: Hi Everyone! My name is Harley, and I just arrived at CSAC from a shelter. My former owner wanted me to find a new home. I love people and lived with kids. I am house trained. I do not like other dogs. I had 2 doggie brothers, and we did not get along so I want to be the only king in my castle. Right now, I am in the caring hands of one of the great Vets that work with the CSAC. They are checking me out and making sure I am healthy. Hopefully, I will find my new family that will turn me into a happy, cherished pet. For more information about this dog, email our Adoption Coordinator. Our adoption process starts with an application. If you are interested in adopting this pup, please click the Adopt menu at the top of the screen, read about our process, and click the application link. The medical and custodial care of the many Cockers in our care is tremendous. More and more dogs are abandoned with urgent and serious medical issues. We are committed to providing the best possible care for these forgotten friends. Unfortunately, the mounting high costs are beginning to limit the number of dogs we are able to take into our program. Even if you cannot adopt or foster one of our current adoptable dogs, please consider making a donation. The Cocker Spaniel Adoption Center is a 501(c)(3) non-profit charitable organization, and your donations are entirely tax deductible. If you can help, please donate.

Right now, I am in the caring hands of one of the great Vets that work with the CSAC. They are checking me out and making sure I am healthy.

Astra came back to us due to no fault of her own, her owner was overwhelmed and Huskies in general are a bit high maintenance, they require lots of regular exercise, a good amount of training and patience and some grooming and if not provided with that, they will find themselves in trouble. Astra is\u00a0 no exception, she is smart and energetic, LOVES people and attention, and LOVES to run and play. She is quite affectionate, and gets along well with other dogs, cats are unknown. She'll probably do best with older kids as she will likely knock little kids over in her exuberance.\n\nAstra is looking for a dog experienced home, preferably with Husky experience as she requires lots of exercise, some training, a good amount of patience and very solid fencing, as well as secure indoor containment, if left unsupervised. She will repay you with lots of snuggles and kisses and the privilege to walk around town with one of the prettiest Huskies out and about!\n\n***Please note: All dogs are fostered in private homes of volunteers, so to meet a dog please fill out an Adoption Application on our website (http://www.twyla.org/adopt/our-adoption-process) so we may setup a private meetup with the dog or coordinate for an Introduction at the next general Adoption Meet  and Greet (as listed on our website: (http://www.twyla.org/upcoming-events), as not all dogs attend all Meet and Greets***",

            "description": "Looks like: Husky mix\nFemale, 13 years old, 41 pounds\n\nChubbs is a regal and gorgeous Husky who has fallen on hard times and is now sadly in a state of neglect. She's very emaciated and is ready for your TLC to help her gain some weight and get into better condition! \n\nDespite being in rough shape, she greets people with a gentle kiss and a hello. She has a gentle spirit and comfort around other dogs and with people. She walks nicely on leash but does get eager to meet other dogs, pulling with a desire to sniff. Chubbs is good with children and is happy to receive pets from them. After a safe and proper introduction, Chubbs is sharing space and is very respectful toward the cat in her foster home. If Chubbs sees a cat outside or on a walk, she will want to lunge and vocally inform you that there is one there. \n\nWhen she hears sirens on the tv she will do a cute Husky howl. She likes to have her head out the window in the car. She does follow her people around as she just wants to be included. She will come up and put her head in your lap when she wants cuddles and pets. She loves to be included on the couch or to hang by your chair to receive as much love as you can give. \n\nChubbs has a sweet disposition and she'd appreciate being in a home with another dog because it will make her feel more at home. She'd also do well in a home where she can get tons of attention. A mellow home is best, where she gets walks but will having plenty of nap time while her person works. \n\nChubbs was seized from a bad living situation by Hitchcock Road Animal Services. They asked POMDR to take her and help her find the life she deserves.",

She would do best in a family that is highly active, as she loves to keep busy! She loves to play with any toy that is offered to her. Her adoption fee of $125 includes her spay, vaccinations, treatment for intestinal parasites, various other treatments, a heartworm test, and a microchip.

I was happy in my home with my mom and then the unthinkable happened, she passed away due to something called covid.  I don\u2019t know what that is.  All I know is that my world was turned upside down!  I went to live with a lady that was a coworker of my moms and she kept me for a couple weeks while working to get me into rescue.  She really liked me and wanted to keep me but she lived in an apartment and she was already at their pet limit so she couldn\u2019t.\n\nA little about myself.  Like I said, I am 15 years old.  When I got to rescue they checked me over and said that I needed a dental.  I had bloodwork and the vet said I was good to go to have my teeth cleaned.  I came home from my dental with just 3 teeth!!  Yup, I had a mouth full of rotten teeth but it has all been taken care of and my lack of teeth has not stopped me from eating dry kibble (though I would love canned ?).  I cannot actually hear you but I can see just a little, maybe a foot, so I get around well.  I am currently in a foster home with other dogs and I am ok with that.  I just tell them what I think when they bump into me!  Yes, I can be feisty!\n\nWhat am I looking for in a forever home?  My requests aren\u2019t much.  I would love a home where I am an only dog or one that I am one of only two or three dogs.  I am old and I like to chill and relax without others bothering me.  If you would give me a comfortable bed in a quiet place that would be my dream!  See, not a lot, just a quiet house and a comfy bed!\n\nDo you think you can give me a wonderful home to spend my golden years?  If so, please fill out an application at www.pawsitivelypugs.org and ask for me!\n\n",

ALL of our dogs reside in foster homes in the greater Pittsburgh, PA area. \n\nWe are a 100% volunteer organization. Please respect our volunteers' time. If a dog is listed on PetFinder, he/she IS available for adoption. We cannot reply to messages, phone calls, and emails about a dog until we have received, reviewed, and approved an adoption application. \n\nOur ADOPTION application is found at www.seniorhearts.org Completing this application is the first step in our adoption screening process. You MUST complete the application in its entirety in order to be considered as a potential adopter.  Please select \"More About Us\" for further details on our adoption requirements.  You can meet a dog ONLY after we have completed our adoption approval process.\n\nIf you are looking at the dog below, it most certainly means the dog is available for adoption. We look forward to receiving your application in hopes that you are able to meet our adoption requirements and provide this dog with a loving furever home.\n\nA message from Flash...\n\nMy name is Flash and I am an 11-year young big boy weighing in at 70 pounds.  Can you imagine?  70 pounds of all love!  I am blind in one eye and can't see very well out of the other one, but that doesn't stop me from my walks and greeting everyone I walk by.  I am super friendly and love all animals and humans I encounter. I would love a sibling but it's not a deal-breaker.  \n\nMy ideal home would be ranch style living. I can\u2019t really do steps.  I prefer a calm adult only home environment. After all, I am an elderly guy. \n\nIf you are looking for a snug bug best friend who is happy all the time, I am your guy.  I promise all the unconditional love you want. I can be adopted within a two-hour radius of Pittsburgh, PA. If you are interested in giving me a furever home, you must first complete the adoption application at www.seniorhearts.org\n",

            "description": "We are so pleased to finally introduce you to an exceptionally special girl named NIYA! This 2 yr-old, 38lb, mystery of a mixed breed has the sweetest one-of-a-kind personality and is seeking the pawfect owner to help nurture her brave, confident and best self! \n\nBACKGROUND:\nThis cutie has come so FAR from when we first rescued her! Saved from an awful animal hoarding situation, \u201cskinny girl\u201d as she was called had spent most of her life locked up in a bedroom with no socialization or training! Incredibly scared and frightened (and very pregnant!), Niya was moved to an amazing foster home! \n\nWithin a month, this sweet girl gave birth to 10 beautiful puppies! Although this was a scary experience for Niya (who ran away from the first few pups!), she received excellent guidance from her foster mom and turned into the most amazing mama dog!  \n\nPERSONALITY:\nNiya is a sweetheart, but can get nervous around new people and scare easily out of her comfort zone. She has NEVER been aggressive (is the happiest dog in her foster home!) and is extremely fond of dogs and toys! We\u2019re not sure about cats as she loves to chase little furry things (and may need some guidance meeting a cat!). She\u2019s a complete snuggle bug and likes to sneak into her foster\u2019s bed occasionally, but prefers her spot on the couch! She enjoys watching TV, especially if there\u2019s animal and will sometimes try to find the featured dog or cat behind the TV! She may bark at her reflection and likes to nudge you with her nose or paw to be petted if you aren\u2019t giving her enough attention! \n\nBEHAVIOR:\nNiya LOVES other dogs and is feeling more and more confident about humans! She has also learned to like children, but may do better in a home with older children (or children who have been taught how to respect their pets). She is completely house-trained + crate-trained, knows how to use the doggy door like a PRO and loves to feel LOVED and give out just as much LOVE!  \n\nThe PAWFECT owner:\n1) Niya would greatly benefit from an owner who had the patience to continue her healing journey. This someone would help ease her into new surroundings, learn how to be exposed to new experiences in baby steps and how to feel confident in the outside world (and earn back those years inside that single bedroom!). \n\n2) Niya loves to please and has a willingness to learn \u2013 however \u2013 she isn\u2019t fond of the leash! We are not sure if this is due to past experiences, but she becomes quite scared at seeing it. Additional training to associate the leash with something \u201cpositive\u201d may need to be administered! (tips- high value treats + gradual conditioning)\n\n3) The ideal house would need a fenced-in-yard.\n\n4) Niya is spayed, up-to-date on shots and microchipped!\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information or are interested in this precious girl, please text 4-6 photo's of your interior/exterior home and yard (including fence if applicable) to Heather at 770-714-4352.\n\n- - -\n\nPlease Note: Inquiries through Pet Finder may be slower to respond and the best form of communication/inquiry would be through text message at the number above. Thank you.\n\nSearch for \"A PAW AND A PRAYER DOG RESCUE\" on Facebook to see ALL our available dogs for adoption updated daily!\n",

I like pets and I like loving and I like Puggles and I like other dogs. I like making friends and eating snacks. I especially like soft baked things 'cause I am missing just a few of my teeth.\n\nIn addition to all of that, I'm house-trained. I walk on a leash. I'm good with pets. My foster mom says I'm super sweet and a really easy house guest. And I'm smart, silly , cuddly and well behaved. I'm 12 years old so I know a lot and can probably teach you some things! At 12 pounds I am the perfect size for a cookie and a cuddle.\n\nSo if you're looking for an easy going guy to share your time with, you should consider adopting me!\n\nTo adopt Cornelius, apply at www.pawsinthecity.org\n\nFor adoption information or to complete an application, please go to: http://www.pawsinthecity.org/adopt.htm\n\nReferences and a home visit are required for all adoptions.",

            "description": "**Justice will be available for adoption approximately Feb 1st following heartworm treatment**\nHi I'm Justice. I'm a good boy who enjoys hanging out next to my people. BIG comfy dog beds are my favorite! I also enjoy  going on long walks and exploring all the different sights and smells. I'm good on a leash and will go wherever you want us to go. I\u2019m fully potty trained and will stand by the door to let you know when I need to go out. I love cuddling up on the couch but just so you know I\u2019m a total couch hog. I like everyone but kids over 10 would be best for me, my tail is pretty lethal as I just get so happy around everyone. I don't jump and I love to give kisses and get lots of scratches. I'm just a big ole love bug! I smile at everyone I meet. I would love to meet you. \n\nJustice came from rural southern Oklahoma where he was found as a stray and never reclaimed. The only way he would make it out of the shelter alive was to be rescued as they do not have any volunteer or adoption programs in their rural animal control facility. Dolly's Legacy came to his rescue and saved his life. Justice is a male Yellow Lab who weighs 70 lbs and was born approximately 11-1-17. He is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, given flea/tick preventative, dewormed. Justice had life-saving treatment for heartworm disease. He will need to remain on heartworm preventative for life, as is recommended for ALL dogs, and retested in 6 months to ensure he is heartworm free. Adoption fee is $450 to help offset the many expenses we have for vetting costs. We rely strictly on adoption fees and donations to continue to save the lives of orphaned & abandoned pets; 100% goes towards their care. If interested in adopting one of our available dogs or puppies, please complete an online adoption application at https://dollyslegacyanimalrescue.org/adopt/\u00a0You will be contacted by our adoption coordinator via email after your application has been reviewed & approved to schedule an appointment.",

He warms up to new dogs easily but he doesn\u2019t seem to be as comfortable around cats. He desperately needs a home, if I could take this sweet boy I would! Come meet Bear!! \n\nAll dogs come with a microchip, annual vaccinations including EBR rabies license and tag, dewormer, vet exam and spay/neuter.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Meet Joey! He's so gorgeous! He's the full Pyr package - a big ol' white lovable giant. Born around December 2016, he is a healthy 90 pounds.\n\nJoey is so charming! He is sweet, friendly, playful, goofy, and a huge fluffball! Not to mention he is smart and a fast learner.\n\nEven after being found as a stray, Joey has always shown himself to be a happy, loving boy. He loves all people and happily will receive hugs from everyone. He loves getting scratches, playing with toys, running in the yard, and playing catch, but (true to his Pyr heritage) he doesn't always bring the ball back! Joey is still learning that not everything is a toy, but he is eager to please and is quickly learning.\n\nHis fondest wish is for a human to be home most of the time. He loves companionship, and will follow you around the house and often takes his nap at your feet.\n\nHe can be too big and playful for young children. If there are kids in his forever home, they need to be older and big enough that they won't get knocked down by him.\n\nJoey will try singing with you sometimes by howling or mumbling along and has been known to talk back to you when he's super excited. He will bark at suspicious noises and squirrels in the backyard, but he isn't on guard while inside and is quiet.\n\nJoey would be happiest in a home with another big doggie playmate. He loves playing with dogs, following them around, sleeping next to them, cuddling with them, and being in close contact.\n\nHe has also been cat tested and did well.\n\nHe is leash trained, and he loves going on daily walks! He relishes meeting new people and new dogs and greeting them all! He loves to smell everything, so often needs coaxing to keep moving his booty forward!\n\nJoey is house trained and crate trained. He sits at the back door to let you know he needs to go outside to potty.\n\nHe has been fine with the 4' fence at his foster home. Sometimes he needs encouragement to come inside at night from his dirt bed.\n\nHe rides contentedly in a car; occasionally he needs a little sweet-talk before he'll get into it.\n\nThis beautiful boy will delight his forever family!\n\nSPIN Pyrs are all in foster homes in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Potential adopters are asked to make travel arrangements if they live elsewhere. All SPIN dogs are spayed or neutered, current on vaccinations and on heartworm prevention. Please go to our website www.SpinRescue.org and fill out an application for this great Great Pyrenees!",

I want to be the one that beats a pathway to your heart via the milky way!\nHere is what the crew has to say about me:\nAddie is a sweet female Shep/Husky mix that was found at the golf course. She is a sweetie that deserves better than that. She is between 1/2 years old and weighs about 50lbs. She likes people and would make a very nice family pet. She is just a little timid at the shelter right now. She wants to be your hole in one.\nPlease call Faustina at 806-664-1615 since she can give you details about the animals!

            "description": "Looks like: Chihuahua/Terrier\nMale, 8 years old, 10 pounds\n\nChewy is a shy guy that desperately wants to be loved, but on his terms. He came to us from the SPCA for Monterey County because the shelter environment was just too loud for this little fella to thrive. He is good with other dogs, rides nicely in the car and has an adorable little face! \n\nChewy is still really uncertain in new situations and can be fussy about being handled, so we think a quiet, patient, adult-only home would be best for him. If you have other accepting dogs to show him the ropes, that would probably suit him well. He can nap around and share space with other dogs. He is not experienced with walking on leash and mostly tags along next to the person but if he feels the pull, he rebels and fights it with an opposite pull and a little tantrum. \n\nIf lefty in the home alone he does ok if distracted with a treat but is sure excited for his person to return. He wants to follow his people around the home and sometimes shows off his play for a few minutes with a toy. at night, he can sleep in a crate but will send a whimper of protest at first. He really desires a lap in the car and will act like he cannot ride comfortably and safely without a lap. This guy really does love to be held as much as possible, and that includes being snuggles. He will give kisses in return. He definitely wants to be a good dog and give love to his person. He has a cute personality that really shines once he is comfortable. His ideal home has a patient person and a consistent routine that will lead to Chewy's settling and feeling comfortable. \n\nChewy is not a fan of the leash yet. He may cower from it pulling him and he needs to build confidence with a person and then be shown how to be lead with leash, perhaps with a tasty treat. Thankfully, this guy will crawl right into your lap or arms and is very content being carried.",

            "description": "Hi there! I'm Polly and I'm a ~5 year old, 60lbs Pit Bull terrier mix. I was just recently rescued from the HIT living team, and I am still coming out of my shell, and allowing myself to be loved... I have never experienced that before, and it feels soooo good :) \n\n- I am a SUPER sweet and observant girl, and just a big bundle of LOVE. \n\n- I am timid but gaining confidence quickly and am a fast learner, especially when there are other dogs around me who can show me the ropes!\n\n- I am not super treat or food motivated, although I LOVE deli meat, and really like a nice bone to chew on :) \n \n- My favorite things to do is lounging around on the sofa or dog bed for most of the day, with my human by my side. I am a big sweet couch potato. \n \n- I was timid on walks and in new places at first, but I have already learned to gain so much more confidence in such little time, and I'm loving the new me! \n\n- I have never really been in a home before my foster home, so I am still learning house rules and boundaries like what I can sit and jump on, but I am very responsive to a stern \"no\" from my owner if I'm doing something that is not allowed, like putting my paws on the counter. I haven't had any accidents in the home though, so I am potty trained! \n \n- I LOVE other dogs, and absolutely would love a home with other dog friends who could boost my confidence and show me how to be a doggo, but also not a necessity. \n \n- My ideal home setting is in a home with a gentle and sweet individual or family, who will have the patience to teach me all the joys of being a dog, and lots and lots of love and cuddles!!!!!!\n\nIf you see me online I am still available for adoption! If you are interested in adopting me please fill out an application here: www.hitlivingfoundation.org/adoption-application, and email a video walkthrough of your home and yard to BOTH Nicole@hitlivingfoundation.org AND Marta@hitlivingfoundation.org. Your application will not be counted as valid without your video. You will hear back from us within a few days.",

I'm smart; I'll learn what to do. You will need to make me your one and only pet. I'm just not a huge fan of other animals. Don't worry I have a lot of love to give so you won't have to stress about only having one pet. Fill out an application for me at animalrescueofcarroll.org.",

They should never be left behind.\n\nThis pretty girl is so sweet and loving.  She loves to give kisses and snuggle.  She was so sad when she first came to us, but she has started to adjust to life outside of a traditional home, and is now drinking in all the love that our staff and volunteers have to offer.

            "description": "Orry-O is a male, 33 lb., black and white Rat Terrier mix. Orry-O's estimated date of birth is December, 2014. Poor Orry-O is a victim of a really bad situation and he needed help! He has a teenage brother that didn\u2019t know how to treat him with respect and love and his mother had to save him from that hurt. She did not want to let him go and it is obvious he was well-loved. He does have some missing fur from flea dermatitis, but should be better from that soon. He is settling in and would be a great laid back dog for someone that wants a calm, established dog in their life! Orry-O has a $150.00 adoption fee plus the cost of 6 months of heartworm prevention. \n\nNote: ARF reserves the right to deny any application that is deemed unsuitable for the animal. Please be aware that our animal adoptions are NOT on a first come- first serve basis. Our sole purpose is to find the best possible home for the animals that fall under our care. We do not ship our animals. All adopters are expected to come to Tulsa if approved.\n\nFor details on how to adopt please visit http://www.arftulsa.org/adopt.",

I am mostly quiet but can bark loud if I decide too.\nI am great with kids and currently have a 2 yr girl I love to play and take nappy naps with.\n     I have a lot of doggy buddies in my foster home and mostly we play great together.  I am leery because I got torn up pretty good by a very big dog before I was rescued and treated.  \n     I am house trained and use the 24 hr open dog door on my own.  I don't seem to know any commands but am very well behaved and great on a leash.  I love to travel in the car.  I usually sleep with my foster mama but also like my fav dog bed and blanket, too. \n     In my foster home, I am never alone so my mom can't know how I behave when solo for any period of time.  I have never done anything my mom has had to correct me for yet.\n     I am an amazing little sweetheart and will make a great addition to a calm,  loving new home.  \n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Marshall County Humane Society is now following CDC guidelines for Covid-19 in order to keep everyone as safe as possible. We are showing dogs and cats to prospective adopters, but only on the grounds outside our shelter. We will need appointment to show the animal and we will want to have social distancing of 6' while you are there and we are wearing masks. We are doing Zoom interviews to see inside of your home since we aren't going into homes for home visit. We do come to your home before finalizing adoption to check the security of your fence if you are adopting a dog. Our dogs are given much care and attention and we treat every medical need of animal once we take them in.\nMCHS is a limited intake adoption center. We are an all volunteer, non-profit organization. All of our animals are disease free, have been spayed/neutered and are up to date on shots. We charge a Dog adoption fee of $125 which includes a microchip. Our Cat adoption fee is $75.00. Most of our dogs will require a fenced yard. To fill out application, go to our website Marshallcountyhumanesociety.org, go to Adoption Info tab and click on Application. For more info, call 662-564-2900. The girls tell me they like the white motley throat marking I have. I really want a home so I promise I'll work hard to be a good boy if you take me home. I try to be cooperative with the other dogs at the shelter so would probably get along with your other dogs or cats too. . The vet says I probably was born in December, 2018 so I can probably listen to your instructions pretty well. Call to see me soon by calling 662-564-2900 or E-mail DogsNCats11@gmail.com to make an appointment to meet me. I will need a fenced yard.\nAll our animals have been spayed or neutered and up to date on all preventives and shots and we are microchipped. Dog adoption fee is $125.\nFill out application at Marshallcountyhumanesociety.org and go to Adoption Info Tab.",

            "description": "Oreo was rescued from Puerto Rico as a puppy and was adopted very quickly. However, he recently was returned to Eleventh Hour Rescue as he was just a little too high energy for his adopter's life style. Oreo would love a fenced in backyard to burn his energy off, and a lot of exercise throughout the day. This is not a dog that can be crated for long hours at a time.\n\nOreo is now about a year old & weighs 45 pounds. He has the most striking blue eyes which give him a unique look. He's a happy guy who loves belly rubs, car rides & playing fetch!\n\nOreo hasn't had much socialization with other dogs, and after dog testing him we know that he should be the only dog in the home. He can see other dogs socially, but sharing his space is another matter. He does wonderful on pack walks, just doesn't like other dogs in his face. He is a friendly boy who is good with people who can give him his space but would be best in an adult only home due to his exuberance . Oreo can be protective of his toys and treats, so he needs an owner with experience who will know when to leave him alone. He's a beautiful boy who deserves to be in a home!\n\nIf you've got a place in your heart and your home for this blue-eyed boy, please fill out an adoption application at www.ehrdogs.org & be sure to mention his name!",

She is shy at first but once she warms up she will love you. Kitten is very selective on the dogs she does like. Kitten was found as a stray trapped inside the fencing of a retention pond. She is a sweet dog,who gravitates towards women, slowly warms up to men. A quiet home with owners who will maintain balance and give her lots of love. She is picky about her canine friends here at the center, so we think she'd prefer to be the only dog in the home. A FENCED YARD FOR HER TO SAFELY PLAY AND ROMP IS RECOMMENDED.\n\nDOG 4 A DAY UPDATE:\nWe took Kitten out twice and can tell potential adopters that she will make a great additional to any family. She is easy to walk, house trained and was so calm during car rides. We took her to the waterfront for al long walk and to relax at our home. At home she was very gentle and curious about everything but only played with dog toys. She does jump when she hears loud noises, like the garage door, but I think with time she will get use to all the usual noises in a home.",

            "description": "Our gorgeous girl Kitsu is looking for an experienced family to be her furever home. Kitsu (who also answers to Kit, and Kitsa), is a wonderfully smart, independent girl who will brighten your day with her vibrant energy. She knows a number of basic cues, has lovely leash manners, and even hides a few other tricks up her sleeves :) Kitsu is incredibly food motivated - seriously, she is able to sniff out a crumb from two rooms away. This smart girl will benefit with adequate amounts of mental stimulation to channel her energy in positive and constructive manners. Since coming into rescue, Kitsu has shown to be an extremely playful girl, almost as if she is making up for lost time. She adores attention, but only after she deems you worthy of her affection, so you have to be patient in order to earn her trust. Once she decides to accept you into her inner circle, she will not hesitate to tell you all the details about her day, and we do mean, EVERY SINGLE DETAIL :) She would be great as your one and only dog as she can be picky about other canines. This beautiful girl will need an experienced handler familiar with the breed who has the time and patience to work with her, and help her get settled into her new home. Kitsu will benefit from consistent positive reinforcement training, and amateur dog sports may be a productive way to challenge her brilliant mind. This girl is ready for the next chapter of her life. Are you ready to give her a chance to love you and be your furever companion?\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

I am strong and overall a big lug!  \n\nSince I've come to the shelter they have made sure that I'm up to date on vaccinations, fixed, and also have a microchip. All I need now is someone super nice to come adopt me!\n\nAdoptions are conducted by appointment only with a pre-approved application. Please call the shelter at 724-539-2544 and leave a voicemail with your information and interest in adopting. We will call you back to do an application with you by phone. Once your adoption application is approved, we will setup an appointment for you to come to the shelter and meet the pet you are interested in. Please be patient in receiving a call back - we are experiencing a very high volume of calls each day with a limited staff.",

He is overall not very vocal and will pace to get your attention. He is very active and loves chasing plush, squeak, and rope toys. He is learning not to play rough and jump, so he may not be suitable for homes with small children or older dogs until he has had more training. He has learned sit so far, but he is a very intelligent dog and is motivated for treats. He would thrive in a larger home that has some land to run around and with a family that likes to be active outside. During his time in foster, he has only been around an older large dog and adults.

Do you have a lap that needs to be warm? I make the best lap warmer! I am potty trained and will let you know when I need to go out like the good boy I am. I like other dogs and wouldn't mind a fur sibling to play with but they should probably be around my size as I like to rough house. Kids are great to be with too! I'll snuggle and be gentle with them. I am good on a leash and would love to go on a adventure with you. Let's go on adventures together forever! Magnum is a male Black Mouth Cur/American Pit Bull Terrier mix who weighs 50 lbs and was born approximately 10-26-19. He is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, given flea/tick preventative, dewormed, tested negative for heartworm disease & started on preventative. Adoption fee is $300 to help offset the many expenses we have for vetting costs. We rely strictly on adoption fees and donations to continue to save the lives of orphaned & abandoned pets; 100% goes towards their care. If interested in adopting one of our available dogs or puppies, please complete an online adoption application at https://dollyslegacyanimalrescue.org/adopt/ You will be contacted by our adoption coordinator via email after your application has been reviewed & approved to schedule an appointment.",

In her previous life, Izzy has been left outdoors in sun and rain, regardless of the weather, and she always had to fend for herself, sometimes even having to scavenge for food. Since coming into rescue, Izzy is slowly learning that a home provides not only a place of shelter, but also food, love and affection. Despite having been neglected most of her life, Izzy is not hesitant to approach people and is more than happy to show her affection. You can easily win her over with a good head scratch and nice belly rub :) Given her history, Izzy would prefer to have a large, fenced-in backyard where she can safely patrol and guard the property. As she is in her golden years, she will need a little more attention taking care of her arthritis; she is not going to let stiff joints stop her from doing her job, so it will be important for her humans to look out for her to keep her healthy for as long as possible. This sweet girl will need some help settling into a new routine in her new home, but she is quite food motivated so that it 'is' possible to teach an old dog new tricks! Will you open your home and show Izzy the love and affection that she so deserves?\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nNGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY. View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

We wanted to give her another chance at life. CiCi is approximately 2-3 years old, up to date on vaccinations, spayed & microchipped. \n\nSince CiCi has been in foster care, she has shown that she is a total love bug. She adores toys of all kinds, walking and sunbathing. She gets along great with other pups and children. CiCi is just seeking for a home to call forever and owners that will never give up on her! \n\nCiCi is house trained, kennel trained & knows her basic commands/manners. \n\nInterested adopters can fill out an application at canehavenrescue.com. \nAny possible questions about CiCi, please email canehavenrescue@gmail.com \n\nCane Haven Rescue will transport any of their adoptable dogs to the right home. We do require adoption fees that are based on the age & health status of the adoptable dog. The adoption fee covers every single dog in CHR with vaccinations, heartworm test, deworming, microchip, spay/neuter & medications. All CHR adoptable dogs are current on their monthly  heartworm and flea medication. A CHR representative will do a home check to ensure the pets are placed in a secure and loving home. \n\nwww.canehavenrescue.com",

            "description": "Yinzer is a Boxer/American Bulldog mix who is almost 8 years old. His birthday is January 25th, 2013. He was adopted by his original owner at 6 weeks old. He is a very loyal and loving dog. Since then, the owner and their family has grown with the addition of two children, 3 years old and 7 months old. \n\nYinzer needs an owner that is good with dogs and able to show leadership with confident verbal commands. He listens well and follows verbal commands once you earn his trust. \n\nHe can feel the emotions of people who are scared and worried which makes him alarmed and protective that something bad may happen. It will take some time for a new owner to establish a relationship with him but he without a doubt will make someone very happy and will become very attached to them. \n\nYinzer does best with meeting new people in a common area that is not his. This way he does not feel like he needs to protect his space or loved ones from a threat. When living with his previous owners he would invite new people into the house by meeting them in the driveway first. Once he was able to meet a new person in a common area outside of the yard and house such as the driveway, he would be welcoming to that guest. Once that person has been welcomed into the home, that person would be able to return time after time without needing to meet Yinzer anymore in the driveway.\n\nOver time Yinzer did develop a protective nature of his owner and the family. So much that when the owners 3-year-old daughter tried to surprise tickle attack the owner, she did it inches in front of Yinzers face and he unfortunately bit her not realizing it was her. \n\nIn the days following the incident Yinzer was around the family and daughter prior to being surrendered and he showed sadness, remorse and no aggression. However, the owner feels it to be the best option to find him a loving home with no small children and a simpler household. \n\nYinzer is an amazing dog who will make someone very happy. He enjoys taking walks and laying around a fenced in yard. \n\nHe does well with other dogs that like to play. He would not do well with an Alpha Male who was already living in the house. But he did do well when the original owner introduced a female beagle into the family 5 years ago. They would play, wrestle and sleep next to each other every day. He also does will with other dogs of friends of the owner that would come and visit. \n\nLike with most dogs, toys are usually removed when friends dogs would visit. But the dogs would wrestle and play for hours without an issue. \n\nYinzer is house trained and can be left in a house for up to 10 hours if needed. \nHe sleeps well in the bedroom or a different room. He is not a dog that will do well sleeping outside or being left outside for long periods of time. \n\nHe is a very low maintenance, cuddle friendly lap dog who is in a larger dog\u2019s body. Be ready for his heavy head to lay on your lap while watching tv with your new best friend.\n\nHe is scared because of the dramatic changes over the past few weeks and will need a little time to understand that he is safe in a new home with you. \n\nInterested in adopting? Go on our website, triadspca.org and submit an application or call us at 336-375-3222.\n",

            "description": "Hi I\u2019m Lucille! I am a pure bred Great Pyrenees somewhere between 5 and 7 years old. \nI love to be petted and want to be around you always! I\u2019m a little slow due to my age and hip dysplasia. (Which I take some joint and pain medication for). But I still love walks! \nI enjoy being with other dogs most definitely. I am not sure about cats as I haven\u2019t been around any.  I have tested positive for heartworm but I am taking daily medications to get me all better.  \nI have a hearty appetite - more food more happy! I\u2019m not spayed yet and I am working on my house training which is getting better every day. \nMy life hasn\u2019t been an easy one, it\u2019s likely someone was using me for breeding and then dumped me when I wasn\u2019t useful anymore. But despite this ugly past, I am an absolute sweetheart with so much love to give. I\u2019m looking to give lots of love and share a happy life with a special someone.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (that application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\n The adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information.\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

Pawlee walks good on a leash, but be prepared because she likes to hold the leash and walk herself.  She is crate trained and would benefit from a basic training class.\n\nNo small children, as she still hasn't mastered the art of keeping all four paws on the ground.\n\nShe will be available after Jan 10th.\n\nFilling out an application is the first step in the adoption process. If you have questions, the best way to contact us is to email azdesertrottis@aol.com.\n\nWe don't always bring all animals to our adoption events so check ahead of time to make sure the animal you are interested in is still available. Some animals listed may already be promised.\n\nArizona Desert Rotti & Pals Rescue is a NO KILL rescue serving Tucson and the surrounding area. \n\nWe do adopt out of area under the right circumstances. If you are willing to travel to Tucson to meet us, and to personally transport your adopted pet home, we may be willing to work with you. \n\nA home visit is usually required for the safety of our animals. We check the yard to make sure this little pup cannot escape, no predator can get in, and also look for hazardous plants. \n\nWe do not adopt our dogs out unless you have a secured, fenced yard, it\u2019s a requirement for the safety of the dog. At the end of the application, please include the type of fencing and the height of the fence you have around your yard. \n\nIf you're interested in Pawlee or any of our dogs, please fill out a pre application at: http://www.azdesertrotti.com/html/to_adopt.htm\nOnce you have filled out the pre-adoption application, someone will contact you about the dog to answer your questions and tell you where our Sunday adoption event is held.\n\nOur dogs are bathed, dewormed, vet checked, given their required shots, spayed or neutered, and microchipped. \n\nOur rescues are homed with foster parents. They are fostered in homes so that we can tell you a little bit about their personalities, feeding schedule, habits, behavior, whether they get along with other dogs. We can tell you if they are crate trained, if they are leash trained and house trained. Most dogs need a refresher course on potty training when they go to a new home. They need to learn your routine, and it will be up to you to teach them. \n\nEven the most abused animals can be wonderful pets. It takes patience, love and good food, along with fun and commitment to the animal. Fosters work with these animals. They are a part of our families, while we are lucky enough to have them.",

No home, no family, no cozy moments by the fire for Hayward. Hayward's Christmas wish this year is just to LIVE. He's a fantastic dog, easy going, he's been a good boy! He doesn't know why he's stuck in this scary place. He just wants to focus on loving his people and being loved in return, and yes maybe he's hoping to having a place that Santa can find him in 2 days! \n\n \n\n $200.00 Adoption Fee \n\n(Which is considered a non refundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible. The fee itself is not negotiable, our vets don't negotiate and thus neither do we.)\n\nTo Contact Us\n\nMessage us through our website http://www.highplainspaw.org\n\nMessage the Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/HighPlainsPAW\n\nFill out our Adoption Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/adoption-application\n\nFill out our Foster Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/foster-application\n\nEmail us at highplainspaw@gmail.com\n\nCall our voicemail at (402)957-1578\n\nWE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY ALL OUR DOGS ARE LOCATED IN FOSTER HOMES.

WE are a high intake No Kill Shelter ran by a staff of 4 and do not always have time to answer every question asked by so many. If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced. It is never our intention to ignore a request about an adoptable animal in our facility.\n\nSandy Brown, Director, PAW Animal Shelter\n\n319-372-2274",

Dottie is looking for a home that wants some fun in their life. She plays in the leaves like a little kid and she hops and twirls when she gets excited. Dottie seems happy to meet other dogs and we think she would do fine with children. Dottie also walks pretty well on the leash and she does love some belly rubs for sure. If interested in \"our\" sweet and happy Dottie, ask us how to meet/adopt her today. \n\nPlease stop by the City of Jackson Animal Shelter at 140 Outer Circle, Jackson, MS during their adoption hr (10 - 4 M - F and 8:30-10:30 Sat) to meet Dottie and take a leash with you so that you can take her outside for a walk and get to know her a little better.  For more information, please contact Kristianna (a volunteer with Jxn Friends of the Animal Shelter) via phone (410-924-1053) or email (ksaelensybk2@yahoo.com). Dottie is eligible for a free spay thru Jackson Friends of the Animal Shelter.  For more pictures and information, please take a look at our Jackson Friends of the Animal Shelter page on Facebook.",

This little girl was found as a stray, and is as sweet as can be! Since coming into rescue, she has thoroughly enjoyed the company of her foster siblings...in fact, she would not let any of them out of her sight :) Not only does Mayze love playing with her foster siblings, she is also quick to catch on to the basic cues that they have already mastered, and we think she may out-perform them in no time! Mayze adores toys of all varieties. If there is a stray toy somewhere, Mayze will be sure to \"rescue\" it and add to her ever-growing collection of toys. This funny girl seems to particularly like soft towels or blankets - if there is one left on the floor unattended, she will most likely relocate it somewhere to nest on. Mayze is a lovely girl who will thrive in a loving family who will help her boost her confidence in navigating this busy world full of people. With a little patience and consistent training, we have no doubt that this girl will mature into a loving, loyal companion!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

As a result, there is often an adjustment period when learning about life as a family pet. We typically do not adopt dogs to homes with young children. Homes with older children will be considered on an individual basis. Common skills such as house training and leash walking will often take a little extra time. Patience, understanding and a gentle hand are a must. The great news is, most of these dogs come around rather quickly and being a part of their rehabilitation is an extremely rewarding experience.

I love to play fetch but I don't always want to give the ball back. Due to my energy I will need a home with children over the age of 6 but would prefer if they were closer to 12. I like other dogs but I am extremely rude when I meet them. If I go home with another dog, it would be ideal if they had a similar energy level to me. I need a fenced in yard and am not suitable for an apartment. I am required to meet all family members, including dogs, before going to my forever home. Wesley is a Diamond Dog and will be shown by appointment only. Diamond Dogs are dogs that are currently receiving special training from staff and volunteers through our behavior modification program. If you are interested in learning more about this animal, please fill out an application by clicking here . Be sure to include Wesley A1360049 when filling out the survey. After reviewing your application, we will only be reaching out to you if the animal is a good fit for your home. Can't adopt, but think you can foster Wesley until he finds his forever home?

Not too long ago I found myself at a rural pound with my time almost up. I could not believe my luck when I was chosen for rescue by Dolly\u2019s Legacy! Now that I\u2019m safe and secure my favorite things are food, affection, and sleeping with my head under a pillow. Can you just stay home and pet me all day? My big brown eyes and soft thick fur make this a pretty appealing offer, I can assure you. I will even climb onto your lap if you let me! I\u2019m not a very shy girl but am a bit nervous. However I\u2019m also very smart and attentive, so a little training goes a long way in helping me settle into new situations and build confidence. I\u2019m getting more comfortable in my foster home and every day show I am a little more confident. I used to watch the other dogs play or wait until they were done with their toys before I took a turn, but now I like to join right in on the fun. I know some basic commands and love to show them off, and when given treats I take them very gently. I have a medium amount of energy right now, but that may change once I\u2019m feeling better after my heartworm treatment is finished. I probably had a litter of puppies at some point in my life since I was only recently spayed and I love to groom the foster puppy that lives with me. Since I'm a Heeler, I would do best with a home with kids over 10 or no kids, I would probably want to herd them. I do show some herding behavior, but mostly I\u2019ll just herd you to the couch so you\u2019ll sit down and pet me. Sometimes my instincts kick in towards smaller dogs, but I play really well with dogs my size or larger. I am friendly and accepting when meeting new dogs, but if they give me attitude I have no problem sticking up for myself! I would probably do best with other dogs who are calm and submissive (but still playful), but I\u2019m willing to meet anyone to see if it\u2019s a good fit. I\u2019ve already done most of the hard work for you since I am house trained and kennel trained, and if you have a dog door with a fenced in yard I\u2019ll even take myself out every time I need to. Now all I need is to find a family who will continue building my confidence through basic obedience, leash training, and positive new experiences. I have so much love to give and I can\u2019t wait to find my forever home! \u00a0 Ruby is a female Red Heeler who weighs 30 lbs and was born approximately 12-12-18. She is spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, given flea/tick preventative, dewormed. Ruby is undergoing life-saving treatment for heartworm disease. She will need to remain on heartworm preventative for life, as is recommended for ALL dogs, and retested in 6 months to ensure she is heartworm free. Adoption fee is $400 to help offset the many expenses we have for vetting costs. We rely strictly on adoption fees and donations to continue to save the lives of orphaned & abandoned pets; 100% goes towards their care. If interested in adopting one of our available dogs or puppies, please complete an online adoption application at https://dollyslegacyanimalrescue.org/adopt/ You will be contacted by our adoption coordinator via email after your application has been reviewed & approved to schedule an appointment.",

All of the nice people here took really good care of me and helped me deliver my babies. I am so thankful for them. I am now ready to find my forever home! I am a very sweet and loving girl. I love getting lots of attention and loves from my people. I'm not too sure about toys just yet. Maybe with some time you could teach me how fun they could be. If you have any other dogs at home then I will need to meet them first. I haven't really made many doggo friends since being here, but you never know! I would not do well with cats. Please come in and meet me! I can't wait to start my new life with you!",

He loves to meet new friends, he can be shy at first but warms up quickly and will make a great life companion. Sadly his family simply didn't have time for him and he is now seeking a new long term love interest. \n\nObedience training will be a great start to your new relationship and get you in tune with each other right away. Sit, down, and are simple commands but really do make life much more manageable and impress those onlookers when you are out to lunch.",

Grady handles grooming well. Grady came to us as a transfer in from animal control. Grady is a friendly boy who needs to learn manners. He is a big boy who thinks he is a small dog and plays too roughfor small children. Grady is learning to sit, walk on a leash and not put his mouth on you. He has come a long way since we transferred him in. He does need to go to a home with no small children at this time because he plays too rough and might hurt them. All dog adoptions are by appointment only, most purebred pets have a waiting list so please call the shelter at 863-324-5227 to set up your appointment. The shelter is open Tuesday Saturday 10:30-6 closed 1-2 for lunch.",

This dog is also tested with other dogs, kennel-trained, and housebroken. We would love for you to meet this dog and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: While we typically host weekly Saturday adoption events, in order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment and/or adoption handoff. Appointments and handoffs are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, adoption appointments and handoffs are only offered for individual animals. When adopting at an appointment, please be aware that you will be taking the animal home that day. We can not hold animals to be picked up at a later date.\n\nDue to CDC's recommended COVID-19 protocols, we are highly encouraging foster homes and adopters to speak with one another via phone or video chat to ensure compatible matches and limit in-person contact. If meeting in person, our foster homes are encouraged to wear masks, socially distance, and choose an outdoor meeting spot. Should you want to proceed forward with the adoption, all adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees are to be completed electronically. Quick and low-contact animal handoff is also being encouraged amongst foster homes and adopters. As always, we include a one-week trial period with all our adoptions.\u00a0***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption! If you would like more information on our organization please visit our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org.",

            "description": "Dawson is a happy little bundle of energy. It's rare that you will see him without a toy in his mouth and even more rare that you will see him not wagging his tail. Shelter life hasn't gotten this boy down (yet)! While we haven't been able to fully dog test him - he did have one buddy here that he would happily run around the yard with. Dawson seems to enjoy the company of other dogs, but probably doesn't want a dog that will be jumping all over him. Dawson is looking for a person or family who will run around with him, play tug-of-war & fetch, and then cuddle up to you for belly rubs. One of Dawson's favorite things is going for a ride in the car! He gets sooo relaxed and pretty soon after you'll probably be hearing some soft snores. He loves everyone he meets and wiggles his whole body in excitement when he sees you (usually with a toy in his mouth). We think our sweet Dawson would do best with kids 6 years and older since he's so wiggly he could accidentally knock a small child over (and watch out for that wagging tail)! Dawson is the sweetest boy with SO much love to give a lucky person or family.\n\nAPPROXIMATE WEIGHT: 45 - POUNDS\n\nESTIMATED DOB: 10/11/2018\n\nGOOD WITH OTHER DOGS: SELECTIVE\n\nGOOD WITH KIDS: YES 6 &^ DUE TO HAPPY TAIL!\n\nGOOD WITH CATS: NO\n\nREQUIRES A FENCE: NO\n\nACTIVITY LEVEL: MODERATE\n\nLIKES TO VOCALIZE: SOME\n\nSPECIAL NEEDS: NONE\n\nBREED EXPERIENCE NEEDED: NO\n\nAPPROPRIATE PLACEMENT FOR 1ST TIME DOG OWNER? YES\n\nFREE OBEDIENCE TRAINING IS OFFERED WITH ALL DOG ADOPTIONS\n\nPlease note that we are often asked if dogs are \"house trained\". The dogs are in fact living in a kennel environment during their time with us. Even if they have previously lived in a home and been trained - the stress of the change and the new home can sometimes cause regression and require some additional training. We feel that it's best for all adopters to be prepared for this possibility.\n\nVisit our adoption page for details about our process, and to fill out an adoption application. All animals come spayed/neutered, UTD on vaccines, and microchipped. If the animals age or health prevents any of these from being completed prior to adoption a voucher is issued for the services to be performed. If you have any questions about the animal, or our adoption process, please email adopt@littleguild.org. The Little Guild is a 501c(3) federally recognized non-profit organization devoted to saving the lives of homeless pets.",

            "description": "Beamer is a sweet boy who loves to go for rides in the backseat of the car. He is a little shy around people until he gets to know them. He weighs about 43 pounds and is 18 inches tall at shoulders, a rather short boy. He is house trained and sleeps in his bed beside yours. He LOVES other dogs and older children. It would be great if he could go to a home with another dog(s) to be his bestie. He does need a little training but has \"\"sit\"\" down. He is a loving boy and gentle but is a little timid around strangers and places he's never been. He warms up quickly though and loves his humans. He likes to cuddle on the couch with you. Loves lounging in the sun and hunting lizards. Loves the dog park and will play in the lake. Loves to play fetch and that usually turns into crazy zoomies. He needs to have a fenced yard since he loves to run around. Likes to walk but could use some leash training. He has a lot of puppy in him and \"\"mouths\"\" when playing and nips a little, foster working on that, but he has no aggression whatsoever, is just playing. Great when left alone for short periods, too. \nGood with dogs\nGood with older children\nHousetrained\nNOT Good with catsIf interested, please apply at www.adorepetrescue.org/adoption",

            "description": "Rhi is living in a foster home. Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet her.\n\nRhi is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~3 years\nWeight: ~58lbs\nHousebroken: Working on it! She needs to be on a strict schedule\nCrate trained: Working on it! Takes 10-30 minutes to settle but overall doing well with her crate-training\nDog sociability: She is leash reactive towards other dogs (barks/lunges).\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Unknown, but she can be mouthy (play bites) so older kids are best.\nIdeal home: Rhi is looking for an active adopter that can commit to training! Rhi does best when she gets exercised both inside and outside of the home everyday. She would prefer a quiet neighborhood where she doesn't have to pass a bunch of other dogs. She currently lives with a male in her foster, but she does prefer slow intros with high value snacks for meeting men. She is not a match for a high-rise/elevator building.\n\nRhi is excited about LIFE and she hopes you are, too! This bundle of energy will keep you on on your toes and snuggle her way into your heart. She loves to play and be showered with attention and she'll be sure to give it back to you 10 fold. She's always ready for a game of tug and war, which she never loses but she won't rub it in! Rhi would love an adopter that will continue to work on training as she is eager to please and will benefit from learning some impulse control and how to direct her energy in positive ways. She does fantastic when given enrichment toys, bones, etc. and of course loves a good 3 or so walks per day. If you're looking for an active adventure buddy to get you out of the house this dark winter, look no further!\n\nRhi's adoption fee is 300. She is spayed, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

Henry would love a home where he can run around and play with toys in his fenced in yard. The kennel environment has been a bit stressful for Henry, so he would really love to relax in a home! Once he walks away from his kennel space, he shows you the love bug that he truly is--leaning into you for scratches and love. Henry would need to be the only dog in his home, as wants to soak up all your love.  He also would like a home without cats. Henry wants to please and would enjoy doing training with his new family so he can be the best dog you ever had. This boy is going to be the perfect companion for a very lucky owner. \n\nA physical fence is required for adoption.\n\nIf you want to meet Henry, please email Rescue@LamanchaAnimalRescue.org.\n\nNeutered, UTD vaccinations, microchipped, wormed.\n\nHousetrained.\n\n",

Ground-level apartments ok.\nSpecial Info: Vera has old injuries to her rear legs that do not require surgery but she will be undergoing physical therapy to help increase her range of motion. She gets along just fine and can anything other dogs can do! She is already housebroken and loves relaxing!\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

His ideal owner will have prior dog experience, a fenced in yard to allow him to run off his energy, and a willingness to provide long walks or runs each day to help harness his energy. He'll need work on obedience and manners and a lot of chew toys to entertain him to prevent boredom chewing.\n\nHe was picked up running stray with another dog so he is thought to be dog friendly.

I am affectionate and laidback. I am fully house trained but I am still working on crate training. I am looking for a home without cats or dogs! I am a queen when on a leash and could do well in an apartment! If I have a house with fenced yard, it needs to be a 6ft privacy fence.  I also would prefer my forever bestie to be home more than away, I just love having company!  I have heard a lot about this forever thing and I hope my family fills out an application for me soon!\n\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

            "description": "\nMeet Momma Millie. This sweet girl was surrendered with her pups and the dad after her family could no longer care for them. All have been adopted except this sweet momma. Sadly, she has spent her life outdoors without much interaction so she is a bit shy at first. She warms up quick and doesn\u2019t offer up an ounce of aggression. Millie truly is the sweetest soul. She just needs a little patience to settle into a new environment. She adores the kids in her foster home and actually stands guard while they are playing outdoors and follows them all over the farm. She\u2019s great with other animals. She\u2019s laid back and very sweet. Millie does prefer to be outdoors and enjoy her property during the day. She is getting more used to the indoor life and starting to enjoy that more. She sleeps all night inside without a peep. She\u2019s learning a leash but still needs some work. She doesn\u2019t mind a kennel and rides well in the car. She is a yellow lab mix around 3 years old and 50 lbs. This girl is truly the perfect farm pup. She is loyal, watchful, easy going and is as sweet as they come. This girl deserves nothing but the best. If you can give that to her please fill out the app below. Millie is utd, hw tested and spayed. \n\nAll dogs have a $150 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter!\n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $100 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159",

PLEASE READ\n\nPosted animals are physically located at the above address except when indicated with the following notations after the animal's name:\n\nAnimal Name (FC=initials) -- indicates the animal is living in Foster Care. To meet the animal, please contact the foster directly when contact information is provided; otherwise call the shelter at 434 263-7722.\n\nAnimal Name (COURTESY) - this animal is posted as a public courtesy using information provided by the owner. Our shelter does not own or guarantee the information provided by the owner to be complete and accurate. Also, adoption does not involve our shelter but is strictly between the adopter and the owner.\n\nHIGH ENERGY...VERY INTELLIGENT!!!UPDATE 12/19/2020:\nPica (pronounced Peeka) is a male @2-year-old Heeler (mix) who weighs @35 pounds. He tested NEGATIVE times 4 on his test for Heartworm, Lyme, Ehrlichia and Anaplasmosis and this is always great news. Pica begs attention from every person he sees. His idea of a perfect day would include lots of stuff to see, chasing balls, being petted, running, running, running and problem-solving games. In the right hands, he would do great as an agility dog. The right hands would be a person who understands the energy needs of working breeds like his and their desire to do a job, and what happens if they are left and become bored.\nThis boy is brilliant and can learn any task if you can translate what you want and provide a reasonable incentive. Pica adores activity of almost any kind, but he has an aversion to water, so swimming sports might be a no-go. And though he likes kids and gets very protective of them, he has been known to bite when something concerns him, so small kids or unattended kids are not a good idea. Pica may feel a need to intervene if someone interacts with the child he is focused on. When people hug, it upsets him and causes a barking frenzy. He needs a firm (not harsh) person to give him direction.\nPica has a high prey drive and has decided that cats are fair game as quarry, merely another varmint to rid the world of. And though he seems friendly enough towards other dogs at our facility, his surrenderer told us he was a bully with their other very submissive dog. We were also informed that if left alone and unconfined, Pica demonstrated mild separation anxiety by barking and chewing personal items left out.\nPica is playful as a puppy, takes treats gently from fingers, enjoys being petted, and has good house manners and was trained to stay off furniture.\nThis eager boy plaintively calls out in a typical Heeler squeal when folks pass his room as if saying, Come play with me. I promise it will be worth it.\nPica is currently living at the Nelson County Humane Society/SPCA Almost Home Pet Adoption Center near Lovingston, VA, and Lindsey at lindsey21581@gmail.com is the point of contact for him. If you are interested in him and have what he needs, please fill out an on-line application for him at www.nelsonspca.org and email Lindsey too. VOLUNTEERS and DONATIONS NEEDED.

She has scares on her face and body from mistreatment in her past but she does not let that stop her from being a huge love! Mona would prefer a home without other animals where she can get all of the attention. She walks pretty well on a leash and knows how to sit already. If you are interested in meeting Mona, the Humane Society at Lakewood Ranch is open Friday through Sunday 11:00 - 4:00. Any questions, contact us at info@hslwr.org.

At the end of the day, she just wants to cuddle with you, wherever you are - couch, office chair, dining room - she wants to be there.

Reese was adopted from us as a puppy and returned recently through no fault of her own. She has made amazing progress since coming back into our care. She\u2019s incredibly sweet with people she\u2019s comfortable with and very affectionate. Reese would do best with an experienced dog owner. To adopt Reese, apply at ITVrescue.org.\n\nAll of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heartworm tested and treated if necessary.\n\nPlease realize that many of our animals are kept in foster homes. Please complete an adoption application at http://itvrescue.org/adoption-application/ in order to meet with one of our animals. There is no obligation in completing the application, but it helps us find an animal that is most appropriate for your family.  The ITV Rescue Center is open Tuesdays 12-5; Wednesdays 12-7; Thursdays 12-5; Fridays 12-5 and Saturdays 10-5.  The Rescue Center is located at 1417 N. Stockwell Road.  You are welcome to come to our rescue center during open hours to see all of our great adoptable animals. Thank you for your interest in our animals!\n\nNOTE: Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

She loves to cuddle and is good with kids. Perfect family dog. Does well with dogs her size or bigger (but not small dogs). Unsure about how she does with cats. House-trained but can have accidents when she has a bladder infection. This has been an ongoing issue and her current family has been hit hard financially due to the pandemic this year. Can you help us find Hera a great home where she can receive the time and care she deserves. Apply to adopt online at https://foreverloverescue.com/dog-adoptionfoster-application/\n\nAll of the cats listed are located in or near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania unless otherwise noted. Adoption fees are $60 for adult cats and kittens over 6 months old, $100 for kittens (under 6 months) and $30 for senior cats (7 years+) to help cover vet bills for spay/neuter, basic vaccinations, testing, microchips and preventatives. No cat will be officially adopted without being spayed/neutered and rabies vaccinated (unless there are health risks in doing so). We highly recommend adopting kittens in pairs and we do discount for double adoptions here to encourage it. Visit many of our kitties at our Kitty Corner adoption center 39 Queen St in historic Gettysburg PA.\n\nWe will require an approved on-line application which is available on our website at\n\nforeverloverescue.com/cat-application/\n\nPlease feel free to call 717-900-5525 with any questions, or reach us by email at friends@foreverloverescue.com.

He is about 5 to 6 years old and a big guy at about 80 pounds. We don\u2019t know how he feels about other dogs/cats yet, more updates to follow. He could really use a place to crash outside of the shelter and some TLC.\n\nHe is available for foster or adoption through All About The Pawz, located in Youngstown, Ohio. If you are interested in meeting him, please apply on our website. https://www.allaboutthepawzrescue.org/",

            "description": "If the qualifications for your next pet are big, goofy, and might actually be a cow, then we have just the one for you! Jax is a 3-year-old dog who is looking for someone he can love on.A bit shy at first, and curious of strangers, Jax warms up quickly to people. After first introductions, it doesnt take long for him to lean against you, hoping for a back scratch. And if he catches you sitting down, you best hope you have legs of steelthis big boy does not seem to understand just how large he is, as he will assume the role of a lap dog.Jax is a mixed bag when it comes to his breed. While he is officially listed at a pittie, his head looks more like a labs, and the curve of his tail is reminiscent of an akitas. Jax has white fur with black spots, and his habit of eating grass all the time really completes the picture of his resemblance to a cow.Jax is a moderate-energy pooch, as he likes to frolic three times around the Big Yard before laying on his tummy, all four legs sprawled out. If you have a rope toy, he can be tempted to have a bit more fun, and he will chase you all day if you have treats.Jax does have a history of resource guarding his food, and while he has not shown signs of aggression toward any of our staff, we would recommend that he go to a home without young children or other pets. Jax would really thrive with someone who can give him the attention he craves and would be game to spend time training him on some basic obedience skills.Are you udderly in love with Jax already? Then head to kenthumane.org to submit your application! Due to COVID-19 precautions, the Animal Care Shelter for Kent County is open by appointment only. Once your application is approved, we will set up an appointment with you!Animal meetings and adoptions by appointment only. Please go to kenthumane.org/adoption-applicationOnce approved we will call you to set up an appointment!",

He loves laying in front of fireplaces, belly rubs, toys, treats, and attention. He will do especially well with an alpha male (human) in the house. Walter does have special requirements, as he does not do well with children or other male dogs and a house with backyard and without steps (so as to be easier on his knees) is ideal. Experience with bulldogs is also a must. However, once Walter finds the perfect home he will be a loyal companion as he loves to be around his people and the more often you are home for quality time the better.",

Cindy has been waiting for her forever home for over 6 months- she is a special girl and is looking for just the right home where she can be the best dog she can be! Cindy is a sweet cuddle-muffin who loves her people. She is the type of dog that will cuddle on the couch and keep you warm, but also doesn't mind a good walk- as long as she is with her person Cindy is the happiest girl on earth! Cindy would prefer a home without other animals since she really doesn't want any animal friends. But that's okay because Cindy has a lot of love to give, and she just knows if you came to meet her, you would fall head-over-heels for her- just like she would for you! \n\nCindy is a part of our Friends with Benefits Program, so not only does she have a waived adoption fee, she also will receive a special benefit package created just for her to help her and her new family. Cindy's benefits are free vaccinations and training sessions at our Rescue Ranch, medical care related to orthopedic issues at cost for life at our Rescue Ranch and one week of free boarding.",

            "description": "Grant is a gentle and docile dog. He gets tired easily and will definitely go for a nap after a long walk. He knows the commands sit, stay, and come. He is happy to cuddle and receive belly rubs. He won't go up on to a couch or bed unless given permission. He is a voracious eater and will get into any food\nor snacks left unattended, but doesn't beg while you eat. He does not bark even when there are sudden noises or a knocking at the door. He does not pull on his leash towards other dogs on walks. He was able to play with another medium-sized dog off-leash with no issues. He is good on the leash and does not pull too hard. He was in the shelter for 19 months :( He was rescued in Tustin and is currently in Lake Forest",

He would love to greet you every day when you come home from work or school. Jacque will be a good fit for most homes. He's friendly, good with children and most dogs, he doesn't bark a lot and is doing very well on his house training. If you would like to make Jacque your new best friend please fill out an adoption application today!!!Please read the animal bios completely before requesting additional information as we do our best to answer the most frequently ask questions in these bios. \n\nIn order to adopt one of our animals an application must be submitted and approved. You can find these applications by going to http://humanemorgan.org/index.php?page=adoption \n\nABOUT ADOPTING FROM THE HSMC: \nThe shelter address is 1170 Fairground Rd. Madison, GA 30650. For more information on any of our pets, please feel free to email us at INFO@HUMANEMORGAN.ORG give us a call at 706-343-9977. \nAll dogs are heartworm negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nAll cats are FeLv/FIV negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nWe are open 10am-5pm Monday-Saturday, we schedule our last adoption at 4pm everyday to allow our staff enough time to feed and walk dogs. \nWe are an animal shelter and therefore are not able to individually potty train our residents. Many adult dogs do arrive \"\"house broken\"\" however due to animal behavior any change in environment will make an emotional impact on the animals and therefore initiate unwanted behaviors during the acclamation period. Please keep this in mind. Puppies do not have the biological maturity to maintain absolute bladder or bowel control and will require a certain degree of potty training and house breaking. Please consider the time and commitment it takes to provide the necessary building blocks for these special babies, prior to submitting your application. \nIf you have any questions please email us at info@humanemorgan.org and provide name of the animal you are interested in, in the subject line. \nThank you, HSMC Staff \n\nADOPTION FEES Adoption Fees may change without notice. Always verify the fee when finalizing the adoption. \n~ Cats and Kittens ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $100 \n* 1-5 Years = $75 \n* Over 5 Years = $50 \n** Purebred cats and kittens may be subject to special pricing \n\n~ Mix Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $200 \n* 1 -3 Years = $175 \n* 4-8 Years = $150 \n* Over 8 Years = $100\n\n~ Purebred and Designer Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $375 \n* 1-3 Years = $350 \n* 4-8 Years = $275 \n* Over 8 Years = $150 \n\n~ Medical and Special Needs ~ \nWe have rescued dogs and cats which require additional medical care or that have special needs which are not life threatening. In these cases we may require a higher fee to help recoup the costs of their care while at our rescue.",

It's Wookie's his time to shine. \n*\tWe are ISO of that someone, couple or family to take Wookie into their life and show him just what LOVE is all about. \n*\tMake your appointment today to meet Wookie 803-802-0902.If you wish to meet me, please call the Humane Society of York County at (803)-802-0902 to schedule an appointment. Adoption consultations are by appointment only.\n\nPlease refer to our website for adoption requirements: https://humanesocietyofyorkcounty.org/adopt/adoption-process.html\n\nTo learn more about the HSYC, please visit our website at www.humanesocietyofyorkcounty.org, Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/HSYC.animals/, or on Instagram at HumaneSocietyofYorkCounty\n\nThank you for your support.\n\nPhotographs courtesy of Emiko at https://www.studioemikophotography.com/, Christi Menefee at ChristiMenefee.tumblr.com, and Karen Carnahan from River Art Images https://www.facebook.com/riverartimages",

My name is Flopsy and I am the sweetest, kindest, and most quiet little lady on this side of the Mississippi! I never make a peep and love everyone I meet! I personally love it when I am in my persons arms being held while getting all the snuggles!\nMy previous chapter in life resulted in me not receiving regular vet care which is why I no longer have any teeth causing my tongue to flop out, hence my name. Since leaving my past behind and joining the rescued life, I have learned what true love and compassion really means. My foster mom has helped me make huge progress from helping me become a social butterfly, as well as teaching me how to walk well on a leash! I have also learned commands like sit and lay down. I am crate trained, but since I lived in a cage previously, I prefer a gated area if I am ever left alone. Unfortunately, I am not house trained. Due to my previous life, I have developed a severe case of incontinence and will require a family who not only is home most of the day allowing me to have frequent breaks to use the restroom outside, but also understands I will likely have accidents and is willing to love me no matter what! \n\nI do well with other dogs, cats and older children.\n\nI am currently on medical hold while my foster mom and I figure out the best way to help with my need of frequent restroom breaks, but once we get a good plan in place, I will be ready to find my forever family!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting the sweet and cuddly Flopsy, apply to adopt at www.causeforcanines.org Adoption fee: $195\nChildren must be 12 years old or older\nMust be an Ohio resident 25 years old or older",

With that said though, I love people and other dogs! I'm even good with kids and cats! I actually would do best in a home with an established dog because they can really show me the ropes. I deserve a happy home since I started off in a hoarding situation during the first part of my life where I was neglected and not taken care of. Please show me what it is like to live in a happy, quiet, healthy home! I am learning so many new and wonderful things from my foster home right now!\n\nIn order to meet me, you must make an appointment by emailing training@animalrescueneworleans.org.\n\nMy adoption fee is $200. This includes a spay/neuter, up-to-date vaccines, deworming, a microchip, a heartworm test, and, if needed, heartworm treatment.\n\n________________________________________________\n\nFor all animals that have not been spayed or neutered a $100 deposit will be required in addition to the adoption fee. The deposit is refundable upon completion of the spay / neuter surgery.\n\nFor more information email: adopt@animalrescueneworleans.org.\n\nTo complete an application, please visit: https://animalrescueneworleans.org/adoptfoster/.\n\nPlease visit our facebook for more information about adoption specials, and adoption events. Events are a great way to meet multiple animals at a time!",

She was in a home with a drug addict and was fed Meth. Itty went through stomach pumping and medicinal and physical therapy to overcome what she went through.\n\nItty Bitty has been with both male and female dogs , she can be bossy and I'm sure wouldn't like all dogs. With proper slow introductions and with a non reactive playmate, she would likely do well. She chases cats. She's very people friendly but gets nervous during changes. Proper decompression time is a must.\nShe's house and crate trained, good with the foster's kids. She don't like being left outside long periods unless you are with her. She rides great in a car, and will play in baby pools with supervision\n\nWe would love to bring her here in mid January if she has a place to go. Need a dedicated foster or adopter to do so! Priority does go to applicant that can bring her to at least one vet visit in Golden Valley, Minnesota. Please apply on our website mattysheartandsoulanimalrescue.rescuegroups.org.\n\nNicole sent November 23 at 9:36 A\nShes house and crate trained, good with my kids.

The first few chapters of Sugar's story is sad but we are sure the second half  - all the way to the finale will be a happy one! Sugar was born deaf or possibly mostly deaf (we are checking). And sadly her owner mistreated her. Extended family came in and rescued her and Sugar showed her gratitude with big pup kisses and a wagging tail. An amazing rescue group took her in and before she knew it -Sugar was on a plane to Washington! She just arrived here ready to start her new life! Those ears of hers might not catch every sound. But along with her sparkling eyes and white coat make her look like she might be part Bunny! \n\nSugar will need a special home with a dog experienced family. A family with experience with training deaf dogs would be the best or maybe some sign language experience? Sugar has a lifetime of love to give to her forever family! Her DOB is 6/8/17 and she weighs 40 lbs.\n\nSugar's adoption fee is $259. This includes the Spay surgery, age appropriate current vaccines , microchip, and preventative flea treatment. .\n\nFor any questions regarding the application process visit our website https://www.sunnyskysshelter.org/our-adoption-process . If you have other questions you can email info@sunnyskysshelter.org .If you have not received a reply in 48 hours please verify your email address. Emailed questions are typically answered within 24 hours.\n\nThank you for your interest in one of our rescue pets. During this unprecedented time we venture into the unknown together and we thank you for your understanding and patience during this process. Together we are working toward the same goal of providing forever homes for all our furry friends.",

She is good with other dogs with proper introductions. She is also good with older children; she has a lot of energy so the littles can be pushed over easily. Definitely no cats though. A volunteer of the shelter took her in to give her more time and is now being told that since she did not get rescue, she must be euthanized. We would love to bring her here in mid January if she has a place to go. Need a dedicated foster or adopter to do so! Priority does go to applicant that can bring her to at least one vet visit in Golden Valley, Minnesota. Please apply on our website mattysheartandsoulanimalrescue.rescuegroups.org.",

I will need to be crated when left home alone and would prefer a home where someone is home more often than not.\nI am a social boy who is good with all people: men, women, & young children. I will seek affection and enjoy being loved on. I will happily welcome visitors into our home!\n*I enjoy playing with other dogs although I can get very rough in my wrestling style and insist on playing, so I would do best by myself or with a large, playful female. I will easily jump a fence if I see a dog outside of my yard, so I will require a 6-foot privacy fence at my home. I cannot go to a home with cats.\nI walk fairly well on the leash, ride well in the car, and am high energy so I would love to be a companion for adventures! I like to play with my toys too.\nI'm a happy boy looking for my perfect forever home with an active family. Could that be with you?\nFollow me on Facebook: #EchoDogLuca\nFor more information, please contact adoptions@echodogs.org.\n\nEcho Dogs fosters dogs in many states. Visit www.echodogs.org/available-dogs to see more of our dogs. Transportation for the adopted dog IS available. Remember, we are an all-volunteer foster rescue organization - we DO NOT have a physical shelter to visit. Our minimum adoption donation is $300. All dogs are spayed/neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations and micro-chipped. Puppies under 6 months old may not be spayed/neutered. This would be the responsibility of the adopter at their own expense. Proof of spay/neuter will be required!\nTo review our adoption procedure and submit an online application, visit: www.echodogs.org/procedure",

            "description": "MEET MONTY!!\n\nUnderdog Rescue does not physically have this dog in it's possession. He is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4381702.\n\nMonty is a aging gentleman looking for his forever home. He loves attention from people. He knows sit and how to take treats gently. Despite his age he's an active boy who loves long walks, running and would be a great addition to an active home. He's still got a lot of pep in his step. Monty has been able to be friends with calm and easy going dogs at the shelter, but has shown some reactiveness to rowdy and rough dogs. If you have another pup at home, please bring him to the shelter for a meet and greet. Monty loves walks and does pull a bit on the leash according to volunteers, so he will need some help learning good leash manners. He does like treats, so that will help with any training endeavors.\n\nTo visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show, and we have seen that you can generally show up and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog and the shelter will squeeze you in, except from 12-3PM or closer to the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

            "description": "This is Nubz!  He's a big, beefy adult, possibly some sort of bull-dog (mastiff?) mix.  He was found cruising around Ace Hardware wearing a harness with a rope attached.  No one came to claim this big, friendly mutt-mutt, and he's looking for a new home.  He's a strong guy, but settles down nicely for his walks once he gets away from the kennels.  He knows how to \"sit\" and will also jump for a treat, but doesn't seem to have had much other training.  He doesn't appreciate other dogs getting up in his face through the kennel door, but otherwise seems fairly indifferent to the other dogs.  Although he hasn't really played yet, we can see that he does have a playful side, yet to come out!  Come check out Nubs and our other dogs available for adoption at 2650 Washington Blvd, Crescent City, CA 95531.\n\nPlease call us at (707) 464-7235 for additional information.

Single male with diverse coloring (Brown/black/white Boxer) seeking a forever relationship! My name is Hank, and I like long walks on the beach (or just around the neighborhood), rides in the car, home cooked candlelight dinners by the fire, and snuggling up to watch a movie with you! Here's some fun facts about me - I love to dance, I'm a strong supporter of the 5 second rule, I think kale is overrated, and I'm probably on Santa's naughty list. Sometimes I put on my devil horns instead of my halo. But most of the time it's the halo.\n\nYou don't have to worry about me chewing up your shoes, peeing in the house, pooping in your shoes or any of those puppy things as I have definitely outgrown those young puppy urges. I'm currently in a foster home sleeping on a nice bed, having nutritious meals & treats, and getting lots of love. Don't get me wrong, I love this lady taking care of me, but I'm really hopeful that there is someone looking for their own dog, a forever friend so to speak!\n\nIf you are willing to make me a member of your family I promise to in return to shower you with lots of Boxer love. I will be your best friend and constant companion! I'll be honest I want to be in a family type of relationship, but I need slow introductions. My ideal family would have another large dog for me to play with that is not an alpha. I really don't like cats, so they and small dogs are a no-no for me. When it comes to humans though I like both men and women but, need slow introductions. As I mentioned I'm one to favor nice relaxing walks, a day of nosing around the yard or basking in the sun, but I may surprise you now and then with some zoomies around the yard just to keep life interesting! I'm starting to show my love of toys, but usually wait for my foster brother to entice me. I also like chewing on a good big bone.\n\nI really am enjoying the good life that my foster mom is giving me. I have heard her say I have the most beautiful, soulful eyes. It's always nice to hear a compliment now and then right? I will admit that I'm rather scared while I'm on my leash walking and I react to people and dogs. My foster mom says a reactive dog class would be highly recommended. I really do love those who love me back. Don't worry if I follow you around while you do your thing - it's just me making sure that you know I'm around if you need me.\n\nI would love to be your Boxer, your friend and forever companion. I would do best in a house with older children, no small dogs or cats and with a strong leader who is willing to be positive in reinforcing my learning. Do I sound like the boy for you?

She is fully vetted, walks great on a leash, loves to cuddle with her humans.\nOlive needs to be the only dog in the home, and preferably no cats.\nShe has an amazing ability to jump pretty high, so a tall fence and secured yard is a must for Olive.\nShe is very loyal to her person and loves to be by your side, so Olive would make a great companion for a calm/quiet household with no young children.\n\nIf interested in adopting Olive, please fill out our adoption application online:  www.salvagedsoulspetrescue.org",

            "description": "Michelle is going to make an exceptional dog for her furever family! About 1-3 years old and 42 lbs, this hound girl is as sweet and gentle as they come. She does well with kids and would be a great addition to a young family. She is reserved when meeting new people and in new situations, but quickly warms up and will begin asking for pets. Grab a spot next to her on the couch and snuggle up for cuddle time. She responds well to praise, and of course, treats. She is always happy and eager to make new dog friends and would be great in a multi-pet home, as she also gets along with cats. If her furry housemates don't want to play, she'll happily entertain herself with toys. Michelle walks well on the leash and would be content with an easy walk around the block each day or to go on longer hikes in the woods. She does have a strong hound nose and when she picks up a scent, she's inclined to follow it!\nMichelle enjoys practicing her\ndoggy yoga and then\neither retreat to her crate for a nap or curl up into a ball on the couch. Michelle happily takes her meals in her crate and will head there when she knows it's mealtime. She also rides well in the car.\nWill you be the lucky household to love her and receive all the love she has to give in return?!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

She\u2019s also on an anti-inflammatory for arthritis which she will need lifelong. Dr. Julia reported she was perfect while at the Vet...good girl Lady!\n.\nHealthcare for Homeless Animals provided funding for her #ForeverYoungSeniorWellnessExam at Malibu Coast Animal Hospital, where it was confirmed that she had mammary masses, and this is likely due to never being spayed ?. Most recently Lady had surgery to remove one mammary chain & she was finally spayed.\n.\nHere's some great news: her mammary masses were benign!! ? Next,  Lady will return to see Dr.Julia and have her other mammary chain removed along with dental work. ?  \n.\nPretty Lady is a sweet girl & soon to be breast cancer survivor, who rides fantastic in a car,  and adores being with her volunteer friends. Lady is available for meet & greets to find her forever and ever home! ?  She is a sweet sheppie who is looking for a family with older children (MS age & up), a calm dog companion is ok. \n.\nPlease email agoura@animalcare.lacounty.gov to meet Lady!\n\nagoura@animalcare.lacounty.gov \n(Please include your contact number)",

I think toys are awesome and would love a person who can throw a ball or a stick for me - I really like sticks. I need some work on my manners, like not jumping and play biting. I've been doing much better about not play biting, and if you have a bone or a toy nearby I will quickly redirect my attention. I have a lot of pep in my step, so a person who can give me lots of exercise and is patient enough to work with me on training would be the best for me. I am a very smart boy, and my foster dad says I learned how to do \"sit\" and \"paw\" very quickly. I have also not had any accidents in his house, so I appear to be mostly or completely housebroken. I can get curious when left alone and might chew up some stuff I find, so crating me when you're away is a must for now. I do cry a little bit in my crate, but after a while I tucker myself out and fall asleep. I likely have too much energy for cats or very small children, though I do think kids are great fun. If you want a playful, spunky boy with lots of love to give, I would love to come home and play with you.",

AND you MUST submit our online application, please CLICK HERE or copy & paste this link: http://www.nyabandonedangels.com/adopt-or-foster-application\n\nCalling all Beagle lovers...\n\nHappy #Tongue out Tuesday with Rocky Road! This very friendly and affectionate 9 month old Beagle is available for adoption at AACSR. Rocky was living in a shed since he was three months old. He was being trained for hunting. Rocky was an unhappy pup, he was not interested in hunting and could be heard whining and howling day and night for his freedom. His owner decided to surrender him to rescue.\n\nRocky will need time, patience and positive reinforcement training to get acclimated to a home environment. We think he will be a quick study! He is good with other dogs. We are not sure how he is with cats, birds and other small animals. Rocky is a sweet boy and eager to please. Since Beagles can be runners and diggers, we would prefer a home with a secure fenced in yard. He would not do well in an apartment. We believe Rocky would\nbenefit with another dog in the home to teach him the ropes. Rocky is currently being vetted and will be available for foster/adoption in two weeks. Please submit your online application at www.nyabandonedangels.com ASAP to bring this Rocky Road home and give him the love and life he deserves!",

AND you MUST submit our online application, please CLICK HERE or copy & paste this link: http://www.nyabandonedangels.com/adopt-or-foster-application\n\nCalling all Beagle lovers...\n\nHappy #Tongue out Tuesday with Rocky Road! This very friendly and affectionate 9 month old Beagle is available for adoption at AACSR. Rocky was living in a shed since he was three months old. He was being trained for hunting. Rocky was an unhappy pup, he was not interested in hunting and could be heard whining and howling day and night for his freedom. His owner decided to surrender him to rescue.\n\nRocky will need time, patience and positive reinforcement training to get acclimated to a home environment. We think he will be a quick study! He is good with other dogs. We are not sure how he is with cats, birds and other small animals. Rocky is a sweet boy and eager to please. Since Beagles can be runners and diggers, we would prefer a home with a secure fenced in yard. He would not do well in an apartment. We believe Rocky would\nbenefit with another dog in the home to teach him the ropes. Rocky is currently being vetted and will be available for foster/adoption in two weeks. Please submit your online application at www.nyabandonedangels.com ASAP to bring this Rocky Road home and give him the love and life he deserves!",

EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

Now he is lucky to be at Furkids looking for a new family. He is as gentle as a dog can be and rarely barks. He walks perfectly on a leash and gets along well with other dogs at the shelter. He is a little bit shy when first meeting people, but warms up quickly. Once he is comfortable he loves to play and snuggle with his people. Pinto P would be a wonderful family dog or companion to someone that enjoys walks in the neighborhood, followed by a night of binge-watching movies on the couch. Pinto P weighs 52 lbs., but is definitely overweight and needs to lose a few pounds. He's 8 yrs. old (est. birth date 12/31/2012) and his adoption fee is $275. If you want more information about Pinto P, please submit a survey at https://furkids.org/dog-adoptions/application. At this time, meeting our dogs is by appointment only.

            "description": "Meet Loretta!\n\nCattle dogs are typically described as feisty, active dogs. While that may be true, my foster mom says I'm the perfect balance. I can walk a few miles on a leash, I can play chase with my resident dog for quite a while, or I can hang out at home and chew bones and tear up cardboard boxes (thank you Amazon). I am about 9 months old and currently weigh 27lbs. If I don't say so myself, I have the cutest set of ears you have ever seen! \n\nI currently live with one large dog and five pretty calm children. I love my foster mom too, but I don't need to follow her around all day because I'm pretty independent. As long as my crate is in your bedroom, I'll sleep in it quietly through most the night. I don't like my crate during the day, so my foster mom allows me to stay in the kitchen but has a pee pad by the door...... Just in case. I'm mostly potty trained but if you miss my cue, I might pee by the door! \n\nI'm also pretty smart! I already know the commands: sit, stay, and down. I am very food/treat motivated and I'll work hard for it. If my forever home has another dog, it should be a dog who can keep me in line while I'm learning the boundaries of play. Since I don't love my crate during the day, it would be great if someone was home to take care of me. \n\nEven though I'm a bit older, you have to remember I'm just a puppy and I'm still learning all the rules. I'm cautious and curious about new people/dogs so I'll bark at them until I know they are \"ok\" My shelter name is Loretta but my favorite nickname is Rosie!\n\nOur standard adoption fee is $375 cash or check and $385 credit card ($10 processing fee).   It includes spay/neuter when age appropriate at our participating vets, age appropriate core vaccinations, fecal testing, deworming, flea and tick preventative,1st vet visit at one of our participating vets, and micro-chipping.\n\nWe must have an application, conduct a phone interview, and meet your entire family to approve an adoption. Please email adopt@safehavendogsIL.org for an application or additional details.\n\nPlease note that the breeds and sizes posted in this biography are educated best guesses and are not guaranteed.",

            "description": "Linus is a big, lanky, and lovable guy. Linus lets his nose guide the way and is happiest when he has ample opportunities to sniff all the good smells in the world. He would probably excel at nosework classes and would love to use his sniffer to solve food puzzles. Linus is an affectionate pup who enjoys leaning in for gentle hugs...and true to being a Weimaraner, he has mastered the art of the ''standing hug''! Linus demonstrates many of the other traits of his breed: friendly, curious, and intelligent. Despite being a senior, Linus is still a very active dog who would do best in a family that can best meet his needs by providing him with an enriching life and helping him learn basic manners through positive reinforcement training. Linus gets along easily with other dogs and could likely co-exist peacefully with another friendly dog in the home. No cats or chickens please; they are too fun to chase! Because of his size and energy level, Linus would do best in a home without young children.",

Wishbone is a very sweet boy that lost his home after his parents could no longer afford to care for him (UGH!).  Wishbone has no clue what happened or how he lost his forever home as he is such a good boy! He walks great on a leash and would be a fantastic walking partner for his  new parent(s) (as he could stand to lose a couple of pounds; although, if you ask him he will tell you it is all muscle-approximately 70 lbs).  Wishbone would be a loyal companion and is deserving of a home and a life overflowing with love.  He still has the best years of his life to offer his new parent(s).  Please, consider adopting this beautiful,  happy puppy dog!!  He needs a happy ever after!\n\nIf you would like to meet one of our Homeless Pets at the Town and Country Veterinary Clinic it is best to fill out an application first and schedule an appt.

I definitely want my furever home to have furry friends for me. I\u2019m so much more confident with them than the fur-free ones in the house and they help me to understand how I\u2019m supposed to do this dog thing. Each day I\u2019m becoming more confident for my own home. When I was in the shelter, I was really shut down and my rescue has no idea what happened to me in my past to make me so scared but they promised me They would make sure I\u2019m protected for the rest of my doggie days. I am fully vetted now and heartworm negative. I haven\u2019t had any accidents in my foster home for two weeks now but she makes sure I get to go out often and praises me when I go potty outside. Foster mom says I\u2019m the best snuggler and I\u2019m so pretty that lots of people should want to love me. I hope she\u2019s right. Is it with you? Below are some things I need for a new home. Please don\u2019t pass me by because I\u2019m still skiddish right now. I will get better with time my people said and I have already overcame to much. I would flinch when someone petted me before and stayed in the corner at the shelter. If interested in me, please contact my rescue ASAP. I really want a real home of my own to live in forever and ever. \nLove \nSable \n\n-",

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please download and complete an Adoption Questionnaire from our website and email Debbie at debbied@k-9lifesavers.org\n\nYou can learn about the adoption process and find a Word, PDF and ONLINE version of the questionnaire by visiting: http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/howtoadopt/.\n\nDog's Name: Ricky\n\nEstimated Breed : Hound Mix\n\nApproximate Age: 3 years\n\nApproximate Weight: approx. 53 lbs\n\nCurrently Living at: Boarding\n\nAdoption Fee: $375\n\nDOG'S DESCRIPTION\n\nRicky is handsome boy who loves kids and is searching for a loving forever home where he can run, play and be your best buddy. Unfortunately, Ricky is heartworm positive and will need treatment. The cost for his treatment will be covered by K-9 Lifesavers at Our Vet. Ricky is not suited for apartment life and would do best in a home with a fenced yard in the suburbs. Ricky does get along with female dogs but would do best in a home as the only dog. Do you have a place in your heart for this handsome guy?\n\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\n\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\n\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\n\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\n\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\n\nPlease \"like\" our\nFacebook Page\nfor the most current events and new dogs.\n\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

If you like to exercise and learn new things, I'm right there with you. I already know several commands, enjoy playing fetch, kennel trained and am great walking on a leash. Going for daily walks or runs would be the best, and a fenced yard would be fun to have, as well. I am great with kids, cats, and other dogs, as long as they're calmer type, but I could also be an only pet. One interesting fact about me is I survived Parvo as a little puppy, so will need a special food for the rest of my life. \nIf you want a new best friend, I'm waiting for you to apply at: AHeinz57.com",

            "description": "MEET ETHEL!\n\nThis super special, super cute little lady is named Ethel! Ethel is an ~11 year old Poodle/Yorkie mix (our best guess) was rescued by Pennsylvania's Humane Law Enforcement during a neglect case. She spent a whole year in the shelter until her court case was resolved\u00a0in Spring, 2020!\n\nNeedless to say, Ethel had a lot of making up to do and she has! When she entered the shelter it was discovered that she was diabetic and started insulin. Ethel formed cataracts due to the diabetes which resulted in blindness. Once we knew that her diabetes was regulated, we discovered that she was a candidate for cataract-removal surgery! She had surgery with an opthamologist this winter and while was already a happy, sweet girl, getting her sight back has transformed her back into a puppy!\u00a0\n\nEthel is happily living in foster care with other dogs and has met both large and small dogs while with the rescue. The kitties she lives with take the opportunity to snuggle with her whenever possible and Ethel doesn't mind one bit! One silly thing about Ethel is that she LOVES to hop into planters, baskets, anywhere she can curl up into a ball! Her favorite thing to do though, is snuggle up with her human friends! She'll happily hop into your lap or cuddle up next to you on the couch. Now that she has her sight back, Ethel really enjoys bouncing around and playing with the other pups and toys. She's an easy-going girl with mild manners and the sweetest disposition.\n\nEthel receives 2 units of insulin twice a day (with breakfast and dinner). She's a good girl who has no issues receiving her injections. While her diabetic needs have not changed during her time with City of Elderly Love, it's not uncommon for diabetic pets to need their insulin amounts tweaked over time. It's important that she receives her regular veterinary checkups. She's also completely housebroken! This sweetie will be an easy addition to most families!\n\nEthel is available for adoption through City of Elderly Love. She is spayed, vaccinated and microchipped. She has also received a dental cleaning and is heart worm\u00a0negative. Interested in adopting her? Visit www.cityofelderlylove.org to complete an adoption questionnaire or email is at info@cityofelderlylove.org!",

This big boy is around 4-5 years old and is friendly, although he's scared when you first meet him,  Andre does okay on a leash, but he's very strong and will pull hard if he sees a cat, dog, or squirrel. Andre likes tennis balls and squeaky toys, and he LOVES to run around in the fenced yard. He has come such a long way in a short time, and with some patience, he will be a loyal companion. He is very treat and food motivated. He will need to be an only pet in his new home.  If you would like to meet this handsome boy, please email the shelter at cchs04@sbcglobal.net and request an application.",

She is on the mend now and putting on a bit of weight, although she will always have a petite frame.   She is about four years old and weighs around forty pounds.  Sweet Tea is desperate for love and affection and is an excellent cuddler.  She loves to go for walks and car rides,  is still playful and runs like the wind.  But she enjoys her couch time and snuggling.  We think she could do well in an apartment and would be ideal for anyone who needs a loving companion.",

I'm feeling a lot better now, and if you know who I belong to, I would love to return home. If no one comes forward with proof of ownership to claim me, I will need a new loving home. I am a medium-sized dachshund/hound mix that gets along with other dogs and kids. I travel well and appear to be housetrained. Let Pet Savers know if you know my previous owners!\n\nFee $100If you are interested in adopting, please visit petsaversshreveport.org and find our adoption application under the 'Dogs' tab. Completed applications can be emailed to our Adoption Team at petsavers@petsaversshreveport.org - all adoptions require a vet reference.

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please download and complete an Adoption Questionnaire from our website and email Debbie at debbied@k-9lifesavers.org\nYou can learn about the adoption process and find a Word, PDF and ONLINE version of the questionnaire by visiting: http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/howtoadopt/.\nDog's Name: Texas\nEstimated Breed : Cattle Dog Mix\nApproximate Age: 1 year\nApproximate Weight: approx. 59 lbs\nCurrently Living at: Boarding\nAdoption Fee: $300\nDOG'S DESCRIPTION\nTexas is a sweet guy who is looking for a loving forever home where he can run, play and be your best buddy. Please consider opening your heart and home to this happy fellow. Texas gets along great with people but does not realize how big and strong he is, so he would be best suited in a home with older children. Texas does know a several commands. While Texas is dog friendly, he does have a dominant personality and would do best as an only dog. Texas is very active and needs a home with a fenced yard and a family that can provide him with lots of exercise. Texas is too active for apartment life.\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

            "description": "Natalia is living in a foster home. Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet her.\n\nNatalia is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~1 year\nWeight: ~53lbs\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate trained: Working on it! Takes some time to settle, but overall doing well with her cratetraining\nDog sociability: Selective with her dog friends. May be a match for some, but not all. She doesn't do well meeting dogs while on leash, but has done well with the dog in her foster home.\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Unknown\nIdeal home: Natalia is an active adolescent dog looking for an active adopter! She will need daily mental and physical exercise. She is frustrated/reactive to other dogs on walks and would prefer a quieter neighborhood where she can work on her leash skills. \n\nNatalia is a wiggly teenager looking for a fun and energetic home! She loves to play and cuddle, but crates very well when its time to settle down. She's big and strong, but likes to think she's a lap dog, so be prepared for her to give you a lot of attention! Natalia is house-broken and hasn't had any accidents in her foster home. Seeing other dogs on walks is quite overstimulating for this gal, so she's hoping to find a home that can work on some good leash manners. She has done great with the other dog inside her foster home and playing in the yard. Natalia is a spunky sweetheart that will steal your heart in a matter of seconds!\n\nNatalia's adoption fee is 300. She will be spayed on a future date (2/22/21) and a 50 refundable spay deposit will be required. She is up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. She will require booster vaccines at the adopter's expense. \n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please download and complete an Adoption Questionnaire from our website and email shannonb@k-9lifesavers.org\n\nYou can learn about the adoption process and find a Word, PDF and ONLINE version of the questionnaire by visiting: http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/howtoadopt/.\n\nDog's Name: Emma\n\nEstimated Breed : Collie and Husky Mix\n\nApproximate Age: 3 years\n\nApproximate Weight: approx. 37 lbs\n\nCurrently Living at: Foster\n\nAdoption Fee: $300\n\nDOG'S DESCRIPTION\n\nMeet Emma! She is a cutie who is searching for a loving forever home where she can run, play and be your best buddy. Her ideal home would be one with a yard, or someone that could take for walks several times a day and no other pets. Other dogs are not her cup of tea so no dog park for this girl! Right now Emma is not very trusting of men but her foster family is working with her on this. For this reason an apartment setting would not be an option for her. Because of this she will need someone who has the patience to continue to work on this with her and is an experienced dog owner. She is medium energy and super inquisitive. If you give her a chance she will no doubt win you over with the fact she is smart, learns fast, and did we mention adorable?\n\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\n\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\n\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\n\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\n\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\n\nPlease \"like\" our\nFacebook Page\nfor the most current events and new dogs.\n\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

I am a part of the Tacoma Trio who came in after my owner passed away. I am so grateful for a place to stay, but I am now ready for a home to call my own. \n\nI am good with other dogs and still have a lot of play in me. Oh wait, before I get into all the ways in which I am the perfect dog for you, I must tell you something first. I am intact, meaning I still have the \u201cfamily jewels\u201d if you know what I mean. This is not usual practice to adopt an intact pup from rescue, but it is in my best interest. My heart might not handle the anesthesia well, which would make neutering me a health risk. The decision was made to keep the jewels and find me a good home with someone who would be responsible, who will make sure I don\u2019t have little Whitey\u2019s running around. A fence is a must! \n\nIf you are still reading and I haven\u2019t scared you off, let me tell you all about the qualities that make me perfect for you. Like I mentioned, I am good with other dogs. I am not very vocal, but I do like to bark to get other dogs to chase me. It\u2019s all in good fun. I could be an only dog in my new home but having a playmate would make me very happy. \n\nI share my toys and food. I am great on a leash and harness and all people love me. Although I have not had any formal training, I do not jump up and I ride in the car like a champ. I am crate trained and potty trained. I don\u2019t love baths, but I tolerate them if I need one. Luckily, white boxers can run through a mud puddle, and if you simply wait a moment, I will turn white again like magic. \n\nI am one hunky boy and have so much love to give. I have not experienced a lot of things in my life so I may be a little hesitant with new experiences, but with positive reinforcement, I will give you my all. My coat is soft, and I am affectionate. I am just waiting to get together so we can start our future together. If you think I\u2019m the boy for you, please send in an adoption application \u2013 https://www.mustluvboxersrescue.com/adopt.",

            "description": "Hi my name is Tamale, cuz I'm a hot one! I\u2019m 3 years old and 10 lbs! I will need a home without kids. I am a little thing that will need time to adjust in a new environment. I\u2019m a little nervous when you go to touch me with your hands ( AND WILL BITE YOU), but I like when you run your toes on me (see video). So far the bes trick with Tamale is to leave a leash on him at all times so you can \"handle him\" without really touching him. He i smore like a cat.. and only wants to be touched on his own terms.\n\nJan 20, 2021 - I bit a volunteer on the hand when they went to take the leash off my collar.\n\nYou can come adopt me or even join our foster program to help the humans learn all the awesome things about new dogs like me! Learn more on our website! \n\nHope to see you soon! \n\nWhat breed am I? Mixed mutt! ODHS does not breed label (unless there\u2019s official paperwork), as studies show it is nearly impossible to tell the exact breed of each dog based off of their appearance.\n\nEducational articles:\n3/3/3 Rule;\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturdays. \nOur adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience.  Currently, the average timeframe for a response to your application is 1 week.\n\nLike us on Facebook \"Old Dominion Humane Society\"\nand be a part of promoting forever homes for dogs in need.\n#Adopt #Donate #Foster #Volunteer \n\nNote: ODHS only adopts to Virginia and surrounding states (including D.C.). A $50 out of state fee applies.",

Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet him.\n\nEros is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~ 1-2yr\nWeight: ~ 45lbs\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate trained: Eros does best being confined to one area, he will cry a bit (20mins+) but settles down eventually. He would do best in a home that has thick walls/won't have noise complaints.\nDog sociability: Unknown at this time - may be selective, and prefer a small friend circle. On walks he is leash reactive and barks/lunges at other dogs.\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Not recommended for a home with kids. Eros is working on some stranger danger.\nIdeal home: Eros would prefer a lowkey household in a lowkey neighborhood. He'd love to work on becoming a more confident dog and would love an adopter excited to work on training!\n\nEros is such a loving, good boy who only wants to hang out with his human(s). Oddly, his favorite part of the day is training time, because he loves getting rewarded with tasty treats and is quick to learn new skills. He's an energetic pup, but is happy to nap the day away or entertain himself with toys while his human is busy. But make sure you don't skip cuddle time after work; he lives for it! He is a bit timid of new people and prefers slower introductions with high value treats. Walks can be a bit overstimulating for him so he prefers quiet/residential side streets or if you've got a yard even better! Your day won't be complete without Eros' curious head-tilts and tippy-tappy paws, and you won't get enough of looking into those beautiful eyes.\n\nEros is heartworm positive and will be undergoing treatment at our Ellis Veterinary Clinic. OTAT will cover the cost of his treatment until he is heartworm negative. He is currently in the Doxy phase of his treatment and will be due for injections on these dates: Injection 1 - 2/10/2020\nInjections 2 & 3 - 3/12 & 3/13. For information on the heartworm treatment process, visit: onetail.org/heartworm\n\nEros' adoption fee is 300. He will be neutered on a future date and a 50 refundable neuter deposit will be required. He is up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm positive.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***\"",

He is happy, energetic, playful and affectionate. He loves to cuddle and charms every person he meets. He's very curious and adventurous. He just loves life.\n\nHe's incredibly cute and has the most expressive ears.\n\nGobi is very smart and good at getting around. He can go up stairs and jump up on things, but is too nervous to go down stairs. He can follow noises VERY well!\n\nGobi loves his own name - he lights up whenever he hears it. He's the only dog I've ever met who I would describe as \"charismatic.\" There's just something about him that people fall in love with him instantly.\n\nThis little dog was starving as a stray when he was found in Baton Rouge, and he shows signs of having been abused in the past. His positive attitude is all the more inspiring. He's a little survivor.\n\nGobi is currently being treated for heartworm.\nBDRA has voted against the use of electrical fencing effective immediately.",

It took us months before we could win her trust but with a lot of patience and lots of treats we gained her trust . \n\nArenya snapped and was clearly over and over beaten on her face . X-rays were taken to see if she had no injuries but she was cleared out . \n\nShe is now ready to a forever home with a GERMAN SHEPHERD EXPERIENCED OWNER . \n\nShe is an alpha female and can be dominant . SHe does not like other dogs or cats .  Adopter can not have children or having children on the property . \n\nAdopter will be checked out by our trainer and has to follow a few training lessons BEFORE we adopt out . This is to protect HER . \n\nWe only want SERIOUS adopters who are willing to give her trust and patience . Potential adopter has to understand that a snap still can happen. SHe did not do it for months now . \n\nArenya is located in Middle Island . \n\nTo become her new family please contact us and we will send you the adoption application . \n\nEvery non serious application will be ignored",

            "description": "Sally is a remarkable 2 year old American Pit Bull Terrier and Boxer mix in need of a new home. Sally was surrendered to the shelter with her baby when their family suffered the loss of their home in a house fire. Sally is very sweet, kind and gentle but is quite strong on a leash. She does much better when walked with a harness, but will require some work on this. Sally enjoys being in the company of her people and doesn't seem to mind other dogs so far.\n\nTo view the adoptable dogs at our shelter, you must fill out an adoption application found on our website. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are showing dogs on an appointment only basis. Please understand that we are receiving a high volume of applications at this time and are doing our best to address as many as we can. Please be patient. Thank you.\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs is $250. Aside from the shelter, food and water, exercise and compassion they receive while in our care, this also includes veterinary services such as Rabies, Distemper+Lepto, Bordetella, H3N2/H3N8 Influenza, heartworm testing, fecal exams, preventions and deworming medications. Spays/Neuters are also included as part of the adoption fee as is microchipping. \nPuppies under the age of 6 months have an adoption fee of $350. The veterinary services rendered include puppies first round of vaccines, fecal exams, deworming medications, preventions, and microchipping. Our facility spays and neuters dogs at 6 months of age. If the puppy is adopted prior to his, or her prescheduled surgery date, a $200 spay/neuter deposit will be taken on the day of adoption. This deposit it refundable and will be returned to the adopter once proof of the procedure is returned to the shelter. \nCOVID-19 NOTE: Please understand that we are looking for forever home for our pets. We understand that many people have a lot of time on their hands during the COVID-19 pandemic, so this may seem like an ideal time to bring home a new pet. Please be sure you are prepared to give your new pet his, or her forever home once our lives go back to normal. They deserve it. Thank you and stay safe.",

She came to the shelter as a stray, so we don't know much about her background or how she does with other animals or kids. Kay is a very outgoing dog and she really doesn't like being left alone so she would do best with a family that doesn't leave her alone for too long at a time! Kay walks well on a leash but she doesn't seem to have had much other training so she is looking for a patient home that can help her learn her manners! Kay is also hoping to find an active family so that she doesn't get bored and cause trouble in her new home. If you are interested in meeting her, give us a call!",

My two tortie sisters are great company! We don't play, but I like watching them run and play and move around the house. I decided to not play with any toys, but I LOVE my new stuffed white bunny! It's a bunny that my tortie sister Lucy used to play with, and Lucy said I could have it. Sometimes I take bunny in my mouth and flip her in the air a few times! I love all the food I'm eating! It's boiled turkey and chicken breast, and LOTS of cooked veggies such as carrots, green beans, sweet potato, and cauliflower, with a few chunks of my dry food at each meal. Every morning I get a half or an entire banana mixed with half can of wet food and of course my cosequin. I look like I've lost some weight already! I feel great and sometimes on our walks I start to trot. I know how to sit and Mommy is teaching me other things like \"let's go left and \"turn right to see if I can learn those. (I can! I'm very intelligent and she knows!) I LOVE meeting people on our walks, even kids! I already know which house is ours and walk up the driveway on my own. Mommy tried to give me a bath in the shower two nights ago. I refused and laid down on the floor. Mommy said it's ok and she also said it makes sense because she knows I do NOT like getting wet in the rain, so she's going to rub me and brush me with a little baking soda. Aaaahhhh yesssss I love being brushed! Ok, that's all for now. It's time for another nap. I think I'll snore extra loud today! \n\nWith Love, Daisy",

            "description": "Josie is a one-year-old lab/boxer mix. She weighs about 60-65 pounds.  Josie is potty trained and loves to get outside and run. She rides well in the car and isn't a big chewer. Her favorite pastimes are playing tug-of-war and fetch. Josie would do best if she is the only dog in a home, but would be ok with another submissive dog.  She likes being queen of the castle.  Josie is deaf, however, she does seem to hear loud noises.  She knows several signs such as sit, down, come, stay, no, and free.  Josie needs a fenced yard to keep her safe. She has separation anxiety, so a family who has to leave her alone for more than 3 hours and/or lives in an apartment/townhome would not be a good match. She is not a fan of the crate, but we have been working with her and she is doing very well compared to when she came to us. We are also working on leash training.  She can be a bit pulley, but again has improved since we have been working with her. Josie is a very smart girl who responds to lots of love and affection. If you would like to meet this dog please call Teri at 630-897-7454. The adoption fee is $225.\n\nAdoption fee includes:\n- microchip\n- spay/neuter\n- age appropriate vaccinations: Bordetella, DH(L)PP, rabies\n- heartworm preventive & flea/tick preventive\n- deworming",

            "description": "This is Baloo, an approximately 2-year-old male American Bully, became a Misfit in the summer of 2020. Baloo was brought into a local shelter showing signs of severe neglect. He was covered in ticks, had untreated entropion in both eyes, and was starved to the point of being skin and bones. Baloo is neutered, up to date on all age-appropriate vaccinations and preventatives, heartworm negative, and micro-chipped. \n\nHe is house trained. He does not use a kennel but would probably be fine in one. He needs some work on leash manners but loves going for walks! He enjoys going for rides in the car, too.\n\nBaloo knows how to sit and is learning touch. He is a quick learner who can easily be trained for more commands. Due to the nature of his past neglect, he's a big fan of food. He will do just about anything for food or treats. But he doesn't want to share so make sure he's always fed in his own safe space where no other pets might intrude. \n\nBaloo lives with a 1-year-old child in his foster home and loves him very much. He has done well with kids of all ages. Due to his energy level and size, please use caution around smaller kids so that he doesn't accidentally knock them over. \n\nWe don't know for sure if Baloo likes cats but we can guess that he would like to chase them. Baloo loves to play with other dogs but it's important that they can tolerate his energy level. He doesn't always recognize cues to slow down or take it easy. Therefore he does best with very friendly and playful dogs, but he doesn't mesh as well with dogs who are more dominant or assertive.\n\nBaloo is a happy-go-lucky guy with a real zest for life. His giant ears are one of his best characteristics. We love to watch them move around like satellites as he listens to everything around him.\n\nBaloo is so well-behaved in the house that he has never been kenneled at his foster home. He is one of the best dogs we've ever had the joy of fostering. He goes to the door and barks when he needs to potty and he barks when he's ready to come back inside.\n\nBaloo enjoys sunbathing outside at times but his favorite spot is curled up on the couch. He enjoys playing fetch and tug of war. Squeaky toys bring him so much joy. He is the perfect mix of laid back and playful. He usually has a daily burst of energy that involves playing with his toys and zooming around the yard. Then the rest of the day is spent snoozing in a soft spot, preferably cuddled up with a human.\n\nBaloo is not a 'guard dog' type and rarely even gets up when someone comes in the front door. He's just a lover and will be the best snuggle buddy you've ever known. \n\nTo meet/adopt Baloo, go to http://muttmisfits.com/adoption-application/\n",

He likes an occasional walk but then likes to rest. If he can rest in your lap that would be even better. Raisin Bran would like a quiet home so no children. He gets along with his doggie friends but is fine being solo. Do you have it in your heart to give him his retirement home?\n\nInterested in meeting Raisin Bran? \n\nAll Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue dogs are in homes with foster families; we do not have a shelter where dogs are available for daily viewing.\n\nOur process is as follows:\n1.  Review our policies and adoption radius  on our website: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n2.  Submit an application for review and approval;\n3.  MPM Rescue reviews application and checks vet records and references;\n4.  MPM foster contacts approved applicant(s) to arrange a home check and meeting with available dog(s);\n5.   If there is a good fit, adoption is completed with a contract and fees (payable via check or cash).\n\nThe adoption fee is listed here: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n\nDogs from Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Age appropriate vaccinations\n- Heartworm test (for dogs over 6mo) and treatment if positive\n- Microchip\n- Deworming\n- Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\n- Any other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\n*Please note that the identified breed(s) are best guesses. We very rarely have information on our dogs' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays.*",

Ali is the one with more spots. Ali is very nervous without Sahara so we are listing them as a a pair. They would be best as the only dogs as Ali is a little dog reactive. They love playing outside and are good on a leash. We would love to find them a loving home and help them become more confident. They are up to date on shots, fully vetted, spayed/microchipped and on flea/tick and heart worm prevention. If you would like to meet these wonderful girls email us on blessedpawsanimalrescue@gmail.com or call Vickie on 561 306 9363.

            "description": "Meet Frankie, an approximately 10-year-old male miniature pinscher who became a Misfit when he and his four sisters were surrendered to a local shelter after their human died. This pet is neutered, up to date on all age-appropriate vaccinations and preventatives, heart-worm negative, and micro-chipped!\n\nWhen Frankie came to his foster parents, he was confused, sick, and neglected.  This was very stressful for him, and even more so, since he had to be kept quarantined because he had an upper respiratory infection (URI).  When he was let out of his crate, all he would do is run in circles.  When he was put back in his crate, he would spin in circles for hours until he wore himself out and fell asleep. When he was cleared of his URI, he was allowed to roam the house with his foster brothers.  After about two weeks he acclimated and began acting more normal.  He is mostly deaf but can hear very loud noises.  When he is awake, he follows humans everywhere hoping it is time for food.\n\nFrankie is good with dogs of all sizes.  He hasn\u2019t been around cats or children.  We don\u2019t think he would be a good fit with anyone elderly, or who is not stable on their feet, as he likes to run around and step on top of your feet as you walk.\n\nFrankie is not potty trained, but he will use the doggie door to go in and out.  He uses the same place in the house to potty every time on potty pads.  He gets super excited after he does his business and has to run through the house.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have a lot of teeth, but he eats a mixture of wet food and small dry kibble.  He isn\u2019t big on treats, but when his brothers get their treats, he will always be willing to accept a Ritz cracker or a piece of cheese.\n\nYou can apply to meet/adopt this pet at www.muttmisfits.com/adoption-application.\n",

Around the house he will follow you around and hang out. If you are on the couch, be prepared for endless hours of indoor ball tossing. He walks well on a leash for the most part, however he gets very excited about squirrels, deer, dogs, and cats. He will pull on the leash when he sees these things, but not excessively hard. Mostly he will jump around and whine a little. He likes to notify you when someone is at the door and gets very excited about people coming over. He is house\nand crate trained. He knows sit (we are working on other commands). He does well in his crate during the day or at night, but will whine if he is in his crate and he can see you around the house. He would do best in an active environment.",

She had a broken leg which required surgery but she is all healed and just needs a joint supplement. Mama is a sweet dog, she loves being loved on and petted but she is not great with other dogs. She s Potty trained and walks on a leash. She is fully vetted, up to date on shots, spayed/microchipped and on flea/tick and heart worm prevention. She really deserves a home where she can be loved and cared for. If you would like to meet this wonderful girl email us on blessedpawsanimalrescue@gmail.com or call Vickie on 561 306 9363.

            "description": "BACKSTORY:\nGotti was surrendered to an area animal control when his owner moved and couldn\u2019t take him with him. One of our interaction team members was there on the very day he was surrendered and committed to getting him out because animal control is no place for any dog, let alone a 9-year-old boy.\n\nHe was very sick with an antibiotic-resistant upper respiratory infection and suspected bladder infection so he was put into isolation and we weren\u2019t able to bust him out. We checked on him regularly and kept asking when we could take him.\n\nFinally, 3 months later the animal control vet said we were able to take him. and we couldn\u2019t have been more excited to have this guy leave the building and be in a loving supportive foster home and out of a cage.\n\nUnfortunately, the suspected urinary infection was looking like it was way more than that. Gotti was leaking urine and blood every time he moved. His hindquarters were lethargic and tender to the touch and he had swelling in his anal area. He was rushed to our vet who diagnosed a severe prostate infection that had probably been going on for an extremely long time, long enough that they thought he might have cancer. Luckily, it wasn't cancer, just the infection!\n\nHe is a bit slow going when first getting up and has some tenderness in his hindquarters which the vet said is arthritis and the doctors are confident in saying that Gotti will get better once he builds more muscle.\n\nEDUCATION:\n* Sit\n* Touch\n* House trained\n\nACTIVITIES THIS CUTIE ENJOYS:\n* Treats: goat cheese, peanut butter, Grandma Lucy's cookie treats\n* Food: he likes Stella & Chewy\n* Toys: hasn't shown interest in toys\n* Walks: pulls hard the entire walk\n* Cuddling\n* Sleeping\n* Chin & ear scratches\n* Calm walks in the yard\n* Lots of petting!\n* He just wants to hang out\n\nSKILLS:\n* Dogs: friendly\n* Kids: friendly\n* People: friendly\n* Cats: unknown\n\nCHALLENGES:\n* Will do best in a home without stairs\n* Can be mouthy at times\n* When bored, he's been known to chew on throw blankets\n* He is a destroyer of dog beds!",

            "description": "Meet Dolly!\n\nHard to believe that this lovely, lively, friendly little goofball is still available for adoption.  And yet, here she is...  To her chagrin, the uncontainable excitement that Dolly feels when she meets other dogs is what's most annoying to them.  She shows NO aggression.  She is absolutely WONDERFUL with people of all ages!  Dolly is waiting in Weare, NH for her forever family to come and whisk her away to a better life!  \n\nThis gorgeous, gentle girl loves to go for walks, and she walks well on a leash. She has a beautiful, soft tan coat, and she's in perfect shape.  And those amber eyes - just LOVELY!\n\nThis sweet baby was on Death Row in a high kill facility in Georgia, and with her innocent, trusting nature, she kissed the hands of those who intended to euthanize her.  \n\nDolly spent about 2 months in a foster home in GA after leaving the Animal Control facility, so she is well acclimated to living in a family environment.  She is very playful and she just loves to cuddle with her humans.  Her foster mom cried when she left to come to NH.\n\nDolly is about 1 year old, weighs 48 lbs, has all of her required vaccines, and is spayed and microchipped.\n\nHer medical records indicate that she is a Terrier mix.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this delightful young girl, please complete an adoption application at https://www.heartsandtails.org/adoption-application/.\n\nPLEASE NOTE that due to the overwhelming number of inquiries we receive daily, we can only respond to those who have completed an online application, and appear to be a good match. PLEASE check all of the fields in this profile to ensure your question hasn't already been answered as most of the information is in this profile.",

What we know so far is she walks incredibly well on a leash, she is quiet in her crate, she tolerated a bath phenomenally, and she loves to follow me everywhere. If you stop for two seconds, you better expect the kiss monster to take advantage! She is terrified of cats, but if they run, she wants to chase. So we will be working on more desensitization. She doesn't mind my other senior dogs and I will introduce her to my young pup after a little decompression, poor girl had 12 teeth pulled today (late December)! Stay tuned for BESSIE'S journey!\n\nIf you think you could give ole BESSIE the home made of dreams, apply at ADOPTASTRAY.COM!All SAAP animals are vet checked, UTD on vaccines, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, and given flea and heartworm preventative as age appropriate.\n\nOur website is: http://www.adoptastray.com/\n\nTo check if this animal is still available visit our master pet list on our website at:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/adoptable-animals/\n\nHave questions:\nPlease email us at saap@adoptastray.com for more information about this animal or to answer any questions you may have.

He gets along best with female dogs but could like with a smaller playful male too. He would love a fenced in yard to run around in and would enjoy a lot of exercise time.

I'm Active??? \n\nYou know me I am not really active kinda of fellow.... I really just enjoy laying on the couch, or laying in the sun or watching my favorite TV shows on the couch with my warm blanket. \n\nWill this active thing change any of those things ? \n\nIt means it is time for you to find your forever home and find your own family, your own couch and maybe your own TV! \n\nOh I think I get what that means... but does this have to happen now .. \n\nHere is my bio-\nI'm an 8 year old boy that likes to wander the back 40.\nBy back 40. I mean safely fence yard with water and a home to chill out in the sun while you yell for me .... \n\nYou will get a meet and greet them too ... \n\nI hope it is not during Jeopardy... Seriously I can not miss an episode . \n\nThey will have to reschedule that meet and greet thingy.... \n\nI'm going through Heartworm treatment right now and they doctor said i must relax on the couch and watch Jeopardy. \n\n Holla Rusty!!! And I will meander over. \n\nThis pair of seniors are very bonded. They were surrendered together in a shelter and Hailee would stand under Rusty for protection. They need to be kept together and be allowed to live their lives out with each other. Besties to the end. Rusty is a retriever mix and Hailee is a little chi mix. Rusty just loves exploring in the backyard and lounging in the sun. Hailee found a shady space and laid down and watched her buddy.\n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption. The standard minimum donation for puppies is $325 + 8.25% tax = $351.81, for dogs over 12 months the adoption fee is $225 + 8.25% tax = $243.66 and for our senior dogs 8 years and up is $100 + 8.25% tax = $108.25; this increase includes sales tax recently required by the State of Texas to collect. You can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallasdogrrr.org. \n\nFor more information, you can email adopt@dallasdogrrr.org. Upon receiving your application please allow us 2-3 business days to review and process.",

He has been on medical hold while undergoing multiple procedures, including medicated baths, mass removals, neutering, nail trimmings and professional training. He has come SO far and has many fans (as seen with his biggest Mohawk twin fan, April). \nNow, he is ready to find his forever family that will love him the way he deserved to be loved from day one. \nKing is 7 years old, cleared medically, neutered, UTD on vaccines and microchipped. We have been told that he lived with a female dog before, but due to medical reasons, we have not yet dog or cat tested King. Though, from a distance, King seems to prefer smaller low key females. King is very strong, but has a beautiful demeanor. Because of his strength, we would recommend no children under the age of 12. Per our trainer, \"someone will get a wonderful dog in King. He is smart, loving and wants to please!\" King has really enjoyed his training (as seen kissing his trainer in the photos), and we will be encouraging and requiring his training to continue in his forever home. \nInterested in meeting King? Apply here: https://www.theroadhomeanimalproject.org/companion-adoption-form-pdf.html\n\n*Note: ALL members of the family (canine and human alike) MUST be present for any meet and greet.\nCheck out our Facebook page for more information and photo updates: facebook.com/trhap2014",

Poor Steele ended up wounded, homeless, and in a county shelter. That's where we spotted him and knew we had to have him. Steele was adopted back in September, but the owner wasn't able to give him what he needs: structure and experience. Steele needs to know that someone else is in charge so he doesn't have to be. He bonds quickly to his person and wants to protect them, which means he needs an owner who lets him know THEY are handling things. We\u2019re happy to have Steele back with us. Now we know even more about him and can make sure to find him a home where he thrives. Steele is crazy sweet, has an awesome personality, and loves everyone. He is a bit timid when he first meets new dogs (who could blame him), but in a short time he gains his confidence and does well. He plays with several other dogs and always looks like he's smiling while he's playing. He is not a fan of \"crazy play\" and prefers dogs that aren't always in his face. He would also do well as an only dog because he loves attention. Steele is housebroken, crate trained, and loves to go for walks. Once on a leash, Steele becomes an adventurer; he's delighted by every turn enjoying the whole experience. Steele is not only adorable, he's smart, sweet, and loves to be close. This boy is going to make some lucky person or family very happy with his unconditional love and devotion. If you think that person could be you, please fill out an application to start the adoption process. \n",

            "description": "Meet Bella. This adorable Bully girl was rescued by a Good Samaritan who saw her posted on Facebook. Bella had jumped into a social worker's van while working in a rural SC neighborhood, and the woman took her home and posted a plea for help. Apparently, Bella belonged to another family in the neighborhood, but they moved and just left her behind with no plan for her well being. The Good Samaritan responded to the FB post and offered to take Bella until they could find a rescue. She reached out to Worthy Dog for help, and we found a foster home for her who could care for her while she goes through heartworm treatment.\n\nBella is currently being fostered with a couple and their family dog in Charlotte, NC. She's doing well with the other dog in the home and will be best paired with a calm, confident dog who is close to her in size, or would be fine as an only dog too. NO CATS...We have not seen her around cats, but she does have prey drive around chickens.\n\nThis bully girls is a very social dog by nature. On walks, she wants to stop and greet every dog, child, and adult. Her foster family had friends over recently, and she loved everyone there. She may bark when there's an initial knock at the door, but that's just her natural alert instinct. She greets visitors well and is very attached to her people. Her foster mom, Hailey, describes her as confident and snuggly and says she can be a little bossy too. She's housetrained and will typically scratch at the door or bark when she needs to go out. Hailey has not used the crate with her and trusts her to be free to roam in the home when left alone.\n\nBella has a more moderate energy level. In the house, she is a couch potato who loves to nap under the covers. She enjoys walks too, and is a strong pup who can pull, so she needs a capable handler. Her foster family has been watching her calories, doing regular walks to help her trim down, and she has already lost 2 to 3 lbs. It will be important for her new family to be committed to daily exercise and a healthy diet so that Bella can be her best self.\n\nHailey shared that Bella is very food motivated and a champion catcher of treats. She loves toys but also wants to destroy them. She can be a little protective of toys if another dog wants to take them away, so that needs to be managed early on. She is always up for a road trip but will try to sit in your lap if you don't contain her, so her foster mom uses a crate for safety. Bella is pretty human-focused and likes to be where you are. She will occasionally go off on her own to bask in a sunny spot near the window or on the back porch, but mostly she's by your side. At night, she would love to share a bed with you if you'll let her, and she is a very snuggly dog!\n\nThis sweet girl, with soulful eyes, will make someone a great companion. Apply today to learn more.\n\nPreference will be given to families with some large dog or bully breed experience.\n\nBREED ESTIMATE: APBT or American Bulldog mix\nGENDER: Female\nAPPROXIMATE WEIGHT: 65lbs - (needs to lose 5 lbs)\nAPPROXIMATE AGE: ~ 3 to 4 years\nCOAT TYPE: short\nADOPTION FEE: $400\nOTHER INFO: utd on shots/spayed/microchipped/treated for heartworm\nLOCATION: Alexandria, VA\n\nFOR MORE INFO OR TO ADOPT: Please go to https://adopt.worthydog.org and complete the application.\n\nYou can also help save dogs like this one by becoming a foster, providing a rescue dog with a temporary home and giving them the love and care they need until they are permanently adopted. Every person who fosters is directly responsible for saving the life of a dog, because we can only save as many dogs as we have foster families available to welcome them into their homes. If you think you might be interested in becoming a foster and want to learn more, please go to https://foster.worthydog.org and fill out an application.\n\nWorthy Dog Rescue is an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue that primarily adopts to families in the DC Metro area.",

            "description": "Reisha 'Penny' Sherwood is an approximately 10 month old bloodhound that  currently weighs 65 pounds. \n \nPenny, as we call her, came into our program after being found and no owner ever stepped up to claim her.  For such a young dog she has quite a few stories to tell it seems.  When we took her in we knew she was heart worm positive and had a bum leg....when she got her X-rays it was clear she'd likely been hit by a car early on and had a break that was allowed to heal improperly, but also, like so many southern rescues, she has some \"buckshot\" in her as well.  None of what she has been through has phased her amazing personality.  There is no limp in her smile!!!  \n\nThis sweetheart of a girl has finished her heartworm treatment and is feeling great!  She loves her walks,  inside toys, bones and puzzles.  Penny is actually extremely calm inside the house and loves to lounge around in the sun.  We'd love to find her a fenced yard where she can have a little freedom to work her nose, run and play to her heart's content.  Penny's foster mom has been working her brain with basic obedience.  She is a very smart girl and is working hard and learning!!  She has mastered her sit and stay and is very food/treat motivated. She has learned so much in a month's time!  She loves any interaction with humans and enjoys playing with other dogs.  Penny is a great combination of calm and playful and can also easily entertain herself.  \n\nReisha 'Penny' Sherwood is up to date on shots and preventatives and is microchipped.    She will be spayed prior to adoption and her adoption fee is $250 plus any additional donation you feel appropriate.  Our adoption fee is set to a level to make adoptions happen.  They do not cover our costs. Thank you for your generosity and interest in our dogs!   \n\nAll dogs adopted locally through SGDR receive a free six-week session of obedience classes and a lifetime of behavior support through our Project REWARD program with trainer Charlotte Blake.\n\nYou must have an approved application before being able to visit a dog. Visit our website below for an adoption application https://www.snootygiggles.com/dog-application/\n\nIf you expect to leave the dog alone for long periods of time, please do not consider adopting a puppy.  Puppies need lots of attention and companionship.  Thanks.\n\nAll known information about the animal is listed above. We do our best to give accurate information, but most of our dogs are rescues and do not come with a known history.",

He knows his basic commands like sit and lay down.  Jonesy is about 2 years old and 60 pounds. Jonesy is up to date on shots, now neutered, heartworm tested negative and will be microchipped upon adoption.  He is in run 80.  ID 626490\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

            "description": "Say hello to Lady! This sweet senior is ready to find her forever retirement home!\n\nThis sweet girl is 7 years young and 49 pounds. Her beautiful and sensitive eyes will lure you in. And her absolutely sweet temperament will make you fall in love.\n\nLady is the easiest couch potato you\u2019ll ever encounter. Lady just wants to live a simple life with lots of snacks, naps, and cuddles from her very own human(s). She loves snuggle time on the couch. Lady is super easy on leash and even enjoys her kennel, as long as she gets her own soft blanket and bed. \n\nShe is very dog friendly and gets along well with both males and females. She is lower energy and would likely do best in a home with a dog with a similar energy level. Lady would do best in a home without cats. She would do well with children who are respectful of her space. We don't know Lady's history but she can be a little skittish at times. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking to adopt an incredible senior dog, Lady truly deserves a retirement home that will love her for the rest of her days. Lady has Cushing's Disease and will need to be on daily medication for the remainder of her life.  Although she\u2019s less than perfect, this gal makes up for all of it with her sweet personality! She is Miss Congeniality for sure, and deserves a retirement home that will pamper her the way she deserves!\n\nIf interested in meeting Lady, please email adoption@sdsanctuary.com.",

He\u2019s a bit on the shy side but warms up quickly. He did very well for his test and his shots. \nRed is scheduled for his neuter Wednesday, January 27th and will get his microchip at that time.\nHe was a stray in Memphis (11-28) and no owner has come forward. He still needs to be neutered and get a microchip. He gets along with other dogs and is very active. Looks to have some Australian shepherd in him.  His fury coat is very very soft!  His foster dad is working on house training and leash walking.  He gets along fine with the other two dogs in his foster home but has too much energy for the older dogs.  He is trying to herd them but nipping at their heels. He would do best in a home with a younger dog that also has a lot of energy to burn off.  He also needs a fenced in yard to play and exercise in safely.\nHis adoption fee is $150 and includes his neuter and microchip.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, we encourage you to fill out our adoption questionnaire at http://members.petfinder.com/~MS72/adoption_app.html\n\nSave 1 Pet is a 501 (c) 3 approved charity committed to helping homeless animals.  We don't have a facility (shelter) but work out of our homes to foster the animals until they find a forever home.\n\nPlease be advised that for all adoptions, we will conduct reference checks, including veterinary references.  Our adoption fee for dogs includes spay/neuter, heart worm check, current vaccines, microchip, worming and heart worm/flea/tick prevention.\nFor dog adoptions, we do conduct fence verification.\nWhen adopting an animal, you will be asked to complete our Adoption Contract",

She's best in a home with no children or children over 15 that can be slow and understanding of her disability. She is currently in training to help her communicate and learn better manners. Clover would love someone to dedicate time to work with her and help her expel all her young energy.\n\nClover won't be available until February so she has time for training and spaying.\n\nIf interested in Clover please visit https://shanessalvationrescue.com/ and fill out an application.",

His ideal new home will have plenty of room for him to run and lots of activities to keep him busy.\n11/20/2020--Remmy is currently housed and enrolled in the Puppies for Parole Program at the Boonville Correction Center where (s)he will stay for 8 weeks of basic obedience training. (S)He will learn commands such as \u201csit\u201d, \u201cstay\u201d, \u201cheel\u201d, \u201ccome\u201d, etc. (S)He will learn crate and house training. Remmy will be available for adoption while (s) he is in the Program, but will not be released to his/her new adopting family until the end of the 8 weeks when (s)he graduates. The adoption fee for a Puppies for Parole dog is $100. For questions regarding adoptions, call the Marshall Animal Shelter at (660)831-0420\n11/2/2020--Remmy has a story to tell! Before he was surrendered by his family, they gave him to a friend who lived 15 miles away from their home. Remmy left his new owner and ran the 15 miles back home! Unfortunately, his family still was unable to keep him due to moving so they signed him over to the shelter. Remmy has been with the same family and their children all of his life so change is a little rough for him at first. He will bark at strangers, but also want to greet them.",

He is scheduled to get his 3rd puppy shot Saturday, January 30th.  \nHe full blooded Red Heeler (Cattle Dog Herding Breed) about 10-12 weeks old.\nNick weighs 12 pounds now and will be a medium size dog (30-40 pounds) when full grown.  He is more on the shy side and will need another dog in the home with him.  He will also need a good size fenced in yard to play and exercise in safely.  NO apartments.  A hearding breed would not do well in an apartment setting. \nHe is set up to be neutered Monday, February 8th.  Must be local to Olive Branch, Ms (near Memphis, Tn) to adopt so you can bring him back for his neuter and microchip.  \nHis adoption fee is $150 which will include 3 puppy shots, neuter and microchip.\n\n****If you are interested in adopting, we encourage you to fill out our adoption questionnaire at http://members.petfinder.com/~MS72/adoption_app.html\n\nSave 1 Pet is a 501 (c) 3 approved charity committed to helping homeless animals.  We don't have a facility (shelter) but work out of our homes to foster the animals until they find a forever home.\n\nPlease be advised that for all adoptions, we will conduct reference checks, including veterinary references.  Our adoption fee for dogs includes spay/neuter, heart worm check, current vaccines, microchip, worming and heart worm/flea/tick prevention.\nFor dog adoptions, we do conduct fence verification.\nWhen adopting an animal, you will be asked to complete our Adoption Contract",

My history is a bit of a mystery, but my friends at HRAAD have told me I am a very good boy. They are not sure how I would do with another dog in the home, but the word on the street is I am not cat friendly. Buck is an absolute loving, playful and  friendly sweetheart with all the humans he has met. \n\nBuck would thrive as an only dog, with an active family with a fenced yard. This sweet boy would make an awesome hiking or running partner with continued work on his leash manners.\n\nI am all up to date on shots, and will be neutered before I head to my fur-ever home. \n\nWill you be my happily ever after?\n\nIf you are interested in adopting me, all you have to do is submit an adoption application, which can be found on our website at www.hoodriveradoptadog.org. \n\nApplications are reviewed and approved in the order in which they are received.\nOnce your submitted application has been approved,  my adoption counselor will be in contact to discuss the next steps, answer any questions and to schedule a meet and greet.\n\nMy adoption fee is $325\n",

They need someone who understands their scaredy-ness and goes slow with them.\n\nThey have really come out of their shells in their foster home. No more grumbles. \nThey are good with other dogs and are really bonded to each other. \nThat could be part of the reason they were acting out initially because they were surrendered to different shelters. \n\n**No small kids\n\n**These boys are bonded and will only be adopted together. \nCan we find them a happy ending for Christmas? \n\nLeo and Apollo are currently being fostered in Clarksville, Tn. \n\nThe adoption fee for both will be $600.00 which includes spay, full vax, microchip, HW & parasite negative, dental (if needed) and any other medical issues treated.\n\nHouse Trained: Unknown at this time\nCrate Trained: Unknown at this time\nKid Friendly: Unknown at this time\nCat Friendly: Unknown at this time\n\n\nYou may apply to adopt at www.tndachshundrescue.com\n\nA little about how the adoption process works:\nWe are an all volunteer rescue so please be patient with us.\nWe usually have pre-approved adopters waiting for the right dog so it is best to get your application approved beforehand so you can contact us immediately when you are interested in meeting a potential pet.\n\nYou will be contacted once the app is processed for a home visit.\nIf you are already approved and see a dog you are interested in, please contact your adoption coordinator.\n\nCheck our FaceBook page at: https://www.facebook.com/tndachshundrescue/",

            "description": "Sweet Baby, along with his furr brother Snoopy were surrendered to LHS when their owner went on hospice and could no longer care for them:(\n\nOf course they were very sad and confused but just a short time after arriving at their foster home, they warmed up quickly giving kisses and playing with toys!\n\nBaby is about 5 years old and weighs about 14 lbs. He is HW negative, up to date on vaccinations, neutered and microchipped. He is crate trained and potty trained.\n\nHe is a very sweet boy with a gentle disposition. He LOOOOVES to play with his toys and run around in the yard. He is also very well mannered and can be trusted in the house while his foster parents are away. And given his small size, would do best in a home with older kiddos.\n\nBaby would do great with another pup or as an only dog. He is a complete love bug that loves getting attention from his people:)\n\nSo if you are interested in meeting this sweet boy, please fill out an application online. His foster family will be in touch within 48 hrs VIA EMAIL.We do not have a facility to house the dogs in our program. They are all kept in foster homes until they are adopted. Therefore, if you are interested in adopting from LHS, please complete an online application at http://legacyhumanesociety.org/adoptfoster/adoption-application/ and we will contact you asap about the status of your application.",

Im a big gentle giant most of the time unless im playing with the hoomans here at the shelter then i love to run around and play fetch. Fetch is my most favorite thing in this world. I am looking for a family who is willing to love my quirky personality unconditionally. I do not get along with anything small so need a home that has no small animals. I get along with most dogs as long as i can be the boss. If you think that i am the right fit for you come on down and take a look at me. I promise you will not regret meeting me.",

Ruthie is such a sweet, well-mannered girl.  She is very friendly and easy-going.  She loves everyone she meets and is good with other dogs.  She is ready to be back in a home with a family to love and care for her.  \n\nThe NAWS Dog Adoption Program operates as a rescue versus a shelter.  We believe in matching the right dog with the appropriate family based on each specific dog or family's needs.  To achieve this, we believe in spending the appropriate amount of time with each family to allow for enough interaction time with potential adopters.  This cannot be achieved if people stop by unexpectedly to meet our dogs.  Please e-mail Stacy at stacy@nawsus.org to setup a day or time to meet with one of our adoption counselors and our potential adoptees.  Thank you!\n\n",

            "description": "Sammy was rescued off the streets of Corpus Christi Texas. He had been abandoned as a young puppy, along with his mom and siblings.\nOver time, Sammy and her one sister (Elizabeth--also for adoption) were the only ones left. Their mom\u2014and other siblings\u2014disappeared and probably either starved to death or were hit by cars.\n\nFortunately, Sammy and Elizabeth escaped that fate\u2014although Sammy did sustain a serious leg injury during his time living on the streets.\n(His leg has since healed--although not correctly--and he tends to want to walk on the top of his foot which is causing him to develop a sore. At this time we are considering possible leg amputation, but--rest assured--\u2014\"tripods\" get around just fine and having three legs will not slow him down a bit!)\n\nOur best guess is that Sammy is a little less than a year of age. With good food and a de-worming regimen, he now weighs 38 lbs. (although he was much thinner when the video was taken). \n\nWe really have no idea what mix of breeds Sammy is, but he is a very sweet dog who always seems to have a smile on his face! He is extremely gentle and he does well with other dogs and people. \n\nSammy needs a home with another dog for companionship, and he would benefit from attending obedience classes to learn the basic commands. (But he is VERY smart--and he wants to please--so he should be a star student!)\n\nA large safely fenced yard is a must for Sammy (we do not consider an \"invisible\" fence as a safe way to contain a dog). Also, we would prefer he goes to an adopter who won\u2019t leave him home for extended periods of time, so an owner who works at home or only works part time would be ideal.\n\nSammy will be neutered soon, so at adoption he will have been totally vetted (including immunizations, de-worming, heartworm test, and microchip).\nHis adoption fee is $300 (which includes the amputation which we will have done along with being neutered.)\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Sammy, please e-mail us at: sylvialovesme@gmail.com and tell us a little about yourself and your living situation. Then, if we all agree that you might be a good fit for each other, we will send you an adoption application. And once your application is returned and reviewed, we can schedule a meet-and-greet.",

He is quite a nervous boy, with major separation anxiety issues. We are working on these issues with him and also have him on a CBD regimine. He has had basic obedience training in his puppy years and listens well to commands. Good for grooming and nail trims.We are looking for a special home for Jager with an ENERGETIC ACTIVE SINGLE HUMAN or a COUPLE with NO CHILDREN who will commit to being with him most of the time. He loves rides in the car, goes into stores, and is easy to control when in these situations, but sometimes he will require discipline. He is food motivated. He loves to play ball! In the house he is well behaved once he settles down. Like most German Sheherds, he will follow you everywhere! He becomes very whiney when he wants something or when he is uncomfortable which we are working to correct.Good at alerting.\n******************************************************************************\nBecause of his insecurity issues, it is NOT recommended that Jager is around children or adults who are not able to pick up on his cues. He has been known to growl, show teeeth and bite when startled or unsure of a situation.Experienced human only for this dog!A job would be great for Jager! A job such as Agility or Tracking work would be good for him!",

His favorite toy is a squeaky tennis ball so he can be picky about taking that away. He prefers women and warms up easier to them. Riggs promises to be the most loyal and loving dog you could ask for once he gains your trust.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please go to our website at www.partnersforpetsil.org and fill out an online application. Riggs' adoption fee is $195.\n\nAdoptions are held at the O'Fallon, IL PetSmart every Saturday of the month from 11am-3:30pm and at the Glen Carbon, IL PetSmart every Sunday from 11am-3:30pm. We are also at Petco in Edwardsville Crossing on Sundays from 11:30-3:30 pm. The cats are only at Glen Carbon Petsmart.

            "description": "Elizabeth was rescued off the streets of Corpus Christi Texas. As a puppy, she had been abandoned by her owner, along with her mom and siblings.\nOver time, Elizabeth and her one brother Sammy--also available for adoption--were the only ones left. Their mom\u2014and other siblings\u2014disappeared and either starved to death or were hit by cars.  :-(\n\nFortunately, Elizabeth and her brother Sammy escaped that fate and now they are both ready to start a new and happy life with a loving family!\nElizabeth weighs about 35 lbs. (she is pretty much full grown).\nShe is a very sweet dog who loves people and does well with other dogs. \n\nWe are looking for an adopter who has another dog (a dog her size or larger would be best). And because she has so much energy, a large safely fenced yard is a must (please note: we do not consider an \"invisible\" fence to be a safe way to contain a dog). \n\nWe would prefer she goes to an adopter who won\u2019t leave her home for extended periods of time, so an owner who works at home or only works part time would be ideal.  Elizabeth would benefit from attending obedience class to learn the basics of good manners (she has a tendency to want to jump up on people for attention) but she is a quick learner and wants to please.\n\nElizabeth is totally vetted (spayed, immunizations, de-worming, heartworm test, and microchip) and her adoption fee is $300.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Elizabeth, please e-mail us at: sylvialovesme@gmail.com and tell us a little about yourself and your living situation. Then, if we all agree that you might be a good fit for each other, we will send you an adoption application. And once your application is returned and reviewed, we can schedule a meet-and-greet.",

            "description": "Sweet mama Arkansas is around 2 years old and looks to be a Lab and Shepherd mix. She was rescued with her 10 puppies from a farm that had too many dogs and couldn't properly care for her and her pups. Now she is ready to put parenthood behind her in favor of a home of her own. She is a little shy at first so she's looking for a kind and patient family that will continue working on her socialization and build her confidence. She is doing wonderfully in her foster home where she has conquered the stairs, started to play with toys and even snoozes on the couch. She's even house trained! She is still working on \"outside\" things like walks and not freezing up when she sees unfamiliar people or dogs. Arkansas needs a mellow household with an owner who understands shy dogs and is willing to put in the extra energy and training to help her blossom into the best dog that she can be. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting Arkansas, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue.

Determined not to let anything like a missing front leg slow him down, Freddie lives life to the fullest and loves nothing more than playing with other energetic dogs and attention from his humans. Best friends with everyone, he would love a family to show him lots of love. Freddie will do best in an adult only home, or teenage children would be fine as well. He does great with another energetic dog to romp around with and/or someone home most of the time. He's doing better in foster care and getting used to the routine but loves his humans so much he wants to be around getting attention all the time. He loves to snuggle in the big bed, but is getting used to a crate. He is housetrained but expect a couple accidents at first while learning the new routine.\n\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\n\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\n\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\n\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\n\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\n\nPlease \"like\" our\nFacebook Page\nfor the most current events and new dogs.\n\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

            "description": "BUDDY IS IN A FOSTER HOME\n\nDate of birth:  11/2018\n\n12/22/2020:  Buddy is a super cute Lab/Hound mix! He\u2019s 2 years old and weighs 50 lbs, but he needs to put on more weight and could easily weigh 60+. Buddy is a little shy at first, but he\u2019s very sweet natured.  He warms up quickly and then enjoys attention and being petted.\n\n\u2022 Buddy would like a home with a fenced yard and another doggie friend. He lives in a foster home with other dogs and puppies and gets along extremely well with all. He\u2019d be a wonderful companion for another dog. We\u2019ll ask you to bring your dog to meet Buddy to see if they could be friends.\n\n\u2022 Buddy is pretty mellow and gentle and likes relaxing in the sun.\n\n\u2022 Because he\u2019s a little timid, we don\u2019t want to place Buddy in a home with young kids. But he\u2019d be fine with older kids/teens. \n\n\u2022 Buddy has a doggie door in his foster home and he is house trained and crate trained.  \n\n\u2022 He\u2019s not a big barker and doesn\u2019t jump the fence.  \n\n\u2022 Unfortunately, Buddy has heartworms. He will be starting treatment on January 11. He\u2019ll need to be restricted to limited activity for several weeks after that\u2014 but he\u2019s not a high energy guy so that shouldn\u2019t be terribly difficult.  We can fill you in more about his treatment plan if you\u2019re interested in fostering or adopting Buddy.\n\n\u2022 Buddy was originally in a shelter in rural Arkansas.  His time was up there, so we transferred him (and other dogs) up here so that we could treat his heartworms and find him a loving home. He\u2019s a real sweetie!\n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE:  PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU.  Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info.\u00a0\n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.521.2339\nhsgkc.org",

            "description": "Bosley comes to rescue from TX as a stray.  He is just a puppy born 8.6.2020. He is a very mellow, handsome, young guy. His adoption fee is $350. He is very laid back loves to curl up and sleep.  He's playful with lots of energy.  He has only had a few accidents with foster in MN as they get to know him.  He does know to go to the door to let folks know he needs to go out.  \n\n1.22.21 update:   He is excellent with kids. I would say any age. He has learned \"kennel up\"  and will run into the kennel for feeding time, no need to say anything, he just knows what to do. Sometimes when he is just plan tired, he goes in his kennel for naps without me telling him. He is very submissive, I think a dog that will help boost his confidence would benefit him, but he could be a single dog household too. \n\nHe is 100% potty trained and will bark if in his kennel to go outside or ring the bell on my back door if he needs to go out. \n\nWhen he gets playing, his zoomies are hilarious to watch, but his prancing and movements make me wonder if he grew up with a heard of horses! He does great in the leash, he does need a reminder in the beginning, but he normally doesn't pull unless a smell catches his nose on a tree. He still is learning to not jump up to look on the counters or table top but a simple Bosley down and he listens. \n\nIf someone is looking a dog who will go out for adventures or just snuggle up on the couch and take naps, Bosley is the boy for them! He truly is a good boy especially under the circumstances he came from.\n\n12.29.21 update:\nHe does great in a kennel and sleeps through the nite.  At night he will bat his cute puppy eyes at foster mom to stay up longer.  As a puppy he does not know what are legal toys or items like shoes etc.  He will put anything in his mouth but easy to teach the difference.  We do require a 6' fenced yard to adopt this dog.\n\nHe is learning sit, down, leave it, and stay but catches on quickly.  Leash training is coming.  We do not allow our dogs to be tied, tethered, chained or confined to any form of a tie out. We do not adopt to folks that have underground fence system.

            "description": "Lucky Momma is the dog everyone wants to come home to. She does need a bit of time to warm up, but when she is settled and happy her greetings are full body wiggles! She is a fantastic playmate, a great study buddy for calm oldeir kids, or a warm couch cuddler after work. Lucky mama will require a fenced yard. Share also learns quickly and wants to please her humans. She does get scared of rambunctious kids, loud men, or noises and would prefer a home with another dog, to show her the way. She was rescued from a home with many many dogs and is much more comfortable with a dog in the home. \n\nShe is house & crate trained and has even recently been introduced to cats and has done fantastic. Lucky Momma rides fine in the car but she is not a big fan and will alternate between sitting and lying down often. She doesn't know many commands yet, but behaves perfectly inside, even handles nail trims like a pro. Come dinner time she will do anything under the sun to get that food bowl to come down faster. Lucky Momma has a funny affinity for finding stray socks and prancing around with her find, but she has never chewed anything up. She is approximately 3-4 years old and a medium sized girl at ~40lbs. with a unique coat pattern. Meet this perfect gal today.\n\nAdoption fee for all dogs and puppies is $300.

            "description": "Watch out, Bandit is here to steal your heart (and all your snacks)! If those ears don't do the trick, his eyes certainly will!\n\nThis guy has come a long way from when he came to us in the beginning of October 2020. Bandit was taken by animal control from his original home where he lived with six other dogs (his parents and siblings) in a pen outside. Living that way for his entire puppyhood has made life a challenge for Bandit but he has been working on getting used to normal dog things. \n\nBandit absolutely LOVES other dogs and has no trouble jumping right into a play session. He is most comfortable when other dogs are around to help give him clues on how to react. Bandit also has a lot of experience living around cats. He likes to try and play and will chase them if they run but quickly jumps away and leaves them alone if they swat at him or walk/jump away.\n\nHis foster home has spent lots of time working one-on-one with Bandit to increase his confidence on his own and around people, which is his biggest weakness. Bandit is incredibly uncomfortable with close contact and handling from people. His new family will need to respect that and give him time and space to come around when he is ready. \n\nBandit is quite a goofball once he gest comfortable! He gets excited to go outside with his foster mom and will hop around and play chase with her on leash. He likes to play \"find it\" with treats and food out in the grass. His foster homes have focused on teaching him to be a dog and giving him coping skills to help him adapt to life in a home around people.\n\nBandit's ideal home is one with exceptionally patient and understanding humans who are willing to continue positive reinforcement training and safe socialization at his pace. Because of Bandit's behavioral needs, he is eligible for a foster to adopt situation. Interested parties should fill out an adoption application and if approved, can take him home as a foster dog to get a true sense of his needs before finalizing his adoption.\n\nHe currently weighs around 45lbs and will be neutered in the coming weeks. He is up to date on vaccines and parasite prevention.",

Kitty is good with all dogs and would do best with a home with a male dog or smaller dogs. She is a medium energy dog and knows when to be calm and relax in the house. She is crate and potty trained.\n\n \n\nThe adoption fee is $450. Kitty is up to date on vaccines according to her age, she has received proper deworming, and comes with additional dewormer. She is microchipped, spayed, comes with 1-6 months of preventatives, one month free trial of pet insurance, all of our animals receive a health certificate (this states a licensed veterinary saw the pet and deemed it healthy for travel, it is not a promise of perfect health.) Our transports are USDA certified and tfransport is included in adoption fee!\n\n \n\n \n\nShe is currently being fostered in Houston, Tx but will be traveling to the PNW as soon as she finds her perfect home!\n\n \n\nPlease inquire by submitting an application to brianna@threelittlepittiesrescue.org\n\n \n\nPlease fill out an application to be considered :https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/29415/generic",

I am about 41 lbs and come with the typical Lab goodies of cuddles and playfulness. I was rescued from Mexico, where I have had an FHO surgery to stabilize my hip. I am chilling out at my foster home and learning to be a great dog! I am fully house trained and pretty good on the leash. There may be a bit of pulling when I see other dogs, but tasty treats and positive reinforcement will get the job done! My surgery has helped me walk around with more ease and has even given me a cute dancing style. It has limited my jumping though, so I require assistance while getting in and out of cars and some coaxing for the stairs. But the good thing is, it has made me timid about jumping on couch or beds!\n\nI am an affectionate, friendly gal who loves to shower her people with love. I do enjoy playing with other dogs, but I don't quite like living with other female dogs. There can be only one queen, right?! I enjoy being off-leash at the park and playing with my furry friends. On leash, I can be a bit reactive, but mostly because I want to play! Don't go by my bark, its just more sound than anything. Actually, I am a timid gal and hence, I get nervous and bark. I am also quite vigilant and like to watch out for my family. I don't think cats and I will get along too well. I have not been around kids yet! I let my family cuddle me all day because they love my soft skin and ears! They say I am actually quite intelligent and will pick training up quite quickly!\n\nI would love a loving family who trains me with patience and plenty of positive reinforcement to make me the best lady around! I would like more socialization to help me understand that other dogs can be very fun! I am mellow, with playful bouts, and eager to please. I pawmise to give velvety cuddles to let you squeeze me! If you think that we could be the perfect allies, give me a woof! My adoption fee is $400 and that includes spaying/neutering, shots, and microchip. If you want to take me home, please fill out the form on the website here https://theanimalpad.org/adoption-application/",

            "description": "Roxbury/Roxie arrived at the Nacogdoches Animal Shelter on August 24, 2020. She spent 119 days in the shelter before NorthStar was able to find a foster for her as large dog fosters, especially for heartworm positive dogs, are hard to come by.\n\nDuring her time at the shelter, Roxie gave birth to a single puppy. No one even realized Roxie was pregnant because she was so small - people thought she was just getting a little chubby due to her very healthy appetite! Roxie gave birth to Pebble on October 17th and was the best mother. She always made sure her little pebble was clean, had a full tummy, and was always kept warm. She would even bring the food bowl into the bed with them as she got older. Once Pebble turned 7 weeks old, she was placed into foster home in Texas so that she could make her way to NorthStar. Roxie obviously missed her, but we knew that away from the shelter was the safest place for her pup.\n\nRoxie is the goofiest pup! She is about 3 years old and will soon start heartworm treatment and be spayed. She is a Black Mouth Cur mix who weighs about 45 pounds. She very rarely barks, doesn't use the bathroom in her kennel if given the choice, and follows directions very well - she goes into her kennel with the point of a finger and a whistle!\n\nRoxie often gets a case of the zoomies and sprints in large circles around her humans. She adores toys and can be found squeaking her toys and throwing them up in the air to entertain herself. She is always happy; I've never seen her not excited to be alive! She runs with her head tilted back and her tail to the ground as if to build up speed. She doesn't do anything half speed. We have enjoyed every moment with her!\n\nOnce Roxie makes her way to NJ, she will be looking for a wonderful forever home with people who will love her & enjoy her company. If you'd like to meet Roxie when she arrives, please fill out an application at www.northstarpets.org & ask for ROXBURY NAC!",

Fill out an application here to get the ball rolling...\nhttps://pethavenmn.org/adopt/adoptable-dogs/dog-adoption-application/\n\nHere is more about Kuzco!\n\n3-year-old, 60-pound Hound mix\nHouse-Trained / Crate-Trained\n\nOther Dogs: Not a dog park candidate, does not get along with male dogs, would be okay with a female dog with slow introductions.\nCats: No, has some prey drive.  \nKids: Unknown, no exposure while in foster care. \n\nKuzco is a sweet and friendly pup who loves his humans and receiving affection! He is working on some of his manners and his adoptive human(s) should plan to continue this training so he can be his best self. His foster is also working with him on his anxiety around men in uniform e.g., delivery personnel, mail carriers. \n\nKuzco enjoys chasing tennis balls, playing with stuffed animal toys, and nose-work games; he has an extraordinary sense of smell! He also loves going for walks, food, and mental enrichment toys like stuffed Kongs, puzzles or fetch. \n\nKuzco would love to have a fenced yard to play in and because he is an excellent jumper, it would need to be at least six feet tall; however, if he is getting other daily exercise, he does not need one.  \n\nKuzco would love a home where he feels he is an important part of his human(s) lives filled with lots of snuggles, couch time, exercise, and adventures. \n\n\nHis adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm/Lyme test, all age-appropriate vaccinations (distemper, rabies, & Bordetella), HW and flea/tick preventative, and microchip implant and registration. \n\nThere is no guarantee of age and breed as a rescue animal's history is unknown. All ages and breeds are best guess.\n\nAdoption fees INCLUDE a mandatory sales tax of 7.525%.\n\nDue to post-adoption services provided, it is Pet Haven's policy to only place dogs into homes within a 150-mile radius of the Minneapolis, MN city center.",

            "description": "Cayenne was recently transferred in from our local animal control where she was surrendered when her owners could no longer care for her. Cayenne can be a little reserved around new people but we believe that is because she is not sure why she is in a shelter environment. She appears to have been well cared for in her past. Potty training and crate training unknown. Cayenne would love to get back into a home environment.\n\nUPDATE: Cayenne is a beautiful 3-year-old, 66-pound, female pit bull mix who has a stunning reddish coat and infectious smile. Cayenne entered the shelter system on December 11th when she was surrendered to Tazewell County Animal Control because her family could no longer care for her, but Cayenne appears to have been well cared for and is healthy. She was later transferred to TAPS on December 21st. \n\nCayenne is lively in the car, will jump from seat to seat and does not like to sit still. But she finally settled down when she found a human to sit next to. \n\nIn my home, Cayenne was an absolute dream and if you are looking for a dog that is \"chill\", then Cayenne would be perfect for your home. She was not interested in toys (ropes, bones, balls, stuffed toys, etc.) and I do not know if it is because she is not interested, or if she never played with them in her past. However, Cayenne clearly has a true passion for food and was not picky about the type of kibble I fed her and loved all the different types of treats that I gave to her. \n\nCayenne does not appear to know her basic commands of \"sit\", \"stay\", etc., but outside of a few attempts at counter-surfing, she is an incredibly quiet, calm girl who merely wanted to keep to herself. She did not try to get on my furniture and appeared to understand the phrase \"let's go potty\". Although she did have one accident in my house, but I believe her accident was my fault because her signals to go outside are subtle; so potential adopters will need to work with her on this to learn her cues. \n\nOverall, I found Cayenne to be sweet, quiet, and friendly and would be a good fit for most families. It is unknown if Cayenne likes other dogs or cats, but was recently cat tested and she was not reactive.",

I was rescued by Animal Ark when my family separated and couldn't take me with. I'm a bit aloof but if you have the patience to get to know me I am a lovable girl, but I will need a slow introduction to any new humans or canines. I would need a home with a fenced in yard (minimum of 5 ft. tall) with no children or cats. I am learning some basic commands but my future family would need to continue training with me. My foster family says I am a very smart girl and I am very treat motivated. Once I get to know you, I'll be a loving companion for life. Do you think you have the patience for a girl like me?",

            "description": "And The Winner Is.... the lucky families who give these adorable Hound and Shepherd mixes a forever home. At around 6 to 7 months old, these superstars are ready to shower you with love and sweet puppy kisses. Since this litter of cutie pies came to Labs and More without mom or dad, we don't know what all they are mixed with or how big they will get, but we are guessing they will be on the large side or even extra large side when full grown. Elton is very smart, picking up several of his basic commands quickly. He is learning the leash and gets along great with kids. He is making great progress settling down in his crate. While it takes him a moment to warm up to new dogs, it isn't long before he starts play bowing and running around happily with them. Elton is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application. If you have any questions email us at doginfo@labsandmore.org or call us at 858-273-5386. Thank you for looking to a rescue group to fulfill your dream of adding a new dog to your life!

            "description": "And The Winner Is.... the lucky families who give these adorable Hound and Shepherd mixes a forever home. At around 6 to 7 months old, these superstars are ready to shower you with love and sweet puppy kisses. Since this litter of cutie pies came to Labs and More without mom or dad, we don't know what all they are mixed with or how big they will get, but we are guessing they will be on the large side when full grown. Bieber is very social and friendly. He loves to play and is working on house training and what a leash is in his foster home. Bieber is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application. If you have any questions email us at doginfo@labsandmore.org or call us at 858-273-5386. Thank you for looking to a rescue group to fulfill your dream of adding a new dog to your life! Dogs + Love = Family",

I tend to be a little protective of my family when I am in my home, but working on socialization skills can help that. I would also prefer that nobody tries to mess with my food. I have had some training, but there are always bound to be some things that need continued work.\n \nI am housetrained well and kennel trained. I don't care for car rides, they make me nervous. I am ok with other dogs, but have not met a cat yet. I grew up in a home with children over 7 years old but haven't been around too many other young children.\n \nCall HHS for more details about me!",

            "description": "This little guy is Porter and he is fully grown at 47 pounds. Porter does climb 4-6 foot chain link fences, so a home with a privacy fence or large yard to roam around in would be ideal. He is not known to run off after jumping a fence; he jumps fences to get back inside after doing his business or to go where he sees people-he loves to be inside and around people. Porter is very affectionate to adults but does not do well with small children. He is pretty laid back and would make anyone a great companion!\n\nPorter is now enrolled in the Paws in Prison Program in Calico Rock where he will receive 8 weeks of obedience training and learn some tricks as well!\n\nIf you would like more information or to schedule an appointment to come meet Porter, please call the Stone County Humane Society at 870-269-5200 or go to our website schspets.org to fill out an adoption application and we will contact you!",

Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nLooking for a fun-loving young dog who really knows how to enjoy life? That's our girl Harley, a 1 year-old who looks like she might be a mix of Pointer and Boxer but that's just a guess. Harley was found as a stray and when she wasn't claimed at the local county dog shelter, she made the trip to Canine Lifeline so she could have fun in a foster home while searching for her forever home. While we don't have any history on her pre-shelter life, we have found Harley to be a great dog! She has been friendly with all people and other dogs that she's met since coming to us. Harley loves to wrestle with other playful dogs so would enjoy having a fun-loving canine pal in her new home. She has excellent crate manners so should be able to pick up the house rules quickly in her new home. Harley hasn't had much experience on a leash yet so still needs some work on her leash manners. Using a harness with her as she gains more experience works best and makes walks more enjoyable. Harley showed her serious side for the camera but this girl usually has a big smile on her face and is ready for lots of fun adventures in her new home. Harley weighs about 34 pounds and her adoption fee is $350. She's spayed, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Harley. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Harley and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

She still needs practice walking on a leash, but she has been working on her manners, is eager to please, and can sit by command. She frequently picks up things she finds on the ground like toys, socks, and slippers and carries them a short distance, but she never chews them. She always wants to be around someone, so she would do best in a home with a stay-at-home friend or other pets to keep her company. She has no issues sleeping in her kennel at night as long as she's not in the room by herself. If you're looking for a cutie pie companion that loves to snuggle and play, Clover is your girl.

She goes to doggy daycare and plays beautifully with every dog there. She LOVES chewing on sticks, playing with toys, chewing her bones, and will keep herself busy with them! Angel adores getting belly rubs and doing zoomies in the backyard.  She is perfectly crate trained and potty trained. She is very treat motivated and knows sit, down, touch, and stay! Angel's ideal home would either be with a dog friend or with someone who can take her to doggy daycare!\nWe feel Angel would do best in a home without cats.\n\nIf interested in meeting her, email adopt@love-a-bull.org",

Rooney is house trained and crate trained. She also enjoys the water and a kiddie pool in the yard will provide hours of entertainment for all. \n\nAt the same time, Rooney is shy with new people. This girl will do best in a home with another dog for friendship and confidence. She will thrive in a low traffic- adult only - home. \n\nRooney's idea of an exciting night is spent with you, a bowl of popcorn and your favorite Netflix series. \n\nRooney is enjoying a foster home in Palm City.

            "description": "To be considered for adopting a dog from Canine Lifeline, you must have an approved application must be on file. Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nThis big sweet, lovable boy is Dexter, a 3 year-old who looks like a mix of St. Bernard and American Bulldog. Dexter found himself homeless after his family could no longer care for him. We were told that he was adopted by that family as a puppy and lived indoors for 8 months until they had a baby. At that time, Dexter was relegated to living outside. Fortunately, they finally realized (after 2 years outdoors) that this was not a good life for Dexter so surrendered him to the local shelter so he could find a warm, cozy indoor home and loving family. Dexter has been a wonderful boy since arriving here with us to work on finding the perfect new home. He acts like a big overgrown puppy and is very playful. He loves playing tug with toys but can be a little rough and mouthy when playing so wouldn't be a good match for children. Dexter will sit nicely for a treat and takes treats very gently for a big guy. He also walks quite nicely on a leash for a large dog, has excellent crate manners, and should be able to master the housetraining rules quickly in his new home with some positive direction on the part of his new family. Dexter gets along well with other dogs so might enjoy having a canine buddy in his new home too. He had a much needed bath when he arrived here and enjoyed all the attention that came with it. Dexter looks forward to living the rest of his life as a treasured family member and we can't wait to see him get that chance. Dexter weighs about 75 pounds and his adoption fee is $325. He's neutered, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Dexter. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Dexter and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

            "description": "**AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION approximately 3-1-21 following heartworm treatment**\n\nBig Bertha's story is one of deep sadness, you can see right into her broken soul through her eyes. Bertha had spent her whole life as a beloved pet, but her owner developed dementia and no longer recognized her own dog. She continued to call animal control to come pick up this stray dog, not realizing this was her precious companion. It became clear that Bertha was losing the home & master she so dearly loved, and was taken away to the rural pound where she slept on a cold concrete floor. Her heart & world shattered. She so longed to go home, but it was not meant to be. We aren't even sure what her name is. We can only work to restore the light in her eyes and the broken spirit behind them. We are committed to giving her everything she needs body & spirit. Will you please help Big Bertha in her journey to finding the happiness she once had by giving her a patient love & committed forever home?\u00a0\n\nBig Bertha is a female Hound/Terrier/mixed breed, weighs 65 lbs and was born approximately 12-25-15. She is spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, given flea/tick preventative, dewormed. Bertha is undergoing life-saving treatment for heartworm disease. She will need to remain on heartworm preventative for life, as is recommended for ALL dogs, and retested in 6 months to ensure she is heartworm free. Adoption fee is $400 to help offset the many expenses we have for vetting costs. We rely strictly on adoption fees and donations to continue to save the lives of orphaned & abandoned pets; 100% goes towards their care. If interested in adopting one of our available dogs or puppies, please complete an online adoption application at https://dollyslegacyanimalrescue.org/adopt/\u00a0You will be contacted by our adoption coordinator via email after your application has been reviewed & approved to schedule an appointment.",

Since you're here, let me tell you a little about about how I got here to Lucies Project.\n\nI was chilling with this really cute Blue Tic chick.  We were making the rounds around town when the postman saw us.  He alerted Lucies peeps.  They had thought that they knew my owner, as I have apparently been missing for quite awhile.\n\nUnfortunately when the people they contacted showed up, they had stated that I was not theirs.  :(\nI was so close to what I thought was going to be my home.\n\nShucky darns....I'm a little heartbroken.  I'm kinda shy and timid, but I know once I have found my furever home I will be so loving.  Don'tcha wanna take me home and cuddle forever?  Oh!  I love to play too!  Come see me, you won't regret it!\n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home. Phone interviews are required for all adoptions****",

            "description": "Bane is a 4 year old Great Pyrenees in search of a new home through no fault of his.  He spent his life with a family as an inside pet until October 2020, when his family had to move in with relatives and he was unable to go with them,  due to space limitations.  They thought they found him a great home, where he would live a house pet, like he did with them.  Instead, he was kept outside, where he was shot at by neighbors, and supposedly did not like the person's teenage son.  He was then surrendered to an animal shelter, 6 weeks after they got him. Bane is heartbroken.   His name means Glorious Defender in Slavic.  He was recently diagnosed  with Lyme disease, and will be undergoing an antibiotic treatment.  His original owner said he was fine with their young children, who were born after they got him, other dogs, and guests in their home.  Bane does not do well with cats. We recommend obedience training for all newly adopted pyrs, to help you create a special bond with you and your new friend, and so you have a well behaved canine. Great Pyrenees are willing to learn, but are not as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds. They are bred to be independent thinkers. Applicants must be over 25, own their own home and all children in household must be over 6 years old. Your resident pets must be up to date on vaccines, sterilized, you must have a good history of vet care for them, and you must have used heartworm preventative year round for your dogs. \n\n\nBane will be placed as an inside pet with outside privileges. You MUST have a securely fenced yard accessible from your home. Invisible fencing does not work with this breed and they will take the shock for the freedom.  Great Pyrenees are bred to roam and will create their own territory if not secured, which can led to them being lost, hit by vehicles or shot by people who see them as a threat. The breed is not a good off leash dog, and cannot be trusted to not run away.  A Great Pyrenees off leash is a \" DisAPyr.\" \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please complete the appropriate application on our website, www.igpr.org under the Adopt tab. \n\nAll of our dogs marked as needing foster homes are also available for adoption.  If a dog is listed on this site, it is available.  No need to contact us to see if it is,  We do require you  complete the adoption application prior to meeting a dog.\n\nWe also offer a foster to adopt program. You foster the dog, and have first right of refusal on them if an approved application is submitted for them. \n\nIn fostering a dog, the dog comes to you fully vetted. and groomed. You provide good quality food, grooming, and we provide the heartworm preventative and medical care, if needed* .(*Based on approval from IGPR.)\n\nAdoption fee is $350",

To begin the process please fill out an application here:  http://goo.gl/forms/XPuk6w9615GXqo0x2\n\nThis is my foster dog...if you or anyone you know is interested in adopting this dog please contact: www.DogGoneInn.com\n\nName: \t\tRigel\nGender: \tNeutered \nColor:\t\tWhite\nDOB:\t\t12/10/2018\nBreed:\t\tJapanese Chin/Maltese Mix\nWeight:\t15 lbs\nNotes:     I need a home without children, as I am a little grumpy until I get to know you and trust you.  \n\nThere is an adoption process along with a donation.\n\nPlease bring your dog (if you have one), and a martingale collar with a leash, should we move forward.  We recycle theirs for the next dog :)  I have attached a picture of a martingale collar.  If you cannot find one, we do sell them at the daycare for 10-15.  Purchasing one from us allows us to fit it properly and it helps to benefit the rescue.  We carry leashes too, the collar and leash set are 30.  Adoption donations vary depending on the dog's age and medical expenses.  Typically they start at 650 and go up from there.  We realize this is a larger donation, however we have no state funding like shelters do.  That being said, dogs do come to you fully vetted.  They have been fixed, given distemper, bordetella, rabies, heartworm tested, de-wormed, on prevention for heartworm, fleas, ticks, intestinal parasites and microchipped.  Additionally we have paid for the microchip registration for life. \n\n*Please note we make every effort to have our dogs altered prior to adoption, if we cannot spay/neuter clauses will be in the contract.\n\n*Please come down to the Dog Gone Inn in Manlius to meet us!\n\nThank you for choosing rescue! \n\nDon't forget to like us and follow us on Facebook, we get new animals in regularly.\n\n*Please submit an application here: http://goo.gl/forms/XPuk6w9615GXqo0x2 and come down to the Dog Gone Inn in Manlius to see me or (315) 728-9344 or www.DogGoneInn.com or DogGoneInn@Yahoo.com or www.facebook.com/DogGoneInn",

            "description": "One year old Ewing is our miracle pup. He was hit by a car and left for dead on October 23, 2020. A good samaritan (whom Ewing is named for) stopped to help and we rushed him to our vet. After seeing multiple other specialists, Ewing\u2019s diagnosis is spinal cord damage. He does have some feeling in his right rear leg and has relearned how to walk. Ewing prefers to get around himself versus using a wheelchair. He\u2019s even taught himself to do stairs; this boy is determined! Ewing is incontinent and wears diapers. We have him on a food that gives him nice solid bowel movements and together with the right style of diapers, makes it very manageable. Ewing is in a foster home with dogs and had even attended doggie daycare. He had learned the joy of playing with toys and does well with kids. Ewing has a very loving personality and you can tell he is grateful for this second chance! To adopt Ewing, apply at ITVrescue.org.\n\nAll of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heartworm tested and treated if necessary.\n\nPlease realize that many of our animals are kept in foster homes. Please complete an adoption application at http://itvrescue.org/adoption-application/ in order to meet with one of our animals. There is no obligation in completing the application, but it helps us find an animal that is most appropriate for your family.  The ITV Rescue Center is open Tuesdays 12-5; Wednesdays 12-7; Thursdays 12-5; Fridays 12-5 and Saturdays 10-5.  The Rescue Center is located at 1417 N. Stockwell Road.  You are welcome to come to our rescue center during open hours to see all of our great adoptable animals. Thank you for your interest in our animals!\n\nNOTE: Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

She is very high energy and loves attention, so she needs a family who can provide her with a large fenced area to run in, lots of mental stimulation, and plenty of love. She is very affectionate and enjoys spending time with people and playing with other dogs. She is excitable and doesn't know her size or strength so she is seeking a home without small dogs or young children. Other dogs in the home should be of a similar play style. Remy's rambunctious energy will be too much for an older or less playful dog.\n\nRemy is potty trained and knows basic commands, but is easily overstimulated so needs some additional training to help her slow down and listen when she is excited. She also needs a little extra time outside, as her adventurous and curious nature sometimes distracts her from doing her business. She loves chew toys and ropes, which she will need plenty of so she doesn't get bored and resort to chewing her bedding.\n\nRemy will be an incredible companion for an active family! If you are interested in fostering or adopting Remy, please submit the corresponding application at k9orphans.org to set up a meet and greet.",

I also need some help learning what sorts of things it's okay to put my mouth on. Energy level? High. How did I get here? Transferred from Wake County Animal Center where a good samaritan brought me.

Keri is currently going through heartworm treatment. She will have to remain on crate rest until March 10th. Because Keri is heartworm positive and on crate rest, we have not done any dog testing because she needs to be kept calm. We always recommend a meet and greet with any resident dogs. At the shelter and while on leash, Keri met a dog-friendly cat and she was extremely rude to the cat. At this time we don't believe Keri would do well living with cats. Keri lived with children in her previous home and reportedly did well with them. We always recommend a meet and greet with any children in the household or children that visit often, such as grandkids. Please call for more information or to make an appointment to meet Keri. (Updated 1/30/21). Her $160 adoption fee includes a $100 heartworm treatment fee to help the shelter recover some of the cost of heartworm treatment.",

Unfortunately at least one of the large dogs picked on Brutus. We believe it is possible that Brutus live with dogs in the future but given his history of being bullied, we would definitely recommend a meet and greet with all resident dogs. At the shelter and while on leash, Brutus met a dog-friendly cat and he was appropriate and polite with the cat. We always recommend caution when introducing a dog to residents cats because behavior can be different in a home. In his original household Brutus lived with children. We would recommend a meet and greet with any children in the household or children that visit often, such as grandkids. At the shelter Brutus is a bit of a nervous nelly. He can be uncomfortable when meeting new people but generally decides people are fun when they are feeding him Pup-peroni treats. Please call for more information or to make an appointment to meet Brutus. (Updated 1/30/21).",

He has the potential to be a lovely dog, but Mikey is very easily aroused and that is expressed through jumping and mouthing. He needs to learn impulse control to help decrease his propensity to pull, jump, and mouth. He's making lots of improvement here at the shelter and his adopter will need to continue to work with him in his new environment. Mikey was playful with the dog he was introduced to here at the shelter. Mikey also needs a home with no children. \n\n\nHamilton Township Animal Shelter cannot offer any guarantees on the age, health, temperament, personality or mental disposition of any pet.

My foster mom takes me for rides once in a while and I love to stick my face in the window and feel the wind rushing by. I am blind in one eye because another puppy scratched me when I was a puppy but it doesn't really bother me. If you adopt me you have to clean my eye with a damp tissue and put one eye drop in my dry eyes. I weigh about 45 lbs. Would you want to be my forever family?",

He is inquisitive, charming, very playful, lovable and he has the most adorable expressions.  This big goofy fellow will need some patience and training, but he is very clean in his kennel, so that's a great start.  Bowtie may be okay with other dogs, but he is probably too playfully energetic for small dogs.  We tested him with cats and we feel he shouldn't be in a home with cats.  A fenced yard is required. Photos of his neck directly after the collar was cut are at the end of this album.   Adoption fee is $185.00, please call us 217.283.0779 or jump to our adoption application at hartshelter.org.",

She does enjoy the company of other dogs, but can play a bit rough, so will need continued work on learning appropriate play in her new home. She does overall do well with other dogs though and would likely enjoy a rough and tumble playmate. As long as she has an appropriate outlet for her energy, she is also respectful of dogs who would rather not play.\n\nBecause Ric can be a bit of a tank, we believe she would be most successful in a home without children or cats.\n\nRicotta is crate trained and house trained. She is doing well with leash training and has not shown any significant undesirable behaviors. She is a bit nervous in new environments but adjusts well. \n\nIf you feel your family would be a good fit for her, and you live within 2 hours of Ann Arbor, Michigan, please apply:\nwww.kellerscause.com/adopt",

He is a very sweet people dog, but needs to be an only pet.\n\nLogan has had quite a journey and is looking for his happily ever after.  Back in February of 2020, he wandered up on a good Samaritan\u2019s porch looking for help.  He was emaciated and had healing wounds on his tale and legs that the vet thought were indicative of falling from a vehicle on asphalt. \n\nLogan quickly went to a foster where he got the care and rehabilitation he needed for several months.  We quickly learned what a love bug he is and how much he loves people.  He is a big cuddle bug at about 70 pounds, he\u2019s goofy and doesn\u2019t know his size.  He\u2019s estimated to be 4-5 years old.\n\nHe loves hikes but he loves being a coach potato just as well.  He\u2019s enjoyed trips to the mountains and sailing on the lake.  He is crate trained, house trained and knows basic commands. \n\nAs noted, he needs to be an only pet.  He does not know how to interact with other dogs, and gets overly excited, which can lead to problems with another.  When on walks, if he sees another dog, he becomes fixated and barks excitedly.  While in foster care, we worked with a trainer to help with this.  It was working well, but training needs to be consistent.\n\nIn October, Logan thought he found his forever home.  However, his training was not continued in his new environment and the progress he had made slipped away and his new owner wanted a dog that could run and play with other dogs.  So Logan is being returned and needs another chance with someone who wants an only pet and is interested in continuing the simple training methods we\u2019ve learned.\n\nWhile Logan is best without other animals (cats or dogs), he is good with pretty much all people.  He\u2019s great with kids.  However due to his size and strength, he\u2019s probably best with children 10 and up.\n\nThis boy has a log of love to give.\n\n",

He suffers from glaucoma and will likely need to have both eyes removed in order to feel better. Dental work may be needed too, as this has been neglected for some time.\n\nThe good news is that Bobby is a happy little guy, adored by his foster mom and dad! He gets along well with their sweet, gentle dog and cat. He likes to go for walks and car rides. He loves to get cozy and warm and take his naps with his little stuffed toys, his people, and his fur siblings nearby.\n\nBobby would love a home where his people are home much of the time. Since he cannot see or hear, he does tend to bump into things until he gets to know his space well. Some basic precautions may need to be taken in his adoptive home in order to keep him safe. He would also benefit from a securely fenced yard that he can safely explore.\n\nWe are committed to getting Bobby the medical care he needs and finding him the perfect furever home! Could it be with you?\n\n*We do not adopt to Canada due to border restrictions and breed-specific legislation*Adoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, deworming, and flea treatment.",

She is easily excitable but is usually able to be redirected as she is food motivated and loves toys. She needs a home that has the patience to work with her quirks. She would do best in an adult-only home or a home with older children due to her intense herding nature. She loves to learn new things and would love a home that will continue to teach her. She loves to play with dog friends big and small. She loves to chase cats so no kitty friends please. If you are interested in meeting Mia please fill out an application and her foster mom will be in touch.\n\nWe do not have a facility for you to visit.\n\nWE PROCESS APPLICANTS AND SET APPOINTMENTS BASED ON THE ORDER APPLICATIONS ARE RECEIVED\n\n, so while you are welcome to email\nccrcdogs@ccrcdogs.com\nwith specific questions, you will want to complete the\n\nONLINE APPLICATION\n\nASAP\n\n,\n\nwhich can be found at www.ccrcdogs.com,\n\nto secure your position in line for one of our dogs. You can also find\n\na description of our process on that same page. Puppies will not be available to be seen until their 10 day quarantine has passed. Our adoption fee is $200 for adults and $275 for puppies, which covers the cost of the spay/neuter, age appropriate shots and tests, medications to bring the dog to full health, and a free visit with one of our approved vets after adoption. The majority of dogs at CCRC are obtained from animal control centers, so there is often very little known about their history or even current habits. You can always expect to do some training, regardless of whether you adopt a dog or a puppy, including crate training, house training, and basic manners. CCRC provides a variety of materials and resources to assist you with this, as well as telephone support.\n\n2/1/21 1:42 PM",

He loves spending time with the humans, but at this point we are not sure how he feels about other animals. He is looking for a home with adults only and a family that has experience with larger breeds. This is because he can be a bit mouthy, but not in an aggressive way. We think it could be due to the issues with his sight. He absolutely loves the shelter staff and volunteers and we can tell he has unconditional love to give to whoever will take a chance on him. Winston enjoys going for walks and despite his size, he won\u2019t drag you around. *Winston will be neutered before adoption.* If you're interested in meeting this lovable lug, please send an email to bandrbunkhouse@gmail.com.",

            "description": "Fendi is a neutered male Hound/Rottweiler mix. He is about 4 and a half years old. He weighs about 75-80lbs. Fendi was surrendered to the Oakville and Milton Humane Society as his family could not care for him anymore. He is a high energy dog who requires lots of exercise.\n\nThis beautiful boy experiences some stress in his day to day life and is suspicious of new people, especially men. He responds well to treats and praise. Fendi is required to go to professional dog training classes. He is reactive towards other dogs and has not been able to make any dog friends while at the shelter. He also exhibits some signs of mild guarding of food and high valued items such as toys. He should not live with any other pets including, dogs, cats, or small animals. \n\nOnce Fendi is more comfortable with someone, his sweet, playful side comes out. One of his favourite games to play is tug. However, he is still learning how to play appropriately without getting too worked up and resorting to unwanted behaviours such as mouthing and jumping up. Fendi does want to learn, and is a smart boy, but gets easily frustrated and overstimulated. If you are in his circle, he'll show you just how friendly and affectionate he can be. He will seek out attention and roll over for belly rubs and pets.\n\nFendi's home should have experience owning and working with large breed dogs. They should be active and excited to spend lots of time each day to exercising Fendi and working on his behaviours and training. A single-dwelling home with a fenced yard would be best (no apartments or condos). He must be adopted by an adult-only household (18+) without any other pets. He is not recommended for first time dog owners or people who want to exercise their pet at a dog park.\n\nIf you have the kind of home Fendi is looking for, and are interested in adopting a new best friend, please submit a Dog Adoption Application to the Adoptions department.\n\nhttps://omhs.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/OMHS-AdoptionApplication-Dog.pdf\n\nYou may submit your completed adoption application by placing it in our drop dox to the left of the shelter doors, by emailing it to adoptions@omhs.ca, or by faxing it to 905-845-1973. The adoption application must be submitted for a particular animal.\n\n Primary Color: Tan Secondary Color: White Weight: 35.2kg Age: 4yrs 4mths 2wks Animal has been Neutered",

            "description": "COURTESY POST (NJ) - Ellie is a senior love bug that has been in boarding for a whole year due to her family losing their home during COVID and then not being able to bring her to the new housing. They cannot afford to pay for boarding much longer so we are helping her family find her a new home.\n\nEllie is an 11-year-old 55-pound terrier mix in good health. Her owners tell us she is a happy pup that does not act her age. She's great with all adults and she absolutely LOVES people. She wants to be around them and loves to just cuddle. She really enjoys lounging around and being able to look out the window or sunbathe. She usually gets nighttime zoomies but other than that, is mellow and lounges around the house. She likes to be tucked in under a blanket and be kept warm. She has select toys (tough toys that she cannot ingest) that she loves to play with.\n\nHer perfect home would be a low-key place without a lot of foot traffic with older kids or adults only. No other pets in the home would be ideal but she may do OK with a submissive dog with owners with breed experience. She has been through so much and just needs a stress-free place where she doesn't need to adjust to a lot. She needs a home where her family understands she will need to settle into her new life and home and give her the time to do so.\n\nEllie is up to date on vaccines and spayed. Her adoption fee is $250. Please note this is not a LOVEPAWS dog so this will be a private adoption between the owner and applicant with the help of LOVEPAWS. Please considering making this sweet senior girl a member of your family and help her get out of boarding.",

            "description": "Ara s a two year old female Great Pyrenees surrendered to a kill shelter because her owner wos moving.  She loves cats and tolerates most other dogs.    The name Ara is a girl's name of Arabic, Armenian origin meaning \"king\".\nAlthough it originated as a boys' name, in the contemporary US, it's now much more commonly used for girls. It's also used as a nickname for Arabella. A home with  male dog would be  best for her.  She would do fine in a household as the only pet too.  We recommend obedience training for all newly adopted pyrs, to help you create a special bond with you and your new friend, and so you have a well behaved canine. Great Pyrenees are willing to learn, but are not as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds. They are bred to be independent thinkers. Applicants must be over 25, own their own home and all children in household must be over 6 years old. Your resident pets must be up to date on vaccines, sterilized, you must have a good history of vet care for them, and you must have used heartworm preventative year round for your dogs. \n\n\nAra will be placed as an inside pet with outside privileges. You MUST have a securely fenced yard accessible from your home. Invisible fencing does not work with this breed and they will take the shock for the freedom.  Great Pyrenees are bred to roam and will create their own territory if not secured, which can led to them being lost, hit by vehicles or shot by people who see them as a threat. The breed is not a good off leash dog, and cannot be trusted to not run away.  A Great Pyrenees off leash is a \" DisAPyr.\" \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please complete the appropriate application on our website, www.igpr.org under the Adopt tab. \n\nAll of our dogs marked as needing foster homes are also available for adoption.  If a dog is listed on this site, it is available.  No need to contact us to see if it is,  We do require you  complete the adoption application prior to meeting a dog.\n\nWe also offer a foster to adopt program. You foster the dog, and have first right of refusal on them if an approved application is submitted for them. \n\nIn fostering a dog, the dog comes to you fully vetted. and groomed. You provide good quality food, grooming, and we provide the heartworm preventative and medical care, if needed* .(*Based on approval from IGPR.)\n\nAdoption fee is $350",

Approximately 55lbs.\nHe's just a young fellow who has a great big loving, spunky personality. So far, Moe has shown no dog aggression towards other friendly dogs.  He does play rough and likes to nibble on people in jest.\nThose who rescued him are currently teaching him housebreaking. Because they do also have a couple of dogs of their own, they feel they may not be able to take on a third for a life term but are  happy to help Foster him until we find a home that is committed.... because he so very much deserves that!

            "description": "Johnny and Moira are a bonded pair who need to stay together. They have likely been together for their entire lives and have a loving dynamic that is a joy to see. Please note the individual details for each of them, as well as the information that applies to both.\n\nJohnny Details\nJust like his namesake, Johnny Rose, SWESR\u2019s Johnny believes that \u201cPeople Love Pizzazz.\u201d He loves to play rowdy and is mischievous. Snow and water make Johnny\u2019s \u201cpizzazz\u201d really come out. Playing in them, he is absolutely joyful. Another of Johnny\u2019s joys is a boisterous romp with his bonded buddy Moira. After a fun-filled frolic with her, he is happy to lounge in the house and chew on a nylabone. He is affectionate with humans and loves a good massage.\n\nLike the youngster that he is, Johnny puts everything in his mouth--from the dog bed, to shoes, to toys. Johnny may be a Large Munsterlander, but the DNA test isn\u2019t back yet. Stay tuned for an update on that. No matter his breed, Johnny is pure doggy joy.\n\nMoira Details\nThe beautiful Miss Moira has settled nicely into her foster home with her bonded buddy Johnny. She never has a grouchy moment, is affectionate, and loves to check everything out with her ever-busy nose. Like her famous namesake, Moira Rose, Miss Moira recently asked her foster mom \u201cYou do realize I\u2019m a professional vocalist?\u201d Her foster mom nodded in agreement as Miss Moira continued the conversation in her lovely professionally-trained dog voice. True to her breed, Moira is a Husky girl who loves to chat.\n\nMoira and Johhny make a lovely bonded pair, with Moira being more dominant and Johhny not concerned about being the submissive one. Moira enjoys the snow and the doggie pool, running and wrestling with Johhny, but then settles nice indoors. \n\nJohnny and Moira\nIn their previous lives, Johnny and Moira were not shown the way to have proper house manners. Both are smart, treat-motivated and have already started clicker training. With gentle, consistent training, Johnny and Moira are learning the way to be great companions.\n\nBecause both of these dogs are big and active, they are not appropriate for a home with young children or frail adults. They are not cat safe, so a home without a cat is a must. Johnny and Moira will need a home with a secure fence of at least 6\u2019 and room to stretch out and enjoy their boisterous style of play.\n\nAt about 2.5 years old, both these beautiful youngsters are house-trained, crate-trained, and fully vetted. They are currently in a foster home in Oklahoma and ready for adoption. For details and an application to adopt, please see http://www.swesr.org/Apply-to-Adopt.html\nFor an application to adopt or for more information about Southwest English Setter Rescue including our adoption requirements and transport availability, please go to http://www.swesr.org/.

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please download and complete an Adoption Questionnaire from our website and email US at barbaraz@k-9lifesavers.org\n\nYou can learn about the adoption process and find a Word, PDF and ONLINE version of the questionnaire by visiting: http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/howtoadopt/.\n\nDog's Name: Sadie\n\nEstimated Breed : Hound Mix\n\nApproximate Age: 11 Months\n\nApproximate Weight: approx. 51 lbs\n\nCurrently Living at: Boarding\n\nAdoption Fee: $300\n\nDOG'S DESCRIPTION\n\nSadie is a sweet sweet girl waiting for a loving forever home. Sadie is very friendly with people and loves playing around with other dogs. Sadie is quite strong and she is not aware of how big she is so she would be better off with older kids.\n\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\n\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\n\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\n\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\n\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\n\nPlease \"like\" our\nFacebook Page\nfor the most current events and new dogs.\n\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

At the end of the day, Nala is honestly just the biggest lover that you'll ever meet. Nala craves human companionship, loves her daily walks, enjoys sunbathing in the backyard, lives for belly rubs, she's all about cuddles & movie nights & loves to give big kisses. She's 100% potty trained, 100% crate trained and does well on a leash.  Nala knows all of her basic commands and is very eager to please. The perfect family for Nala would be one that is active, loves the outdoors, an avid runner or someone who loves going on daily walks, and definitely a family that loves cuddles & puppy kisses.\n\nWhen it comes to people, Nala loves everyone she meets! She loves & adores children and would make the perfect family pet. She'd do best in a home with kids over 10 years of age because at times she doesn't always understand her strength. Nala would thrive best as the only dog in her furever home, although she has made a few friends while in our care. Nala does not do well with female dogs,  but does well with submissive male dogs with a proper introduction. But once again, we would like her to be the only dog in her forever home. Nala absolutely adores the cat that is currently in her foster home- especially when it comes to cuddle time.\n\nAdoption Requirements: No Exceptions\n- Fenced in Yard Required\n- Needs to be the ONLY DOG in her new home\n- Nala would thrive best as the only dog in the home, but does do well with most submissive male dogs & does great with the male cat in her current foster home\n\nWant To See More Pics:\nhttps://www.petfinder.com/dog/nala-50060051/mi/ferndale/pro-pet-otic-foundation-mi1050/\n\nNala is currently up for adoption through Lending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue located in Metro Detroit. Her adoption fee is $150  & will include her distemper, rabies, bordetella, parvo, & lepto vaccines; deworming; microchip; heartworm test; fecal test & being fixed. Nala is currently on both flea & tick prevention and has had her ProHeart 6 Injection for heartworm prevention. \n\n***PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE POST & FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS****\n\nLending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue; previously known as the PRO-PET-OTIC Foundation, is a 100% Foster-Based Rescue that is ran by all Volunteers. Which means that we are not a shelter & each animal is in an actual home with a foster family. We kindly ask that you put any questions within the email & our team of Volunteers will get back to you. With the overwhelming amount of emails please be patient with our 100% volunteer family and we will get back to you. The application MUST BE filled out, a Vet Check MUST BE completed by our team, as well as a phone interview before we do a 'Meet N Greet.'\n \nHow To Apply:\nIf you're interested in adopting one of our available dogs:\n1. Email LendingaHelpingPaw313@gmail.com with the dogs name as the subject when you ask for the adoption application.\n2. Once you have completed the application, please print it out, fill it out, scan it, & then email it back to LendingAHelpingPaw313@gmail.com. If you do not have a scanner, please take a picture with your phone and we kindly ask that you sent all attachments into one email.\n3. Please make sure to call your vet to grant our organization permission to do a vet check on your current pet.\n4. If you are interested in more than one dog, please list your top 3 choices on the completed application.\n5. Please be honest & truthful on your application. We always do a vet Check. We always do a home visit. And we always have both the prospective families & dogs best interest at heart!\n\nThank you in advance for all of your love & support,\nThe Lending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue Family",

Nala craves human companionship, loves her daily walks, enjoys sunbathing in the backyard, lives for belly rubs, she's all about cuddles & movie nights & loves to give big kisses. She's 100% potty trained, 100% crate trained and does well on a leash.  Nala knows all of her basic commands and is very eager to please. The perfect family for Nala would be one that is active, loves the outdoors, an avid runner or someone who loves going on daily walks, and definitely a family that loves cuddles & puppy kisses.\n\nWhen it comes to people, Nala loves everyone she meets! She loves & adores children and would make the perfect family pet. She'd do best in a home with kids over 10 years of age because at times she doesn't always understand her strength. Nala would thrive best as the only dog in her furever home, although she has made a few friends while in our care. Nala does not do well with female dogs,  but does well with submissive male dogs with a proper introduction. But once again, we would like her to be the only dog in her forever home. Nala absolutely adores the cat that is currently in her foster home- especially when it comes to cuddle time.\n\nAdoption Requirements: No Exceptions\n- Fenced in Yard Required\n- Needs to be the ONLY DOG in her new home\n- Nala would thrive best as the only dog in the home, but does do well with most submissive male dogs & does great with the male cat in her current foster home\n\nWant To See More Pics:\nhttps://www.petfinder.com/dog/nala-50060051/mi/ferndale/pro-pet-otic-foundation-mi1050/\n\nNala is currently up for adoption through Lending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue located in Metro Detroit. Her adoption fee is $150  & will include her distemper, rabies, bordetella, parvo, & lepto vaccines; deworming; microchip; heartworm test; fecal test & being fixed. Nala is currently on both flea & tick prevention and has had her ProHeart 6 Injection for heartworm prevention. \n\n***PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE POST & FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS****\n\nLending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue; previously known as the PRO-PET-OTIC Foundation, is a 100% Foster-Based Rescue that is ran by all Volunteers. Which means that we are not a shelter & each animal is in an actual home with a foster family. We kindly ask that you put any questions within the email & our team of Volunteers will get back to you. With the overwhelming amount of emails please be patient with our 100% volunteer family and we will get back to you. The application MUST BE filled out, a Vet Check MUST BE completed by our team, as well as a phone interview before we do a 'Meet N Greet.'\n \nHow To Apply:\nIf you're interested in adopting one of our available dogs:\n1. Email LendingaHelpingPaw313@gmail.com with the dogs name as the subject when you ask for the adoption application.\n2.

            "description": "MEET BUSTER!!\n\nRecommended for serious and patient adopters. We aren't sure about Buster's past, but he is incredibly scared and anxious. Buster has been at the shelter since 8/3/20 when he was brought to the shelter after biting a bicyclist. It appears based on his fear, timid and scared demeanor he has gone through a lot in his young life so far. Because of how scared he is when he meets new people and the bite incident, Buster will probably do best in a quiet and calm home without children. Buster will need time to adjust to a new home and potentially a crate or some kind of safe space for him while he adjusts. Buster is getting used to yard time but still retreats quickly to his kennel. Buster is such a handsome boy and deserves love and a home to call his own. Do you have the patience and time to devote to Buster that he deserves? Come visit Buster today! The Behavior staff is recommending placement with an adopter or rescue/new hope partner that is able to provide behavior intervention/support for fearful and undersocialized dogs.\n\nUnderdog Rescue does not physically have this dog in its possession. He is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4450301.\n\nTo visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show, and we have seen that you can generally show up and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog and the shelter will squeeze you in, except from 12-3PM or closer to the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

Only a Husky owner understands that term truly! And you know that means our Blue is silly, wonderful and a whole lot of fun! Blue is a freckled 3 year old fella. He was a rescue transfer from another agency who knew we'd be better suited to find Blue the right home. They took Blue in after he was found dragging a chain and had been missing for five months! His \"owner\" decided they didn't want him back. Our initial assessment shows Blue is dog friendly but still plays like a puppy, can scale a fence like nobody's business and wants to be where the people are. Classic Sibe! Blue will require breed experience or someone who's done extensive research, will let us further educate them and won't leave Blue for long periods of time, even post pandemic. Blue also needs another playful canine companion and a 6ft privacy fence. Video: https://youtu.be/LGZsasoOivo If you understand the breed, you'll appreciate Blue.\n\nBlue is being fostered in NC - his adoption area is NJ to NC. He is able to be transported.\n\nwww.huskyrescueteam.org~~Husky Education And Rescue Team is a foster based rescue. Our dogs are in our foster homes all up and down the east coast. We do not have a facility in which you can visit. We find this a huge benefit because we learn our dogs and are able to educate our adopters on what it's like to have them live in your home. Part of our process, once pre-approved, is to speak with the foster for the dog you're interested in. If you're still interested in adopting from our rescue the first step is to complete our adoption application online at www.huskyrescueteam.org/apply\n\nIf you have additional questions please email info@huskyrescueteam.org 2/2/21 4:51 PM",

            "description": "Caesar is an 11 year old, 65 pound (but should be 55 lb) male lab mix that was taken to a vet clinic, along with the cat that he lived with to be euthanized because the owners were moving THE NEXT DAY to a retirement community! Luckily, the vet refused to do it and asked for them to be surrendered to her.\n\nHe is absolutely the sweetest old soul! He gets along well with cats and calmer dogs (loves the ladies). He is great on a leash and enjoys short walks and long naps. He loves listening to jazz music! He does have some anxiety due to the huge change in his life, but routine, time to adjust, and jazz music has helped a lot as he has settled in the foster home. He sleeps all night on his bed and doesnt make a sound. He loves being outside and laying in the sun. Caesars ideal home would be with someone who is home most of the day, so that he can lay at their feet and keep them company. He does bark when you first leave him in a room, but give him a few of his favorite treats and turn on some jazz music and he will calm right down knowing that you will eventually come back! Caesar is also in need of some weight loss, and short slow walks are his favorite type of exercise. If you are looking for that dog to get you out moving a little more, Caesar is the one for you!",

            "description": "We would like to introduce you to our loving hound mix here at Saving Grace, Gibson! Gibson is a super sweet, cuddly dog who loves nothing more than being with his humans and would love to find a home where he is your one and only. He is so loving and appreciative of all the attention you can give him.\nHe's got very soft fur and is a wonderful snuggler! T\nhis sweet boy is around 3 years old, so still a young man, but through those puppy years. He is a great size at around 56 pounds.\n\nHe likes to play (stuffed squeaky toys are his fave) and do puppy pose to let you know he is ready to play. He's good at chasing and bringing back balls and is very athletic. On the other hand, he's just as content to curl up in his bed (one with cuddly sides) and snooze.\n\nHe is a smart, curious boy and is just so happy to get a scratch behind the ear. Gibson is excellent in the house, knows to potty outside.\n\nGibson is very good on a leash and has worked on learning \"heel\" and \"leave it\" without much trouble\n.\n\nGibson does have a strong prey drive so probably best in a house without cats-and watch out for bunnies, squirrels and rabbits on walks because he'd love to chase them! He walks well on leash and tolerates his crate, although he'd much prefer to be with his people.\n\nWith his beautiful coloring and sweet personality, he just will melt your heart the second you meet him. If you think Gibson sounds like your perfect match, get your application in today to come to see for yourself why we love him so much!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",
