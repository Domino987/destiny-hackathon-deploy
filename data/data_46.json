            "description": "My name is MOCHA and I'm a gorgeous 7 yr F Tan/White Amstaff. I'm 70 lbs of BIG LOVE!! My owners had to move to a new home due to COVID hardship and now the landlord says I have to go!!  I'm a sweet chunky mama that had a very rough start in life. I was used as a bait dog as a puppy and luckily was rescued before I was torn to bits; however the scars were deep and as a result I am NOT FOND OF DOGS!  I've had a few altercations with dogs in the past so I need to be a SOLO DOG.  Funny enough I'm ok with cats as I'm living with cats now.  I've never been around young kids but because of my size... ages 13 yrs+ would be best. I'm a chubba wubba because I'm not getting enough daily exercise and my mama spoils me with chicken mcnugget treats ....but all the more dog to love! and I am a COMPLETE SNUGGLEBUG!! I have to snuggle under the covers with you!!  I love people and get very excited to meet them and sometimes I can be jumpy and mouthy because I can't contain my excitement so I will need further training with that. I'm looking for an ADULT ONLY quiet home in the suburbs with patient humans that are EXPERIENCED DOG HANDLERS &  KNOW, UNDERSTAND and APPRECIATE MY BREED. I need structured daily exercise and further discipline/ socialization training, but I'm eager to please (w/ treats) and quick to learn. I am a DIAMOND in the RUFF & will give you back 200% if you will work with me to put the demons of my puppy past behind. Please give me a chance today!!! My time is running out!!\n\nFor more info/application - pls email: INFO@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG",

She nursed her back to health, then entrusted her to STAF to find her forever home. Noelle is just around 1 1/2 years old (est. birthdate 6/19) and shy of 60 pounds. She is as friendly and sweet as she is horrible on leash ... our volunteers are soaking up the former while working on the latter :O) A basic manners class will go a long way with this cutie. Please check back for updates as we get to know Noelle better. Visit www.STAF.org for more information on our adoption process.\n\n\u2022  All of our animals are spayed/neutered and current on shots.\n\u2022  We do not do same-day adoptions; we ask that you return for a follow-up visit before taking an animal home.\n\u2022  You must be 21 years or older to adopt from STAF.\n\u2022  We require a 4-foot-tall physical fence for homes with children under the age of 11. We also may require a physical fence for specific dogs on a case-by-case basis, depending on each dog\u2019s behavior and exercise needs.\n\u2022  Due in part to increasing coyote activity/incidents in the area and the difficulty of predicting how a dog will respond to invisible fence training, we can not adopt to homes with invisible fences.\n\u2022  We do request vet and personal references.\n\u2022  We can facilitate adoptions within a 75-mile radius of our Cincinnati-based shelter.\n\nPlease visit www.STAF.org for visiting hours, a downloadable application, and additional information.\n",

            "description": "Please share this girl for us. ?? \n\nIf there is any dog that needs a home, it\u2019s Oreo. Oreo has been in a shelter system for 2 years now. She hasn\u2019t found the right home. I know our Slumdog family can help this girl. We have had several flighty cases who have found great homes. \n\nOreo is a 3 year old, very petite and polite pitty mix. She is a fearful girl but she thrives being around other animals. She would make a great addition to a \u201cpack\u201d. Oreo is good with all sizes of dogs, ranging from 9lbs to 75lbs (my variety), good with cats and Tunie, the pig. She was excellent for her bath and nail trim. She is an extreme flight risk and I can\u2019t stress this enough. She will need a secure, PRIVACY fenced in yard. She will also need to be leash walked in the yard. If there\u2019s a way to escape, she will find it. We are already working on recall and she follows you around if she trusts you. This is a case where Oreo will pick her person. She\u2019s cuddled up to me on the couch right now and has been stuck like glue to my side. But I already have a pack and she deserves her forever home... \n\nOreo is not a dog park or pet store kind of dog. She\u2019s a good, solid neighborhood walk to get her exercise in but other than that, she would be safest at home. She does get car sick as well so that just adds to the list of reasons why she shouldn\u2019t be a traveling dog. She just does not have the confidence. \n\nI didn\u2019t know Oreo when she came into the shelter but I believe that 2 years in a shelter can change a dog. If there is a special person out there that is willing to give Oreo the attention and dedication she needs, I truly believe she would flourish in the right home. Please share. She has already been spayed, vaccinated and is heartworm negative. ??\n\nTo apply to meet Oreo, please complete an application and a volunteer will be in touch. https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/13467/generic",

Please visit www.paws-united.com to fill out an application.\n**For puppies under 6 months a $200 spay/neuter rebate will be given with proof of spay/neuter certificate signed by a vet, if they have not been done prior to adoption.**\n**Please note we DO NOT adopt our dogs as outdoor/farm dogs. These dogs are coming to us as stray, roaming or dogs that have lived a life tied to a chain. Our goal is to bring them in the house off the chain and give them a pampered indoor dogs lifestyle. Unless otherwise stated we will not even consider a home that has intentions of leaving our dogs outdoors or tied to a chain**",

            "description": "1/23/2021\n\nHolly was found wandering around on her own in AL.  A kind family took her in and began rehabilitating her.  She weighed just 35 lbs at that time and was in very sad shape.  While in their home, Holly was doted upon by the family and their young children. \n\nHolly is a beautiful purebred Golden Retriever estimated to be 8 years old.  She is truly lovely inside and out, happy and always sweet.  She is great with all people, even the little ones.  Holly is low activity, fine with leash walking, and riding in a car.  She was timid when first meeting a new dog while with the family who first took her in, but has been fine with other dogs at the vet clinic.  Cats are an unknown.  Holly enjoys stuffed animals, as you can see in her pictures.  Like most Goldens, she lives for love and attention and being with her humans.\n\nWhen Holly was examined by our vet, it was discovered that she has a degenerative spinal condition and allergies.  With the help of anti-inflammatory medicine and supplements, Holly is currently much more comfortable and enjoys playing and carrying around her beloved stuffies.  She will always need her medicine to help maintain her mobility.  Her allergies are under control with a dog food that works for her, a diet which must continue when in her adoptive home.  Because her medicine and diet are an absolute requirement for Holly, we consider her to be a \u2018special needs\u2019 dog.  We are hopeful that Holly will maintain her current mobility for a few years, although it is possible that her spinal condition will slow her down more quickly.  It is heartbreaking that she has this degenerative condition but she does not feel sorry for herself and enjoys every single day.  She is looking for a family who will accept her special needs and open their hearts to her.  She deserves so much to be spoiled and loved for her retirement years, however long that may be.\n\nHolly is spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, heartworm negative, and ready to be part of a loving home.  If you have a big heart for older Goldens and would like to be part of Holly\u2019s rescue story, please contact  Lisa at lkh5@mchsi.com to be considered to adopt Holly.  If not yet approved, please fill out an application on the Adoption Info page.  \n\nRescued dogs come with a range of needs - from behavioral to emotional to medical.  When approved applicants adopt such dogs, they agree to continue the rehabilitation we have begun.    \n\nIf not yet approved, please use this link to submit an online application:  http://www.emailmeform.com/builder/form/8O06oK9Af8\n\nYou can also visit our website to learn more:  http://jlgoldenretrieverrescue.com/index.html\n\nPlease DO NOT use the ASK ABOUT button to contact us, about this dog, as that will delay our ability to respond to your inquiry.  \n\nPlease direct any questions regarding your application status to Lisa at:   LKH5@MCHSI.COM\n\nThank you!\n \nAbout Our Rescue \nBefore being approved to adopt, all potential adopters will be required to complete our online application and participate in our pre-adoption review process. The process includes the completion of an online application, a reference from the applicants' vet, a phone interview, and a visit to the applicants' home.  The application process helps us determine what type of Golden would be best suited for the applicants' life style.  In some cases, the specific dog you are interested in may have found a home before this process is complete or further assessment may indicate that this dog is not the right match for your family.  We are frequently getting new Goldens in need of a home, so we encourage you to apply and complete the application process so that when the right dog comes along you will be ready. \n\nAdoption Fees:\n$700  Purebred puppy to 12 months                                 \n$400  Dogs under 7 years\n$200  Senior, 7+ years\n$500  Bonded pair\n\nThe information provided on each dog is based on the observations of our vets, volunteers, fosters, and when available, trainers. While we do our best to report any and all issues, J & L does not make any guarantees as to the health or temperament of any dog. Dogs evolve differently in different environments and we cannot predict with any certainty how the dog you adopt will behave and adapt in your home.\n\nA contract is signed on the day of adoption.  Under the terms of the contract, all adopters are required to bring their dog to a vet within 7 business days.  All dogs receive basic veterinary care prior to adoption.  However, if an adopter's vet identifies an illness that an adopter is not willing to treat, then the dog may be returned and a full refund would be provided. \n\nMost of our dogs are fostered in private homes.  We do not have a facility to visit.  We are committed to our dogs before, during, and after adoption! To this end, the rescue retains an interest in each dog and our dogs can never be surrendered, re-homed, or sold. Should an adopter no longer be able to keep their J & L dog, J & L must be notified so that we can take the dog back into rescue and place it into another home. We reserve the right to remove a dog at any time should we find the adopter is no longer providing proper care.  Adopters agree to follow up visits as needed.  \n\nPlease be a ray of light for this J & L dog and make a tax deductible donation toward medical care and other expenses.   Every cent of your generosity goes directly toward the care of a J & L dog.\n\nTHANK YOU!",

Please visit www.paws-united.com to fill out an application.\n**For puppies under 6 months a $200 spay/neuter rebate will be given with proof of spay/neuter certificate signed by a vet, if they have not been done prior to adoption.**\n**Please note we DO NOT adopt our dogs as outdoor/farm dogs. These dogs are coming to us as stray, roaming or dogs that have lived a life tied to a chain. Our goal is to bring them in the house off the chain and give them a pampered indoor dogs lifestyle. Unless otherwise stated we will not even consider a home that has intentions of leaving our dogs outdoors or tied to a chain**",

            "description": "**If you're interested in learning more about Chloe, please email adhakcount@gmail.com**\n\nFull of energy and adorable personality, Chloe is a wonderful companion... perfect both on rambling outdoor adventures and for quiet evening cuddles on the couch. Curious, super smart, and playful in the extreme, she's a great fit for outdoorsy, experienced dog owners looking for a new sidekick. Prone to getting the Zoomies out in the yard, she loves to prance around and keep you laughing. Chloe is just a bouncing bundle of cute! \n\n \n\nShe's gentle and friendly, is quick to warm up to just about any human,. She's a quick learner and responds very well to positive reinforcement. At the same, time, she's quite confident and independent. When she's indoors, she's usually quiet and relaxed. She does tend to bark at noises outside, so may not be suited to apartment living. At walk time, she waits patiently by the front door for you to put on her halter and leash, and after she's home she curls up happily by your feet when you're reading in your favorite armchair. She's great in car rides and loves two long walks (and many romps in the yard) each day. Once she's spent both playtime and quiet time with you, she'll become your best buddy forever!\n\n \n\nWhen meeting new dogs on walks around the neighborhood, however, Chloe's so enthusiastic that she can go a bit overboard! This degree of enthusiasm makes her a good match for experienced dog owners who are ready to work with her on some \"refresher training work. While Chloe knows some basic verbal cues (like \"sit and \"come) she'll need a patient friend to help her learn the finer points of dog etiquette!\n\n \n\nShe will be happiest in a single-family home with a yard, and may do best with either an individual, a couple or a small family with older children. She's prone to rowdy, energetic play which makes her a poor fit for a home with an older dog, or one with cats or small children.\n\n \n\nChloe is a real gem - loving, funny, gentle and loyal - like a pearl in the rough. She's just waiting to find her forever friend who will help polish up her rough edges, allowing her brilliant luster to shine!",

All children in the home must be at least 5 years of age. We appreciate your understanding of these policies. \n\nNapoleon is super cute, intelligent, loves to play and always up for a good time. We rescued his mom Ginger from South TX and we found out when she arrived that she was pregnant. She had 5 healthy babies who have thrived in their foster home. Their mom weighs approx 40 lbs and appears to be a hound/terrier mix so that is our best guess on size and breed. Napoleon is just an all-around fun pup so don\u2019t miss out on making him a forever family member. \n\nLike all puppies, Napoleon needs an adopter who is willing to train and work with him to help him be the best dog he can be.\n\nIf you would like to meet Napoleon, the first step in the process is to complete an application.  Please go to roadtrip4paws.com and click on the Adopt tab to find a link to our online application.  \n\nHome visits required for all dog adoptions\n\nWe reserve the right to refuse placement of an animal for any reason",

All children in the home must be at least 5 years of age. We appreciate your understanding of these policies. \n\nBrutus is intelligent, very sweet natured, playful, and of course adorable. We rescued his mom Ginger from South TX and we found out when she arrived that she was pregnant. She had 5 healthy babies who have thrived in their foster home. Their mom weighs approx 40 lbs and appears to be a hound/terrier mix so that is our best guess on size and breed. Brutus\u2019 favorite thing is snuggling with his foster family when he gets tired so we think he will make a fabulous family pet. \n\nLike all puppies, Brutus needs an adopter who is willing to train and work with him to help him be the best dog he can be.\n\nIf you would like to meet Brutus, the first step in the process is to complete an application.  Please go to roadtrip4paws.com and click on the Adopt tab to find a link to our online application.  \n\nHome visits required for all dog adoptions\n\nWe reserve the right to refuse placement of an animal for any reason",

She is unsure of people and very timid, but she comes alive when she sees another dog. Her tail wags and she is kissing them through the kennel bars.  It is such a contrast that you have to wonder what she has been through in the past with people.  We are determined to show her that people can be kind and loving. Falcon was tested with dogs (male and female) and for food aggression and passed!! She will need a home WITHOUT cats! he is available for adoption so hurry in to meet her!!\n\nFalcon is located at the Richland County Dog Shelter in Mansfield, OH\n\nPhone is 419-774-5892\nIt is an application process.

The vet thinks we are cattle/heeler mixes. \n\n I am a very high energy breed but also very cuddly.  I love to play and sunbathe. \n\n* 1/31 update: Freddy is making lots of progress with working on sharing food. Over the past two weeks he slowly worked up to eating around dogs, sharing toys and water. When we met Freddy two weeks ago he struggled with sharing food with dogs/puppies (attacked if another dog or puppy came near when he is eating or drinking) this was due to his past as a stray, fighting for food. In combination with how this puppy was \u201cnegatively nurtured\u201d(past negative experiences) this puppy\u2019s \u201cnature\u201d (high energy/high arousal breeds) play a role in the intense behavior. \n\nWe are looking for people with another dog and the dedication to help Freddy continue to work on his behavior.  \n\nFreddy did NOT struggle with any human aggressive in any way, and only had issues with sharing with other puppies/dogs. His issues are almost gone but we want to make sure he is continuously worked and managed to make sure he never has issues in the future with sharing with dogs. \n. \n\nAll puppies are spayed / neutered , microchipped, vaccinated (rabies, distemper, parvo, boardatella), have 2 recent negative fecals, 2 recent health exams, and have been on monthly heart guard and flea and tick medicine . \n\nTo apply to adopt https://www.secondchanceranchrescue.com/apply-to-adopt",

Over the past two weeks he slowly worked up to eating around dogs, sharing toys and water. When we met Freddy two weeks ago he struggled with sharing food with dogs/puppies (attacked if another dog or puppy came near when he is eating or drinking) this was due to his past as a stray, fighting for food. In combination with how this puppy was \u201cnegatively nurtured\u201d(past negative experiences) this puppy\u2019s \u201cnature\u201d (high energy/high arousal breeds) play a role in the intense behavior. \n\nWe are looking for people with another dog and the dedication to help Freddy continue to work on his behavior.  \n\nFreddy did NOT struggle with any human aggressive in any way, and only had issues with sharing with other puppies/dogs. His issues are almost gone but we want to make sure he is continuously worked and managed to make sure he never has issues in the future with sharing with dogs. :)\n",

We will not respond to emails that can be answered on our website.\nMoxie is an 8-year-old poodle mix, weighing in at 9 pounds. Moxie is a very sweet girl and is great with kids older than 6. She is definitely a lap dog and enjoys all the attention that she can get. Moxie is very quiet, only barking/talking when she wants some love and attention. She is working on house training, she uses the pee pad or outside for all urine, but still poops in the house. This little girl is just too cold to go out in this winter weather, she seems more concerned with getting back inside the house than doing her business outside. She did have an extensive surgery when she was spayed, we sent the mass off, and it was benign.\n\nComplete Application\nYou must complete the adoption application in full to be considered for adoption. \nHome Check\nAll adoptions do require a home check. If you are not comfortable with a home check please do not apply. We want to ensure the safety of our dogs and to make sure the adoptive family is comfortable. \nMeet and Greet\nIf your application has been approved we will schedule a meet and greet for the dog of your choice or for a few we think might be a good fit for your family. \nSign Adoption Contract\nThis must be read and signed prior to adoption.\nAdoption Fee \nOnce everything has been reviewed the adoption fee will need to be paid. Puppies under 6 months is $300, over 6 months is $250, over 10 years is $150. Adoption fee includes: -Spay or Neuter -Microchip (additional registration fee required to transfer ownership to adopters) -Up to date on vaccinations -All animals have been examined by a veterinarian ** All adoption fees are non refundable.",

We will not respond to emails that can be answered on our website.\nRex is a 6 month old Boxer mix. He is the most perfect pup! He loves dogs, kids and people. He does play like your typical puppy, and loves to play with toys of all kinds. The Kong toy has been his favorite but he loves to fetch and play tug of war. He will tear the squeaker out of any toy! He has not tried to chew things that he shouldn't but he should always have a selection of toys ready! He plays hard but will settle in quickly and curl up right next to you. He is excellent on the leash. He loves the dogs and just wants a good playmate. He would be good without another playful dog though too. He sleeps through the night. He is happy in his peoples bed or in a kennel. He has learned to be comfortable in the kennel but has not chosen to go in on his own. He is working really hard towards potty training. He loves to snuggle.\n\nComplete Application\nYou must complete the adoption application in full to be considered for adoption. \nHome Check\nAll adoptions do require a home check.

She is one of the sweetest, best behaved, and most loving dogs her foster family has ever had. She is so laid back and easy going that she instantly blended in with her foster family as if she had always been there.\nWhen Angel Pie found her way to the shelter, she was very emaciated. In addition, she had developed a bad case of mastitis from having her puppies taken away too soon. As if that wasn't enough, she was also positive for tick born diseases and heartworms. Angel Pie has been treated for all of her ailments and is now ready to find her forever home.\nWhen Angel Pie first went into foster care, she was very sad. It was obvious that she missed her puppies. Her foster sisters helped to bring Angel Pie out of her depression so that her sweet and playful personality could come out. Angel Pie gets a little separation anxiety. She won't do anything bad - she just gets mopey and sad. For that reason, she should go to a home with at least one other dog.\nAngel Pie likes to follow her foster people around the house. But if they aren't doing anything interesting, she will go and find a sunbeam to lie in. And when her foster people come home, she greets them with a full body wiggle!\nAngel Pie's energy level is medium to low. She is perfectly content being a couch potato. However, she also likes to join in on any activities that are going on. She likes to \"go with the flow.\" Angel Pie does get nippy when she gets overly excited, but she is sensitive and responds very well when told \"no.\" This behavior is getting better as she learns the difference between playing with people and playing with other dogs.\nAngel Pie walks easily on a leash. She comes to her name (which she chose for herself), and is starting to learn her commands. She is not food motivated, but she is eager to please and loves to be loved on.\nAngel Pie is ready to start the next chapter of her life as your new best friend!\nAngel Pie is microchipped and crate trained. She is up-to-date and her adoption fee is $350.",

I am a little over a year old, weigh in at 40 lbs, and I am a precious little lady.\n\nI LOVE my foster mama. I am very comfortable around her and she is the one I trust completely. However, I am quite shy around new people (especially men and children). I'll keep my distance, and will approach on my own, but still am not sure I can trust them. Sometimes if they move too fast, I'll bark at them. I'm not trying to be mean; I'm just reacting in fear. My foster mama wishes everyone can see how cuddly and adorable I am with her. She can move quickly around me, roughhouse, snuggle, kiss my face, rub all over, take toys and food away, and all the things she does with my fur brothers and sister. We both know I am a very smart little girl and have the sweetest disposition, I just need to find someone who will be patient with me until I can connect like I do with my foster mama.\n\nI learned how to use the doggie door, navigate stairs, go into my kennel (which I love), and find my place bed. I take treats gently and eat my food like a lady. I'm currently on medicine for Valley Fever (I have a mild case), and take my pill gently when it's wrapped in ham. I LOVE to chase my fur siblings around the yard and chew on Nylabones. I must have Nylabones. I have completed a basic obedience class, but would love more training to help build my confidence.\n\nFor the most part, I have freedom to roam around the house and can be trusted. But, because I am still a young dog learning how to live my best life, my mama knows where I am all the time so I don't chew on things I shouldn't.\n\nDuring the day I mostly sleep like the other dogs. I love our playtime in the yard and Zoomies are my favorite. I love to play Follow the Leader and romp around with my fur siblings. I do like to chase the kitties in the house, but respond to correction when I'm told to leave the kitties alone. I would never hurt them, I just want to chase and play with them. If my humans leave, they kennel me just like the other dogs. We all just chill out and take an extra snooze. I am quiet in my kennel. I used to sleep in my kennel at night, but I have found sleeping cuddled up with my mama or the other dogs is more my style.\n\nI would love to have a fur-sibling to play with in my fur-ever home, but I think I'd be feel most comfortable in a home with no children. I'm a sweet little girl who has a lot of love to offer. I do need someone who is patient and gives me time to feel safe. I promise the wait will be worth it. 2/2/21 2:49 PM",

He likes to snuggle on the couch with you while you watch TV. Buster would be good with children with supervision since he is a puppy. He gets along with other dogs, but we are unsure about cats. He loves to play with toys and would like to have another dog to play with. A fenced in yard is required for him. He rides good in the car an  is crate trained and housebroken. Buster is neutered, micro-chipped and up to date on vaccines. His adoption fee is $300.00. If you have any questions about him not answered in this bio email  projecthoperescue@gmail.com or to fill out a app for adoption go to our web site  http://www.projecthoperescue.org",

At foster home she is very smart learning to potty trAin and crAte train snd leash train.  Very beautiful markings and her personality really is cute .  She is still a little shy and needs leash training but really doing great. A fenced yard will be needed and lots of hugs and love.  She will give back 10 fold.  Apply at rsimis2@gmail.com",

            "description": "Introducing Lincoln! At 2 1/2 years old, Lincoln is such a smart, inquisitive boy who enjoys investigating the great outdoors on long walks or yard time. He knows all of his commands (sit, down and stay) and is so eager to please his person. Lincoln will thrive with an active person/family who will take him running, exploring or perhaps even train him for agility. Due to Lincoln's age and activity level, we think he would be best suited for a household with children ages 12+. He is social with other dogs but is dog selective. We would require several successful meet and greets with any possible canine siblings. Lincoln loves people and always wants to be around them and as such, he sometimes shows signs of slight separation anxiety by whining or barking when he is apart from those he loves. Come meet Lincoln today and see if he is your perfect match! Please fill out an adoption application (no obligation) at www.satchelslastresort.org, and an adoption counselor will be in touch.",

My new family will need to be an active one that likes to go on hikes and explore the outdoors.  The more exercise I get the calmer I will be when I am in the home.  I love all sorts of dog toys so I hope my family will have lots of them.  I know how to sit and take treats nicely. I would say my manners are a work in progress.  I arrived on December 3 as a stray from Rutland County.  I have no known history with other dogs, cats.  I was adopted but returned in less than 24 hours because I was too much for the young children in the home.  My friends here at the shelter are suggesting teenage children in the home would be best.  If you think I might be a good fit for your home please call to schedule an appointment to come in and meet me.",

Completing an application does not guarantee an adoption. The age to be considered for adoption is 21.\n\nWe will not consider applications for those not able to meet/adopt on the next upcoming Saturday or at a time designated by the rescue. Adoptions are done usually on Saturdays as we are all volunteers who work full time during the week. Dogs live in private foster homes. We do not host events and there is no opportunity to view multiple dogs. \nWe will not consider incomplete applications. We will not process applications that are not for a specific dog listed on petfinder. We do not process and \"hold\" applications. We do not ship dogs and we do not arrange transports. All adopters must be present to complete the adoption. If an adopter is approved we do a \u201cmeet and greet\u201d with a specific dog or pup. If at the meet we all agree it\u2019s a good match, then the adoption takes place at that time. Their is no opportunity to meet and adopt at a later date. Again, please only apply if you are available on Saturday and ready to adopt.\n\nPlease keep in mind that we do our best to make an educated guess as to the breeds of our rescued pets. In rescue we rarely see the parents puppies, and even when we do, they are usually mixed breeds as well. We will never promise a particular breed or adult size.\n\nWe do our best to put all info we have in the bio. We will not respond to inquires regarding information that is already detailed in the bio. \n\n My name is Abbey. I am about one year old and I weigh around 35 pounds. Adoptable pets are spayed/neutered (unless the rescue Veterinarian deems the pup/dog will need to be adopted on a SN contract), have age appropriate vaccines, are current on hw and flea preventatives and microchipped. \n\nAbbey is currently in a foster home. Is is crate trained and they are working on housetraining. She is walked many times a day and has yet to meet a stranger. She is very energetic and sweet.\n\nAll adopters are provided with a medical summary, a new collar and leash, an opportunity to go over basic training/pet care and help shopping for supplies if needed. \n\n The adoption fee is $395.\n\nIf interested in adoption please submit an application! The application is found on our home page at palmettopaws.petfinder.com \n\n\n",

            "description": "Jaxx is a really great dog.  We're not sure of his breed, so guess is spaniel and pekingese or similar.  He's a young dog, maybe a few years old and weighs in about 25 pounds.  He's small, but sturdy.\n\nJaxx is a local dog, that was surrendered to his local animal services and in turn, transferred into our care.  He was surrendered as he bit a child.  There was no hospital visit and no stitches needed, but he does have that bite history and he can be a bit set in his ways, so a home without kids 15 and under, is best for Jaxx.\n\nJaxx loves being with people, and can be a bit velcro, so a home with someone that works from home often or can take their dog to work is best.  We can see him having some separation anxiety if it's not worked on during the pandemic.\n\nJaxx, we're sure has pekingese in him, and that requires an experienced handler.  He's not suited to first time dog owners.   Though he's super smart, that intelligence is offset by an independent mind and a wide stubborn streak. \n\nTraining Jaxx is possible, but it'll be a challenge for sure. Jaxx considers himself in charge of all situations, so training needs to happen with an element of Jaxx still being in charge, but not realizing you actually are.  \n\nHis adopter will need to work with a professional trainer to help Jaxx be the best version of himself.  He has so much incredible potential, and just needs someone to get him over the finish line of best behaviour.\n\nHis breed does not handle  discipline and it can cause him to become defensive and possibly to bite, which is where his bite may have originated from.  He will never want to be forced to do something he doesn't want to do.\n\nThe difficulties aside, Jaxx is a really sweet boy.  Loves to love.  Is great on car rides.  Wants to be with his people always and in the hands of an experienced handler, will quickly become someones best buddy to have amazing adventures with.\n\nFROM HIS FOSTER DAD:\n\nJaxx is an affectionate little guy who is happiest on your lap or, when he needs a break, lying down right beside you. \n\nHe was a little nervous with us at first but didn't take long at all to relax and make himself comfortable.\n\nJaxx is great in an apartment or condo. He never barks indoors and is happy to lounge around the house - so long as he has a human nearby. He gets a little anxious when left alone at night but usually settles down quickly enough. He loves his walks, and will hop up from wherever he's resting as soon as he hears the word \"walk\".\n\nJaxx is very straightforward to walk as well. He insists on walking on your right side, and will run around you to make sure this happens. He also tends to dart back and forth a bit, so may need some extra attention to avoid crossing paths with other people or getting onto the road. However he is not stubborn with the lead.\n\nHe is very well housetrained - no accidents so far in foster care. \n\nHe is cautious but calm with other dogs but does occasionally bark, especially if he can't get close enough to say hi.\n\nThere are a couple of minor cases where Jaxx has growled at us. When you take off his harness he'll try to grab onto it, and if he does get it will not easily let you take it back. He also doesn't like to be shifted around too much when lying down (although picking him up to put him on your lap is fine). He's very easily distracted though, so if he does get a little grumpy, it doesn't last long.\n\nJaxx has been our easiest dog to feed so far. Put any amount of dry food in front of him and he will quickly eat it. sThe only risk is overfeeding!\n\nAll in all, Jaxx is a beautiful and affectionate dog that will fit right in with anyone willing to give him lots of attention.\n\n____________________________________________\n\nAs of today, though our protocols could change tomorrow, we are still moving forward with adoptions. Our process has changed from some of the previous elements: We are a registered animal welfare organization, so we are deemed an essential service.\n\nAll paperwork completed online, video home visits, meet and greets outside respecting social distancing, leashes/collars/supplies wiped down and disinfected (GermiCide 3 wipes), disinfectant on the dog prior to handoff (Aqueos wipes for dogs)\n\n-----------------------\n\nTo note: the above description is relevant to this dog in his current setting. Home changes & adopter personalities can bring out different behaviours not previously seen.\n\nWe do not specifically kid/cat test our dogs when they arrive at Mattie's Place. That just wouldn't be fair to the dog or child/cat.\n\nWe also do not claim, endorse, suggest or hint at, that any of our dogs are hypoallergenic, low shed or no-shed.\n\nAdoption fee includes: spay/neuter, deworming, defleaing, vaccinations, nose to tail health exam, leash|collar, 6 months of preventative based on season/need, DNA test for entertainment purposes, dishes, poop bags, food and any extras she has accumulated in foster care.\n",

She should have either a physical fence or be taken out on a leash\u2014no tie outs. \n\nLady is good with the children in the foster home but she does like to play rough so it would be best if her forever home had older kids (8+) who were more confident with her rough play. \n\nTo learn more about Lady, see her bio at: https://ragom.org/dogs/lady-20-162\n\nPlacement Requirements:\nGood With Dogs: Yes-Required\nGood With Cats: Not Tested\nGood With Kids: 8+\nFence: Physical Fence Optional\nAge: 1\n\nIf you are interested in any of the dogs available at Retrieve a Golden of the Midwest (RAGOM), you can read our adoption process and apply to adopt, which can be found at https://ragom.org/our-adoption-process. \n\nRAGOM\u2019s adoption territory includes: Minnesota; Iowa; North Dakota; South Dakota; Western Wisconsin (within 75 miles of the Minnesota border)\n",

I'm out of those puppy years, and in just the right place to be a cuddlebug.' The adoption fee for dogs is $95. This includes spaying/neutering, fecal test and worming, rabies, and parvo/distemper vaccinations. You can find the link to our adoption application at the bottom of this page. \n \n\n \nDid you know that even if you can't adopt this pet, you can still help him/her get a home of his/her own? And all it takes is a tax-deductible donation of $10-$20! If you don't have room in your home, but do have room in your heart, you could sponsor this animal. This means you pay part of the adoption fee, making it possible for them to be adopted much sooner. \n\nDownload our adoption application at http://www.andersonhumane.org \n\n",

I was found as a stray and no one came looking for me so I became an ARF dog! \n\nI am approximately 1-2 years old and I weigh 50 lbs. I may not be all the way done growing so it\u2019s possible I could be close to 60 Lbs. once I\u2019m fully-grown. I am friendly, sweet and spunky! I have lots of energy and love to give to one very lucky family. I get along GREAT with other dogs and I love every single human I come in contact with. I will need a large, fenced yard to run and play as I please; I would not be suitable for an apartment. I love to go on walks and run around with my friends; I will make the most wonderful family pet. I would love a home with another dog or two to play with; I am the friendliest, happiest guy on the planet and I enjoy running around with my best friends and playing with toys.\n\nThe fee to adopt Chief is $200.00; this includes spay/neuter, deworming, vaccinations and a microchip. If you are interested in adopting Chief, please visit our website. www.arfhouse.org and fill out an adoption application. \n\n**Please Note: Chief is currently located at our facility in Sherman, Texas. Adoptions are by-appointment only; if you would like to meet Chief, please fill out an application on our website. Once we have your application, our Adoption Coordinator will follow up with you ASAP with any questions she may have, or to set up a meet-and-greet.",

I am a very energetic pup, but no matter what I'm doing I will always sit and give you a great big smile, when you ask me to! Prior to arriving at the Big Dog Ranch Rescue I was living in a foster home with LOTS of other dogs. I'd love to find a home with a great big yard for me to run around and play whenever I wanted to. I get along well with others, but can sometimes be selective with who I choose to engage with. I do appear to have a prey drive and would do best in a home without any feline companions. I could definitely benefit from some further training, including potty training, but I know that I'll get the hang of everything very fast. My favorite place to be is right by your side, no matter what it is that you're doing. I think I'd be happiest in an adult home or a home with older children. I love to play with toys and balls and can keep myself entertained quite well. But my absolute favorite thing to do is give hugs and kisses to anyone and everyone who comes by!",

I'm a sweet boy who loves to cuddle and play, but I can be a little bit skittish and shy when I first meet new people, dogs, or find myself in new situations. I think I would make an excellent family dog, and I even think that I'd be able to live happily in a home with a feline companion. I'd be a solid pick for any first-time adopter, but I would love it if I could find a new owner who could help me learn how to work through my shyness. I'm small and don't take up much space so I would make the perfect apartment dog! A quiet lifestyle is definitely the lifestyle for me and cuddling up on the couch next to you would make me the happiest pup in the whole world! I don't think I'd like to go out and about with you in public but I would love to be a permanent fixture in your living room. I do appear to be well-trained and while I'm not totally potty-trained yet, I do keep my kennel very neat!",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Rosie! I was rescued, along with my 6 puppies, from an Alabama animal shelter before arriving at the Big Dog Ranch Rescue. I am a super sweet girl and I absolutely love human attention - so much that when you stop petting me, I will whine and let you know that I'd like you to keep going! I like to play with dogs, but I can be selective sometimes with who I choose to engage with. Sometimes, when in social situations with other dogs, I can be a little bit skittish and very cautious, so formal introductions when meeting new friends are helpful! I think that I could make an excellent family pet, but would prefer to be with children over the age of 12 who are better able to respect my boundaries. I could be a good pick for either an experienced dog owner or a first-time adopter, but I need a confident owner who is going to be ablet to reassure me that everything is ok to help me get over my nervousness. I think I could be happy in any type of home, either an apartment or a house with a big yard, but I think that I would definitely do best in a quieter home. I could use some additional training, particularly with leash walking, but once I get the hang of it, I think that I could be a good dog for you to take out and about in public if you wanted to. I do appear to be potty-trained here at the ranch and I am confident that I can learn anything you want me to, as long as you're willing to work with me while I warm up to new things and new people.",

A Good Samaritan helped get us out of a bad situation where we were living outside, prior to our arrival. I have a very sweet personality and tend to be very playful, particularly with my sister. Between my sister and I, I would say that I'm the more submissive pup in the pair.I like to play with other dogs, regardless of their size, but can sometimes be a little bit selective too. I think I would make an excellent family pet, even in a home with small children. I even think that I could live harmoniously with a feline companion. Either an experienced dog owner or a first-time adopter would be happy to have me join their family, and I think that I could make myself comfortable in any variety of home situations, from an apartment to a great big farm. A busy or quiet lifestyle would suit me just fine and I love to welcome new visitors so if you like to entertain, I'm the perfect pup for you! I may even be the type of pup that you want to bring out and about with you in public. I could probably use some additional training, but I am very neat in my kennel here at the ranch. I also love to go for long-leashed walks and running around and playing with toys.",

A Good Samaritan helped get us out of a bad situation where we were living outside, prior to our arrival. I have a very cute and playful personality. Between my sister and I, I would say that I'm the more dominant pup in the pair. I like to play with other dogs, regardless of their size, but can sometimes be a little bit selective too. I think I would make an excellent family pet, even in a home with small children. I even think that I could live harmoniously with a feline companion. Either an experienced dog owner or a first-time adopter would be happy to have me join their family, and I think that I could make myself comfortable in any variety of home situations, from an apartment to a great big farm. A busy or quiet lifestyle would suit me just fine and I love to welcome new visitors so if you like to entertain, I'm the perfect pup for you! I may even be the type of pup that you want to bring out and about with you in public. I could probably use some additional training, but I am very neat in my kennel here at the ranch. I also love to go for long-leashed walks and running around and playing with toys.",

I am a very sweet girl who just loves to cuddle and be as close to you as possible! I just love it when someone gives me lots of kisses and attention. I like to play with other dogs, regardless of their size, and I think that I could make an excellent family dog for a family with young children. I do seem to have somewhat of a prey drive so I would probably be happiest in a home without any feline companions. I would be a great fit for a first-time adopter looking for a forever friend and I think that I would be happiest living in a home that has access to a large yard space for me to run and play. I would love a busy home environment, particularly one with lots of visitors for me to get attention from. I may even be the type of pup that you can bring out and about with you on your daily activities. I could benefit from continued training, but I am very smart and respond to my name and know how to catch treats in my mouth! I do appear to be potty-trained and I love to go on long leashed walks here at the ranch.",

I am a very good girl and I know how to sit on command! I get along just wonderfully with everyone that I meet. I also love to entertain myself with my toys and will even throw them up in the air and catch them sometimes! But nothing makes me happier than getting to play fetch with a willing human! I love to play with other dogs, regardless of their size. I think I would make a very good family pet, and would do quite well in a home with younger children. I even think that I may be able to live harmoniously with a feline companion in my new home. I think I'd make a great choice for a first-time adopter with a great big yard so we can play fetch for hours and hours on end! A busy home would suit me well and as far as visitors are concerned, the more, the merrier! I could benefit from some continued training, including potty-training, as I haven't quite mastered that yet. I LOVE to go for long leashed walks and I just can't wait to meet you so we can start having fun!",

I love to run around and play! I'm friendly and happy and just want to get to know you. Sometimes I can be a little bit shy and skittish in new situations with new people but I usually adjust quickly. My favorite activity here on the ranch is definitely getting to chase after a tennis ball. Aside from having tons of energy, sometimes I can be loud, as I don't know how to control my barking yet. You have to remember, I'm a lot like a baby and have not necessarily adapted to a schedule yet so you may find that I'm staying up in my crate at night, and sleeping during the day. I need lots of direction and training, and that doesn't just mean puppy pre-school classes. I need you to show me the right and wrong things to do. Please don't be mad if in the process I wind up chewing some of your belongings or if I have accidents in the house - I promise I will get the hang of things! I require LOTS of time, energy, and patience, but my sweet little face makes it all worth it! This is a learning curve for us both but I promise that if you put the time and energy into helping me grow big and strong, you'll wind up with a wonderful little best friend for life.",

I love to play with other dogs, regardless of their size. I also LOVE to play with people and I will run up to you and ask you to play with me, if I feel that you're not giving me enough attention. I think that I'd really enjoy being a family pet and would be good with slightly older children, preferably over the age of 5, due to my energy level. I think that I may even be able to live harmoniously with a feline companion. I'd be a great fit for a first-time adopter looking for an excellent boy to add to their clan. I also think that I could be happy in a variety of home environments, from an apartment to a big home on a large piece of land; or from a busy home to a quieter and more laid back one. I'm just happy to be with people that love me and want to show me affection. I may even be the type of pup that you would want to take out and about with you on your daily adventures in public. I could benefit from continued training, particularly surrounding potty-training, but I have learned to be a great leash-walker during my time at the ranch.",

Now that these cuties are around 2 months old, they are ready for their forever families. Is that you? Their mama, Espresso is a super sweet girl, who weighs about 40 lbs. We are guessing her pups will be on the large side like her and will be just as sweet. We don't know who the father of these pups is and we think they are likely a mix of many different breeds. Macchiato is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! Please note that processing time for applications is currently three to four weeks. We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org.

Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs.

Now that these cuties are around 2 months old, they are ready for their forever families. Is that you? Their mama, Espresso is a super sweet girl, who weighs about 40 lbs. We are guessing her pups will be on the large side like her and will be just as sweet. We don't know who the father of these pups is and we think they are likely a mix of many different breeds. Cappuccino is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! Please note that processing time for applications is currently three to four weeks. We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs.

            "description": "Meet the Espresso Pups! This litter of adorable possibly Labrador and Spaniel mixes is guaranteed to brighten your day! Now that these cuties are around 2 months old, they are ready for their forever families. Is that you? Their mama, Espresso is a super sweet girl, who weighs about 40 lbs. We are guessing her pups will be on the large side like her and will be just as sweet. We don't know who the father of these pups is and we think they are likely a mix of many different breeds. Cortado is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! Please note that processing time for applications is currently three to four weeks. We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs.

            "description": "Meet the Espresso Pups! This litter of adorable possibly Labrador and Spaniel mixes is guaranteed to brighten your day! Now that these cuties are around 2 months old, they are ready for their forever families. Is that you? Their mama, Espresso is a super sweet girl, who weighs about 40 lbs. We are guessing her pups will be on the large side like her and will be just as sweet. We don't know who the father of these pups is and we think they are likely a mix of many different breeds. Panna is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! Please note that processing time for applications is currently three to four weeks. We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue.

            "description": "Meet Espresso! This sweet and happy girl joined Labs and More with her eight puppies, and she is now ready to enjoy life on her own. She is thought to be a Labrador Retriever mix, about 4 years old, but because she's on the smaller size (around 40 lbs), we think she's likely got a few other breeds in her as well including Spaniel. Her tail is always wagging and she is very friendly with humans of all ages. She gets along with other dogs but prefers the companionship of humans, and also prefers a home with no cats or other small animals. This high energy girl would love an active family that can give her regular exercise and continue to help her with her training. She is smart and food motivated and is quickly learning her basic commands in her foster home. Espresso is house trained and crate trained.

He's very intelligent and would love an owner to work with him to help him be the best pup he can be. He's a little jumpy, but it's just because he's excited to meet new people. Enzo is partially housebroken and partially pad-trained. Enzo has always been friendly with other dogs, but recently was in a fight and required medical attention (4 staples). He needs some positive experiences with other dogs in order to keep his good temperament. Please contact Outreach@sjras.org to help Enzo.",

            "description": "Maui is an adorable 2 year old pittie who had a very difficult early life. After suffering abuse and neglect (including burns), he and a companion dog were rescued by a good samaritan. In those few weeks, Maui has shown what a loving and dedicated dog he is, and he is enjoying being treated properly, the way he deserves. Maui is housebroken and roams free in the house. He walks nicely on leash. It's unknown how he is with cats, but he gets along well with the dog he was with, possibly some food guarding with the other dog due to not being fed propertly. Maui however has developed separation anxiety. It's heartbreaking, as you can almost see how desperate he is not to be alone. Maui's caregiver is afraid he will destroy a regular crate and afraid to leave him alone since he rents. He has been missing work to care for Maui and is struggling financially due to loss of work. Maui urgently needs placement that can help him overcome or manage his separation anxiety. Please contact Outreach@sjras.org to help Maui.",

We honestly have no idea what breeds Duke's is, but we do know that he came from the streets of Texas and both parents, and both parents parents were mutts, so Duke probably has 5-15 breeds in him. We are guessing Duke and his siblings will be around 50-60lbs when full grown, but again, that is just a guess.\n\nDuke and his siblings were found living in a barn/abandoned shack in Texas with a pack of dogs who had been running the streets for some time. We were able to catch all the puppies whent hey were about 7.5 weeks old. Since they had not had any human contact until we were able to catch them, they were very weary of humans before getting to their foster homes here in CO. They were all split into separate foster homes where they have been really well socialized for the last 2 weeks. They are still a little nervous and will need patient humans, but they have to love human affection, play time, other dogs in the foster home, and to follow their fosters around the home. They are soooo sweet and really want nothing more than to be loved. These pups are also incredibly smart! They are learning really quickly and listen really well!\n\nWe are going to require Duke and his 8 other siblings go to families with other dogs so they can continue to learn from other K9's to be wonderful companions. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Duke or one of his siblings, please fill out our adoption application at brighterdaysdogrescue.com",

            "description": "PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE BIO BEFORE SUBMITTING AN APPLCIATION OR INQUIRY.\n\nMeet April!\n\nApril is a very special girl who needs a very special home! She came to us through the local open-intake animal shelter where she was brought in as part of a cruelty case with her two babies. They separated her from her babies and the first two weeks she was sitting in the shelter she went crazy, it was heartbreaking to see. After her babies got adopted, an amazing shelter worker really took April under her wing and started bringing her outside and teaching her tricks. April always did amazing in playgroups and loved all the humans that worked there. When we saw April's grin and heard her sad story, we were gonners and she joined the Mafia!\n\nWe're hoping to find April a very special home that will help her forget her sad past. If you are looking for a forever couch sidekick and hiking buddy, April is your lady. If you are hoping to take your dog with you everywhere-- bars, Lowes, pet stores-- she is probably NOT the dog for you. You see, given that she was a part of a cruelty case, she finds strangers to be very scary. BUT if her foster mama introduces her to a new human, and they have yummy snacks, she'll forget they're a stranger in about 10 minutes. She WANTS to trust, and love and be loved. She's just a tad skeptical.\n\nShe can be reactive on leash with strangers, so a fenced yard to get her energy out or a quieter home with not too much foot traffic is ideal for her. When leashed, she will pull towards strangers and bark, but she is controllable with a harness. \n\nShe is in a foster home with dogs of all ages and sizes and gets along great with all of them. She loves car rides and is totally house broken. She is not a huge fan of her crate and would love her family to be around more often than not.\n\nApril is about 3 years old and 47 lbs, so she has a ton of life and energy, but she's over her anoying puppy phase. All of our dogs are spay/neutered and up to date on age appropriate vaccinations April is currently in a MA-area foster home and is available for meet and greets with approved adopters, so please use the webaddress below to apply. \n\nPs, if you can see my profile, I am still available for adoption. Please follow this link to submit an application: https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/13170/generic\n\nOne in three pets becomes lost at some point in their life. We have partnered with Fi Collars (tryfi.com) to provide our pups and adopters with an extra layer of safety. If chosen to adopt, you will be given the option to add $100 to the adoption fee to recieve a Fi collar and 1 year subscription ($250 value).\n\nPlease make sure your vet, references, and landlord, as applicable, are expecting to be contacted by a Mutt Mafia representative. This helps expidite the process. \n\nNote: Due to increased demand, we will NOT be responding to all inquiries. If you have an issue with the application, feel free to send us an email. If you have questions about the adoption process, most should be answered by the information within the application.",

She will be great company for someone wanting a companion that is calm, housetrained and really no trouble at all. She enjoys being brushed is good with a bath. Jolie is a Maremma Sheepdog mix and spent her early years or a large farm, working, guarding her flock. She has been a pet in recent years and loves nothing more than just hanging out with her people/person, inside or outside, going for walks and riding in the car. She really wants a family/person that will take her for walks and let her be inside with them. Jolie has lived happily, with a medium size dog and enjoys the company of other dogs once she gets to know them. We do not know how she is with cats. She has done well with kids that she has been around. Her calm demeanor will make her a great addition to most any family. Jolie is 10 years old and weighs about 70 pounds. She would love to have a new family to spend her senior years with.You can apply on line at www.hsvawl.org by completing the Adoption Application on the home page.",

            "description": "Bingo now goes by the name of Toby.. He has been adopted and returned 2x. He is potty trained but is a flight risk at first. He needs a home with a secure fenced in yard and another dog to play with. He needs a patient home that is willing to give him plenty of time to come out of his shell. He prefers women and has also done well with children. He can become territorial and will bark at and nip men once he gets comfortable in his new home.\n\nAfter being adopted for almost a year, his owner has decided that it is best to rehome him. His progress was slow and he wasn't able to turn into the life companion that his owner needed. We are looking for a home with another dog to help teach him to trust his human family members and a secure fenced in yard to help prevent him from running away. He will be a flight risk until he learns where his family and food are.\n\n \n\nRazzle, Dazzle, Bingo, Nixon & Remy came to us from Warren County Humane Society. The Humane Society intervened in a hoarding case with 148 poodles in September of 2019. The community and rescue support was huge at first and allowed them to move all but about 30 of the poodles, all of which had the most severe socialization or medical issues. Stray Haven went in, when they were at this point and selected 5 of these babies to help share the load of moving them into their new forever.\n\n \n\nBingo is probably the youngest of the poodles we took in, but is also the most vocal. When in doubt he will bark. We can see behind his eyes that he wants to be rehabilitated, we think he is actually waiting for it, we think he is one light bulb moment away from realizing that people are good. You currently have to chase him down and handle him with care until he is in your arms. Once you have him in your arms, his fight goes away and he can be worked with.\n\n \n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting this baby, please fill out an application. They currently are fixed, up to date on shots, wormings, preventatives and are microchipped. Adoption fee is $188 ($175 Adoption Fee + $13 Lifetime Registration Fee for Microchip), applications can be filled out at this link. https://www.petstablished.com/adoption_form/10167/generic .We cannot guarantee breed or size when full grown.\n\n \n\nDue to our current situation, with more great applicants than we have available puppies and young adults, we are no longer accepting applications from people that are over 150 miles away. Exceptions will be made on dogs over the age of 3, special needs dogs and direct referrals from our volunteers.",

            "description": "Bonita's litter was so excited to be born into this world that their momma didn't even make it to Omaha before she went into labor! Pregnant and alone, Bonita was rescued from an overcrowded Oklahoma shelter euthanization list and started having puppies during transport, which was abruptly halted. Once momma and 11 puppies were safe and approved for travel, they completed the journey to their Muddy Paws foster home. Starting 2/28/21 these babies will be looking for homes ready to embark on the great adventure of raising a puppy!\n\nSince this puppy may be too young to be altered at the time of adoption, the adopters will be provided with a voucher to have the puppy altered and microchipped by the time he is 6 months of age. This must be done at Nebraska Humane Society. If you prefer to take the puppy to your own vet, we will pay a PORTION of the cost ($69) to your vet of choice.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for this puppy is $450. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

            "description": "Bonita's litter was so excited to be born into this world that their momma didn't even make it to Omaha before she went into labor! Pregnant and alone, Bonita was rescued from an overcrowded Oklahoma shelter euthanization list and started having puppies during transport, which was abruptly halted. Once momma and 11 puppies were safe and approved for travel, they completed the journey to their Muddy Paws foster home. Starting 2/28/21 these babies will be looking for homes ready to embark on the great adventure of raising a puppy!\n\nSince this puppy may be too young to be altered at the time of adoption, the adopters will be provided with a voucher to have the puppy altered and microchipped by the time he is 6 months of age. This must be done at Nebraska Humane Society. If you prefer to take the puppy to your own vet, we will pay a PORTION of the cost ($69) to your vet of choice.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for this puppy is $450. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

Pregnant and alone, Bonita was rescued from an overcrowded Oklahoma shelter euthanization list and started having puppies during transport, which was abruptly halted. Once momma and 11 puppies were safe and approved for travel, they completed the journey to their Muddy Paws foster home. Starting 2/28/21 these babies will be looking for homes ready to embark on the great adventure of raising a puppy!\n\nSince this puppy may be too young to be altered at the time of adoption, the adopters will be provided with a voucher to have the puppy altered and microchipped by the time he is 6 months of age. This must be done at Nebraska Humane Society. If you prefer to take the puppy to your own vet, we will pay a PORTION of the cost ($69) to your vet of choice.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for this puppy is $450. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

            "description": "Bonita's litter was so excited to be born into this world that their momma didn't even make it to Omaha before she went into labor! Pregnant and alone, Bonita was rescued from an overcrowded Oklahoma shelter euthanization list and started having puppies during transport, which was abruptly halted. Once momma and 11 puppies were safe and approved for travel, they completed the journey to their Muddy Paws foster home. Starting 2/28/21 these babies will be looking for homes ready to embark on the great adventure of raising a puppy!\n\nSince this puppy may be too young to be altered at the time of adoption, the adopters will be provided with a voucher to have the puppy altered and microchipped by the time he is 6 months of age. This must be done at Nebraska Humane Society. If you prefer to take the puppy to your own vet, we will pay a PORTION of the cost ($69) to your vet of choice.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for this puppy is $450. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

            "description": "Meet Rose, the elegant thirty-eight pound approximately 4-year-old foxhound. Rose is gentle and not a barker, and she would be best in a home with a fenced in backyard. The Foxhound is a sweet dog with a lot of patience, but bred for activity. They are not recommended for novice dog owners, especially those living in urban areas. Thus we are not adopting her to apartment owners. This is an intelligent, active breed that will find some way to occupy themselves, and in a potentially destructive manner, if they don't have space or time for running. So, a fenced in backyard with a doggy door is ideal. She is great with all humans including kids. She is both dog and cat friendly. She, like all rescues, will need decompression time and patience in a new environment. We do not know if she is housebroken yet, but she would learn quickly when given proper direction and guidance. She will be up to date on all her shots and spayed by the time she arrives on Sunday, January 24. To adopt Rose please visit our website www.peace4paws.org and fill out an adoption application. Thank you. \n\n\nDog Size Guidelines:\nSmall: 25 lbs and under (11 kg)\nMedium: 26\u201360 lbs (12 \u2013 27 kg)\nLarge: 61\u2013100 lbs (28 \u2013 45 kg)\nExtra Large: 101 lbs or more (46 kg)",

I think mostly she will want to sit on the couch with you and have her pet her belly.Kissy has had a very hard start to life and as a result he is scared. We pulled her from a scary animal control with her puppies. Any new little change makes her nervous such as wearing a coat when you didn't before. Kissy is going to need a very patient owner. She is not going to bond with you immediately. It will take weeks. However once she trusts you she is all yours. She shows her gratitude and love. I do not think she would do well in a home full of rambunctious children because of how scared she is. She has never been aggressive or nipped. She is fabulous with cats. I have not tested her with my dogs but with slow introductions I think she would do well with a doggie friend. She is 25 lbs. and house trained. She may have an accident every now and then but it is a rare occasion. Fenced yard required. She walks well on a leash if she is't scared where she is going.",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Dot or as my foster momma calls me Poke-a-Dot! Then she boops me on the nose. She finds it hilarious and I wag my tail and wiggle cause I think it's funny too. I am approximately one year old and I love other dogs but foster momma doesn't think he'd be good with cats because I like to chase the ones that come into our yard. I love my foster sister because she likes to play and rough house with me and she understands that when I'm happy I show all my teeth and smile and she doesn't get scared. She understands I'm just really really happy. Foster momma says I have some insecurity issues and I guess I do...but hey I was a puppy during COVID-19 so I missed some pretty important milestones! I get scared around new people. I don't growl or anything but they terrify me and I require lots of love to calm down. I also have a tinsy issue with food that I am working on. I can take treats with other dogs and can even stand with the pack while you serve up the food but it's best if I eat alone and have a bit of a time-out after I finish. I'm working on it and the more I work on it the more confident I become and the less of an issue it is.So the things I want in a forever family would be a doggy brother or sister to play and rough-house with. m i'mpetite maybe 30 to 40 lbs so someone that size or a little bigger would be great. A family to love me and be patient while they work on my little issue would be fantastic. In return I promise to potty outside once you show me where. To be a lovable cuddly family member that requires lots of stuffies (to unstuff!) and chew toys and to be the best Poke-a-Dot you've ever seen! Will you be my forever? requires a fence",

He currently weighs 96 lbs but would look great around 90 lbs (and we're working on it). Hunter is living with other dogs and is very tolerant good (tolerant!) with males and females. He has also been friendly with children he has met. He can be territorial on leash without proper leadership, but will thrive with a breed savvy owner who wants a balanced, friendly GSD with a good temperament. Hunter is house-trained and working on crate-training, and would prefer an owner or family who is home more often than not.\n\nNote: We will only consider single family residences (no apartments/condos) for Hunter. Dog experience is required: No first-time dog owners.\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $500 which includes spay/neuter, all core vaccinations, microchip, heartworm test and health certificate. Your adoption fee may be tax deductible as Dog Gone Seattle is a federal 501c3 organization.\n\nApply online: www.doggoneseattle.org/adoption-application\n\nHistory: Hunter was transferred from a Seattle area shelter due to kennel stress.",

I may take a little while to warm up when I first meet you, but once I do, I love to cuddle! Did I mention, I am very, very soft? \n\nI'm not house broken yet, but me and my foster family are working diligently on this task. Since I love to play so much, I would be extra-happy to have another dog in my new home, but no small kids, since I am very shy when first meeting new people. Oh, I do well with cats! \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out our application here: http://www.rchsks.org/our-animals/adopt-a-pet/adopting-a-dog.  By filling out the application you are not committing yourself to adopting; it's a screening process that must be completed before you meet the dog. Please do this BEFORE calling.

            "description": "So Bear was adopted out as a puppy in March 2019.  Sadly, his owner of 70 years  of age passed and the family has several animals of their own.  They were very sad and reluctant to give him up,  but they already have a full house.  The previous owner didn t have other animals by choice.\n\nThis boy is energetic.  Older children would be fine, but not a toddler as he loves to run when he gets in his yard.  He does need to be taught no jumping on humans, etc.   Positive training of course to be rewarded with a treat!  As far as other dogs, it is unknown.  My guess is that he would be dog selective and reactive if he comes in contact with a dog that has an alpha demeanor.   He s a shepherd  so I believe he would make an awesome protector.\n\nI will also have him heartworm tested if there is no current test in his medical file.  As soon as this is known,  I will update!  My guess if that he s negative....but we ll find out for certain!",

He just arrived from an overcrowded California kill shelter. And maybe that's his reason to prance now? He knows this is his chance for a new life with a great forever family! Moe is just 3 years old, a bit timid, but with lots of spirit. With some patience, TLC and a few treats Moe is developing confidence and trust.

This long fellow had a home once, and a mom who loved him but just couldn't afford to care for him. He was suffering from eye and ear infections and had a huge mass on his side. The mass ruptured, got infected, and animal control removed Clyde from his home. A stinky dog with a hole in his side was not safe in the Philly shelter, but luckily we have friends there and they asked us to help Clyde. And of course we did!\n\nClyde gets along just fine with dogs, cats, and new people. He is almost completely blind so he is nervous at first, but warms up with kind words and lots of petting. Unfortunately most of his time with us has been spent doing wound care (his cancerous ruptured mass was removed and Clyde is now cancer-free!), and treating his eye and ear infections, so we didn't get off to a great start of making him feel comfortable mentally. However, now that he is finally healing up we are making progress with earning Clyde's trust and letting him know his suffering is over. Although he gets around pretty well, Clyde does need help going outside and coming back in after going potty. He will need a patient family who is willing to work on his house training and give him daily eye medications to prevent dry eye (a common Shih Tzu issue.) Clyde will need a home without small children.",

            "description": "Cody was found wandering the streets of San Bernardino. We believe he is around 5 years old. Cody is very scared and has shown mild signs of aggression when being approached. We believe he has spent his whole life as a stray and therefore has had limited contact with humans to show him love. We will be working with him to help socialize him and build his confidence with humans and other dogs. We are sure he will be the greatest boy once he feels safe and secure. He came in with Roo and they appear to be bonded so ideally we would like to place then in a home together. Please email Lauren- laurenforeverrescue@gmail.com for an application!\n\n---\n\nCome meet our dogs Saturdays and Sundays at Petsmart in Costa Mesa from 11:30-2:30. All A Home 4 Ever Rescue dogs receive a wellness exam by our veterinarian and are up to date with vaccinations. They are spayed or neutered and microchipped before they go to their adoptive families. If you would like more information please email the adoption Director muellenbergerin@gmail.com",

            "description": "This beautiful young (15 months old) dog came from a home where he was loved, and yet there were issues. His mistress, a young woman who adored him, realized that she didn\u2019t have the skills needed, and the rest of the family (her parents) weren\u2019t on board with regard to consistency, structure, and rules, and she didn\u2019t have control over how he was being treated (rough treatment by the man in the home). \n\nBean is a sweet boy who lacks confidence and needs an understanding human (Rottweiler experience a must) to provide clear, consistent rules to help him be the best he can be. Overall he's proven to be an easy, low key dog, very mellow and not high energy at all. He adores being with his human and an ideal home for him would be someone who is retired (quiet home without young kids) or maybe someone who works from home, or can take him along. Someone who would like to talk a leisurely walk with him in the morning and spend the rest of the day hanging out. \n\nHe's still getting over some of the treatment he had in his prior home and can be very unsure of himself, slow and tentative. So far he's been very friendly with everyone he meets, but is cautious when meeting men. He's been around horses, chickens, and the barn cats without much fuss, and seems to have a fairly low prey drive.  He just wants to be loved and to lie at your feet adoringly.\n\nHe\u2019s good with other dogs, including small breed dogs (his sister was a shih tzu), but wants to dominate one of the other male dogs in his foster home. He\u2019s very responsive and nonchallenging to humans, with basic obedience and is looking for consistent guidance and confidence from his human. \n\nThis boy has SO much potential and is ripe for becoming your next nose work titleholder, or barn hunt champion, or simply your best walking buddy. He\u2019s young and has so much to learn\u2026and to give. This guy is truly a diamond in the \u2018ruff\u2019 and we are excited for the bright future ahead. \n\nGo to  https://spdrdogs.org/rescue-referral/how-to-adopt/ to fill out an adoption application for Bean.\n\nWashington State only - no interstate transports (although we will consider Oregon and Idaho applicants).\n\nVisit our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/SPDRRottweilerRescue",

Unfortunately, he has a collasping trachea which causes him to cough and which will likely need medical treatment in the future. He is sweet and friendly and loves to go on walks and will do well with anyone. He is great with other dogs and came in with Aspen and Angel. His ideal home will be with someone who is willing to work with him to restore him to a proper weight so he can live his full life potential in good health.\n\nFor an application and an appointment to meet Denali please email muellenbergerin@gmail.com.\n\n---\n\nCome meet our dogs Saturdays and Sundays at Petsmart in Costa Mesa from 11:30-2:30. All A Home 4 Ever Rescue dogs receive a wellness exam by our veterinarian and are up to date with vaccinations. They are spayed or neutered and microchipped before they go to their adoptive families.

The kind humans at HSNB think I might have been a backyard dog, but don't worry, I'm working hard on my puppy manners and am making real progress. I'm hoping my forever family will (be patient and) continue to work with me on this. If you are looking for a sweet-natured boy with LOTS of love to give, please complete the adoption application on hsnb.org/adoptions. My fee is $300. Thank you!

She enjoys time outdoors (and will require a sturdy fence; she pushed a loose board out of the way once to escape). Her happiest home would have her as an only dog (she is good with cats and mature kids). She enjoys playing with other large dogs at the dog park, but wouldn't enjoy living with another one on a day-to-day basis.\n\nNova is housebroken and crate trained (although she prefers to sleep outside of it). She occasionally steals a treat off the counters but is otherwise very well behaved.\n\nInterested in giving this lovely girl a home? Please fill out an application today (GPRM can assist with transport to her new home).\n\n*Please know that Nova needs a very soft and gentle hand... she remains standoffish but is absolutely loving once she gets to know you.",

            "description": "Fitz is a 4 year old, 12 pound, male Chihuahua, who is the sweetest little guy you will ever meet. He recently had surgery to repair his knee and is healing at the home of a foster. He is a very sweet well trained little boy who just wants to please and does not let his injury get in the way of enjoying life. He will do great with children or adults and needs to be with someone who will give him the love and care he deserves.\n\nFor an application and appointment to meet Fitz email muellenbergerin@gmail.com.\n\n---\n\nCome meet our dogs Saturdays and Sundays at Petsmart in Costa Mesa from 11:30-2:30. All A Home 4 Ever Rescue dogs receive a wellness exam by our veterinarian and are up to date with vaccinations. They are spayed or neutered and microchipped before they go to their adoptive families. If you would like more information please email the adoption Director muellenbergerin@gmail.com",

We had to step in and are very glad we did. Rosie is a VERY sweet, but shy rescue. Submissive in nature, but her heart is wanting and willing to love. We are looking for a loving, patient and safe place for Rosie to find her forever home. She is absolutely adoptable and her initial shyness should not keep her from finding her match. We believe that the right home is out there and that she deserves it. She is fully vetted, sterilized and ready to fly. We are looking for a home in the upper east coast where we have the support of one of our sister shelters to help us find her match. If you'd like to apply to adopt Rosie, please log onto www.scarpr.org and click on How to Adopt. Her adoption fee is $425 which includes transportation off the island of Puerto Rico. Thank you in advance for your support of our mission.",

Beans is all about that ball life, so if you are looking for a dog that loves fetch he's your guy! While Beans is active and up for anything, he is also perfectly happy to snuggle up and snore the afternoon away. Beans is incredibly food motivated and eager to please! He is crate trained, but does have some minor separation anxiety that presents in the form of whining, not barking. Beans is also house trained, and does well on leash with a training collar. Beans does have some leash reactivity, but he has drastically improved that behavior and with continued training we are confident he will be an excellent canine citizen. His ideal home would have bully breed experience, a securely fenced yard, be able to provide consistent structure and training, and a comfy couch for snuggling up at the end of the day. Though Beans has played with other dogs he would be best as an only dog with no kids under the age of 12 due to his size and strength.\n\nDNA: 50% Amstaff 20% Aussie 20% Collie\n\nAdoption Info:\nAdoption fee is $400 which includes spay/neuter, all core vaccinations, microchip, heartworm test and health certificate. Your adoption fee may be tax deductible as Dog Gone Seattle is a federal 501c3 organization.\n\nApply online:\nwww.doggoneseattle.org/adoption-application",

He was a baby when I first met him. He was always carried in arms. Sparky was Rosie's baby. Well sadly Rosie passed away in September 2019 and Sparky became homeless running the farm roads on the outskirts of research ave in Lubbock. So, I followed him to where he stayed and the elderly husband of Rosie said he couldn't care for  Sparky since his wife passed. And sadly Sparky was left to fend for himself. So the foster brought him home.  He is a bubbly young boy. He is extremely sweet. and prefers to be held It's his security. He is super quiet and calm. Easy going with other dogs. He is super active. Likes to eat watermelon and treats.  When you tell him no he has this look as if he is saying PLEASE... He's just so adorable. \n\nHe is up to date on shots, microchipped, heart He is up to date on shots, microchipped, heartworm test negative, and neutered. He can go on a 1 week home visit to see if it\u2019s a good fit. His adoption fee is $150. If interested please email adoptions.spspca@gmail.com",

            "description": "Meet Emery #2, an 8 year old yellow Labrador eager and ready for his forever home! Emery is a full-sized lab weighing approximately 70 lbs. Emery is a total sweetheart and just as handsome as can be! Emery is working on his leash-walking skills and is housebroken. He is also crate-trained. Emery loves water, so his forever home should be ready for water activities. He will chase the hose, because he loves to bite at the water! Emery is a bit nervous at first and once he knows he is safe, he will be your best friend. Emery gets along great with other dogs. Please ask us all about this fantastic senior; we've promised him the perfect forever home!\n\nFor additional information about Emery #2 please email Shana Luzusky at shana2576@gmail.com. \n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION: We receive many questions about our adoption process from potential adopters, most of which can be answered by viewing our \"Adopt a Lab\" page on our full service website, https://labs4rescue.com/.   To expedite the process, please follow the step-by-step instructions outlined and submit an adoption application listing 3-5 dogs of interest. Please hurry as your new best friend is waiting for you!\n\nADOPTION FEES: $345 non-refundable adoption fee for all vet expenses (spay/neuter, shots, etc.) and transportation to ensure your lab gets to you in a safe, professional manner. All fees may be paid using PayPal, cashier's checks, or money orders. Labs4rescue does not accept personal checks for adoption fees. All adopters must pay their Labs4rescue adoption fee prior to the rescue shipping their dog.\n\nResidents of Massachusetts or New Hampshire are required to pay an additional $125 fee, which defrays the cost of their state's mandatory 48 hour isolation and examination by a licensed veterinarian.",

He is 7 years old and his current owner is not able to give him the love he needs because of her mother being sick and in and out of the hospital. Blue is excited to find a home where he can be the dog he wants to be. He is not good with cats or any prey animals, and he does not like other male dogs. He will probably need to be an only dog unless they are females. Blue loves pleasing his people, and he wants someone who will give him attention and love him.

Grace loves being upside down on a couch while you rub her tummy, which causes her to make all manor of strange noises. She truly is a ham! She enjoys car rides and country road walks. Grace is housebroken and crate trained as well! \n\nYou would not guess she is a senior girl between the age of 11-12. She truly is an excellent companion, and very happy to meet everyone she sees! Grace does need to be an \u201conly child\u201c, as she does not see eye to eye with other dogs or cats. However, she is very  polite around dogs when walking on a leash, or in a fenced yard. She does well with children over the age of 5 as well! \n\nSenior dogs truly are such a treasure, and Grace is no exception! They sleep all night, love to share the couch, your bed, and of course, your snacks! They are also known to  lower your blood pressure, and brighten your day!",

(Corgi/Schnauzer/Jack Russell blend???) \n\nKasey is totally housebroken and has great house manners and does not need to be crated!\n\n Kasey is very sweet but also very shy and skittish and calm and quiet. She is starting to come out of her shell (and gives kisses) but she needs someone with patience to give her the time she needs to blossom. \n\nKASEY IS A GREAT DOG!!!\n\nShe is indifferent to other dogs but would do best as an only dog. Currently prefers to hide behind a chair or in a corner but has been really coming out of her shell!\n\n It seems as if she is not used to the comforts of life and soft blankets or kindness... she has a sad and gentle nature about her. \n\nShe is doing great on the leash!\n\nSadly, Kasey is heartworm positive and has started treatment which is paid for by Mini Mutts. We expect her to test negative in six months!\n\nKasey needs a new life!!\n\nEMAIL:\nmini-mutts@outlook.com\n\n(fosters/adopters must be in the Dallas/Fort Worth/Rockwall or surrounding areas only)\n**************************************\n*NO CHILDREN UNDER 5 YRS OLD\n* NO APARTMENTS\n*************************************\nTO APPLY-Your dog\u2019s heartworm prevention and testing must be seen on vet records or other proof must be included.

This is Duncan! Earlier in his life Duncan found himself in a rescue through unknown circumstances. He was adopted and very loved, but then circumstances changed for his family and he wasn\u2019t getting the time and attention he needed so he was turned over to our amazing rescue. Even though he has been shuffled around and has been through rescue twice now his spirit has not been broken. He is a happy, loving, sweet soul that needs some stability in his life. Duncan\u2019s next home needs to truly be his forever home. He is a very easy going pup and gets along with other dogs, and cats too. His preference though is definitely towards the humans in the house. Duncan loves to be snuggled up under a blanket in a lap, but he is still a young adult so he enjoys playtime too. He is housebroken and crate trained and an all around good boy. We have not exposed Duncan to young kids so we are not sure how he would interact. If you feel you could provide Duncan the loving forever home he deserves submit an application and see if you could be this sweet boy\u2019s perfect match!\n\nIf you want to help with this dog\u2019s medical expenses: \nhttps://therescuedrescuers.org/how-to-help\n\nIf you want to adopt this dog, apply at the link! \nhttps://therescuedrescuers.org/adoption-application",

ORG to learn more about Vegas and to submit an application. If you are reading about Vegas, she IS available.\n\nFOSTER COMMENTS: Do you enjoy the outdoors and going for walks? Vegas does too! She would be a great addition to an active household.\n\nVegas is a 5 yo sweet girl who is very loving. She weighs 60 lbs and is full grown. She was a bit timid at first in her new foster home but after a day or two, she warmed up to and her tail is wagging! Vegas is house broken and we have not had to use a crate much as she is very well behaved.\n\nVegas would be a great companion and would love to find a forever home with a fenced yard. She knows commands such as stay, sit, shake (touch), lay, and wait which she learned from obedience training. Please check out her video!\n\nVegas should be in a home without young children and would be best as an only dog. She will get along fine with most dogs but will want to be the alpha dog. Do you think you have the right home for this wonderful girl who is now looking for a forever home?\n\nEVERY DOG HAS A STORY: Vegas used to live with a wonderful couple for 5 years. They said they would have kept her forever however they had two boys who are now 18 months old and that was too much for Vegas to handle. They decided that she should live in a home without young children.\n\nSome of the information contained in this biography includes approximations based on our expertise and is not guaranteed.\n\nApplicants must live no further than one hour from Cary NC as our dogs must be seen by a BFPA veterinarian for all medical care prior to adoptions being finalized. Our foster guardians deliver dogs to their new homes for adoption trials and we do home visits to finalize all adoptions. We therefore require applicants to live within an hours drive of Cary NC.\n\nINTERESTED IN ADOPTING VEGAS? If so, please fill out our dog adoption application by copying and pasting this link in a new browser window:\n\nhttps://toolkit.rescuegroups.org/of/f?c=WHMSYCNC",

I have some wonderful qualities and I'm a very handsome doggo, but I also have some behavioral challenges that I am working on and I require an experienced adopter. Please look beyond my handsome pics and read on to learn more about me.\n\nHere are all the ways I'm an awesome dog:\n\n- I'm house trained and crate trained. I'm working on my leash training and making great progress!\n\n- I love to get outside for walking, hiking, and playing fetch. I also enjoy napping afterward just as much.\n\n- I'm very smart, treat-motivated, and eager to please so I pick up on training quickly.\n\n- Once I know & trust you, I'm a sweet and lovable boy. I give kisses and love to be pet.\n\n- I like playing with other dogs around my size whose energy & demeanor are a complement to my own.\n\nHere are the areas where my behavior is a work in progress and why I need an adopter with dog behavior experience:\n\n- I have \"stranger danger\". New people are scary to me so I try to be even scarier by barking and lunging. Once I know and trust you, I am a lovable, sweet boy but it will take me several meetings to get to that point with a new person.\n\n- I have some anxiety. It doesn't bother me too much when things are quiet & peaceful. But sometimes when things around me are busy or too active, I get a little overwhelmed.\n\n- Because of my behavior, I need a quiet home with adults only.\n\nI may not be a perfect dog, but I'm still a very good boy. I love the people in my life who I know & trust and they love me too. I'm sure there is someone out there for me who will teach me that life is not so scary and will help me to build my confidence, trust humans, and be the bestest doggo I can be!\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal.

            "description": "Matthew is an approximately six-month old Shar Pei-Lab mix who\u2019s very active and has so much love to give.  He was found wandering in the woods and his foster family is working with him on the basic skills of potty training, etiquette and play, but Matthew will likely need some additional formal training due to his high energy level and lack of experience in a domestic environment.\n\nMatthew is very people-centered. He loves cuddling on the couch, happily accepts belly rubs and is always craving treats! He has been a very fast learner when it comes to potty training and is an extremely attentive listener. We expect he will grow to be a very obedient boy.\n\nDue to his alpha personality, Matthew would probably do best in a home currently without other pets. However, Matthew does like other dogs and we believe he could eventually thrive with a patient family willing to properly integrate him with another pup. Since he is still so young, Matthew would also do best with a family with older children.\n\nMatthew is a beautiful dog with an even more beautiful heart. Despite the adversity he faced, he is a sweet, playful and loving boy who will make a wonderful life companion.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Matthew, please fill out an application via our website at https://therescueproject.net/adoption-application and we will get back to you via email once your application has been reviewed.  If you have further questions please feel free to reach out to us at adoptionstrp@gmail.com\n\nMatthew's adoption fee is $150 and includes age appropriate vaccines, spay/neuter, microchip, deworm, and heartworm testing.",

            "description": "Edison is a senior but don't let that fool you - this old guy does not spend his days napping. Edison is alert and excited for each new day. Whether that be accompanying you in the car on your errands, or just following you around the house, he just wants to be where you are, by your side.\n\nEdison walks nicely on the leash, and is always excited to go for a walk. Out and about he's friendly and curious, and seems very keen to meet other dogs. We're not too sure how he feels about cats just yet, but in his current foster home he lives with a parrot and he has no interest in him at all.\n\nHe is happy in his crate, is perfectly house trained, and quiet in the home. We're not sure Edison can bark, we have never heard him, but he does make an adorable old man grunt when he wants your attention.\n\nHe is also clearly a little hard of hearing, but if you clap or wave your hands around he will realize you want his attention and will come bounding over.\n\nAn affectionate and mellow guy, Edison loves to fall asleep with head on your lap. He loves attention and cuddles, and if you stop petting him you might hear one of his famous 'grunts' to request you not to stop!\n\nWe can't forget to mention that sweet Edison has a heart shaped head. He really does. He wears his big heart on the outside as well as the inside, we love this guy!\n\nEdison is 8 years old, 62 lbs, and ready for his forever home!

            "description": "Meet Remy. This handsome boy was found running as a stray in a small town in South Carolina and taken in by a Good Samaritan. They posted him online, had him scanned for a microchip, and contacted Animal Control to see if anyone was looking for him, and found no one. To ensure he would find his true forever home, they contacted Worthy Dog for help.\n\nRemy is currently living in SC in a home with his foster mom and two other dogs, a small Chihuahua and a Lab, and he does well with both. He gets along great with other dogs and really enjoys their company. He's a medium-level energy pup who loves to romp and play and knows how to be mellow inside. Daily activity and exercise is the key to keeping him calm and well behaved.\n\nLike many hound mixes, Remy is a vocal dog and will bark when he gets excited. Because of this, he is not a good fit for a condo or apartment. His foster mom describes him as a playful but gentle pup who is very respectful of your space and the other dogs. He's crate trained and sleeps well through the night, and has been getting better every day at walking on a leash.\n\nWe think sweet Remy will make a great family dog. He's social and not shy around new people, and doesn't like being left out - he wants to know where everyone is. We are looking for a fun, active family with another young playful pup in the home.\n\nFOSTER UPDATE - 1/28/21\n\nRemy has really settled in. He likes pet and being close by, so he's starting to hang out with us more now. He loves being wherever his family is and loves playing with the dogs.\n\nHe does mouth a bit when excited, but no nipping or biting. He is calm when he meets people, and doesn't try to jump on them right away.\n\nHe is significantly better on his leash walking. He takes his treats really well, very gentle. He still has to learn how to play with people so that he isn't as mouthy, but that's improving too.\n\nRemy gets neutered this week and will be ready to come to N. VA on 2/6.\n\nApply today!\n\nBREED ESTIMATE: Beagle or Hound/Shepherd mix\nGENDER: Male\nAPPROXIMATE WEIGHT: 40 lbs\nAPPROXIMATE AGE: ~1.5 to 2 years\nCOAT TYPE: Medium\nADOPTION FEE: $400\nOTHER INFO: UTD on shots/neutered/microchipped\nLOCATION: Indian Land, SC\n\nFOR MORE INFO OR TO ADOPT: Please go to https://adopt.worthydog.org and complete the application.\n\nYou can also help save dogs like this one by becoming a foster, providing a rescue dog with a temporary home and giving them the love and care they need until they are permanently adopted. Every person who fosters is directly responsible for saving the life of a dog, because we can only save as many dogs as we have foster families available to welcome them into their homes. If you think you might be interested in becoming a foster and want to learn more, please go to https://foster.worthydog.org and fill out an application.\n\nWorthy Dog Rescue is an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue that primarily adopts to families in the DC Metro area.",

            "description": "I am proud momma to the Greek Mythology litter. I am a great momma and a great dog. I love to roll on my back to have my chest scratched and I love to cuddle. I haven't had an accident in my foster mom's house yet, even with all the milk weighing on my bladder. My foster mom says that's outstanding! I'm okay with most dogs, but do take a while to warm up, possibly because I'm protective of my pups. I walk pretty well on a leash and am good at coming when called. I love to steal shoes, but haven't chewed them yet, I only bring them to my room for attention and haven't chewed anything in the house. I am a wonderful dog, and you'll be lucky to have me!\n\nYou can also watch for stories, pictures and videos about me on JR's Pups-N-Stuff's Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/groups/40103261297/. Ask to meet me today!!\n \nAdoption fee: $350\n \nAdoption fees for all dogs/puppies include a $50 refundable training deposit. Complete your basic training program and provide a copy of the certificate within 4 months (120 days) of adoption and we will refund $50 of the original adoption fee.\n \nAll dogs/puppies have been fully vetted including spay/neuter, micro-chipping, worming, heartworm testing and preventative treatment, flea/tick preventative, and all required age appropriate vaccinations. As required by Wisconsin Act 90, all dogs will have received a veterinarian exam (CVI) within the past 30 days.\n \nOur adoption process requires the submission of an application. Applications and Adoption Rules can be found on our website, on the \"HOW TO ADOPT\" tab at JRsPupsNStuff.org. Upon receipt of the completed application, we will process the application including: contact with your veterinarian and completion of a home visit. Please be sure to include the contact information for your vet as we will call. If your vet requires an information release, please be sure to contact them as soon as you submit your application. We are a group of volunteers with families and jobs, so please be patient and allow a few days for our response.\n \nJR's Pups-N-Stuff Dog Sellers License 270089-DS",

            "description": "Dill is a 1 year old male Labrador Retriever mix sweetheart who currently weighs 45 pounds but should be closer to 50-55lbs. He is equal parts playful and cuddly. His favorite things include running around the yard chasing other dogs, snuggling on the couch, and scouring the kitchen floor for snacks. He is so sweet and gives the best kisses.\n\nDill has a few charming puppy habits such as chewing on shoes, pillows, and clothes if found lying around when he's unsupervised. His foster family is working on breaking the habit. He is also skeptical about stairs at first, but with practice, has learned to go up and down the stairs without issue. He is (mostly) house trained, with the exception of a couple accidents on his first day in the foster home.\n\nDill is great with humans and other dogs. He absolutely loves his 4-legged foster sister. He is the hyper little brother that consistently nags her to play, but always in a gentle manner.\n\nDill would do great in any home, but would be best with active owners who can make sure he gets daily exercise and play time. He can also benefit from some basic training and discipline to break a few of his puppy habits. Regardless, he will make any family happy because he is truly a great dog.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Dill please submit an inquiry directly with Greater Charlotte SPCA by visiting charlottespca.org/adopt.\n\n***Because our rescue is composed entirely of volunteers and we require a home check for each of our adoptable pets prior to them going to their new homes, local applications will take precedence. We will accept out of town applications, but any family further than 60 miles from Charlotte is responsible for finding a representative of a rescue local to them that is willing to perform the home check. All out of town applicants will also have to be willing to drive to Charlotte to meet/pick up the pet as soon as the application is approved.***",

            "description": "Marilyn is ready for her forever! Get ready to fall in love!\n\nMarilyn came to us a little over two months ago from a shelter in Southern California. Originally she was pulled with her buddy Monroe, but they ended up not being bonded and Monroe quickly found a loving home. Marilyn needed extra time and love. Her time in Southern California was traumatizing and she was in a major funk when she came to her foster home. We cannot stress what a perfect example Marilyn is of rescue dogs who need time and patience and love in order to truly heal and trust and feel safe. \n\nWhile Marilyn has made huge progress with the help of her incredible fosters, she still needs a very specific kind of home to thrive.  Marilyn does well with other dogs with slow introductions.  She does not like to be crated. \n\nWhile Marilyn is not a \u201cplug and play\u201d dog, she is special, and we have found that the broken ones are often most desperate to give and receive love, and end up becoming our heart dogs. Our namesake was no easy pup, but Dublin grew into the greatest gift. We know that Marilyn is a special girl who needs to find her perfect match. Are you her forever?\nPlease email 4everyoursrescue@gmail.com for an adoption application.\nAdoptions only in Reno, Sacramento, Nevada County, Roseville and Rocklin.",

From there you can find the dog and comment on his or her picture which will notify the foster family of your interest. \n\nWe are a foster-based rescue, so adoptable animals are in private homes in the NW Florida Panhandle. The best way to meet one of our pets is to attend our adoption events on Saturday. To find out where we'll be this week, visit our Facebook page at www.SavingwithSoul.com. \n\nThank you for considering a rescued pet!",

From there you can find the dog and comment on his or her picture which will notify the foster family of your interest. \n\nWe are a foster-based rescue, so adoptable animals are in private homes in the NW Florida Panhandle. The best way to meet one of our pets is to attend our adoption events on Saturday. To find out where we'll be this week, visit our Facebook page at www.SavingwithSoul.com. \n\nThank you for considering a rescued pet!",

He would love a yard where he can run around and play with toys and his people. Kaden also loves walks, he is working on his leash manners as he still pulls a bit, walks are exciting!\n\nKaden loves treats and will gladly work with them while working on his training. Kaden is strong and will need a family that can physically handle him. \n\nKaden has done well with other dogs in our care, but due to his size we would not put him with dominant dogs and proper intros are always recommended! Kaden is not tested with cats. Since he is a big boy, kids over 10. \n\nKaden is UTD on shots, microchipped and neutered. His adoption fee is $450.",

From there you can find the dog and comment on his or her picture which will notify the foster family of your interest. \n\nWe are a foster-based rescue, so adoptable animals are in private homes in the NW Florida Panhandle. The best way to meet one of our pets is to attend our adoption events on Saturday. To find out where we'll be this week, visit our Facebook page at www.SavingwithSoul.com. \n\nThank you for considering a rescued pet!",

Playing in the yard, playing in the house, playing with toys, playing with the resident dog, you know, just playing. If I were a food I would be a fudge stripped cookie, you know, the kind Keebler makes. We are the same color with just the right amount of sweetness. Just like me! A perfect day for me would be, well, playing, of course! I bet I would like hikes and runs too. If I was on a dating app, my pickup line would be; \"Do you believe in love at first sight-or should I walk by again?\" Dinah is about 12-14 weeks old, currently 19 pounds, does well in her crate and she would love to have a family of her own. Her adoption fee is $285 which includes vaccinations, microchip, spay and she is on heart worm prevention. If interested in adopting Dinah, fill out an application online at hhpr.rescuegroups.org. Approved application required.",

It turns out it was Noel. She was covered in fleas, many sores over her body, skin and bones thin, and could barely hold herself up.\nShe now seems to be at her ideal weight. She does need some help every once in awhile being lifted around. So her new family/individual will need to assist her. A family with a single story home and easy access outside would be best for Noel because stairs are difficult for her to navigate. Noel will need someone who is looking for a super sweet, affectionate senior that loves long walks. She's so perfect girl, very low key and chill. Sweet Noel is patiently waiting for her new home. \n\nHer adoption fee is $100 which includes age-appropriate vaccines, microchip, and spay. \n\nTo adopt me, please fill out an adoption application on the Lucky 13 Rescue website www.lucky13rescue.org",

He was born January 3, 2018 along with his brother Bananas (also available for adoption). Both boys are extremely sweet and ready to find their furever families!\n\nIf you are interested in pursuing an adoption and you live in Texas , please complete the application (links provided below). The process includes a vet check, calling references and doing a home visit. \n\nhttp://www.texassleddogrescue.org/web_documents/tsdr_application.pdf\nor\nhttps://www.formstack.com/forms/?1632205-WX2Zb144ZP\n\nPlease note the following:\nWe rarely do out of state adoptions.  (Exceptions can be discussed but will be based on previous big dog experience and will require same adoption process.)\nChildren in the home or that visit often must be at least 6 years of age. (Exceptions can be discussed but will be based on previous big dog experience.)\nAdoption donation is due at the time of adoption.  Puppies under 1 year are $300. Dogs 1 year to 7 years are $200 and dogs over 7 years are $150.  As this is a donation, it will be non-returnable if dog is returned to rescue.\nDogs are not placed on a \"first come, first serve\" basis but rather the best home for the dog. \nAll dogs placed by TSDR will be:\nspayed/neutered\nvaccinated for distemper/parvo, rabies, and bordetella\nheartworm tested and treated if needed\nmicrochipped\nother vetting as deemed needed\nNew owners will receive copies of all available vet information and must agree to keep them current on all of the above.",

He does not like sudden movements and needs to work on building trust. He knows how to play fetch and is a good boy who drops the ball on cue. He seems to really enjoy playing! He was able to sniff a dog through the kennel with no reaction but hasn\u2019t had a full meet and greet with another dog yet. Yoki seems really confused and doesn\u2019t know what is expected from him. He would do much better in a home environment. \n\nAGE\n2 years\n\nHOUSE-TRAINED\nUnknown\n\nGOOD IN A HOME WITH\nUnknown\n\nInterested in Yoki? Contact the shelter above.",

She's not been around really young children while at the shelter nor has she been cat tested. \n\nShe is currently in Fort Worth, TX but will making the trek to Olympia, WA scheduled to arrive on Saturday Jan 23rd IF she is pre-adopted meaning you need to get your app in, approved and pay the adoption fee to secure her.

Drake was found as a stray with another dog and has been friendly with other dogs that he has met.   We have not been able to cat test him yet. \n\nHe is medium energy and would love to go on daily walks or play fetch.\n\nWe saved this poor guy with just hours until euthanasia!

He was born January 3, 2018 along with his brother Foster (also available for adoption). Both boys are extremely sweet and ready to find their furever families!\n\nIf you are interested in pursuing an adoption and you live in Texas , please complete the application (links provided below). The process includes a vet check, calling references and doing a home visit. \n\nhttp://www.texassleddogrescue.org/web_documents/tsdr_application.pdf\nor\nhttps://www.formstack.com/forms/?1632205-WX2Zb144ZP\n\nPlease note the following:\nWe rarely do out of state adoptions.  (Exceptions can be discussed but will be based on previous big dog experience and will require same adoption process.)\nChildren in the home or that visit often must be at least 6 years of age. (Exceptions can be discussed but will be based on previous big dog experience.)\nAdoption donation is due at the time of adoption.  Puppies under 1 year are $300. Dogs 1 year to 7 years are $200 and dogs over 7 years are $150.  As this is a donation, it will be non-returnable if dog is returned to rescue.\nDogs are not placed on a \"first come, first serve\" basis but rather the best home for the dog. \nAll dogs placed by TSDR will be:\nspayed/neutered\nvaccinated for distemper/parvo, rabies, and bordetella\nheartworm tested and treated if needed\nmicrochipped\nother vetting as deemed needed\nNew owners will receive copies of all available vet information and must agree to keep them current on all of the above.",

Great with other dogs, and is crate trained. He is still working on perfecting house training. Doesn\u2019t have many accidents. He\u2019ll readily go outside to go potty, he loves it outside. He loves chew toys and likes to follow his foster everywhere but loves to sleep on your lap. He will need a fenced yard. He likes kids but would do best in a home with older kids  (teens). He does like to sneak out open doors just to go outside for fun so would need to be watched when people are coming and going out exterior doors. \n\nAdoption fees is $200 for dogs over 8 months. If you think you would be interested, please complete our no obligation application and we can start the process at www.middletennesseetreasures.com.\n\nOur dogs and cats are kept in foster homes with volunteers who share their homes with these animals until the right adoptive home is found. These foster homes evaluate for temperament and also work on basic training with the dogs. Our dogs and cats have been seen by a vet, brought up to date on vaccinations, micro-chipped, heartworm tested, cleared of parasites and spayed or neutered if 6 months or older. \n\nThe first step in adopting from Middle Tennessee Treasures is to complete an adoption application.(http://www.middletennesseetreasures.com/adoption/) Vet references are usually called first. When we contact your vet we ask about current and past pets (both dogs and cats). We ask if all animals are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations, seen on a yearly basis and whether dogs are on heartworm preventative. Personal references are called and finally a home visit is set up. The purpose of the home visit to meet you, your family, and any pets you may have. It also allows us to see what kind of dog or cat would be the best fit for your home. \n\nThis screening process helps to ensure that each rescued dog is placed in a loving, safe, and permanent home. We do not place our dogs on a first come, first serve basis, but according to the needs of the dog and family.",

My name is Molley, and good golly am I going to make a great companion for the patient family that gives me a chance to thrive! I previously lived in a small cage being bred for my puppies, so I am just starting to learn about the big, wide world around me and need humans who will give me time to settle in and feel safe. I do great with other dogs and think it would be a big bonus to have a doggie friend in my forever family; I have learned that playing outside in the snow with my canine foster brothers is a lot of fun! It would be nice to have a securely fenced yard to enjoy at my forever home, too. I am crate trained (and consider it a safe space to lounge while I adapt into my new home), but my potty training is a work in progress and I need some patience while I learn this important skill. Speaking of learning, I need a family who will be committed to signing me up for training classes; I think training will help with my confidence and I am eager to learn how to dog. Could you be the person to make my dreams of a loving home and family come true? Then fill out an adoption application soon, please!\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS, NO EXCEPTIONS:\n*ADOPTION FEE: $300\n*Be at least 21 years of age\n*Live in a 50-mile radius of Itasca, within the Illinois border\n*Have the knowledge and agreement of all adults living in the household\n*Have approval from owner of residence (written in lease)\n*Have a valid ID with current address (please provide proof of address if ID address is not up-to-date)\n*Be approved as a suitable adoptive home by Fetching Tails Foundation\n*Be prepared to make a lifetime commitment\n\nIf interested please fill out an application on our website at www.fetchingtailsfoundation.org; please make sure you fill in every required field/question or your submission will not go through. Please note that we take time to learn as much as we can about each dog in our care and our bios are our current observations; we are unable to make any guarantees on the future health or temperament of your adopted dog. Most dogs in our care come with unknown pre-rescue history and as such breed and age estimates are an educated guess.",

That is husky speak for \u201cHello, can you give me a loving home?\u201d My name is Mica, and I am a soulful lady who is looking for a patient family that will give me time to settle in and feel safe. In my pre-rescue life, I was kept in a small cage and bred for my puppies so I am only now learning what it is like to feel comfy and loved. I prefer to lounge in a safe spot and observe, but am starting to enjoy walks and soft pets from my foster family. I get along with other dogs, and am kid-friendly, too: I currently live with children who are 5 and 7 and do well with them even when they are feeling silly and bouncing around. Children and adults just need to understand that I might be shy at first and want a little space while I adjust to my new surroundings. I am crate trained (and consider it a safe zone) but am still working on potty training. Speaking of training, I hope my forever family will commit to signing up for classes so I can continue to learn - I think training will help me blossom and come out of my shell. I know I am going to be a great companion, and I hope you give me a chance to shine!\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS, NO EXCEPTIONS:\n*ADOPTION FEE: $300\n*Be at least 21 years of age\n*Live in a 50-mile radius of Itasca, within the Illinois border\n*Have the knowledge and agreement of all adults living in the household\n*Have approval from owner of residence (written in lease)\n*Have a valid ID with current address (please provide proof of address if ID address is not up-to-date)\n*Be approved as a suitable adoptive home by Fetching Tails Foundation\n*Be prepared to make a lifetime commitment\n\nIf interested please fill out an application on our website at www.fetchingtailsfoundation.org; please make sure you fill in every required field/question or your submission will not go through. Please note that we take time to learn as much as we can about each dog in our care and our bios are our current observations; we are unable to make any guarantees on the future health or temperament of your adopted dog. Most dogs in our care come with unknown pre-rescue history and as such breed and age estimates are an educated guess.",

My name is Kirsten and I am a soulful, snuggly little lady who would love a calm home where I can finally feel safe. You see, I spent my pre-rescue life in a small cage being bred for my puppies, so I am finally learning what it feels like to be pampered and loved. My favorite activities so far include snuggling, receiving belly rubs, and napping in a cozy bed. I am very sweet, but I am not used to loud noises, fast movements or too much excitement, so I would do best in a quiet, adult-only home. I'm dog friendly and crate trained (I consider it my safe space), but I need help with potty training and hope for patience while I learn this life skill. I have spent my life dreaming of a better future, and if you think you could provide me with the love and attention I've longed for, please fill out an adoption application soon!\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS, NO EXCEPTIONS:\n*ADOPTION FEE: $300\n*Be at least 21 years of age\n*Live in a 50-mile radius of Itasca, within the Illinois border\n*Have the knowledge and agreement of all adults living in the household\n*Have approval from owner of residence (written in lease)\n*Have a valid ID with current address (please provide proof of address if ID address is not up-to-date)\n*Be approved as a suitable adoptive home by Fetching Tails Foundation\n*Be prepared to make a lifetime commitment\n\nIf interested please fill out an application on our website at www.fetchingtailsfoundation.org; please make sure you fill in every required field/question or your submission will not go through. Please note that we take time to learn as much as we can about each dog in our care and our bios are our current observations; we are unable to make any guarantees on the future health or temperament of your adopted dog. Most dogs in our care come with unknown pre-rescue history and as such breed and age estimates are an educated guess.",

My name is Brenda, and I am an itty-bitty princess who is looking for a nice lap to curl up in for lots of snuggles. I would love a quiet home to call my own - I would do best in a family with no young children because of my fragile little size and preference for a calm home. I get along with other dogs but prefer ones who have a laid-back attitude like me. I spent the earlier part of my life in a little cage being bred for my babies, and all I desire is a place where I will feel  pampered with someone who is home more often than not so I can catch up on all the attention and affection I previously missed out on; my favorite activities include being carried in your arms and cuddled. Now that I am coming out of my shell, I even do a happy dance on my hind legs to show my foster parents how appreciative I am! As you can imagine, I am not potty trained and need someone with patience who will understand that this might take me a while to learn. I am eager to please and have a lot of love to give the special person who finally helps me realize my dream of being a loved lap dog. If that could be you, please fill out an adoption application soon!\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS, NO EXCEPTIONS:\n*ADOPTION FEE: $300\n*Be at least 21 years of age\n*Live in a 50-mile radius of Itasca, within the Illinois border\n*Have the knowledge and agreement of all adults living in the household\n*Have approval from owner of residence (written in lease)\n*Have a valid ID with current address (please provide proof of address if ID address is not up-to-date)\n*Be approved as a suitable adoptive home by Fetching Tails Foundation\n*Be prepared to make a lifetime commitment\n\nIf interested please fill out an application on our website at www.fetchingtailsfoundation.org; please make sure you fill in every required field/question or your submission will not go through. Please note that we take time to learn as much as we can about each dog in our care and our bios are our current observations; we are unable to make any guarantees on the future health or temperament of your adopted dog. Most dogs in our care come with unknown pre-rescue history and as such breed and age estimates are an educated guess.",

My name is Doris, and I am a darling little lady who would love a home with patient people who will go slow with me to help me learn what being pampered and loved is like. I spent the earlier part of my life in a small cage being bred for my puppies, and am finally experiencing life in a cozy home for the first time. I love being near my people once I am comfortable and would appreciate a home where someone is home more often than not so we can spend our time together making each other happy. I'm dog and cat friendly, and would do fine in a home with children old enough to understand to go slow with me and be respectful. I am not a fan of a crate, but do fine in a larger playpen where I have room to move around if you need to leave the house for a while. I am also not potty trained and hope for patience and understanding that this might take me a while to learn. Do you think you could be the special person to help me blossom and provide me with all the love I've dreamed about?

I also like cuddles with my people, and think I would do fine in a home with children who are old enough to understand I might be shy at first. I am crate trained, but need help with potty training; I am working hard on this skill, but I need some patience while I continue to figure it out. I would love to learn more skills, as well, and would like a family that will commit to signing me up for training. I think training classes will also help with my socialization and confidence, so it could be the first of what I hope are many future adventures!

I still need to gain about 5-10 pounds\u2026but I don\u2019t think that should be that hard to do. \n\nI am full of love and have adapted to my foster home pretty quickly.  I have a furry foster sibling in my home right now and would be okay if my furrever home has a dog or I\u2019d be completely fine on my own. To be honest, I\u2019m more concerned with human attention that attention from other dogs. One thing I do need is a secure, fenced-in yard.  I am pretty sneaky, so we need to make sure I don\u2019t find any escape routes. When I first arrived at my foster home, I did not play with toys but I\u2019m slowly coming around to how much fun they are. \n\nI am already housebroken and potty-trained. I do not need to be crated as I am not a destructive guy and if I do get crated I spend the whole time plotting my escape.  I am ready to find my furrever home and since I\u2019m \u201cmove-in\u201d ready, I hope it will be a quick journey to find my new family.\n\nFor this to be a successful adoption, Captain MUST HAVE:\nNo invisible fence\n\nIf you are interested in meeting me, please contact LOLIN for a meet and greet.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please go to our website at www.lolin.org and click on Adoption Process along the left-hand side.  From there, you can submit an Adoption Application to be considered for this dog.  You MUST be an approved applicant to meet LOLIN dogs.  There is no central location or hours to meet dogs.",

His shorter legs suggest Corgi; and the shape of his head, spotted tongue, and happy disposition suggest Lab.\nBoston came to Colorado from Texas when the adult\u2019s son went to foster care and he and Peppe lost their primary caretaker. The household had many cats and it should make for an easy meet-and-greet if there is a cat in his new home.\nBoston is a happy dog and will be happiest when allowed to play in a fenced-in yard with Peppe and when taught basic commands. He loves exercising by roughhousing with Peppe outside, and both know to stop when you tell them enough. He appreciates ending his day by snuggling with his foster mom.\nBoston is a nice dog who kindly knows not to jump up on kids or adults. He takes to riding inside the back of a car naturally, and his appreciating your help lifting him up tells you he is trusting.\n\n\n$100 refundable after successful completion of approved obedience classes.",

            "description": "Pepe and Boston are a bonded pair. ***will not separate***\n\nPepe\nBonded Pair\nLabrador Retriever mix\nPepe is a Labrador Retriever mix with a shiny black-and-white coat and shiny personality. When playing outside, Peppe balances playing with his faithful dog pal Boston and with checking in on the human he is with.\nPeppe came to Colorado from Texas when the adult\u2019s son went to foster care and he and Boston lost their primary caretaker. The household had many cats and it should make for an easy meet-and-greet if there is a cat in his new home.\nPeppe is a happy dog and will be happiest when allowed to play in a tall fenced-in yard with Boston and when taught basic commands. He loves exercising by roughhousing with Boston outside, and both know to stop when you tell them enough. He appreciates ending his day by snuggling with his foster mom.\nPepe is a sweet dog who approaches kids and adults calmly and gently, with no jumping up. He takes to riding inside the back of a car naturally, and will let you lift him up and in, or will jump in on your command. Playful and intelligent, Peppe makes eye contact that politely lets you know he enjoys being with you.\n\n*** $100 refundable after successful completion of approved obedience classes ***",

Good news, he is also house broken and crate trained! \n\nMonty loves to play with other dogs like him. Play wrestling is his favorite, so a dog of his size; with a yard is ideal, but he is ok being an only dog too. \n\nMonty was loved his whole life, but his owner has hit hard times, and is no longer able to provide an suitable environment for a dog as big as Monty, so he has been in foster care ever since.",

            "description": "Cashew and her five sisters were surrendered to an overcrowded shelter in northern Louisiana. We believe they are golden retriever mixes. She\u2019s about 20 pounds currently and expected to be in the medium to large size range when full grown. Cashew is good with other dogs and kids (we\u2019re not sure about cats, but expect that she\u2019d do just fine). Cashew is microchipped and up to date on vaccines. She\u2019ll be spayed at 6 months old. She\u2019s doing great with house and kennel training!\n\nPlease note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppy\u2019s breed or size potential. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

            "description": "Meet Evander! Yes, as in Holyfield...\n\nEvander came to us from a local shelter where his owner surrendered him. He came in with the injury to his ear and this is the way he came to CARES when we pulled him from the shelter. Unfortunately too much time has passed to try to suture it. The vet advised us to simply leave it alone and it will heal. We told Evander this makes him extra special!\n\nEvander is a young male - about 1-2 years old. He is crate trained and has been good about outside potty. He came in a bit timid when being handled so we are still getting used to walking on a leash. Sporting a beautiful black coat with just a bit of white on his chest, Evander looks to be a beautiful Dachshund mix. This boy is full grown at only 11.5 pounds. \n\nEvander has been good with all the dogs here; however he would be best suited for a home with no cats. \n\nEvander has an appointment on Thursday for neuter surgery, chipping and to finish up his vaccines. We will also get a closer age estimate at that time. Evander will be ready for his new home this Friday! \n\nEvander is healthy, fully vetted and ready  to leave for his forever home soon so we are taking applications now! His wish list consists of an inside forever home with a big fenced yard for playtime, a home with lots of toys and another doggy friend for play time and pet parents who understand the time commitment that a new dog requires. Adopters who are retired or work-from-home parents are ideal as they have the time to spend with the pet. Adopters committed to doing a 6 week basic obedience class to ensure Evander's successful transition to his new home would also a plus (and to ensure the new puppy parent's education level). If you think you have the perfect home for Evander, contact us at info.caresga@gmail.com for an adoption application. We adopt up north and all over so please ask for details. $350 adoption fee and a vet reference is required to ensure a great home (this means you have had a pet so we can call to verify their level of care). Eligibility for adoption means your current or past pets are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccines and on monthly heartworm and flea prevention. Please be aware that we do not allow shock collars (ie underground fences) or \"pens\" as an alternative for a fenced yard.\n\nWe do our best to place our rescue pets in the very best homes. Please be aware that we have an application which also includes required vet records showing your existing pets are current on preventative medical care. Puppy adopters please take note that we generally try to place our puppies into homes where at least one parent is retired/stay at home/works from home to ensure the puppy gets enough attention and training (puppies cannot hold it all day in a crate) so please have a plan ready when contacting us. For safety reasons, we try not to place small dogs or puppies in families with children under 5 (there may be exceptions depending on situation).\n\nAdoption fees vary based on breed, size and age. Some pets, smaller dogs for example, may have a higher than normal adoption fee but we will alert you if there is a variance. Dogs rescued from China always have a higher adoption fee. Adoption fees help our group offset PART of the cost of rescuing, rehabilitating, and getting the pet healthy so they can go on to find a loving home with someone willing to give them a second chance at life. This amount includes each animal being current on age appropriate vaccinations including DHPPL, bordetella, influenza, rabies, and boosters when appropriate. De-wormed for any internal parasites (round worms, hook worms, tape worms and whipworms) with Drontal Plus, 4DX tested heart-worm negative (if positive, they are treated), tested negative for tick borne diseases, spayed/neutered, implanted with a micro-chip and have been examined by a veterinarian to certify that they are healthy. Any other known health issues are treated as well prior to adoption (examples: UTI, broken bones, contagious infections, dental cleanings, etc). All animals are also on a regime of flea and heartworm medication every month. Lifetime registration for the micro-chip is included in each adoption fee. In addition, each adopter will go home with a fitted collar, tags, a bag of dog food the pet has been on, copies of all vet history, and an adoption kit filled with valuable information and coupons as well as other various treats or toys as promotions become available. All puppy adoptions include two puppy training books, the Puppy Primer & Way To Go by Patricia McConnell, and all adult adoptions go home with Love Has No Age Limit by Patricia McConnell to help ensure a smooth transition for your new family member.\n\nWe ask that you consider an additional donation on top of this pet's adoption fee. This money will go directly into our Adoption Fund to be used exclusively for rescuing and caring for other pets in need. Many pets we take in have very high vet bills to get them healthy and adoptable for the public - much higher than their adoption fees. We receive no government funding and rely solely on donations from our community and caring adopters to continue our rescue efforts!",

            "description": "Mr. Jack is a 9 year old Jack Russell Terrier mix.  Jack came to the rescue after his owner passed away.  We know a little about Jack's past but not much.  He was originally found as a stray when he was believed to be a year old.  He did well in the home with the woman but was protective of her from the man.  Due to this, Jack is requiring a home with a single owner, preferably, his own lady friend!\n\nJack has proven to be very sweet with the volunteers but has been known to be bossy when he doesn't get his way.  Jack is extremely intelligent and knows how to push the boundaries.  He is very food motivated so we think this boy could learn some new tricks!   He will require some structure, patience and lots of activity!  Don't let Jack's age fool ya!  He is still a very lively fella.  Jack would not do well in a home with other dogs, small critters, or children.  \n\nJack is healthy but does have a slight heart murmur.  We don't believe this to negatively affect his life.  If you are local to the area, a single lady, active, and live in a quite home, Jack could be your new companion!  Please visit our website, www.crcpa.org, to learn more about or adoption process and complete an application.",

Zoey is house trained, leash trained, has no food aggression with people. She does not like to share food with other dogs so she'll need to be feed separately with no food left out. Zoey does good in a crate, with other dogs of like size, and mature kids. No cats. Zoey loves to cuddle and be petted, and will show you love. She's not very vocal, but will alert you if someone is outside the home. Zoey will require a privacy fence. She's laid back and when not loving on you she'll be laying around. Zoey is currently on a diet, she needs to loose a few pounds. She is spayed, microchipped, and up to date on all shots, worming, and flea treatments. She did test positive for Lyme's disease and is taking meds for it.

Jiminy is an adorable 1 year old Basenji/Cattledog mix with the most audacious personality! He absolutely loves his toys, especially soft squeaky toys, and will toss them around and pounce on them all day long. Jiminy loves to run zoomies in the yard and would do best being supervised while he's outside so he's being as safe as possible. He's got some real fast speed and doesn't have any brakes which makes him the perfect running or hiking buddy. Even though he's young, Jiminy already knows 'sit' and could use a patient owner to teach him everything he'll need to know in order to be the best dog he can be. He would love to explore his surroundings and keeps his nose to the ground when he's out and about. Jiminy needs a home with a fully fenced in yard because adventuring without a buddy can be dangerous and he might not want to wait for his family to come with him. He also needs a home with no children under the age of 16 because his energy could be a little too much for young kiddos. If you're looking for an energetic, fox-eared companion to spend your days with, adopt Jiminy today!\n\nIf you're interested in adopting Jiminy, please email a completed adoption application to adoptions@kitsap-humane.org. Adoption applications and more information about our adoption process can be found on our website here: https://www.kitsap-humane.org/adopt/how-to-adopt/. Once your application has been received, you will be placed in line to have your application reviewed. All applicants are pre-screened over the phone, and then are scheduled for a time to come in and meet the dog at the shelter.

We want to make sure he\u2019s had 2 shots before adoption. He will have shots according to age, be neutered, microchipped, and on preventions. We are working on potty training he\u2019s on schedule for his age. Franklin will be a very large boy once grown. We want him to have the very best home. We will require vet references and a fenced yard. We also suggest obedience classes with all our adoptions. Socialization  and a schedule are key to a happy healthy pet. We will start looking at applications soon so we can have his family lined up soon as he\u2019s ready to go.

You may be required to travel if approved for adoption.\n\nThis is Liam, a very handsome white Shepard mix who's foster mom says he's such a goof ball! Playful and fun, he loves toys of all kinds, loves to run and play with the other dogs, loves a good game of fetch, and even at a year and a half, is still very much a puppy at heart. When he finally sits still, he loves a good belly rub or butt scratch, and he's quite the cuddler! Liam is unfortunately not a fan of cats and should not be in a home with them. Liam will be arriving from Texas soon and is looking for a forever home and an active family to call his own - might that be you?\n\nApplications can be submitted through\n\nhttps://lgarinc.org/adoption-application/.

            "description": "Cooper (aka Coop) is a sweet & friendly Beagle/Terrier mix who is 8 years old and weighs 55 lbs.  His current family needs to re-home him, so please read his bio below and contact his dad Daniel directly at hunter8285@gmail.com or 850-217-7299 if you'd like to get more information about Coop and possibly adopt this sweet boy! \n\nCooper is a relatively laid-back dog. He needs a home where he is given daily walks and/or a fenced in yard to roam around. He walks relatively well on a leash. He isn't needy in the sense that he doesn't need a lot of physical touch.  Our smaller dog does, but Coop is happy to just be in the same room with you. He is content with laying at your feet. He is loyal, food driven, and a great protector. His nickname is Agent Dale Cooper because he likes to police things. If you get up fast or react quickly he will jump to his feet and start barking. He knows basic commands like sit, stay, down, release, and heel (sometimes). He is kennel trained and house broken. Our dogs have been taught to go to their kennels to be fed and they also know what you mean when you say it is time to go to bed. Cooper doesn't have any history of chewing up things that don't belong to him, at least with us. We were told he would get into trash cans but we simply bought trash cans with lids. \n\nWe have owned him for almost 4 years. We took him from a family who no longer wanted him. At that time, he lived with an older dog and there were some serious food aggression issues. We had to work with him a good bit to break him of the food aggression. He's been quite receptive to that and it's evident that we have built rapport with him. We keep the kitchen area blocked off so he cannot grab stuff off of the counter. Cooper was often tethered to a couch or chair in his previous home, which has caused some trauma for him to work through. To add to it all, about 2 years ago he was attacked by a pitbull. Our smaller dog was present and was subsequently chased by another dog present during the attack. Neither of our dogs have quite bounced back personality wise from that trauma. The trauma presents itself within Cooper when he sees a dog that resembles a pitbull. He becomes vocal and can be difficult to manage on a leash. Easiest is to redirect him and take him a different direction. It can be interesting because other times he is non-reactive to other dogs barking or in backyards while we are walking. It does feel unfair for Coop to stay with us because our smaller dog requires so much attention, we have a 20 month old son, and we are expecting another child in April. Cooper is older and needs a quieter and less chaotic place to stay. \n\nCoop enjoys going for walks either on the road or on a trail. If he could be an only dog that would be preferred. He does deal with some anxiety that flares up in the form of obsessively licking his paws. I think some of this is nervous energy with how busy and chaotic things can get around our house. He has truly been a wonderful dog for us but we also know that he deserves to have more attention than what he currently gets in our home.\n\nCoop is neutered and current on vaccines & preventatives as of 10/2020. He is a very good boy!",

Dad: Hound x Bull Mastiff \nAdoption fee: $160\nAge/DOB: Oct. 29, 2019\nUp-to-date on all vaccinations for their age\nAPPLY AT FODRescue.org.\n\nThis litter of 4 girls and 2 boys came into the rescue on a frozen day in January. They were just 12 weeks at intake - a perfect age to begin training. You should expect them to be around 60 pounds. Sherman is one of the larger puppies.\nIf he is not yet spayed when adopted, we will refund $25 with proof of surgery within 6 months.\n\n\nAll of our rescues are in a foster home where they receive one on one care, attention, and training. \n\nWe welcome out of state adopters but there is an additional fee of $20 for a veterinary health certificate. We do not ship our animals- they all need to be picked up in northeast Missouri.\n\nPlease fill out an adoption application at our website: FODRescue.org, or call (660) 342-6023 and leave a message. Thank you!!\n\n",

Once he tires himself out from playing or chewing, loves nothing more than to snuggle up next to (or on) you and sleep.  He is crate and potty trained as long as he goes out frequently.  He is also a \"velcro dog\" and will follow you wherever you go.  He hardly ever barks, and only while playing.  He has no medical needs and would make a great BFF!",

Sadly, Missie and Tara are needing a new home\u2026\nGood with children\nGood with other dogs\nHouse trained\nAt no fault of their own, these poor girls are again looking for their new forever family or foster family as we do NOT want these senior girls to have to go back to a kennel\u2026 It was found out in their newly adopted home, that they have no tolerance for cats at all! They were previously turned into GRRAND as their owner passed and their family members could not keep them. They are a bonded senior pair needing to stay together. We know that they are super sweet and well behaved, just a little confused at this time.\nHere is a little from the previous owners family\u2026\n\u2018They both love people & become extremely excited with visitors. For now they\u2019re a little confused. I do not want them caged if at all possible as they do not need to be. They are house-trained, well behaved and so sweet. Missie will stay at your side forever except when excited and wants to play. Tara is sweet and easy going. They both prefer to snuggle when resting\u2019.\nWe are learning all about Missie and Tara now. They seem to get along fine with children and with the other dog currently in the home. If you are interested in meeting these two, please complete an adoption application\n\nAt this time, we are unable to process any applications that are outside of the geographic areas listed below:\nGreater Louisville, KY (including adjacent southern Indiana)\nGreater Lexington, KY\nSouthern Indiana Counties: Clark and Floyd\nOhio Counties: Hamilton, Butler, Warren, some areas within Clermont county, Montgomery and Green\nNorthern KY Counties: Boone, Kenton and Campbell\n\nTo inquire about a specific dog, we require that you first submit an adoption application. Visit http://grrand.org/online-adoption-application/ to access our online application. You do not need to fill out an application for each dog you are interested in learning more about. Once your application is reviewed a GRRAND volunteer will contact you to begin the process. Our Adoption Placement Coordinator will work with you to find a dog with the characteristics to best fit your family.",

We can see why.  His skin is inflamed, and his ear canals are swollen shut due to infections.  He currently weighs 65 lbs. but is very thin.  He will most likely weigh over 70 lbs when he's filled out.  \n\nHe howls and cries when left alone, so he would not make a good apartment or townhouse dog.\n\nOn the positive side, Frollo is a very kind soul who going o make the right person a great friend.  He's also going to be a real looker.  Very handsome.\n\nApplications are to be emailed to CDHAdogs@gmail.com.\n\nFor more information please call Jennifer: 664-3450 or email Nancy: CDHAdogs@gmail.com.",

They were just 12 weeks at intake - a perfect age to begin training. You should expect them to be around 60 pounds. Didi is one of the larger puppies.\nIf he is not yet neutered when adopted, we will refund $25 with proof of surgery within 6 months.\n\n\nAll of our rescues are in a foster home where they receive one on one care, attention, and training. \n\nWe welcome out of state adopters but there is an additional fee of $20 for a veterinary health certificate. We do not ship our animals- they all need to be picked up in northeast Missouri.\n\nPlease fill out an adoption application at our website: FODRescue.org, or call (660) 342-6023 and leave a message.

            "description": "Brisco is everyone's idea of the perfect little Shih-Tzu, but he has some healing to do. He would do best with a retired female, as that is what he is used to. He is very attached to his foster mom, and he will be a loyal companion. He will need a gentle patient person to work with him. He needs a quiet home. He is very shy. He is insecure, he is still mourning for the loss of his first home. \nBrisco needs work on his potty training. This dog has not been abused in any way, he has been loved. He's just extremely sensitive and fearfuI of new environments. \nI am inclined to say that if you have not worked as a foster for a dog rescue, or have other extensive dog experience, you may not be the person for this dog. We are being very careful, as we do not want Brisco to be any more traumatized than he already is. His next home has got to be his forever home. \nBrisco is 5 years old. He will need professional grooming about every six weeks. He weighs (guessing) about 15 pounds. You must have a nice secured fenced yard. \nPlease fill out an application first if you are interested.\nThis dog will only be adopted in Tucson, so we can monitor his progress more easily.\n\nFilling out an application is the first step in the adoption process. If you have questions, the best way to contact us is to email azdesertrottis@aol.com.\n\nWe don't always bring all animals to our adoption events so check ahead of time to make sure the animal you are interested in is still available. Some animals listed may already be promised.\n\nArizona Desert Rotti & Pals Rescue is a NO KILL rescue serving Tucson and the surrounding area. \n\nA home visit is usually required for the safety of our animals. We check the yard to make sure this little pup cannot escape, no predator can get in, and also look for hazardous plants. \n\nWe do not adopt our dogs out unless you have a secured, fenced yard, it\u2019s a requirement for the safety of the dog. At the end of the application, please include the type of fencing and the height of the fence you have around your yard. \n\nIf you're interested in Brisco or any of our dogs, please fill out a pre application at: http://www.azdesertrotti.com/html/to_adopt.htm\nOnce you have filled out the pre-adoption application, someone will contact you about the dog to answer your questions and tell you where our Sunday adoption event is held.\n\nOur dogs are bathed, dewormed, vet checked, given their required shots, spayed or neutered, and microchipped. \n\nOur rescues are homed with foster parents. They are fostered in homes so that we can tell you a little bit about their personalities, feeding schedule, habits, behavior, whether they get along with other dogs. We can tell you if they are crate trained, if they are leash trained and house trained. Most dogs need a refresher course on potty training when they go to a new home. They need to learn your routine, and it will be up to you to teach them. \n\nEven the most abused animals can be wonderful pets. It takes patience, love and good food, along with fun and commitment to the animal. Fosters work with these animals. They are a part of our families, while we are lucky enough to have them.",

When his owner went away, Mason was unleashed and left to wander amongst the neighbors who fed him and watched over him. Sometimes, this would be for weeks.  Mason is so people friendly and he is also aware of being nice to other dogs as his habit of wandering the neighborhoods made him be.  He is what we believe, after looking him over, and with his size of approximately 40lbs, to be a cattle dog mix. He is approx. 4 years old.  He really needs a home of his own where he is a part of a family and lives inside, instead of outside. He hates being confined in our kennels and balks when having to come back inside after a nice long walk.  Please consider this boy to add to your family.",

We are told she is housebroken, crate trained, knows a few commands, and has lived with cats. Scarlett is ready to find her own fur-ever home!\n\nAdoption fee for Dogs is $100, which includes microchip. All of our dogs and puppies have been examined by a veterinarian, de-wormed,  vaccinated, treated for fleas and ticks, spayed or neutered and  tested for heartworms (If 6 months of age and over) and are on monthly heartworm preventative.  Puppies too young to be spayed/neutered require a refundable $50 deposit which will be returned upon proof of spay/neuter. If this is done at our vet (Allen's in Parsons), there is no charge for the spay/neuter. Give us a call at 620-421-0445 or e-mail us at pals@wavewls.com today to find out more about this pet.",

He is overweight ( has lost 4 pounds already) and has diabetes ( requires 2 shots a day).

Dad: Hound x Bull Mastiff \nAdoption fee: $160\nAge/DOB: Oct. 29, 2019\nUp-to-date on all vaccinations for their age\nAPPLY AT FODRescue.org.\n\nThis litter of 4 girls and 2 boys came into the rescue on a frozen day in January. They were just 12 weeks at intake - a perfect age to begin training. You should expect them to be around 60 pounds. Jeter is one of the smaller puppies.\nIf he is not yet neutered when adopted, we will refund $25 with proof of surgery within 6 months.\n\n\nAll of our rescues are in a foster home where they receive one on one care, attention, and training. \n\nWe welcome out of state adopters but there is an additional fee of $20 for a veterinary health certificate. We do not ship our animals- they all need to be picked up in northeast Missouri.\n\nPlease fill out an adoption application at our website: FODRescue.org, or call (660) 342-6023 and leave a message. Thank you!!\n\n",

He came into rescue from the shelter because he had an injury to his left rear leg. The shelter vet thought he had a broken bone. Turns out his hip was dislocated. The best solution for Jonah was an FHO surgery. This removes the head of the femur bone so he doesn't have bone rubbing and allows him to gain use of his leg again. Jonah had his surgery before Christmas. Rested and recovered and is now enjoying special time at his water rehab. Jonah is getting his spunk back is improving daily in how much he uses his leg. He even tries a bit of running and jumping. Jonah does best with female dogs and dogs that are smaller than him. He's a pretty easy going guy who would love a family of his own to enjoy.",

            "description": "Buster is new to GRRAND and is doing well in his foster home\u2026We were contacted by a volunteer about this sweet 11 year old boy being turned into a shelter with a couple other dogs\u2026 GRRAND took in Buster and he was so lucky to go straight to a foster home! Buster is currently living with 3 other dogs and is having no issues with any of them. Here are a few things his foster dad says about him\u2026\n\u2018Meet Buster. Buster is a very sweet, older guy, I am fostering for GRRAND. Buster is very laid back and very sweet. He\u2019s settling in well with the other 3 dogs but Buster has very clearly communicated his lack of interest in playing right now.\nI know very little about Buster but I have learned this evening Buster likes long walks in the rain!\nBuster was owner-surrendered to a shelter where he struggled for several weeks. He has been through a lot in the past couple of months and I\u2019m sure with some love, attention, and time his personality will come out. He is headed to the vet for a good check up and he is a little husky so his diet is being adjusted accordingly. He has some joint issues that we will also have looked at, and after a little more time, and we learn more about him, we will update\u2019.\n\nAt this time, we are unable to process any applications that are outside of the geographic areas listed below:\nGreater Louisville, KY (including adjacent southern Indiana)\nGreater Lexington, KY\nSouthern Indiana Counties: Clark and Floyd\nOhio Counties: Hamilton, Butler, Warren, some areas within Clermont county, Montgomery and Green\nNorthern KY Counties: Boone, Kenton and Campbell\n\nTo inquire about a specific dog, we require that you first submit an adoption application. Visit http://grrand.org/online-adoption-application/ to access our online application. You do not need to fill out an application for each dog you are interested in learning more about. Once your application is reviewed a GRRAND volunteer will contact you to begin the process. Our Adoption Placement Coordinator will work with you to find a dog with the characteristics to best fit your family.\nPlease visit our website at www.grrand.org for information about our adoption procedures and the areas we service.<br><br>",

            "description": "What can we say? Miki is a chihuahua and comes with a chihuahua attitude.\n\nShe's 4 years old and 4.5 pounds.  So she deserves to have all the attitude in the world she wants to have.\n\nBecause of her teeny tiny size, we will not place her in a home with another dog over 5 pounds and no children under 13 years old.\n\nMiki is a gal that knows what she wants and when she wants it.  Everything in life has to be on her terms because she will try to bite you if she feels she's not in charge of the situation.\n\nShe shifts loyalties very easily, and will be a velcro dog to whoever she feels is her person at the time.\n\nThat said, she doesn't have any separation anxiety, though that could change from household to household and can be independent if she needs to be.\n\nShe hates cats (more scared than anything) is not great with dogs (again, probably more scared as every dog is bigger than her) and has a 3 time bite history with humans.\n\nBUT, this dog is also incredibly sweet and kind and cuddly and loving and if you understand chihuahua's you'll love Miki for who she is as a dog.  \n\nShe is still working on housetraining, be it pee pads or going outside, so patience in this area will be important.\n\nWe are looking for a quiet home for Miki. Someone that is home more often than not or can take their pet to work.  Someone that is patient and kind.  Someone that understands chihuahua's and all the oddness that is this amazing breed.\n\nFROM HER FOSTER MOM:\n\nMickey is a tiny cuddler, who likes to be carried around or on your lap. \n\nShe is playful in the afternoons, where she will chase her tail, climb & paw at you, and use her teeth, but very gently. \n\nShe may copy your yoga poses, and I think she thinks yoga is me trying to play with her, so she'll climb you and get right up in your space if you practice yoga/home exercises. \n\nShe really likes her walks and will allow you to bundle her up in a sweater & jacket and get her harness on without much struggle. \n\nShe doesn't bark to go out or give you notice that she needs to go out, so I find routine walks work well for her, especially before bed and first thing in the morning. She has asked to out in the middle of the night several times, only to not go potty, just to enjoy the smells and explore so I'm working on curbing that.\n\nShe has a very low appetite, but hopefully you can find the right food for her to eat more enthusiastically as it's still a work in progress. \n\nShe does bark at little noises & shadows inside, and people & dogs on walks, but she is already showing improvement so if you can keep up the positive reinforcement I'm sure it will continue to improve. \n\nShe likes to sleep on the bed, over the covers, curled up in the knook between or behind your legs (depending on how you sleep). \n\nShe's had some accidents inside despite the regular walks and pee pads spread throughout the place, but knows she shouldn't be, and will give you giant puppy dog eyes and maybe even hide in her crate so I'm only rewarding walks where she goes potty now, and trying to encourage regular spots for it. \n\nShe is a pretty typical chihuahua velcro dog, sticks right by your side and is always checking to make sure you're right there, but doesn't seem to experience any separation anxiety when I leave. \n\nGreat little companion who loves to be petted all the time, and is not shy to ask for belly rubs; you can carry her in one arm easily, and find her hiding under a pile of blankets and pillows or up high in a basket when you get home.\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\nAs of today, though our protocols could change tomorrow, we are still moving forward with adoptions. Our process has changed from some of the previous elements: We are a registered animal welfare organization, so we are deemed an essential service.\n\nAll paperwork completed online, video home visits, meet and greets outside respecting social distancing, leashes/collars/supplies wiped down and disinfected (GermiCide 3 wipes), disinfectant on the dog prior to handoff (Aqueos wipes for dogs)\n\n-----------------------\n\nTo note: the above description is relevant to this dog in his current setting. Home changes & adopter personalities can bring out different behaviours not previously seen.\n\nWe do not specifically kid/cat test our dogs when they arrive at Mattie's Place. That just wouldn't be fair to the dog or child/cat.\n\nWe also do not claim, endorse, suggest or hint at, that any of our dogs are hypoallergenic, low shed or no-shed.\n\nAdoption fee includes: spay/neuter, deworming, defleaing, vaccinations, nose to tail health exam, leash|collar, 6 months of preventative based on season/need, DNA test for entertainment purposes, dishes, poop bags, food and any extras she has accumulated in foster care.\n\n",

            "description": "Teddy is a handsome, senior Belgian Malinois, roughly 8 years old, and 55 lbs. He is UTD on his vaccinations, heartworm negative, and is neutered. Being the older gentleman that he is, he does experience some sore hips so he needs some TLC with supplements and understanding. Teddy LOVES playing ball. He wil chase it for hours (see previous sentence). He forgets that he's not a pup anymore! He likes to play with other dogs, but is not a fan of small dogs, cats, or squirrels. In his mind, those little critters are for chasing! We are currently unsure on how he is with kids, but we'll update as we know more about him. He only just arrived at his foster home, so we look forward to seeing him settle. \n\nTeddy loves to snuggle and be with his people. We are not sure how much experience he has with living in a house as he tries to mark indoors. His foster is working with him to correct it, so we can soon say he'll be fully \"housebroken\". He just needs to learn the house rules. Teddy has had some formal training in his time. He knows all of his basic commands. He is also very food motivated, so this can serve as a great motivator and training tool for him. He stole his transporter's Egg McMuffin on the ride to his foster home!!! What a goof! Teddy does well in the car and enjoys coming along. \n\nWhen Teddy came to MAD Rescue, he was a bit underweight, so he will need to put a few pounds on to reach his optimal, healthy weight. If you are looking for a sweet, senior Mal, this is your guy!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet please complete an application at this link https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/24689/generic . \n\nWe are an official 501C3 organziation that does not have a physical location.

            "description": "KANE BROWN is a unique mix of a blue Doberman Pincher, Cane Corso and American Staffordshire Bull Terrier. He is a BIG puppy at just 18 months old, currently 75 lbs and very tall. He loves people and does the 'doberman lean' on his foster Grandpa during play breaks. Kane has a thick beautiful short haired coat requiring no special grooming. Kane loves kids, he knows to sit and give his paw (\"high five\") when he meets new people but also tries to give hugs. \n\n \n\n \n\nHe has been observed to be good with dogs of all sizes - he plays nicely when running with little puppies and other large breed dogs. Due to his age and size, he needs regular exercise and continued leash training. He gets anxious on car rides, he whines and tries to sit with his humans in the front seat. Kane is a social boy who needs to be part of a family and given a 'job' besides being a constant shadow. \n\n \n\nKane will be a great addition to any home, he is affectionate and concerned about all those around him. He would be just as happy in the city or country, as long as people are close by. This handsome boy deserves a forever home to match his loyalty and BIG HEART.\n\n \n\n \n\nThe adoption fee is $600.00 He is up to date on vaccines according to age, has received proper deworming, and comes with additional dewormer if needed. This pet is microchipped, neutered, comes with 6 months of Heartworm preventative via ProHeart 6 Injection, and one month free trial of pet insurance if registered by adopter with insurance company. All animals receive a health certificate (stating that a licensed veterinarian saw the pet and deemed it healthy for travel, but is not a promise of perfect health.) Our transports are USDA certified and the cost of transport is included in adoption fee!\n\n \n\nHe is currently fostered in Houston, Tx but will be traveling to the PNW on 02/06/2021.\n\n \n\nDue to the Covid-19 crisis we are experiencing a dramatic influx in inquiries and adoption applications. If you have questions regarding a pup you are interested in please fill out an adoption application. Once received it can take up to a week to complete our review. Be assured we have received your received your application! If you need more information regarding a pup you are interested in, the process of filling out an adoption application is still required prior to answering detailed questions. We value our potential adopters time and appreciate your patience as our staff navigate through the blessing of an overwhelming response for adoptions.\n\n \n\nPlease inquire by submitting an application:\n\n https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/30255/generic\n\n \n\nThank you for your interest in adopting a rescue! \n\nKane's Adoption Coordinator - Leah@threelittlepittiesrescue.org\n\n \n\nPlease go to our website to see more about our rescue and what we do! We are very proud of our hard work in saving as many animals as we can, giving them what they need, and matching them with the right families.",

            "description": "Koda had been bounced around a bit in his short life. Relinquished at 7 months, adopted, and passed on through Nextdoor; he had been in 4 homes by the time he was 10 months. The inconsistencies in his life had led him to make independent decisions as smart shepherds are prone to do. He ended up with a fantastic advocate he met through his doggie daycare, who acted as a matchmaker between his last family and us. \n\nKoda's been getting love, consistent structure, and guidance in his shepherd experienced foster home. He'd been looking for direction on how to be his best self; his foster family has set him in the right path. Although Koda had lived with kids and loved them in his last home, we prefer to place him into a home without young kids. He had developed protective instincts around his favorite folks without appropriate re-direction before coming to us. \n\nDog friendly, Koda had regularly attended doggie daycare and is living with dogs in his foster home. He plays happily with friendly dogs outside of his foster home, slightly intimidated by pushy dogs. Koda is super sweet, smart, happy to meet new people. He's been out and about with his people enjoying life thoroughly. \n\nKoda attaches to his person readily, wanting to please and generous with his cuddles and kisses. Integrated into his foster household, Koda has learned to rely on more than one person for direction and love. He loves toys, bully sticks, and treats. \n\nCar rides are fun adventures for him, settling in the back seat with his head on the middle console. Weighing in around 55 lbs, he's got a little of another breed to add to his handsome look, maybe a heeler. We love the white tip at the end of his tail. \n\nSince he's way too interested in chickens and rabbits, we'd say no small critters in Koda's furever home also. \n\nGiven his prior history, we will require adopters interested in Koda to have experience raising adolescent shepherds and a firm commitment to on-going training to work this boy's mind and continue moving forward as a delightful adult.",

            "description": "*Due to concerns surrounding COVID-19, we have reformatted the way that we do adoptions in order to follow social distancing protocols. We are thrilled that so many people want to adopt right now, but we are not equipped to handle the large number of calls, applications, and email inquiries we are receiving. We are no longer answering phone calls and are doing all communications with adopters via email. If you have a dog you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application before sending us emails. When your application has been processed, you will receive an email from us with further instructions on how to adopt. You do not need a new application for every dog that you are interested in adopting. \n\nAt MAMCO we understand that in order to continue rescuing moms and babies, we must stretch our finances as far as we are able. For this reason we use variable adoption pricing. By assigning higher adoption fees to high demand moms and puppies, we are able to rescue more families in need.The money raised through these adoptions acts as a benefactor to moms and puppies in our care who require expensive veterinary treatments, have behavioral issues, or need more time to find a home. We often reduce the adoption fees on these harder-to-place moms and puppies to help them find forever families. Adoption fees vary, but all include spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccinations and deworming, rabies vaccine at the time of spay or neuter, and 30 days of pet insurance. We also cover hernia repair and cherry eye repair at the time of spay or neuter. Applications can be filled out at mamcorescue.org.",

            "description": "Kando is a really sweet dog. He does fine with dogs his size, but bigger dogs seem to scare him a little bit. His appetite hasn't been like other dogs and he won't eat the dog food I offered him. The only thing he has been eating is mostly bacon treats and pepperoni treat sticks, he seems to favor wet food. He loves all humans big and small, and trusts them.\n\nHW+ simply means the dog has tested positive for heart worms in our screening process. We utilize what is called the fast-kill method which means we place the dog on antibiotics for 30 days and then administer 3 injections in increments afterward. The cost to treat heart worms is rather steep. However, thanks to our generous donors, we are able to cover that cost for our adopters so long as they go to our veterinarian, Red Rocks Animal Center in Lakewood.\n\n\n\tApproved Applicants may make the adoption fee payment by clicking donate above. Partial adoption fees will not hold a dog.\n\tDogs adopted with our rescue come with FREE training from #GoodPup to help you build strong bonds from the start!\n\tIf upon meeting the dog of your choosing at an adoption event you find that you aren't a good match, your deposit will be refunded minus a 10% administration fee.\n\tAdoption fees include vaccines up until time of adoption, microchip, spay/neuter and 1st 30 days of free Pet insurance. We are not affiliated with Pet First pet insurance. (you have to sign up for the insurance or it will not go into effect). \n\tAdopters can go to our vet for medical issues that may arise in 1st 3 days of adoption. \n\tThe dogs in our care are fostered in Colorado, Texas, and New Mexico. While all dogs are picked up during our scheduled times, sometimes transport dates change due to unforeseen circumstances.",

            "description": "Faye has come a long way in just 4 days so we hope that whoever fosters her can be patient and allow her a few days to come out of her shell. Here are a few thoughts and photos we hope will help her to find a new foster or better yet a forever family. When Faye first came to us she was carried out of the shelter and the poor girl was shaking like a leaf. When we got home we backed the car into the garage and opened up the tailgate. She stayed in the back of the car for about an hour without moving. We had hoped she would come out of her own accord but in the end, we had to lift her out and carry her into the house. She did eat with no problem except she seemed to prefer to wait until we were out of sight. She actually has a good appetite but did prefer her dry food mixed with some canned dog food. She spent most of the first day in the crate. The next day we encouraged her to walk through the house on the leash. On day four she walked through the house to go outside where she sat enjoying the warmth and we left her alone but left the back door open. Her last day with us - she came out of her crate this morning with no encouragement while wagging her tail. Faye took herself to the backyard where she had wandered about and rolled in the grass all the while wagging her tail and appearing much happier. One thing that did surprise us is that she has the ability to go a long time without going outside yet no \"accidents\" in the house. Faye is a gentle girl - she has taken treats - and hotdogs - from our hand very gently. Although she was clearly afraid when we picked her up at no time did she snarl or snap at us. On her last day with us she found her voice. She didn't bark but when she walked out of her crate this morning wagging her tail with a big smile on her face she made funny little noises as if she was trying to talk to us. Later, when she was outside enjoying the fine weather she would come to the open back door and talk to us while wagging her tail as if to say aren't you going to come out to play? It is clear that she has been through a lot and almost seems depressed. We feel that a quiet place where she has time to come around at her own pace and feel safe and secure would be best for her. Too much noise and stimulation may frighten her. Our house is very quiet with just the two of us and we have left her to come around at her own pace and it seems to have worked. Faye obviously has a sad story and we almost wish she could tell us what happened to her so we could help her better. I am sure she will find her place within the right home and I am happy for any future foster or adopter to contact me if I can help in any way. I would love to follow her progress and given a few months I am sure she will be a completely different girl than the sad, shaking girl we collected from the shelter. \n\nFaye had belonged to a truck driver; when she was younger, she spent a lot of time riding with him, but once she got older, he had to leave her at home more frequently. While he was on the road, he would leave Faye with his mother. Unfortunately, after a long trip on the road, he came back to a pregnant Faye. He thought he might be able to care for them, but with his mom's older age and him being gone so frequently, he knew this family would not get the care that they needed. So he took them to the shelter, hoping to be able to give them all a better life than he could provide them. Faye is incredibly fearful in the shelter as you'll see in the video. She just needs a soft place to fall where she can decompress and come out of her shell.\n\nWe have no back story or update for this dog at this time. When we do, it will be updated here. This is all the information we have currently.\n\n\n\tApproved Applicants may make the adoption fee payment by clicking donate above. Partial adoption fees will not hold a dog.\n\tDogs adopted with our rescue come with FREE training from #GoodPup to help you build strong bonds from the start!\n\tIf upon meeting the dog of your choosing at an adoption event you find that you aren't a good match, your deposit will be refunded minus a 10% administration fee.\n\tAdoption fees include vaccines up until time of adoption, microchip, spay/neuter and 1st 30 days of free Pet insurance.

Star is already about 30 pounds, so she will be a fairly large dog when full grown. She's crate trained and responds well to most basic commands-- sit, stay fetch, and drop. Doing very well with house breaking and working hard on leash training. Cars, loud noises, and barking dogs scare her a little so she would do best in home with a fenced in yard. Star loves to run and play outside and would probably do well with another dog to play with, but a meet and greet would be necessary. Star is now spayed, up to date with vaccines for her age and microchipped. Her adoption fee is $450.00. If you are interested in adopting Star, please visit our website www.LHARinc.org go to Adopt and complete the dog adoption application.",

I am well-behaved and house-broken. My foster dad tells me she is impressed with my manners. I know basic commands and am as sweet as can be! My foster dad thinks I get too excited when we are walking and I see other dogs, but I just want to say hi! He's helping me with that and I am quick to learn. I also love,love,love being outside, so it would be awesome if my new family has a yard! I'd prefer to be your one and only- I promise I have enough personality to fill your home with love! \n\nI sure am looking forward to finding my furever family soon!",

Sadly, we are no longer able to respond to every application, but will contact the one that is a good match within 3 days.\nHolly is a female 4 yr old maltipo (born 11/5/2016), really more poodle then anything.   She is sweet and social and tons of fun.  Holly is 12-13 lbs and so very cute.  She does not love being alone and has lived with another dog.  Holly had a bladder stone, which had to be removed surgically, so whoever adopts her has to undestand that she will need to be on prescription food with regular exams for the rest of her life, no exceptions as otherwise she will make more stones and that is painful and very expensive.  She loves walks and can handle really long ones.  Holly has good housemanners and is a joy to have in the home.   She is a bit too much for kitties.   Holly is crate trained and goes right into her crate for travel.\nMost of our dogs are not available to an out of the area adoption because of difficulty to follow up.  If you do not live within a 2 hr drive of Orange County, please email us before applying to see if the dog you are interested is may be a candidate for long distance adoption.    We only make consider long distance adoptions for dogs who have been in our rescue for 6 plus months with no local candidates.\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our rescues, please visit our main website for adoption procedures at www.pupsandpals.net and then fill out our application.  Please note that we are all volunteers so it may take up to 3 days to process your application, but you will hear back from us if your application is a good match for the pet. \nWe do not have a shelter so individual appointments must be made to meet the pet you are interested in.  Our pets are fostered/boarded all over LA and Orange County.  \nThis pet is altered, vaccinated, microchipped, and has had a brief temperament evaluation to help us determine what type of  a home he/she would thrive in.  Please note that we put lots of time and effort to make sure our pets are ready to be someone's perfect pet before they go home.... and to make sure that we will have the best possible match for this pet we do require an : application, interview, adoption fee and in some case a home check.  \nListed for adoption: 1/18/2021\nAdoption fee: $350\nPLEASE DO NOT call or email to see if a pet is available.  We update our pages daily so if he/she is pictured here in the available dogs section, we are accepting applications at this time.",

Please watch your spam folders as an application will be attached and this sometimes places it in there. \n\nHIS/HER adoption fee is $550 USD and that will pay for TRANSPORT, all his/her shots up to date, neutered/spayed, microchip and rabies.\n\nPlease e-mail MuttsAndMeows@Mail.com for an adoption application. \n\nThis dog is currently in the Houston Texas area.  Once the application is approved and adoption fee paid, transport will be arranged.\n\nBecause this adoption will be without meeting the dog first, we will need to try to be extra careful that everyone (including you) think this will be a good fit.  We will try to give you as much information about the dog as we can.  Unfortunately, many are fresh from the shelter and we don't know much about them yet. \n\nLike us on Facebook - search Mutts & Meows - and help even more pets find loving homes.",

            "description": "Please read the dog's entire bio before you apply.  Sadly, we are no longer able to respond to every application, but will contact the one that is a good match within 3 days.\nJicama is a little female senior chihuahua, just about 8-9 yrs old and just under 7 lbs.   Jicama is very sweet and easy to get along with, just likes attention and being held yet is pretty low maintanence.   Jicama does have a cataract in one eye so her eyesight is pretty limited on that side.    She had a dental cleaning and had some teeth pulled but that doesnt stop her.  She is a sweet and easy girl who would make someone a great little loyal companion.   She has some age related stiffness in one of her back legs so no super long walks for this pup.\nMost of our dogs are not available to an out of the area adoption because of difficulty to follow up.  If you do not live within a 2 hr drive of Orange County, please email us before applying to see if the dog you are interested is may be a candidate for long distance adoption.    We only make consider long distance adoptions for dogs who have been in our rescue for 6 plus months with no local candidates.\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our rescues, please visit our main website for adoption procedures at www.pupsandpals.net and then fill out our application.  Please note that we are all volunteers so it may take up to 3 days to process your application, but you will hear back from us if your application is a good match for the pet. \nWe do not have a shelter so individual appointments must be made to meet the pet you are interested in.  Our pets are fostered/boarded all over LA and Orange County.  \nThis pet is altered, vaccinated, microchipped, and has had a brief temperament evaluation to help us determine what type of  a home he/she would thrive in.  Please note that we put lots of time and effort to make sure our pets are ready to be someone's perfect pet before they go home.... and to make sure that we will have the best possible match for this pet we do require an : application, interview, adoption fee and in some case a home check.  \nListed for adoption:  1/18/2021\nAdoption fee: $300\nPLEASE DO NOT call or email to see if a pet is available.  We update our pages daily so if he/she is pictured here in the available dogs section, we are accepting applications at this time.",

Please help! \n \nLogan is a distraught, 6-year-old Pekinese who lost his home suddenly when his owner was murdered. To make matters worse, Logan needs an intricate surgery to repair a bilateral perianal hernia. He is struggling to go to the bathroom and uncomfortable. Logan's surgery is estimated at $3,500 - a specialist must be called in, as the surgery is high risk for failure and infection due to the location. \n \nUntil his surgery, Logan will be on stool softeners and prescription food to keep him more comfortable. He is a friendly dog, whose spirits have improved in the short time he has been with us. Logan is seeking a medical foster (or foster to adopt home) for his recovery. Please consider a donation towards Logan's surgery - and remind him that there is an amazing life of happiness on the horizon for him. Please complete an application at rbari.org to foster / adopt Logan. Primary Color: Fawn Secondary Color: Black Age: 6yrs 1mths 2wks",

She is a high energy dog and will do well in a home that is active. When she\u2019s not playing she loves to cuddle in bed or on the couch with you! She recently had a cherry eye repaired and is healing great! This should not cause any long last problems for her going forward. She does have a slight heart murmur which her doctor believes doesn\u2019t require any medical intervention at this time and should be monitored yearly at her annual physicals. \n\nTwiggy\u2019s adoption fee is $300.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete and submit an adoption application. To fill out an application, COPY AND PASTE the link below into the address line of your Web browser:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nhttp://members.petfinder.com/~MI559/formJot.html\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe application must be approved before visiting with this dog.\n\nApproved applications are based on best fit and not first  submitted.  Midwest Small Breed Rescue reserves the right to refuse any  applicant, it is within our discretion to make these decisions on behalf  of our dogs.\n\nWe do require a home visit and a veterinarian reference.

She weighs in at about 50 pounds. She likes people very much and does well with calm dogs. She will not be a good dog park buddy due to being the fun police around excitable dogs but she will be your best friend forever if you want to walk the neighborhood or hang out at home.  We would not recommend that Leila live in a home with cats. She is well house broken, does pretty well on a leash, and is a good car rider. Leila loves her toys, she has a whole collection and likes to pick a new one out of the toy box every day to add to her stash. She is spayed, vaccinated, and microchipped.

We think that I may be a Shepherd mix with a bit of Collie, as my coat is def collie like! I had a lonely start to life, as I started out in the shelter, so the world terrifies me! I need someone who can be patient with me and let me open up and blossom into my handsome self. I am still young but I am crate trained. My foster mom has a doggie door and the very first day I learned how to take myself out, and have had zero accidents. I am, however, still learning to walk with a leash. They scare me a lot so I need a fenced yard to play and potty. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting me, reach out to my foster mom Liz at 214-616-6128 and she can tell you a bit more about me.\n\nMelvin is neutered, microchipped, as well as up to date on his vaccines!

He's now happy and healthy! Bruce is a quirky little dude, he overall prefers the people he lives with and can be very standoffish with new people, he does become defensive when new people enter his home or yard. Bruce needs a low traffic home and would love someone who is home frequently. He also needs someone very experienced in dog behavior and who will understand and respect his behavioral needs. \n\nBruce does really good with other dogs but overall prefers snuggles with humans. He's good with cats as well! Bruce does not need to be in a home with small kids he would however be fine with older kids. \n\nBruce spends most of his time sleeping, if you're chilling then he's chilling. He does get the cutest happy dance and bounce when he's excited. Bruce absolutely loves treats, especially dental treats! Bruce likes to pee when he wants to pee and wears a belly band inside. Bruce rarely poops inside unless you leave him alone for too long, then he'll poop and smash it everywhere. Bruce loves loves to be outside and will soak up all the sunshine but he also really loves to be inside too. \n\nOur little man is only available for foster to adopt so we can ensure the best quality fit for him! If interested please contact our director at krfdirector@kanoarescuefoundation.org or send her a text at (405)255-3484.",

Introducing me...Ace! A little about me...well I\u2019m 7 years old, about 80 lbs, and a fluffy mixed breed. (Best guess Anatolian or Pyrenees mix) I was actually adopted from the rescue when I was a puppy and had a home for 7 years, but then my family had kids and decided they didn\u2019t\u2019 have time for me and didn\u2019t want me anymore. I\u2019m totally fine with kids so not sure what the big deal was. I\u2019m crate trained, potty trained, and well behaved. I like hanging out with doggy friends and cats don\u2019t bother me at all. Whenever I drink some water and finish my dinner I don\u2019t have the best manners because I like to let out a nice, loud BURP. My foster Mom can\u2019t help but laugh at that; she says it adds to my charm. So what are you waiting for? Take me home already!\n\nIf you are interested in adding this pup to your family, please click here (or copy and paste https://www.dfwpuppatrol.com/info/adoption into your browser) to view our adoption info and where you will find the link to fill out our online Pre-Adoption Application.  Any questions can be directed to us at info@dfwpuppatrol.com.  All of our adoptable pups have a minimum requested adoption fee of $250 + tax  (pups 6 months and older) and $350  + tax (pups under 6 months old), regardless of our expenses, and it includes vaccinations, spay/neuter, heartworm test for pups 8 months and older, heartworm treatment if tested positive, deworming and/or fecal test, parasite treatment if tested positive, microchipping, any immediate known health issues, and pups 3 months and older are kept current on monthly heartworm prevention.\n\n INTERNAL\nPSTD 01/18/21 TSELF\nCNTC DFWPPR",

He knows how to sit, and likes to play with the other dogs. \n\nThese puppies came from a horrible situation - the were severely malnourished and had potential rickets as well when they were brought to us.\n\n!!Spay/neuter agreement must be signed upon adoption. !!\n\nOur adoption application can be found at www.centraliahumanesocietyil.org, and emailed in. Applicants must have current/past pets current vaccinations, taken to the vet regularly, and dogs must be on monthly heartworm prevention to be approved for adoption.

            "description": "Draco was recently placed and returned because he was too much for the resident Chihuahua.  And while it wasn't the right match, it is no reflection on this dude!  When I first met him I thought he would be a handful, but honestly I found him to be quite a sweet dog.  No edges.  He is all puppy and needs manners (he jumped up on top of the picnic table and loves to be on top of his kennel dog house) but manners are easy to teach.  Temperament is what is really important and Draco's is just wonderful.\n\nAre you looking for young and fun without having to deal with all the hassles that come with a young puppy?  If so, then Draco might be the right match for you!  At just 9 months old and about 45 pounds he is every bit a puppy, but housebroken and having some basic manners already established (he will sit on command for a treat).   \n\nOf course don't let that fool you, he still has ALL the energy of a young dog so his new family must be ready to give him plenty of exercise.  Lots of walks, runs and fetch in the yard will be needed.    Draco is good on leash, pulling just a little but corrects every easily. \n\nDraco is housebroken and crate trained (although it will need to be a very solid and sturdy crate as he can break out of a cheap crate).  We have found that he will even hold it in his kennel at the shelter which is amazing!  He is good with other dogs and seems to be good with cats.  \n\nWhile Draco is good with kids, his previous owner said that he is too much of a large puppy to be placed with small children.  All the screaming and running gets him excited and he wants to join the fun and that can get overwhelming.  So children over 10 would be recommended.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:    DO NOT CALL THE SHELTER.  If you have questions you will get a much faster response if you email questions to  HSPCdogs@gmail.com  \n \nWe are open for adoptions Thursday - Saturday from 12-4pm (excluding holidays).  Adoptions are on a first come, first serve basis.  Adoption fee is $100 (cash or check only, NO credit cards).   Meet and greets with kids and other dogs are required.\n",

Although her foster says she does well with other dogs, she is at the age when this could change drastically. Any adopter should use the usual precautions in introducing her to other dogs.\nFrom her foster:\nCoco does really well with other dogs. Coco lives with one male husky and is able to go to the local dog park and socially interact with other dogs and people. She's also been interactive with children of the ages of 5 and 10. Coco is housebroken. She understands some commands like sit and paw with treats. Is a very smart girl and learning quick. I have only been working with her for a few days and she's been doing great. She is working on walking on the lead, she doesnt pull it just that she walks all over the place. She prefers to be outside running around in a fenced backyard than inside so would recommend someone with a fenced yard. Not possessives of food or toys because she shares everything with the husky at home and with others at the park. She still needs a little help getting up and downstairs she's afraid of them but able to overcome it with some help.This is also a problem when getting her into cars but once she's in the car she just sits and looks out the window. She has been on road trips for hours with ease once in the car",

Squeaky toys are simply amazing to Emmet. He also enjoys a good snuggle in his foster moms lap. Emmet will make an amazing addition to a family . After all who wouldn't want to play with this handsome boy. Emmet is estimated to be 11 weeks old and 9 lbs. Since we don't know at all what doggy genes are in the dog's make up (we don't know who mom and dad are!), we are just guessing on breed and size when grown. \n\nAll dogs have had a vet exam, are up to date on vaccinations, have been given a dewormer, treated for fleas and given heartworm preventative.  Dogs over 7 months have been heartworm tested.  \n\nPlease note that because we require a home visit at the time of adoption we can only place animals in homes within a 60 mile radius of Minneapolis. If you are interested in meeting this dog please fill out the pre-adoption application on our website at http://www.safehandsrescue.org under Adopt and we will get back to you to arrange a meeting in the foster home.",

He has really started to show his personality and he really loves to give kisses even though it still takes him a minute to warm up to new people.

            "description": "*PLEASE NOTE: FAMILIES INTERESTED IN THIS LITTER MUST HAVE PRIOR GERMAN SHEPHERD EXPERIENCE & A YARD*\n\nBandit is a 6 month old neutered male German Shepherd mix who weighs 48 lbs. Bandit and his brothers came to All 4 Paws after their owner passed away and family members could not provide them with the attention they deserved. It was a heartbreaking situation and we are so grateful for the opportunity to help these sweet pups. These boys are going to grow up to be big, loyal companions. They are incredibly intelligent and excel with a job. We are looking for families with direct experience with owning German Shepherds for them, so their families understand their needs from the get go. Activity - both mental and physical - is essential for their well being, and they will thrive in experienced homes. They have always lived with other dogs and have been comfortable with respectful children who do not overwhelm them. Bandit seems to rely on other dogs for comfort so his ideal forever home will have other dogs. He will need a home without cats. Bandit has always had a yard to exercise in and seems most happy when he can be outdoors a lot, so he is looking for a forever home with a yard too. Bandit is very shy at first and needs time to get comfortable. He'll need a patient family with a quieter home in order to feel safe. With some time, dedication, and lots of love we have no doubt Bandit will blossom into a devoted family companion; all he needs is a chance. \n\nInterested in adopting?

            "description": "Reimer came to us after he was found as a stray. Reimer's genitals did not develop correctly causing him to retain a lot of urine, this resulted in him having a penile amputation. Reimer is still not always able to control his bladder, he is on medications that help him out and he has less accidents because of it but he is not always 100%. Reimer absolutely LOVES to play and be around other dogs. Reimer is pretty energetic so we do not suggest a home who wants a lazy dog, he needs a home and family that will keep him active and burn his energy. \n\nReimer would do best with older kids, he is a little much for little kids and would most likely knock them over and accidentally hurt him. Reimer thinks he is a small dog and literally does not understand his size so can be rough with little dogs but has never hurt any small dogs, he just tends to play rougher than little dogs prefer. If dogs do not want to play with him then he respects their space!\n\nReimer does need slow introductions, when we bring people over to meet he stands back for a few seconds but quickly makes friends! He basically just wants to be loved by everyone. Reimer truly is very eager to please, he loves training time!\n\n\nOur sweet man is only available for foster to adopt as we want to ensure the family adopting him is able to handle him and truly love him for all that he is! Please contact our director directly at krfdirector@kanoarescuefoundation.org you can also text her at (405)255-3484 with any questions regarding Reimer.",

He would be a perfect companion for someone with a laid-back lifestyle.  He was an owner surrender and his vet visits were a bit out of date, but after a couple visits and some dental work done he is completely healthy, all shots up to date, and ready to find his furever family. He gets along with other dogs fine and loves people, even though he can be a little shy at first.  His favorite activity is to curl up on a lap and be spoiled with petting and bellyrubs.  He does alright on a leash, but we jokingly call him the \"Poky Little Puppy\", he is never in a rush.  He likes casual strolls over fast-paced walks any day.  He hasn't had any behavioral issues while in foster care, and he's well house-trained.  He does not like the crate, but he hasn't caused any trouble outside of it at night or while the family is gone.  This guy is so ready to take up some lap space on someone who loves sunny patches and book reading.  He will have no problem becoming a wonderful, quiet companion.\n\nIf you want to help with this dog\u2019s medical expenses: \nhttps://therescuedrescuers.org/how-to-help\n\nIf you want to adopt this dog, apply at the link! \nhttps://therescuedrescuers.org/adoption-application\n",

I have a medium/high energy level and will need daily exercise and play time with my family. I'm a big guy at 56 lbs. who will benefit from obedience training. Did you know obedience training not only teaches dogs good manners, but also helps dogs bond with their new owners? It's true! I am approved for respectful children over the age of 10 and will be a great addition to a caring and involved family. If you can commit to an active and affectionate canine companion, I'd love to meet you! Barkley is approved for families with respectful children over the age of 10.\n\nThe online adoption listing websites require that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We encourage you to select your new companion by considering each dog's individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on a breed label that is only a guess.",

He will need to be kept as calm as possible until 12/23 due to treatment for the Heartworms and will need to be kept on monthly heartworm prevention for the rest of his life. He will also need to be retested for heartworms around February 23rd. He sits next to his person without being called. He is loose and wiggly. Sam is high energy and loves to play with the toys. He pulls on the leash. He is food motivated. Sam knows the sit command. He is intensely interested in cats in a shelter atmosphere. Dogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Our cat test should be used as a general purpose screening only to rule out overt aggression; we always recommend caution when introducing dogs to cats in the home. Recommendation on suitability of placement with children by their ages is based on behavioral observations including energy level and response to body handling. We never recommend leaving young children unsupervised with dogs, and we cannot guarantee the behavior of dogs with children, other pets or cats. Behavior evaluations should be considered as a snapshot of the behavior of the dog at this point in time; JHS believes all dog families need to be prepared to invest time and energy into training as well as provide common sense management of their new dog.

Her tail is not tucked but may be near her back legs. The tip of her tail wags and her head lowers when spoken to. Sassy is mellow most of the time but will have bursts of energy. Sassy pulls on a leash but with some basic obedience training, this could easily be resolved. She is food motivated. Sassy knows the sit command. She is afraid of cats in a shelter atmosphere. Dogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Dogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Our cat test should be used as a general purpose screening only to rule out overt aggression; we always recommend caution when introducing dogs to cats in the home. Recommendation on suitability of placement with children by their ages is based on behavioral observations including energy level and response to body handling. We never recommend leaving young children unsupervised with dogs, and we cannot guarantee the behavior of dogs with children, other pets or cats. Behavior evaluations should be considered as a snapshot of the behavior of the dog at this point in time; JHS believes all dog families need to be prepared to invest time and energy into training as well as provide common sense management of their new dog. We always encourage family to do some research on the breeds or mixes of breeds prior to adoption as many can have some unique characteristics that may or may not fit into their families. Always remember that the majority of dogs at our shelter have been exposed to or may have kennel cough. Kennel cough is contagious to other dogs, please talk to your vet if you have any questions about kennel cough prior to adoption. Please ask your adoption counselor at time of adoption if you have any unanswered questions regarding illnesses and treatments of the path that you are adopting.

Ellis is mellow most of the time with bursts of energy (medium) He pulls on a leash but with some basic obedience training, this could easily be resolved. He is food motivated. He does not know any commands but is willing to learn! He is not a fan of cats in a shelter atmosphere. Dogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Dogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Our cat test should be used as a general purpose screening only to rule out overt aggression; we always recommend caution when introducing dogs to cats in the home. Recommendation on suitability of placement with children by their ages is based on behavioral observations including energy level and response to body handling. We never recommend leaving young children unsupervised with dogs, and we cannot guarantee the behavior of dogs with children, other pets or cats. Behavior evaluations should be considered as a snapshot of the behavior of the dog at this point in time; JHS believes all dog families need to be prepared to invest time and energy into training as well as provide common sense management of their new dog. We always encourage family to do some research on the breeds or mixes of breeds prior to adoption as many can have some unique characteristics that may or may not fit into their families. Always remember that the majority of dogs at our shelter have been exposed to or may have kennel cough. Kennel cough is contagious to other dogs, please talk to your vet if you have any questions about kennel cough prior to adoption. Please ask your adoption counselor at time of adoption if you have any unanswered questions regarding illnesses and treatments of the path that you are adopting. For more information about this dog or any others at our Shelter, please visit www.joplinhumane.org. We are the Joplin Humane Society in Joplin, Missouri. 417-623-3642 I AM SPONSORED!

I\u2019m Moose and I\u2019m a big guy with a big personality looking for a big love with my forever family. If you\u2019re up for super-sized fun and affection, read on for more about me!\n\nI\u2019m a happy guy who spends a lot of time smiling, loves my people and bonds to them quickly. Sometimes I forget how big I am and try to crawl up in my foster dad\u2019s lap for snuggles. I\u2019m such a fun \u201cwork from home\u201d companion and mostly just lay by your feet and keep you company (but once in a while, I\u2019ll nuzzle in for some love throughout the day!) Not to brag, but I tend to win over the hearts of everyone I meet with my goofy and quirky personality!\n\nMy favorite place to be is napping with my people but every so often I do get the zoomies and like to take off, running and playing. I love playing tug with my rope toy and fetching balls and sticks. My foster dad says it\u2019s pretty funny watching a big guy like me zoom around. \n\nI do struggle with politely meeting new dogs on and off leash and I am STRONG  so I need to be the only dog in the home. I also need an adopter who can help me avoid meeting dogs on walks and is willing to help me learn to be more relaxed when I see dogs overall. I\u2019ve been working with a trainer and have made lots of progress. I\u2019m SO eager to learn and just need a human to help me thrive! Due to this, I won\u2019t be a candidate for an apartment living situation and it\u2019s very important that I have a 6ft fence in the entire backyard. I also have some reactivity to men who come into my house without a proper introduction so I need a home where someone either doesn\u2019t have a ton of visitors coming over or someone who can just let me meet a male visitor properly first. I am WONDERFUL with men in general-just a random visitor who walks in the door can be overwhelming to me. \n\nI\u2019m overall a happy, playful, cuddly guy who just wants to love. I will be such an awesome companion! If you\u2019d like to learn more about me, please visit PawsCo\u2019s website at www.pawsco.org to fill out an application or email adopt@pawscoadoptions.org for more information about me! \n\n\n\n",

I was born in late October and am 15 pounds lab mix who will be a medium/large dog when fully grown. I spend my days alternating between wrestling and running all over the backyard with the other puppy and dog I live with and cuddling for naps. I also live with two cats, but they don't like to play so I ignore them. They're no fun. But you know what's fun? Playing tug of war! And getting treats! I like getting treats so I am a fast learner when it comes to commands. I am starting to get the hang of this potty training too but I still have accidents sometimes. My foster mom says that's okay and we keep trying. She says I'm a good girl full of curiosity and love. When she opens the gate to our doggy room in the morning after I sleep all night long, the first thing I want is cuddles and then to go explore and play. \n\nMy previous owners gave me and my siblings up so now I am looking for a new family who likes to play and give snuggles. I'd be really great in a house with kids and other dogs so I have playmates. I\u2019m dewormed, microchipped, UTD on vaccines, and looking for my forever home! Is it with your family? Meet me and find out!\n\nPlease note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppy\u2019s breed or size potential. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

She is a very active 8 year old and does not show signs of slowing down. Like most of her breed, she is a little stubborn and will need someone who is familiar with her breed and knows how to work with them.\n\nShe enjoys walks but needs work on the leash. She likes to bark at her surroundings a bit - squirrels, cars etc catch her interest. She loves playing in the yard and needs a secure fence.\n\nShe cannot be around chickens, cats, squirrels, small critters, and farm animals.\n\nMaya will be good for families with kids over 12. She has a lot of energy and can be a little mouthy when she feels very playful.\n\nShe likes her folks to be around more often than not. Loves her people.\n\nShe is now updated on all shots, spayed and chipped. Her adoption fee is $395.\n\nWe cover the medical to prepare the pet for adoption and the adopt donations go directly to cover those costs and range from $295-$495. Thank you for stepping up to save a life!\n\nTo expedite to meet with this dog, please go to our site at www.savinggreatanimals.org and fill out an application. We look at the first applications to arrive, so we hope to hear from you soon!",

            "description": "RUS BARNWELL was found as a stray by a local GA woman. He was emaciated and covered in fleas. She took him in and cared for him until there was room for him at the local shelter. Rus is a 6+ year old handsome bully mix with so much love to give! He is good with other dogs and children too! If he goes to a home with children, they should be older children (8+ yrs). Rus can get excited and accidently knock down small children. Rus loves to play with his toys and clown around with other dogs. He seems to be ok with cats, but definitely wants to chase them. Rus walks pretty well on leash too! He's a smart boy and knows the sit command. Check out his videos on this page from when he was in the shelter and now that he's at our rescue. Rus would make a great addition to any family!\n\nApply to adopt RUS BARNWELL at EHRDOGS.ORG and be sure to mention him by name!!",

He has the sweetest demeanor and hasn\u2019t met a person he doesn\u2019t LOVE! Lincoln also loves other pups, and does best during playtime with a proper introduction. He is an absolute joy to be around and can be playful when appropriate but when he\u2019s inside the house he is pretty mellow. He\u2019s potty trained, crate trained, and is working on his leash skills and takes correction easily. If you\u2019re looking for a new best friend that loves walks as much as cuddling on the couch, Lincoln may be the guy for you!",

Therefore, she needs a home where she will be the only dog and get all of the doggo attention and love.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAll PETronus Rescue dogs receive basic vaccinations (distemper/parvo, bordetella, & rabies), spay/ neuter, and microchip prior to adoption. We also treat any know medical issues, including heartworms.\n\nOur dogs live in foster homes while they wait patiently for their forever families to find them. This is beneficial in that they learn house manners, crate training, housebreaking, etc while they wait and we are also able to get a very realistic picture of their energy level, temperament, etc so that we can place them in a home that is the best fit.\n\nOur adoption fees are $200 for dogs over 1 year of age and $250 for dogs under 1 year of age. Puppies receive 3 rounds of puppy vaccinations.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our amazing dogs, please fill out our adoption application here http://bit.ly/PRAdoption and we will be in touch!\n",

Bear would fit best in a home as the only dog with children 16 yo+.\nSome of Bear\u2019s favorite things are going for short walks (ideally a few times a day), long naps, spending time outside taking in the fresh air, getting brushed, going for car rides, belly rubs and laying at his person\u2019s feet.  \nBear is considered to be low energy, however if you want to see the puppy in Bear come out, mention the word \u201cwalk\u201d and get your boots and coat on!  He is a pro at walking nicely on a leash and loves going on short, slow strolls and taking in all the scents he can!  \nBear is house trained and crate trained.  He needs a home that will be consistent in keeping up his crate routine during the day and most importantly at night.  Bear will thrive in a home with an owner that is able to respect that sometimes Bear likes to have quiet time and space.  Bear can be protective of his \u201cperson\u201d and doesn\u2019t always like to share attention.  Bear likes to take a slow and steady approach to eating and likes to have his space while eating.\n\nBear is more than ready to be someone\u2019s best friend and part of a forever family! Could that be you?\n\nBear\u2019s adoption fee is $250. That includes the cost of spaying, up to date vaccinations, foster care, rescue, and transport fees. \n\nTo get the ball rolling, head over to our Adoption Application and submit your application today. \n\nA Dog Bear representative will contact you within 24 hours. \n\nTo help speed up the process contact your vet and give them permission to speak with us. \n\nIf you do not get a response within 24 hours of submitting your application, please check your spam folder.",

She is fun and social.  Dog friendly, cat friendly.  We are looking for a home with NO small children and NO large dogs, NO exceptions.  We require this due to her small size and being injured by kids or other dogs.  Cookie is being released by her owner due to a possible medical condition.  Cookies new owner must be financially secure, own their own home and able to cover any medical expenses for her if ever needed.  Be prepared to prove you can do this.  We are looking for someone wealthy enough who will not need to depend on pet insurance if a medical necessity happens.  More will be explained in person.  Cookies owner must keep her well socialized.  Due to her breed, purebred toy poodle, she will require being taken to a groomer about every 4 to 5 weeks.  The rescue also requires the future owner to have a car seat for her while in a vehicle.  If you think you fit these requirements contact the rescue at suzzie38@gmail.com.  Home visits and a contract are mandatory, no exceptions.  We are not doing out of state adoptions at this time. You must be in Pennsylvania and within 75 miles of 17257.  Thanks, have a great day!",

If there are multiple applications for a puppy, after all home checks are done, then the puppy is adopted out to the home that is the best fit for that puppy.\n***** All breeds listed are a best guess or based on information from our rescue partners and are not guaranteed*****\n \n ******Chicagoland Dog Rescue reserves the right to restrict adoption of a dog to potential adopters who live within a fifty (50) mile radius of Schaumburg, IL *****\n\nHi! My name is Charlotte and if you are looking for a dog who wants to hang with you\u2026it's ME! I am very affectionate and love to follow my foster Mom everywhere! I do have a furry foster brother and he and I have the best time running around out in the yard. I do have lots of puppy energy but also love a good nap, hopefully on my foster Mom\u2019s lap! I have not quite mastered the whole walking on a leash thing yet but I am a smart girl so I know that with time, I will get the hang of it! And being such a smart girl I do have sit down pat, especially when a treat is involved! I am working on potty and crate training and doing well with both. I just know that with lots of love, training, and patience, I will be one GREAT dog! If you would like to meet me, please fill out a pre-adoption application and a CDR volunteer will get back to you just as quick as they can!\nSnuggles and kisses-Charlotte\n\n\n**The ADOPTION FEE for this pet is $450 which includes getting the puppy/dog up to date on rabies, distemper and bordetella vaccines, fecal test and deworming if necessary, heartworm test, spay or neuter (not including pre-surgical bloodwork) and a microchip. Free access to our weekly training classes is also included for the life of the dog, something no other rescue in the area offers.***",

Applications can be done at www.adoggie4you.org This dog is between 3 and 4. He weighs 15.4 pounds. Her adoption fee is $350\n\nSnowball was owner surrendered. His owners were not caring for him and he was a matted mess. As a result he was hurting and biting at them.\n\nSnowball has been a loving dog since he was groomed and the tangles were removed. He had some sores, which are healing. He was also covered in fleas, which we have treated.\n\nSnowball needs a loving family that is going to treat him with love and understanding. He is afraid of men, which makes us wonder how he was being treated. The lady that turned him in said he was running with their other 15 to 20 dogs outside. He needs work on potty training, since he never lived inside. Once he bonds with you, he is 120% yours. He follows his foster mom everywhere. He is wanting a connection with a family. But he takes a day to warm up and he is a fear biter if you try to rush him.",

I LOVE TO CUDDLE UP NEXT TO YOU ON A SOFA AND IN BED SO HOPING SOMEONE WILL ALLOW ME TO DO THIS ONCE ADOPTED.\n\nI WAS IN A FOSTER HOME WITH A SMALL CHILDREN, DOGS, AND CATS AND DID GREAT.\n\nI AM ALSO HOUSETRAINED, DO WELL IN A CAR AND  HAVE ALL OF  VET WORK DONE INCLUDING NEUTERING MICROCHIPPED,  AND ON MONTHLY PREVENTION,AND ALL SHOTS UP TO DATE. \n\nPLEASE FILL OUT AN APPLICATION IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ME AND I HOPE TO MEET YOU SOON!\n\nHERE IS SOME MORE YOU NEED TO KNOW IF INTERESTED IN ADOPTING ME! \nPlease email Kim at ghogrescue@gmail.com for an application. GRACIE'S HEART OF GOLD ADOPTION APPLICATION GRACIE'S HEART OF GOLD REQUIRES ONGOING PROPER VETERINARY CARE FOR ALL ANIMALS ADOPTED TO INCLUDE HEARTWORM MEDICATIONS, FLEA MEDICATIONS, AND YEARLY VACCINATIONS. GRACIES HEART OF GOLD DOES NOT SHIP OUR DOGS - WE REQUIRE A FACE TO FACE MEETING. WE ALSO DO NOT ADOPT OUR DOGS AS GIFTS UNLESS THE RECIPIENT MEETS WITH THE DOG PRIOR TO ADOPTION. MY ADOPTION FEE IS: $250. THESE FEES HELP KEEP THE RESCUE GOING. PLEASE READ MORE! Adoption fees average $150-$400. This fee varies per animal based on additional vet care required to save them. Due to the rising costs of veterinary care, premium holistic dog food, gasoline prices, and boarding fees, which are paid for out of our own pockets, we recently were forced to raise our fees. We are not funded by anyone - adoption fees help to offset only a part of our cost of getting the dog ready for adoption. All dogs > 6 months are vetted, up to date on vaccinations, spayed/neutered, microchipped, heartworm tested, wormed and have a goody starter bag. Puppies",

Holly and her siblings were part of an unplanned litter, and their owner was unable to give them the care they deserved. We feel lucky to have had the opportunity to save these cuties and find them wonderful families that will love and care for them forever! They have been in a wonderful foster home since the day they were born, so they are very friendly and social. Holly is last of her litter to find her forever home, and she is looking for a special one. This little girl is super smart and eager to please. She's doing great with her house and crate training, and will work for treats. She will need a family who has experience with strong-willed breeds as she is a little sassy about being handled sometimes. She is affectionate though when it is on her terms and will cuddle up in your lap for a nap. Holly is a little weary of new people, but warms up once given some time. She loves to play and chew on her toys. Holly is pretty obsessed with her canine foster sister and is learning a lot from her. We are requiring her forever home have a confident canine pal to help teach her the ropes. With love and patience we have no doubt this beautiful girl will grow up into a loyal and loving companion, all she needs is a chance. Please help us find Holly the forever home she's been dreaming of!\n\nInterested in adopting?

            "description": "Wow, is Keith a good looking Boy! He kinda has a split personality. He loves to be with people and play and go for walks, be petted, and learn commands; all the things dogs like to do. But he can get upset when there is a barrier between him and a person or dog or anything happening on the other side of the barrier, such as a fence, a gate, or a door. With time and training and learning that he is safe, this \"instinct\" should ease up. He will do best in a home where his people will work with him, (our training staff can help). Keith is a wonderful dog and very loving. To give this boy a chance, call 513-735-2299 to schedule an appointment.",

Sammie is a 20-month-old merle labradane girl who is the definition of AFFECTIONATE, HAPPY and ENERGETIC! \n\nShe is currently living with two toy breed dogs and kids and doing great. She previously lived with bully mixes and loves the dog park too, she's great with other dogs. BUT she is HYPER!! She's a very active girl, she LOVES to play ball, and she can be a bit overwhelming for senior dogs or any dog that isn't a fan of lots of playful energy.\n\nWe still need to get her spayed and settled into foster care so we can learn about her needs. We know this much: She is very much a puppy! Nothing gets her down... she has lots and lots (and lots) of energy! She will certainly benefit from a large playmate. She is rock solid with kiddos.\n\nSammie's adoption fee is $300. To apply for Sammie please go to www.nwflgdr.com/adopt.\n\nATTENTION: NWFLGDR DOES NOT TRANSPORT. If you are applying from out of area or out of state, understand that if your application gets approved, you will be expected to pick up the dane in the location that he/she is being fostered. In addition, if the adoption does not work out, it is your responsibility to bring the dane safely back to us.",

Please read our eligibility requirements and apply on our website: www.ildoberescue.com/adopt. After an application is submitted, additional inquiries can email PlusDogs@ILDobeRescue.com. Our adoption radius is 3 hours from the Chicagoland area.\n\nDiamond is an adorable 2-year-old Chihuahua/Pug-mix, who was surrendered to animal control and transferred to IDR+ with no background. Her foster home has learned a lot about her over the past few months and wants to find her a great match! She is completely crate-trained and housebroken, but watch for her to sit at the door as her signal to go out. Diamond currently cohabitates with other smaller and larger dogs and gets along with them, but she gets a little jealous at times. She\u2019d prefer living with a very laid back smaller dog who gives in easily, and she\u2019d even thrive as an only dog. She isn\u2019t a big fan of cuddling with people, but she loves to snuggle with the resident cat! Diamond tolerates the grandkids when they visit, but she doesn\u2019t like when they try to pick her up. She\u2019d be okay with older kids who are respectful of little dogs and know they aren\u2019t toys. She can also be inappropriate with her mouthiness, but her foster mom says \u201cno nibbling\u2013kisses only!\u201d Diamond is very food motivated, so training will be fun! Positive training is always highly recommended to help bond and communicate. She can be leash walked, but her foster mom would like to see her adopted to a home with a fenced yard (no e-fence). Diamond loves to hang out on one of the many dog beds and is endlessly entertained by the selection in the toy bin. She would be a wonderful addition to a household that can keep her mind and body active.\n\nThe biographical information provided is correct to the best of our knowledge while the animal is in our care or includes what may have been provided by a previous owner. We strive to be honest and accurate, but animals can change their personalities and behavior when they settle into a new home.

We do not know if she has ever been around children.  \nHer foster mom recommends she either be the only dog or in a house of equally large dogs only (70+ lbs)\nNina is extremely loving and affectionate and loves to give kisses and cuddle. She accepts hugs and is very food/treat driven. Training has been slow because her attention span is short. \nShe loves to run and play ball even has begun learning fetch. \nShes gorgeous and deserves a forever home. \nFor more information contact Mary Davis dogfriendsgrooming@gmail.com\n",

            "description": "I AM ON HOLD FOR AN UPCOMING ADOPTION APPOINTMENT Lucus is a handsome 5-year-old mixed-breed fellow who currently weighs about 24 pounds. He came to SFAS when his guardian could no longer care for him and he is now ready for a new family. Here at the shelter, Lucus has been sweet and energetic with staff members. In playgroup he does solicit play and can be quite rambunctious. If you have another dog at home, feel free to bring them in for a meet n greet for your appointment. Lucus's adoption fee is $350. He is a SHELTER HERO! Which means 100% of his adoption fee goes towards other animals in the shelter. He is neutered and microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. To meet Lucus or to be added to his waitlist, call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the DOG'S NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org. A scheduler will call you back within 48 hours to confirm your request. If you have other dogs at home, tell the scheduler you would like to bring them along for a Meet n' Greet. SFAS offers a variety of excellent training classes, seminars and Trainer Talks led by animal behavior professionals. These are $50 off for animals adopted from any shelter or rescue group! Due to current COVID-19 restrictions, classes and talks are all presented virtually using Zoom. For course descriptions, schedules and registration, visit https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/group-training-classes/ for classes and https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/special-seminars-and-workshops/ for seminars and Trainer Talks.",

            "description": "Meet Dulce!  She is an approximately 3-4 years old Dalmatian mix and was a mama to a litter of puppies that have all gone on to find their forever homes.  Now, it's her turn!  She is very people friendly, but is very strong and gregarious, so no small children that might be knocked over.  She does well with dogs her own size as long as they match her energy level.  No small dogs or cats.  She is reactive to other dogs on a leash, which is something the foster is working with her on, but because of that, we are also requiring her to have a physical fenced in yard (no invisible fence) to run off all of her energy.  She is both crate and housetrained.  \n\nDulce's adoption fee is $250 and with that she comes spayed, vaccinated, and microchipped.  Interested in adding her to your family?

I am also potty trained, crate trained and up to date on vaccinations.\n\nI have learned to walk on leash and feel comfortable outdoors. I no longer fear strollers, bikes, joggers and I am by the door when I see my foster mom with the leash.\n\nMy relationship with humans started recently and I am learning to trust and love people as I trust and love my foster mom, but I am still fearful and need time to warm up to new people-treats really help\n\nI am NOT a dog for just anybody.\nI am looking for somebody very patient, willing to commit to as many meet&greets as needed to make me feel comfortable around him/her.\nI would prefer to have dog friends to play and cuddle with, furry friends make me feel more comfortable and confident. I started learning things late in life but I am smart and have a very gentle nature. Must have a tall fence in the yard (6+) as I am a big boy who can jump easily.\n1/31/21 10:03 PM",

            "description": "Callie #7173 is a 13-year-old female Border Collie/Spitz mix. While this older lady can be a bit shy at first, she warms up quickly and is the sweetest soul you could ever meet. She loves to lean against you for comfort, once she knows you. Callie is seeking a nice home to live out her golden years. She has been diagnosed with arthritis and will need to be on joint supplements. She struggles with her vision, but is not completely blind. Callie is a bit finicky with her potty business. While she enjoys going on walks, she prefers to do her business in a fenced-in backyard without the weight of a leash. She is also trained to use pee pads, so having those around the house is a good idea. Callie is good with cats and other dogs that are her size. Dogs that are bigger than her frighten her. She absolutely loves cheese! She weighs 27 pounds and is full grown. This pup is microchipped. We believe you can always teach an \u2018old\u2019 dog new tricks, so we highly recommend continued obedience training for this smart pup; it stimulates the dog's mind and establishes a good dog/adopter relationship. This pup, like all pups, should be on heartworm preventative; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If you are interested in adopting this dog, and are already approved to adopt through our organization, please contact dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with the pup\u2019s name and ID number in the subject line. OTHERWISE, please submit an adoption application online: http://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.org/adoptus.html E-mail dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with questions.

            "description": "Sierra is a 5 year young Great Pyrenees and Anatolian Shepherd mix that weighs about 80lbs. Sierra arrived at her foster home on December, 27, 2020. When Sierra arrived, she was a bit shy and not very confident. However, Sierra seems to have adapted quickly and well to her new large fenced in property and the companionship of her foster parents who respect her breed. Sierra loves to be outside with her people. Sierra also loves being in the house and enjoys her couch, chew toys and cuddle time. Sierra loves to be petted and thrives from it. Sierra enjoyed the company of another dog for 10 days at her foster home. She played well with the other dog but she is a large dog and play dates are best supervised as she likes to do butt slams and doesn't realize how strong she is. She is very playful and has a gentle way going about it. Sierra will bark if another dog comes around her property but not aggressively more of a communication that she wishes she could run free and play with the other dog. Sierra has been brought to the groomers with her Foster Dad and did very well during her grooming. The groomer loved her and said she was very well behaved. Sierra's Foster Dad brought her to the Veterinarians and again she did very well with her behavior. The vet tech said she was very well behaved. Sierra seems to love people and tries hard to please. Sierra walks well on a lead but she may do best with a harness fitted for her as squirrels make her want to pull. She does get excited about squirrels and likes to chase them out of her fenced in yard. Sierra is learning that her job is to be respectful of the ducks at her foster home and that protecting them is her job. Sierra doesn't do well with cats. We were warned about this from her previous caregiver. Her foster family has a cat. Sierra will bark at the cat and chase the cat if given the chance. However, Sierra doesn't challenge the gate which the cat is behind. Sierra doesn't challenge the 6' high fencing at her foster home either. Sierra enjoys her quiet times at night and her once a day Greenie dog dental chew. Sierra likes to watch her meals being prepared and enjoys her food. Sierra does not sleep in a crate at her foster home. Sierra sleeps in the master bedroom with her foster dad and will get up and make space for him at bedtime. No guarding her food, bed or toys. Sierra will share her toys and initiate play. Sierra will sit patiently to get her treat, go outside or come in. Sierra will bark at you and sniff her tail if she needs to go out. Sierra is very gentle when giving her food or treats. Sierra is a joy to have around and she would make a great companion for someone who enjoys the outdoors and especially if they have a large fenced in property. If Sierra really likes you, she will give you a hug and sit down next to you and lean into you while giving you a most adoring look of gratitude.\n\nIf you are interested in any of our dogs, please complete our online adoption application:\n\nhttp://www.lifesaverssp.dreamhosters.com/adoption-applicat\n/\n\nWe will conduct a phone interview, check references and then a home check. This helps us to match a dog with their potential adopter. The adoption fee is $350.00 for adults and $450.00 for puppies under one year which includes spay/neutering, up-to-date age appropriate vaccinations, flea/tick & heartworm preventative and a health certificate. We foster our dogs in homes, not in shelters. This allows us to get to know the dogs temperaments in order to match them to a home. This also allows us to get the dogs ready to live in their forever homes! All dogs coming from the south have been quarantined for two weeks and fully vetted before traveling to New England!\n\nFor more info please email Lifesaversapps@outlook.com OR visit our website:\n\nhttp://www.lifesaverssp.org/ 1/30/21 12:01 PM",

            "description": "Animal Profile: Mirabella joined us from the Tacoma Humane Society in January 2021. She is estimated to be two years and came to us weighing only 42 pounds.\n\nFoster Update: Mirabella is settling in well. She's an energetic and intelligence dog who loves hanging out with people. She was pretty underweight when she arrived and we are working on adding some meat on her bones. She does well with the resident dog, but has some reactivity to dogs on leash (though she's not aggressive). Initially she's very timid and a slow introduction to people and dogs is best. Once she had a time to check out people, she's a complete love bug. Mirabella is still very timid but is gaining confidence daily with the help of her foster mom. She has recently discovered that she loves to play fetch and very quickly learned to drop the ball. She can still be scared of loud noises and bustling actions and we think she would do best in a home with a fenced yard.\n\nMirabella is looking for an active home that will continue to help her blossom and teach her how to be confident. She will do best in a home with previous large dog breed experience.\n\nAdoption Info:\nAdoption fee is $500 which includes spay/neuter, all core vaccinations, microchip, heartworm test and health certificate. Your adoption fee may be tax deductible as Dog Gone Seattle is a federal 501c3 organization.\n\nApply online:\nwww.doggoneseattle.org/adoption-application",

She is not as rowdy as most of her other siblings, and so she would do best in a quieter home.\nTheir mom Slinky is a 14 lb red dachshund mix. Father is unknown. Pups and mom are named after Toy Story characters. The puppies should grow to 20-30 lbs. Molly will be on the smaller end. The other pups are Bonnie, Molly, Bo Peep, Woody, Jessie, and Hamm. As of Jan 27, Molly is the only one still available. She has just been spayed and is a little woozy right now.\nMolly got her super duper home with human sisters Hailey and Kelsey, mom and dad. We are thrilled for everyone. So many excellent apps for the Toy Story pups. We are always rescuing and always have wonderful dogs that we get to know well.\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com.

PLEASE DON'T BREAK IT.\n\nhttp://www.wagsandwhiskerspetrescue.com/adopt.html\nThank you so much for looking into wags and whiskers for your next family member.\nAll of our pets are up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, heartworm tested if over 6 months old and will be spayed or neutered before being allowed to go home.\nUnfortunately, we don't always know the background of each dog. Some were dumped, abandoned in an empty house, left tied to a tree, picked up by animal control as strays, or simply unwanted by their owners. We ask that only serious and committed adopters apply as these dogs have suffered enough.\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet please apply to adopt at http://www.wagsandwhiskerspetrescue.com/adopt.html if the pet is still available for adoption and you are approved to adopt we will contact you to set up a meet and greet appointment.",

I hope that doesnt make you sad Im feeling so excited to be here and find my people soon!\nAt just 1.5 years old, I already know quite a few tricks! I know sit, shake, and speak, plus I know to lay down when you point your finger to the floor! Im sure I can learn a lot more tricks along the way if you have treats or toys that youre offering. While I like treats, toys are my favorite Im super motivated to be the best girl if it means having you play fetch with me! I do have a lot of energy and love to run around so I would benefit from a lot of exercise and some additional obedience training so I can exercise my mind! Ive also been working really hard on keeping my kennel clean and have showed signs of being housebroken! While I will need some patience when I find my new home, I do seem to have a head start on learning how to be house broken! The nice volunteers here say I am incredible smart so I know that I can keep working hard to be the best version of myself!\nRecently, I had one of the best days ever! I got to go on a field trip with a really nice volunteer. It was so amazing to get a few hours outside of the shelter and get a taste of what life could be like once my furever family finds me. We got to go on a hike which was awesome its so fun to go on adventures. We also went to Home Depot and walked around which was cool! I got to meet some nice people who offered up some pets and said I was really cute it made me feel so special! I also got to go to a bakery where the volunteer shared one of their tasty treats with me. It was SO good! I did well in the car and overall had a blast! I cant wait to see all the other cool places Ill be able to visit once I leave Wayside.\nSince I have never had much of my own, I dont need a whole lot in my future home. Just someone to love and someone to love me right back. Because I have never really interacted with dogs before, I will need to be the only dog in the family since Im not sure how much I really enjoy other four-legged animals. But, I definitely want you to know that I have so much fun, love, and joy to share that I will be all you would ever need. I really hope we can meet soon I cant wait to give you all the kisses in exchange for all the pets!\nLove,\nYodel\n ...",

The shelter adopted them out together to a family in the Brownwood area. After a month Winter was returned because she growled at the granddaughter and about a week ago they returned Simba for the same reason.\n\nAccording to this family Simba lived outside w/ heat lamp, is sweet and friendly but does not like when you push his butt down to sit (Possible the reason he turned on granddaughter).\n\nSimba gets along with other dogs outside but not in the house, so he should be the only dog. He showed food aggression with their other dog as well.\n\nSince he is with us at the rescue we had no problems with him. He is very sweet and calm and loves to be petted/attention.\n\nA BIG FENCED YARD FOR SIMBA TO RUN AROUND AND PROTECT EVERYTHING AROUND HIM IS A MUST!",

They are very well behaved and friendly, if a little timid at first. We don't think they have every lived with very young children, so that might be a no go, but they'd love an active family to play with!\n\nIf you're interested in Jax OS, go to EHRDOGS.ORG and submit an application.

            "description": "Life is uncertain, always eat dessertor ADOPT it!!\n\nWe are so excited to finally introduce you to the ultimate fun-sized, super special, extra sweet treat that you won't feel guilty indulging in for the rest of furever-please give a heartfelt 'hello' to our girl, BUTTERSCOTCH! At just 15 pounds, she is teeny tiny but oh so mighty! Let's just say her road to Boston Buddies was anything but sweet; Butterscotch came in to the Rancho Cucamonga Shelter as a stray with dry eye, a fractured pelvis, and a luxated left hip. We quickly learned that although Butterscotch was physically broken, her soul was beautifully resilient and strong. She immediately had FHO surgery on her hip to help restore as much mobility as possible, her fractured pelvis was on its way to healing naturally, her dry eye got a little lubricating love with medicated drops, and her arthritis was put at ease with some pain meds. Never once did our little go-getter get down. Butterscotch kept sharing her contagious toothy grin (we're obsessed!), sweet kisses, and so much love with her doctors, our volunteers, and now her foster momma!\n\nSpeaking of foster mom, simply put, she's totally smitten. Butterscotch has settled in quite nice; she's totally potty trained, makes the perfect copilot in the car, doesn't mind getting cleaned up in the tub, and is always up for a good quality belly rub. Ready, waiting, and wanting to be besties with any and every one, Butterscotch is kind to all humankind and has them swooning over her in no time (those puppy brown eyes certainly mesmerize)! Speaking of puppy eyes, you may be wondering how old our little bitty beauty isand the answer is, she's somewhere in between! What does that mean?! The Shelter listed her as 2, our routine vet thought she was closer to 8, and our surgeon certainly thought she was 12+ until she saw how perfect her teeth were then she understood why the shelter listed her at 2. So not so simply put, she's extra special, has stumped the vets, and hey-age is just a number, so let's just say she's somewhere in between 2 and 12 (I bet it's the first you've heard that oneus too)! When it comes to other puppy pals, Butterscotch is best suited in a quiet home and prefers a mellow mate that likes to nap, and snuggle, and snooze rather than run around and play. Butterscotch is spayed, fully vaccinated, heart worm and fecal tested (both negative), and microchipped. She will need long-term drops for her dry eye and pain medication to manage her arthritis. Butterscotch hasn't done too much exercise since her hip surgery, but she does go on small walks and is quite the lady on her leash. She isn't too upset about the lack of outdoor activity, our girl is more of a great indoors woman. She makes the sweetest shadow, loves being everywhere her human is, and is happiest curled up snoozing the day away by your side. Butterscotch is ready, waiting, and more than deserving of the perfect person(s) and her happily furever after. How absolutely sweet life will be with BUTTERSCOTCH.\n\nPlease fill out an adoption application on our website\nwww.bostonbuddies.org\n\nAdoption Donation: $300",

What about without having to worry about anything being chewed up in your home because of puppy teeth or boredom? Well look no further...I'm Deebo, one of the most well-behaved foster dogs my foster mom has ever known (and she has fostered LOTS of dogs). I love riding in the car, cuddling on the couch, playing with my foster brother, and enjoying an occasional ice cream cone. I am playful, enjoy a good game of fetch, and also don't mind playing with my toys alone. I looovvveee people so I'm always happy when my foster parents have their friends over. Since I am eager to please and enjoy tasty treats, I am a fast learner and already know basic commands. Being a gentle and even-tempered soul, my foster mom thinks I would be a great fit for a home with kids of any age. Don't be surprised when I jump into your lap on the couch because I am a bit goofy and I love affection. I did have surgery a couple of months ago on my knee so my foster mom has been keeping my walks slightly limited. We are still making vet visits to make sure everything is healing like it's supposed to. Honestly though, I'm quite content with a couple of 20 minute walks a day...I'm not really a marathon runner or anything. If you're interested in more information about me, please connect with A Rotta Love Plus or fill out an adoption application. Thanks for checking out my photos!!\n\nIf you're interested in adopting this dog, please view our Placement Process and to fill out an online application.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.You MUST submit an application at BFPA.org if you are interested in Scottie! Please note that ALL dogs on our website ARE available.\n\nFOSTER COMMENTS:\n\nMeet Scottie a 60 pound, 1 year old, Terrier mix. He's adorable - great colors and a good personality! He is puppy curious and explore everything, seriously, everything! He does great with a consistent schedule and exercise. He is very loyal and just wants your love.\n\nHe is shy at meeting new people, but it's been getting better. We meets visitors outside when we walk but he's also met our neighbors and loved the hugs and petting. Scottie has lived with two other dogs in the past so he could join a family with dogs or be the only dog. I have not seen him interact with cats. He is not living with children but because of his size and puppy like behavior at times, he would do best with older children but not young, small kids.\n\nScottie is a very sweet dog and is quiet for the most part. If he hears strangers or an odd noise, he will sound the alarm appropriately. Scottie is housebroken! During the day he has gone 5 hours with no problems. At night he sleeps in his crate 9-10 hours with no accidents. He is crate trained and he is very happy and comfy in his crate.\n\nScottie has the typical high puppy energy and behaviors. After we go for a walk and I remove the leash, his puppy runaround play time kicks in! A fenced yard would be a bonus so he can burn off some of the puppy energy, but not necessary with the appropriate amount of walks and play time. I don't have a yard but take long walks 2x day (30 min +) and 3 smaller ones around the block. On walks he tends to want to lead and pull and mouth on the leash, very typical puppy behavior. I have only had him a short time, so proper equipment is helping and he is quite trainable.\n\nScottie's favorite things to do are to chew on his nylabone, play with ice cubes, prance as he goes on his walks, getting rubbed down with a towel and like all puppies, chew on things. His thing to chew on is material, ie. towels, blankets and toilet paper. He has not tried to chew on any furniture. This chewing is typical puppy behavior and is correctable. Scottie is super smart and has learned several commands in my short time with him. He has learned , sit, stay and no. We are working on, leave it and down.\n\nScottie was found as a stray and is looking for his forever home. If you are looking for a sweet guy that is going to be your best friend, Scottie may be the pup for you.\n\nEVERY DOG HAS A STORY: Scottie was found as a stray and is now looking for his forever home. Some of the information contained in this biography includes approximations based on our expertise and is not guaranteed. Applicants must live no further than one hour from Cary NC as our dogs must be seen by a BFPA veterinarian for all medical care prior to adoptions being finalized. Our foster guardians deliver dogs to their new homes for adoption trials and we do home visits to finalize all adoptions. We therefore require applicants to live within an hours drive of Cary NC.\n\nINTERESTED IN ADOPTING SCOTTIE?

            "description": "Stella's DOB is 03/09/2020. She is shy at first but once she gets to know you, she is actually very loving and loyal. She's a huge cuddle bug and kisser with her humans, especially before bed and in the early mornings. Stella requires a strong, bully-breed savvy family. We recommend older children (13+) in the household or an adult only home and she must be the only pet in the household. She is really such a wiggle butt and a true puppy but we are on the search for the right home for her where she will continue to thrive. She is so affectionate and really will make a fabulous companion. She has medium energy meaning she does enjoy playing but once she's had her fill, she will go right back to you to chill out by your feet or even in your lap if you let her.\n\nIf interested in ADOPTING, please fill out an adoption application online:\nwww.hoperanchanimalsanctuary.org/adoption-application\n\nA copy of your application can be sent to us via email\n\nFor more information about Stella, please contact Kathy:\nCall/Text: (951) 515-4077\nEmail: k.haley.hope.ranch@gmail.com",

I can't really run, since I'm older and have arthritis, but I'll still make the effort! My bark is pretty quiet, so I won't disturb the neighbors. I'm a very sweet girl who would love a home with minimal stairs and lots of soft beds.\n\nI am currently on a prescription diet for kidney disease. While this can be a serious issue, but it also can be managed quite well with my new diet! This will be a lifelong diet and my future adopters will need to bring me to their vet multiple times per year to make sure I'm still in good health and continue my prescription.

            "description": "Meet \u201cMr. Life of the Party\u201d Kori, a 2 year old male Pit Bull/boxer mix.  He has a gorgeous orange brindle coat (looks like a tiger) with white markings. He is a nice medium size weighing 35 pounds and is solid strong muscle.  Kori was pulled from our local shelter where he had been picked up as a stray by Animal Control and down there for several weeks with no one coming to claim him.  Kori is a very energetic, fun-loving dog.  He will need lots of exercising so we think he would do best in a house environment with a fenced in yard.  \n\nHe would make a great running/walking partner.  Kori loves to play with his toys and is very social and friendly.  He should do fine with children 12 and older, not young cause he may jump up to say hi and perhaps knock them down.  Kori did well with the dogs he has been behavior tested with.  We have started on his crate training.  Kori is up to date on his vet care, neutered, heartworm negative and is microchipped.  He is on heartworm and flea/tick prevention.  Need some cheering up during these crazy times, then Kori is the one for you!!\n\n\nAll HSWA dogs are either at our Dog Adoption Facility or in foster homes. All dogs require an appointment to meet.  Please call us at 205-554-0011 or email humaneswa@yahoo.com to request an appointment to see the dog/puppy and to check availability.\n\nVisit us on Facebook! www.facebook.com/humaneswa\n\nOur adoption fee is $75.  Read more information on our adoption process at www.humanesocietyofwa.org/howtoadopt.html.  Then, if you feel your home might be the right forever home and you would like to adopt a dog, submit an online adoption application. The online applications may not work on mobile devices. If the online application does not work on your device, look to the right side of the forms page for a downloadable .PDF copy of the application.",

            "description": "Maggie has been with ARL since the end of 2019.  She is just over 3 years old.  She was adopted a few months after being at ARL but was brought back.  Then she was adopted again last year and brought back.  Maggie apparently survived distemper and it seems to have left her with some neurological problems.  She is so excited to see people.  There possibly could be a dog she would get along with, but maybe being a only dog might work better.  You just need to meet her and see if she's the dog for you.  No small children, Maggie just has so much energy and would be overwhelming to smaller children.  She just needs the right family to see her potential.  My adoption fee is $125 which includes my spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations,  heartworm disease test,  microchip/registration fee and collar .  ADOPT ME TODAY and find a friend for life!   And remember that adopting a pet is a life long commitment.",

She has been in our home for about two weeks and has already figured out her way around our downstairs and our backyard. In new situations and with new people she is a bit cautious, but once she has a chance to warm up, her feisty spirit shines through. She loves other dogs and my teenage son. She would probably do best in a home with older children and a dog friend. She will be finished with her vaccinations in two weeks and ready for adoption in time for Valentine's Day.

We are currently very busy! Please reach out to allaboardanimalrescue@gmail.com if you have an approved application on file! Please fill out an adoption application on our website if you are ready to adopt! \n\nThank you for your patience and understanding during this difficult time! We are on a mission to find everyone companions, we will continue to rescue dogs weekly! We update our page every Monday evening. We are not currently hosting any Petco adoption events for the public. We will be hosting meet/greet adoption appointments!\n\n\nBreed and size disclosure: As a rescue all of our dogs come to us from high-kill shelters or other rescues, so we do not get a lot of background or information on these dogs. We occasionally receive the mother with the puppies, but in most cases both parents are unknown. Because of this we do not know the full breeding of the dogs. We are required to list the dogs based on the breeds provided to us on their records, but they are all mixed breeds as far as we know, and we cannot guarantee the actual breeds of any of these dogs. Since the full breeding of the dogs is unknown we can also only give you an educated guess on the full-grown size of the dogs. All of the current information we have on the dogs is listed in their bio above. More information may be available at our adoption event, since a lot of the fosters turn in report cards on how the dog has done in their care when they drop them off. \n\nAdoption Process: If you are interested in adopting from us, the first step of our adoption process is to fill out an application online at http://aaanimalrescue.org/adoption_app.html. It takes us 24-48 hours to process your application and get back to you, via email. Applications turned in Friday afternoon or Saturday morning will not be processed since we are preparing for or at our adoption event. We do have applications on site at our events, but are not always able to approve them at that time and many of the dogs will already have holds on them, so we suggest you fill out an application prior to attending an adoption event. We can place a hold on one dog per approved applicant after a deposit fee has been received, please do not ask to hold a dog if you have not turned in an application and been approved, for the first hour of our adoption event, so that they can get the first chance to meet and hopefully adopt that dog. After the first hour of the event all dogs are available on a first come, first serve basis. If you already have an approved application on file, there will just be more paperwork and the adoption fee at the event, but you will be able to take home the dog/puppy that day. Since we are foster based and do not have a location, our dogs are only available to meet at our events, unless otherwise noted.",

She loves to snuggle, and is eager to please. Ditto has been through some training so she knows basic obedience skills. She is an active pup and would make a wonderful adventure companion for any lucky person! Ditto loves to get all of the attention from her humans, so she prefers to be the only pet in the home. She has so much love to give!! Ditto is house trained, spayed and up to date on vaccines. If this precious pup sounds like the perfect fit for you, email us at lasthoperescuefl@gmail.com! \n\n*THIS IS A COURTESY POST. This means this pet is not in our rescue. We are assisting with finding this pet a new home, in efforts to keep him/her out of the shelter! We do require an adoption application for courtesy posts, to help find the best match for the animal, in hopes that their new home will be FOREVER!*",

You can make an appointment to meet available dogs at our ADOPTION CENTER by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet and available cats at MEOW PALACE by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet1. \n\nFor animals in FOSTER homes, please submit an online application and an adoption team will reply with next steps. We thank you for your patience as we work to keep saving lives during this difficult time.\n\nPLEASE VISIT THIS WEBSITE TO FIND THE ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE: http://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-forms/\n\nLouie is a sweet 2-year-old Great Pyrenees who hails from rural VA. Louie is your typical Great Pyrenees who loves being outside and is very loyal and protective. He needs a home with a fenced in backyard (with at least a 4' fence) because this big boy has been known to be able to jump quite high. He's a super goofy boy but will need someone who understands his breed and is able to work with him on proper positive training to overcome some resource guarding (very common with the breed).\n\n Apply to adopt Louie today!\n\nAdoption Coordinator: Adoption Center\nLocation: Adoption Center\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $0. This fee includes spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\nWe also provide a free online workshop with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria/Falls Church/DC area. Start your new dog out on the right foot with this valuable, expert guidance FREE!\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program",

            "description": "Please note:  Rokey is being fostered in Iowa.  RAGOM's policy is that all family members along with resident dogs must travel to a foster's home if selected.\n\nPlease note,\u00a0RAGOM's adoption territory includes\u00a0Minnesota, Iowa, North and South Dakota, and western Wisconsin within 75 miles of the MN border.\u00a0\u00a0 At this time, we do not adopt out of our territory.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nRokey is truly a wonderful companion and a very bright and loving Goldendoodle. He is almost 6 years old, weighs 75 pounds and is bouncy, energetic, and extremely affectionate. He's the kind of dog that follows you around the house, waits for you outside a closed door, and does everything he can to keep you in his sights.\n\nRokey was lovingly returned to RAGOM by his original adopter who needed to take care of a family member and was no longer able to provide the care that he needs.  He was born with megaesophagus and very simply, that means that the muscles in his throat do not move the food to his stomach.\n\nHe eats his meals sitting upright in a special chair that allows gravity to do what his muscles can't.  He is fed regular kibble with water added so that it's a soupy mix\u2014he loves this stuff!  He is fed in his special chair and then he stays in the chair for about 20 minutes after each meal. He really wants a person there with him to keep him company.\n\nHe likes to be petted and sometimes the foster will do some simple combing of his fur while he's in the chair. After his upright time, he spends some quiet time in the house for a bit and then he's playing with the dogs, going for rides, and enjoying the regular routine.\n\nIf he's in the house, the fosters typically have him wear a pillow collar that keeps his head up. He knows all about this and wears it without problem. The goal is to get him to twice-a-day feedings, but right now three meals seems to work best for our household routine.\n\nHe is a tall boy who really enjoys playing with the foster's resident dogs: sometimes quietly playing in the house and other times playing chase in the backyard. He gets along with all of our resident dogs, both males and females.\n\nDue to his size, children in the home should be over 8 years old.\n\nThis sweet boy needs a good-sized fence to keep him safe. He has a history of escaping and could easily jump a low fence if he wanted. He is also very skilled at trying to dash out an open door\u2014like when you reach outside to bring in a box that was just delivered\u2014he's got his eyes open for those quick opportunities. \n\nTo learn more about Rokey, see his bio at: https://ragom.org/dogs/rokey-15-058\n\nPlacement Requirements:\nGood With Dogs: Yes\nGood With Cats: Yes\nGood With Kids:  8+\nFence: Physical fence required\nAge: 6\n\nIf you are interested in any of the dogs available at Retrieve a Golden of the Midwest (RAGOM), you can read our adoption process and apply to adopt, which can be found at https://ragom.org/our-adoption-process. RAGOM\u2019s adoption territory includes: Minnesota; Iowa; North Dakota; South Dakota; Western Wisconsin (within 75 miles of the Minnesota border)",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Annie!  I am a former Texas girl and they called me Granny back in the day but my foster family did not think that suited me as I am too energetic and playful.  I was picked up as a stray and was living on a property with a good Samaritan and the other rescued street dogs until I could get into rescue in Texas and finally to Wisconsin.  Initially I had some skin issues and sores but those have all been taken care of.  Next a had a whole lot of testing to make sure my organs were strong for a spay surgery.  Initially there was concern over my blood clotting ability and kidneys but repeated testing over time has proven with proper nutrition my body was able to get back on track and into the normal zone.  I will be spayed soon, then looking for my forever family.\n\n     My foster family is home much of the time and it turns out, that is the best future for me.  I love people and attention but especially like to see where foster mom is at all times.  I have been around lots of dogs in Texas and in Wisconsin and I am very playful.  I like to wrestle, run, and snuggle with other dogs.  I have been around dogs and people of all sized but I don't seem to know my size and love to curl up on everyone, big and small, so that is something to watch out for. I like to sleep in a dog pile but will also go find my own spot if I am too squished.\n\n     I have been a really fun addition to my foster home.  I can definitely run with my long legs and have plenty of energy left in me so a fenced yard would be very beneficial so i get my exercise in outdoors.  I love to go outside throughout the day but will bark to come in.  I am not as good at letting you know I want out so there were some accidents in the beginning but now mom takes me out whenever I get up from a nap or seem to be pacing about.  I do like to nap plenty during the day as well and can curl up into surprisingly small spaces.\n\n     I am strong and pull ahead on a leash, so the kids in the family cannot walk me.  We will be trying to switch to a gentle leader as I will pull on a collar until I sound raspy.  I do love walking with the family and like to walk with mom so I know where she is.  I am not as comfortable in the car though and try to sit on mom's lap when she drives.  We are working on that as I am lanky and do not make an ideal window.  I love food but with my height it is important not to leave food on the counter.  I used to eat like every meal was my last and though I have settled down some, I still eat alone as I scarf what I have a look for more.  I am currently on grain free fish based food and over the counter antihistamine as I was scratching my belly for a while.  I am not anymore but no one really knows why so I'm not sure if I need to stay on those things.  Initially I would try to grab paper or toilet paper to chew up, which is likely I sign that I was often hungry in my past.  Now  I love chewing on toys and bones and that also keeps me busy. \n\n     That's kind of the basics.  I'm a pretty typical coonhound gal with plenty of goofy quirks that make me the loveable, long legged hound dog that I am.  If you think I may be the hound you need, you can fill out the adoption application under the Adoption heading on our website www.bassetbuddiesrescue.org and a volunteer will reach out to you.  \n",

His favorite thing to do is snuggle in your lap, followed by giving kisses and nibbling on your face. He is a true velcro dog who would love a family who is home often or willing to take him with them if they are out a lot. Little Man is great with other dogs (and cats!) and enjoys a daily play session. He\u2019s easily excited and will dance for almost anything. We recommend a home with teenagers or no kids at all due to his small size. Little Man does great on a leash and in the car. He is a typical Chihuahua who is still working on house training but he does fairly well when he is able to go out often. He has the cutest little bark and tends to use his voice when left alone. We believe that he may have some allergies and is currently taking medications to help. If you love Little Man as much as we do, please apply at www.milehighcanine.org! He is in foster in Fort Collins and his adoption fee is $350. REQUIREMENTS: Lap/bed/couch privileges Family who is home often or will take him out with them (but not leave him in the car alone) Kids teenage+ or no kids due to his small size  You can apply for Little Man at https://milehighcanine.org/forms-and-applications/mhcr-adoption-application/.",
