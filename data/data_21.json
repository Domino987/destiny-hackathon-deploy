Cooper is a 5-6 month old American Staffy blend that is currently a free agent looking to get his start with an amazing team willing to take in a Rookie. He has spent the last month in training camp with the Holthus team where he has picked up the basic skills needed to contribute to his next team. He may play hard but don't be fooled this kids a lover including his love for all things comfortable.  \nHe has requested to go to a team with an indoor arena and would not be successful at a team like Green Bay due to his aversion to cold weather. He has a real love for food and has not missed a meal while working on bulking up for his future linebacker roll.  With that being said he is also a food thief and will finish off others plates if they are not as speedy as him which has lead the team to encourage him to eat alone. \nAlthough he is very energetic when he is on the field he also has a very strict 9pm bed time. He is mostly trained to used the outdoor facilities but is known for the occasional accident if its too cold out.  Cooper enjoys walking the track and knows how to kennel up outside of practice time. He'll need a little refining but has a rare upside and can be a starter from day one.",

Because I can get rambunctious and am still learning some manners, I would be best suited for an adult only home at this time. If you already have another dog at home, you'll need to bring them to the shelter for an introduction prior to adoption.\n\nIf you're interested in adopting me, please contact the East County Animal Shelter at 925-803-7040.",

He is quick to make new people friends and is both a cuddle bug and a race around doing zoomies kind of guy.

Fencing required and no small kids, please, as Chester is a bit too jumpy for little ones.\nDOGS:\n\nThe first step of our adoption process for dogs is to fill out our \"\" interested party application\"\" form online at this link \n\nhttps://service.sheltermanager.com/asmservice?account=ac0662&method=online_form_html&formid=12\n\n\nCATS:\n\nFor more information on our cats please send an email to cats@vipp.org\n\nPlease note we are an all-volunteer organization and it may take us several days to respond.",

He is so friendly, loves other dogs and people, will smile at you and just wants to belong to his forever family.\n\nRig is a mastiff/cane corso mix we believe, is around two years old, is neutered and updated on his vaccinations, is great on a leash, house trained 100% and is not destructive at ALL.  He is goofy, and playful, and loves to run to you and walk with you.  He will greet you with all the wiggles and kisses you can stand.  And he's NOT drooly.  \n\nIf you have a place in your heart and home and could let this guy come steal your couch, please call or text Lori at 405-620-2411.  You will fall in love with this big old knuckle head. .  Come meet him.  You'll see the sweet smile in his eyes and will want him for your very own.\n\nAdoption fee is $150",

            "description": "Meet Doughboy. Born approximately November 2020, he is super cute and sweet and loves everyone he meets. He is curious, bouncy, and fun but also loves to be cuddled.\n\nThere is a lot for a puppy to learn, so he will need to find a home where someone is very available to him in these early days. He loves the companionship of other animals and requires another dog to act as his mentor as he continues to understand his new world's rules.\n\nCurrently, his Foster family is teaching him the difference between his toys and others' prized possessions. This cute little boy is not going to be little for long. Now is the best time to jump in and continue mentoring him. It is going to be so fun watching him fill out and fit into those big paws. Please complete an Adoption Application. Doughboy is only available for adoption in WA.\n\nPUPPIES ARE ONLY PLACED IN HOMES WITH YOUTHFUL, PLAYFUL RESIDENT DOGS.\n\nOur requirements for puppy adoption are simple and necessary.\n\nOur puppies are not livestock guardians, they are family pets that live inside the family home.\n\nPuppies must be placed in homes with a youthful, adult resident dog of similar size. This gives the puppy a mentor and a solid foundation for becoming part of the family.\n\nPuppies are only adopted to homes with someone at home at least part of the day. If no one is home for 6-8 hours at a time, please do not apply.\n\nPreference is always given to those with Great Pyrenees experience.\n\nApplicants must have secure, visible fencing and a socialization plan in place.\n\nThe fastest way to be considered for a puppy is to fill out an application. Adoption is not first come, first served. GPRS and its fosters work diligently to find the right fit for each and every unique dog and puppy.\n\nApplicant's personal pets must be current on vaccines & heartworm/flea prevention and be altered.\n\nAdoption Fee: $450 (Adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm test, rabies, distemper, parvo and health certificate for travel). Northwest adopters pay the cost of transport to independent transport service ($225). Adoption applications can be found on our website at\n\nhttps://www.greatpyreneesrescuesociety.org/\n\nADOPTION, FOSTERING, AND DONATIONS are just some of the ways you can help a rescued dog. We have worked hard to cultivate a large network of volunteers to save this majestic breed. While monetary donations are always much appreciated, you can also help by donating your time as a GPRS foster or volunteer!",

At his young but adult age, he can hold his bladder like a champ and absolutely loves to cuddle with you. He doesn't have a mean bone in his body. He loves all dogs and humans. We don't know how he is with cats or kids.\n\nHe would make for an excellent addition to any family and enjoy family hikes or Netflix marathons.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Bagel please submit an inquiry directly with Greater Charlotte SPCA by visiting charlottespca.org/adopt.\n\n***Because our rescue is composed entirely of volunteers and we require a home check for each of our adoptable pets prior to them going to their new homes, local applications will take precedence. We will accept out of town applications, but any family further than 60 miles from Charlotte is responsible for finding a representative of a rescue local to them that is willing to perform the home check. All out of town applicants will also have to be willing to drive to Charlotte to meet/pick up the pet as soon as the application is approved.***",

It seems brindle was too Energetic and would take long runs around town Visiting all the neighborhoods. Brindle Is an absolutely stunning girl. She looks like a mix between a German Shepherd and a greyhound. She's good with dogs ( We wouldn't suggest little dogs as she can play a little rough with the little ones) and kids (likes to jump on kids in excitement. She LOVES water and would love to splash around in someone pool! This girl got some energy And will need a home that is active ( Even someone looking for a running or super walking partner)! This is what the foster has to say about her:\nBrin loves everyone she meets. She is very friendly and tries to give everyone hugs. While she walks good on a leash, she does like to stop and smell a lot. If she sees another dog, she will have a tendency to pull on the leash a lot and bark trying to get them to play.\nShe would do well with a home that can give her plenty of exercise and work on her house training. She will need a backyard with a 6 foot fence (as she only likes to potty in fenced yard). She is crated at night and does well with that. She enjoys people and being active.",

My name is Keller and it's good to meet ya.\nI'm a pretty easy going gal who's looking for a family that likes relaxing and taking it easy. If I had to describe myself in one word, it would be Snugglebug, and although meeting new places and people can give me some anxiety at first, if you're able to let me get comfortable and move at my own pace I think you'll find that I'm quite a playful and affectionate gal.\nI do prefer the company of adults rather than children since the unpredictability, noise, and hectic behavior of human-pups can stress me out a little. That being said, I am a wonderful dog for an all adult home and you won't regret taking a chance on me.\nLet me tell you some things about myself...\nI enjoy a game of fetch now and again.I like to chew on bones!I have lived with many dogs before. I am able to co-exist with other dogs well, and even like playing sometimes. I would also be more than happy to be the only dog in my home.I know loads of commands and will happily show them off for a treat or two!I am able to stay out free in the home while you are gone and I promise I won't touch anything that's not mine!I can be a bit sassy and pushy sometimes but a dog-savvy owner will know that mygreatest desire in life is to please you, so all you have to do is tell me what you want from me.Now that you know a little about me, let me tell you about the home I'm looking for.\nI'm going to need a home without any children. It's nothing against youngsters, I just feel I'll live my best life among other adults.I do like to bark at unfamiliar noises so I can keep the family safe. An apartment might not be the best place for me because of that. If you tell me to stop barking though, I will.A fenced yard is always nice for a dog but not a necessity for an older, chill girl like me.A home with lots of love, food and attention - but maybe that goes without saying?I hope you ask to meet me soon!\nLove,\nKeller\nAdoption Requirements;\nTo ensure everyone in Keller's life is safe and comfortable, she is eligible to go to a home with humans 16 years and older.Keller must meet all dogs in her future home.Keller is currently living in a foster home. If you would like to meet her or have questions, please email foster@greatplainsspca.org. ...",

We are looking for a family to adopt us together.\nSecond, lets dive in to more about ME! Im a 9-year-old Shepherd/Chinese Shar-Pei mix! What a combo. I can be a little shy when you first meet me, but being with my pal Goldie helps me feel more comfortable. Once you get to know me, youll see that Im bursting with personality and like to talk, talk, talk. Im eager to go for walks and would love a yard to explore in, and Ive definitely got more energy than Goldie, who is more of a couch potato! I hope we can work on expending my energy and training when you take me home, too!\nObviously, I get along well with Goldie, but you should know I am friendly with other dogs too! Even though Im on the more mature side, I initiate play with other dogs by doing play bows.\nGoldie and I have been down on our luck since our previous owner passed away. What do you say, take a chance on a wonderful pair like us?!\nLove,\nSonny\nRequirements:\nTo ensure that Sonny and the children in your life are both safe and comfortable, Sonny must meet all children in the home prior to being adopted.Sonny and Goldie are a bonded pair and must be adopted together.

I came to Great Plains after being found as a stray in Arkansas. I'm glad to be in a safe and loving place now but also loved doing all kinds of outdoor things that Arkansas offered: hiking, exploring, you name it! I also like to cuddle inside once I'm tuckered out.\nI was scared when I got to Great Plains - I experienced a lot of transition in just a few days! Since I was stressed at the shelter I got to go to a foster home and have a nice foster mom help me feel better. I still get scared sometimes but have met quite a few new people and they weren't so scary!\nI'd love a home that can be understanding that I can get scared sometimes. In fact, I might make a good guard dog for that very reason!\nMy foster mom wants you to know:\nI now ride pretty well in the carI do not try to jump fencesI like to play with toysI am mostly house broken (but may have the occasional accident if you don't notice I need to go outside)I am getting better at walking on leash without pulling!She has taught me how to \"sit\" and lay \"down\" on command, we are still working on \"fetch\".I am used to getting in my kennel at night on my own.I would benifit from structure and positive reinforcment.Would thrive in a quieter environment where I can build trust and confidence.I am such a smart boy and would love to learn even more things about the world with you. Please ask to meet me soon!\nAdoption Requirements:\nTo ensure Max and the people in his life are safe and comfortable, Max is eligible to go to a home with humans 16 years and older.Max would do best as an only-pet.**I am currently living in a foster home. Please email foster@greatplainsspca.org if you are interested in meeting me or have questions.**\n ...",

PLUS, Im a well behaved girl.\nIm a 1-year-old American Bulldog mix! I weigh about 60 pounds and every ounce of me is filled with spunk and adoration for my favorite people. I adore humans big and small.\nI was rescued by Great Plains SPCA's outreach team after being abandoned out in a yard for over a month. Phew, am I glad to be an inside dog again! Despite these circumstances, I am a friendly girl (sometimes I take a minute or two to warm up!), am eager to please, love to cuddle and am super affectionate. I am happy to greet you and will even try to get my big old body right in your lap!\nI do love play time and will even toss toys around myself! I am still a young girl with lots to learn (already know sit and shake with both paws)so I may get into mischief like trying to chew on things that arent toys. But hey, just teach me the way and Ill learn real fast and basically, I already have told you Im a quick learner! If I get plenty of exercise and mental stimulation, I'll be the best girl! I rarely have accidents inside if I am taken out regularly!\nI walk nicely on a leash! Well, unless I see other dogs. Im a bit of a diva in that way, I am reactive when I see other dogs and definitely want the spotlight to be all on me in my forever home.\nI gotto live in a foster home for afew weeks and it waswonderful! When foster mom would leave the house, I got to stay gated in a room and I wasa very good girl. Sometimes she would bring small humans over to play with me and we had a blast! Maybe you have some small humans I could play with? I hope they like having their faces licked because that's my second favorite thing after playing! Then at night you and I can cuddle and watch TV while the little ones are sleeping. All rave about my cuddling skills.\nFriendly, goofy, lovable, thats me! Hope to meet you soon!\nLove,\nTwist\nRequirements:\n Twist and other animals dont always get along. To ensure a safe, manageable home for all family members, Twistis not safe to be in a home with any other pets.\n\n ...",

I adore my people and want to be with you wherever you go. Ill be happy to take a nap or binge watch your favorite TV show with you! As long as I have a human who loves me and a comfy spot, Im happy! Dont get me wrong, I love to explore out on walks, too. I walk great on a leash and enjoy taking in the sights and smells.\nSo youre hooked and want to know more?! Im housetrained, know come and sit and think I would do just find around kiddos. Im pretty gentle and sometimes a little on the shy side, but my confidence is really starting to shine as I spend more time with the humans here. I also love a good treat, so Im sure we could learn more things together as long as treats are involved! As far as other dogs, Ive had a few pups in my past and lived with them, but Im definitely more of a coexister than a player. I wouldnt mind a calm doggie friend.\nI have been pretty restless in my kennel at the shelter, sometimes I bark and whine. Like I said, I just want to be near you. People-loving, sweet and gentle. Thats me! I hope to see you real soon.\nLove,\nSarah\n ...",

Please email foster@greatplainsspca.org if you are interested in meeting me or ave questions.**\nIm a happy-go-lucky 5-year-old boy. I enjoy meeting new people and long walks on the beach. Looking for my perfect match, could that be you?! Read on!\nI know sit and come and am treat motivated and could surely learn more. I walk nicely on a leash but may get a little vocal if I see other pups. Thats just because I want to play! Having a canine sibling would be cool. My favorite game to play is tug! I share toys nicely with my humans because Im a polite boy! I have energy to spare and will benefit from keeping my mind busy with things like puzzle toys. I tend to be on the more anxious side, so providing outlets like puzzle toys, games and play time will be a huge help to me.\nIll thrive in a home with older kiddos due to my energetic and sometimes anxious nature. Ive been in and out of the shelter a few times in my life, but Im ready to end that streak! I am housetrained and have pretty darn good house manners if I do say so myself. I love to be around my people and am an excellent cuddler!\nHope to meet you soon,\nMichael\nRequirements:\nTo ensure that Michaeland the children in your life are both safe and comfortable, MIchaelis eligible to go home with children 5 and older and must meet all children in the family prior to being adopted.\n**I am currently living in a foster home.

At times I could be forward and excitable when meeting other doggy friends, so I could really benefit in getting trained to develop better skills and manners when interacting with other dogs. I just really enjoy meeting new people and making new friends, so sometimes I can't help but contain my joy and excitement! Would you like to be my new best friend?\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about me, please email a completed application, found on our website, to Adoptions@eastbayspca.org; and mention me by name!

He would do best in a home with older kids as he is jumpy. He is heartworm negative, up to date on preventatives, neutered and up to date on vaccines.\n\nHe is part of our foster to adopt program. The rescue will cover his getting vetted by our veterinarians during the foster period. If it is a love connection the foster gets first dibs to adopt. Please fill out an application if you are interested in fostering him. Typically the adoption fee is $380 but if you foster and decide to adopt we show our gratitude by providing a $50 discount plus his vetting.\n\nPlease do not send inquiries asking if animals are still available, if you see it online, that means it is.  We only post available animals.  In order to adopt one of our puppies or dogs, an application must be filled out prior to Being invited to meet the dog.\n\nPlease note that these animals in most cases are abandoned and therefore breeds and sizes are our best estimates based on years of experience.  Many times we do not know the parents, so we are guessing.  If you are looking for a specific breed or size maybe rescue is not for you, it is very possible you will adopt a puppy we say will be medium size and the pup may be smaller than estimated or may be larger than estimated.  We do our best but many times we are wrong so please beware of this before rescuing from us.",

            "description": "Sarge is a friendly 1 and half year old Mastiff. Currently, he weighs in at 82 pounds. He has a very kind demeanor and is gentle in his interaction with people. He is submissive when playing with other animals and would love a home with a furry brother or sister. He lives in a foster home with 4 dogs and 2 cats. He has been a popular guy amongst them since settling in. He is in the process of learning basic obedience and overall doggy manners - leash pulling, barking at people passing by, potty training, jumping, counter surfing and crate training. He is a medium energy level dog who would be fine with a couple short walks and a game of fetch each day. He is working on a fear of stairs and is slowly starting to understand going in and out of doors. This leads us to believe he was likely not kept inside prior to coming to WI. Due to his size, we ask that his new family not have children under the age of 13. Ideally his forever home would have a fenced in yard for him to safely tromp around in.",

I am working on house training and leash training.  I could not be happier to be living in a real home after being rescued living by an abandoned house.  I am shy with new people at first, but once I get to know you, watch out!  I love to play with other dogs and I have a lot of energy!  I also love stuffed animals and bully sticks.  I need a home would have another dog, a fenced yard and parents that are home a lot!  I would like a family that has the time to provide me with the training and love that every puppy needs to grow into an amazing companion.  No children under ten, no apartments and must have another dog.  Email doggymomma5@gmail.com for more information and an application.",

            "description": "Paul McCartney is a 5 month old hound mix who weighs 40 pounds. He is very easy going and gets along well with other dogs. Paul is a little shy with people at first, but warms up quickly. He loves playing outside and is working on his house training and manners. He is up to date on shots and will be neutered soon.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Paul McCartney please submit an inquiry directly with Greater Charlotte SPCA by visiting charlottespca.org/adopt.\n\n***Because our rescue is composed entirely of volunteers and we require a home check for each of our adoptable pets prior to them going to their new homes, local applications will take precedence. We will accept out of town applications, but any family further than 60 miles from Charlotte is responsible for finding a representative of a rescue local to them that is willing to perform the home check. All out of town applicants will also have to be willing to drive to Charlotte to meet/pick up the pet as soon as the application is approved.***",

He can be dominant with other dogs so a meet and greet is required.  We prefer he goes to someone with Husky experience as they are a unique breed of dog that need owners that understand their needs and energy level.\n\nDice is current on shots, licensed and microchipped. All dogs over 6 months have been heartworm tested, and all dogs are treated monthly for fleas/ticks (Nexgard or Frontline Gold) and are on Heartworm prevention (Heartgard Plus). All pets are spayed/neutered prior to adoption. All our dogs are temperament tested and \"should\" like dogs, cats, and kids unless noted. WE HAVE MORE PETS IN THE SHELTER THAT ARE NOT ON PETFINDER.

To apply read about our adoption policies\nhere\nto fill out an application.\nHello great friends of CARA. My name is Vashti, named after a Persian Queen. Everyone loves me here at CARA, but I have been kind of sad since I have arrived. My family loved me so dearly, but I did not get along with the small dogs in the home. For that reason, I need to be the only fur baby in the home for the rest of my life. If you think that you are ok with that, and that you would love me, and spoil me like I deserve please put in an application. Once it is approved we can set up a meet n greet. Breed experience is a must for me, for my benefit.To see more animals for adoption, please visit the CARA Website\n\nOur adoption fees are:\nDogs: $155\nCats: $95\nPuppies under 4 months: $115 plus S/N Deposit: $100\nKittens under 4 months: $70 plus S/N Deposit: $100\n\nAll pets available for adoption have been spayed or neutered (unless under 4 months please read about our adoptions\nhere\n), are current on vaccinations and preventatives, and micro-chipped. Cats have been tested and confirmed negative for Feline AIDS and Leukemia. Dogs have been tested for heartworm disease.\n\nOur shelter is located at 42 Deep River Rd in Sanford and is open Tues, Thurs, & Fri from 3pm - 7pm & Sat from 10-2pm (other times available by appointment). CARA's adoption process and online application can be found at\nhttp://www.cara-nc.org/info/adoption\n\nPlease call 919-774-9433, email adoptions@cara-nc.org, or visit www.cara-nc.org for information about this or other pets available for adoption.\n\nIf you would like to adopt me or any of my friends, please visit CARA to fill out an on-line application or e-mail us at adoptions@cara-nc.org.\n\nEvery animal that comes into the CARA program is here because one or more events occurred that led to this animal needing not only a home, but a person or family to love and protect them. Each animal has been loved and cared for by a small and determined group of people who want nothing more than to know each animal is safe for the rest of his or her life. Thank you for looking to adopt!",

He is an intelligent 6.5 year old, 65-pound hound mix located in Lowell, MA. He is neutered, up-to-date on his vaccines, and in great health. He has been in foster care for the past 7 months and is looking for a family to give him as much love as he will give to them.\n\nCliff is an all-around goof ball whose antics will brighten your every day. He bounces around the house, wiggling and wagging, and constantly has a smile on his face. He truly loves life and is interested in everything.\n\nCliff loves going for walks, hiking through the woods, swimming, and playing around with all his toys at home. If you want to do it, Cliff does too. Though he may be quite active, he is also a huge lounger. He will make himself comfy wherever you let him: on his bed, your bed, or a pile of blankets he makes into a bed!\n\nCliff has a few specific needs in his new home to ensure his long-term success. He is best suited for a calmer environment as the only pet and no children under 13. He likes his humans to be predictable and trustworthy, with no surprises. Since he loves to be outdoors running around, he would benefit from active adopters and preferably a single-family home with a fenced-in yard.\nCliff has had a rough go of it over the years. He suffers from anxiety which can get the better of him at times. He has nipped on a few occasions, and though no medical attention was required, Cliff needs a patient and experienced owner who understands body language. His foster will explain Cliff\u2019s telltale signs and guide you through the training strategies that work to curb his behavior. \n\nAre you looking for a wonderful dog, full of personality and life?  If you are willing to open your heart to Cliff, he will return the favor ten-fold.

They are about 6 years old and very sweet. They get along well with other dogs and cats. Their owner is older and no longer to care for them.\n\nThey are part of our foster to adopt program. The rescue will cover her getting vetted by our veterinarians during the foster period. If it is a love connection the foster gets first dibs to adopt. Please fill out an application if you are interested in fostering them.  Typically the adoption fee for both dogs would be $600 but if you foster and decide to adopt we show our gratitude by providing a $100 discount for fostering and a $50 discount for adopting both Together plus their vetting.\n\n\nPlease do not send inquiries asking if animals are still available, if you see it online, that means it is.  We only post available animals.  In order to adopt one of our puppies or dogs, an application must be filled out prior to being invited to meet the dog.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nPlease note that these animals in most cases are abandoned and therefore breeds and sizes are our best estimates based on years of experience.  Many times we do not know the parents, so we are guessing.  If you are looking for a specific breed or size maybe rescue is not for you, it is very possible you will adopt a puppy we say will be medium size and the pup may be smaller than estimated or may be larger than estimated.  We do our best but many times we are wrong so please beware of this before rescuing from us.",

            "description": "Banshee is a 10-week-old mixed breed rescued from a high-kill shelter. This dog is current on vaccinations, microchipped, and spayed/neutered. This puppy is currently in foster care learning home etiquette, kennel training, and housebreaking. We would love for you to meet this puppy and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: While we typically host weekly Saturday adoption events, in order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment and/or adoption handoff. Appointments and handoffs are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, adoption appointments and handoffs are only offered for individual animals. When adopting at an appointment, please be aware that you will be taking the animal home that day. We can not hold animals to be picked up at a later date.\n\nDue to CDC's recommended COVID-19 protocols, we are highly encouraging foster homes and adopters to speak with one another via phone or video chat to ensure compatible matches and limit in-person contact. If meeting in person, our foster homes are encouraged to wear masks, socially distance, and choose an outdoor meeting spot. Should you want to proceed forward with the adoption, all adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees are to be completed electronically. Quick and low-contact animal handoff is also being encouraged amongst foster homes and adopters. As always, we include a one-week trial period with all our adoptions.\u00a0***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption!

A handsome 6-month old boy making the most of his second shot at life.   Poor Gru was found abandoned near a construction site in East TN just before Christmas.  Emaciated and weak, he could barely stand.  He was taken in by the local animal shelter and went to the vet for fluids and treatment.  Gru had the fortune to be taken into foster care by a member of the vet team, then was transferred into our rescue and another loving foster family has been caring for him since.  He has been gaining weight, strength, and confidence over the past month, and it is time for him to finally be placed into his forever home!\n\nGru is polite and has picked up many basic obedience commands quickly, and will learn new tricks for treats.  He has even learned to shake with one paw and give a high-five with the other!  He also knows down and is working on stay.  Gru loves to play and is especially fond of tug of war with ropes.  He is FANTASTIC with other playful dogs and cats!!  Routinely goes potty outside (although he is still young and learning).  An eager to please, super smart, and handsome boy!  He is an affectionate boy that wants to snuggle with his people and furry siblings all the time.\n\nWe have a few things that are \u201cmust haves\u201d in Gru\u2019s forever home.  He does not like to be left alone for very long, so we are looking for the perfect family fit! Do you have what he needs? --- \n\n-He MUST be an inside family dog with supervised outside time or leash walks.  \n-He MUST have family members that are either working from home or are retired so he can assist with all office duties and puttering around the house routines.  He wants to be with his people!\n-He MUST have a family without small children.  Only those with kids 13+ should inquire please (small kids make him nervous, and he is still getting past having food aggressive tendencies due to being starved). \n-He MUST have a patient family that is willing to take it slow when first meeting him.  And the family must also understand that it may take more than one meeting to get him comfortable.  Strangers still make him nervous and grumbly.  His foster family is working to help him overcome this fear, but it will still take time.\n-He MUST have another doggie friend in the home!  Gru thrives with another friendly doggie that will play and show him the ropes in his new home.  \n\nCould you be the family Gru would like to call his own?  Please email Amanda, at pawsofvalor.ar@gmail.com to request an adoption application. \n \nOur adoption fee for local (East TN) residents is $150.  This fee includes:  Spay/neuter, microchip, up-to-date DA(H)PP vaccines, bordatella (kennel cough) vaccine, rabies vaccine (12-weeks and older),  heartworm test (6 months or older), deworming(s), and up to date flea/tick/heartworm prevention.\n\nVet references, personal references, and home visits may be also be required prior to adoption.  Completion of an adoption application does not guarantee adoption. \n",

Brett sleeps in a crate at night and is well on his way to being potty trained! He loves kids and other dogs. We don't have any cats, but he would probably be great if properly introduced.\n\nTo set up a meet and greet or inquire about a dog, please first fill out an application at https://savinghoperescue.org/contact. It doesn't obligate you, but it is the first step. We don't get to all of the inquiries but respond to all applications. Thank you for choosing to rescue!",

I am bouncy, playful, and love to play fetch! I am great with people of all ages, children included! I have been an indoor dog since puppyhood, so my manners are pretty good. I also enjoy chew toys and tug-o-war ropes. I have lived with 4 cats and got along great! I also lived with another large dog and we played all the time. I am a typical lab which means I am always happy and learn quickly. \n\nPlease note:\n- Our website (www.neenahanimalshelter.org) is updated in real time, so we are accepting applications for all animals that are currently listed.\n-Applications can be downloaded from our website. (http://neenahanimalshelter.org/how-to-adopt.html)\n- Our shelter no longer has open visiting hours, so a pre-approved application and scheduled appointment is needed prior to meeting any of our animals.",

He loves treats and back rubs. Rolling around in a sunny yard is another delight.. He is loving to his people and enjoys soft places to cuddle up.

I will follow you around the house looking for affection. I will entrance you with my beautiful blue eyes! How can you resist? I'm extremely submissive and get along fine with all other dogs and cats in the house. I've never shown any aggression; but I startle and scare easily, so a household without young children would be best. I have used a doggy door in the past and did pretty well with that arrangement. However, my current home doesn't have a doggy door, so I am trying to learn to wait until we go outside to do my business. I am a work in progress in that regard. While learning, I do wear a belly band inside and it will go with me to my new home. I do sometimes tinkle if scared or startled, so I will need a new owner that's very patient, doesn't raise their voice at all, and has time to take me outside often until I get the hang of things. I stay in my crate during the day and sleep with foster mom at night. I wear my belly band at night, but have never wet it while sleeping. \nNow something you should know about me is that I have a heart murmur. I have three different medications that I take, but my medication has been paid for up through the end of 2021 by my previous owner. I will also need to be on a canned food diet as I can't chew kibble well anymore. The homestyle chicken or turkey dog food is my favorite and I take my pills enthusiastically when they are inside my favorite treat... chicken meatballs. Yum! \nAll in all, I'm a wonderful boy and would sure love to find my forever family. Could that be you?\nIf you would like to meet me, fill out an application and the Bella staff will arrange it.",

My name is\n\nCarbie!\nI am a\n\nsweet\n\nyoung pup around 2 years old that loves people and other dogs\n\n.\n\nIt sure didn't take long for my foster family to fall in love with me!\n\nAt my foster home I have two foster brothers and I love to play with them. I also love to play ball\n\n;\n\nmy foster plays ball with me all of the time. I am working on potty training and doing\n\nreally\n\nwell. I am not a huge fan of the snow\n\n,\n\nhowever\n\n,\n\nand I like to get my business done quick outside. I would do best in a home where someone\n\nis\n\nhome quite a bit, because I don\n\n'\n\nt like my kennel.\n\nIn the future, I probably won't need one at all.\n\nAlso, having a family that is very active or a family with some dog siblings for me to play\n\nwith\n\nwould\n\nhelp to\n\nkeep me entertained and busy. I don't know any tricks yet, but I am learning sit and come right now and doing well with it\n\n; I especially love that I get treats when it sit!\n\nI love cuddles so much, so I sleep with my foster on her bed and I am doing really good with it.\n\nNo nighttime accidents or destruction, which makes my foster family happy.\n\nI also love to give kisses to everyone, although I am a bit shy at first\n\n,\n\nI warm up to people pretty quick\n\nly\n\n. My foster says I\n\nmight be\n\na bit too much for little kid\n\ns since I am such a strong girl, but I am working to mind my manners\n\n. Do you think I am a good fit for you? I can't wait to find my forever home!\n\nAdoption fee includes: Full veterinary exam, alter, prepaid microchip, dewormed, Rabies vaccine, DAPP vaccine, Bordetella vaccine, 4DX\n\n, flea/tick and heartworm preventative while in rescue.

They are both house trained. They adore each other and both love affection. They are currently living at Bowzee Wowzee Pet Lodge in Ft. Mill, SC, being loved and care for by the amazing staff there! Nola may be on the older side, but she has lots of pep in her step and acts much younger than 13!\n\nCowboy and Nola must be adopted together.  If you are interested in adopting Cowboy and Nola, please visit the Adoption Process page on our website \u2013 http://carolinasrescue.com/Adoption_Process.html.

            "description": "Olive is a very rare breed found in the North called Hangin Tree Cowdog which consists of the  combination of 4 breeds:\n\u2022\t3/8 Border Collie for their intense herding instinct and intelligence.\n\u2022\t1/8 Catahoula for the ability to trail and find cattle, also for their toughness and slick hair coat.\n\u2022\t1/4 Kelpie for endurance and also herding instinct and short hair.\n\u2022\t1/4 Australian Shepherd\n\nVideos of Olive:\nhttps://youtu.be/GdVDc0LPwpc\nhttps://youtu.be/S1BcTQUSC0E\nhttps://youtu.be/-UTQWvt4QK4\n\nOlive will be happy with a family that can keep her active by going hiking, running, lots of walks, swimming. Olive would do great doing agility. This breed needs a lot of exercise and mental stimulation to keep happy. \nShe truly is a happy girl who always has a smile on her face.\n\nOlive has been around horses and respects them. She has lived with other dogs and has done great with them. She likes to chase cats and squirrels. Even though she has been around children age 2 to 11 years old and has done great with them, we prefer to place Olive in an adult only home or with kids age 14 and older. \nOlive can be nervous with lots of commotion going on at a home with lots of people coming and going. She would do best in a home that is on the quieter side and more stable with a predictable routine. \nShe may be unsure around strangers and slow introductions are highly recommended.\nOlive is not a good first time dog. She would do better with an experienced dog owner who has knowledge of herding breed traits and temperament. Someone who knows how to keep them mentally and physically challenged.\n\nOlive is house-trained. She is spayed, micro-chipped, up to date on vaccines and flea/tick and heartworm prevention.\nOlive is beautiful with a nice chocolate brown colored coat and the most stunning green eyes.\nHer tail is docked. Olive is 2 years and 4 months old and weighs 40 lbs. \n\nPlease send an email to NeedfulSoulsDogRescue@gmail.com and request an application.",

This breed needs a lot of exercise and mental stimulation to keep happy. \nShe truly is a happy girl who always has a smile on her face.\n\nOlive has been around horses and respects them. She has lived with other dogs and has done great with them. She likes to chase cats and squirrels. Even though she has been around children age 2 to 11 years old and has done great with them, we prefer to place Olive in an adult only home or with kids age 14 and older. \nOlive can be nervous with lots of commotion going on at a home with lots of people coming and going. She would do best in a home that is on the quieter side and more stable with a predictable routine. \nShe may be unsure around strangers and slow introductions are highly recommended.\nOlive is not a good first time dog. She would do better with an experienced dog owner who has knowledge of herding breed traits and temperament. Someone who knows how to keep them mentally and physically challenged.\n\nOlive is house-trained. She is spayed, micro-chipped, up to date on vaccines and flea/tick and heartworm prevention.\nOlive is beautiful with a nice chocolate brown colored coat and the most stunning green eyes.\nHer tail is docked. Olive is 2 years and 4 months old and weighs 40 lbs. \n\nPlease send an email to NeedfulSoulsDogRescue@gmail.com and request an application.",

She has tons of energy, she can jump a fence and let's get the bad news over at once, she can tear up some toys with the best.  But she isn't a bad girl, she just needs somebody to set some boundaries for her train her and reign in her or take her on runs and wear her out!    She is a dominant player so a meet n greet is required.  She knows lots of commands and really does great with kids.  Her previous owner said she is housebroke and crate trained.  Skyy would love a forever home, she just needs someone with patience and understanding.  Is that you?  Come meet Skyy.\n\nSkyy is current on shots, licensed and microchipped. All dogs over 6 months have been heartworm tested, and all dogs are treated monthly for fleas/ticks (Nexgard or Frontline Gold) and are on Heartworm prevention (Heartgard Plus). All pets are spayed/neutered prior to adoption. All our dogs are temperament tested and \"should\" like dogs, cats, and kids unless noted. WE HAVE MORE PETS IN THE SHELTER THAT ARE NOT ON PETFINDER. Call with the pet's name and ID if you have questions on this pet. Save time, print out and bring our Pre-Adoption Form.",

Needs Fence\n\nLocation: Salt Lake City, UT\n\nEmail Address: Michael Barlow at barlowfamily220@msn.com\n\nPhone: 801-550-4138\n\nOnline Adoption Application: www.americanbrittanyrescue.org or http://fs20.formsite.com/brittanyrescue/form10/index.html\n\nDog Story\nWillow is a lovely 3.5 year old, looking for a loving and active fur-ever home. She was surrendered to ABR by her owner who did not have the time to dedicate to her, and wanted her to have a chance at a life that better suited her needs. \n\nWillow gets along great with other dogs! We will continue to update her profile as we learn more about her personality. She DOES NOT like being crated, and WILL destroy a crate. We think with adequate exercise and attention she will settle into her fur-ever home and make a beautiful addition to the right family.\n\nAll serious inquiries MUST submit an adoption application  and also be able to come to Utah to meet Willow and take her to her new home. We do not operate on a first come-first serve basis, but rather take the time to find the perfect match for each dog and fur-ever home. Thank you!",

            "description": "\u2022\u2022 Our shelter will be open this Sunday, January 31 from Noon to 2pm. Come see us! **\n\nMia is a 6 year old black mouth cur mix that weighs 50lbs. She\u2019s a sweet, low energy lady who just wants to get all the love. Mia is friendly with other dogs, however, high energy dogs give her anxiety so she would do best in a home with a docile dog or no other dogs. Her meek nature makes her a great companion for a family in an apartment or house. \n\nWe believe Mia has been potty trained in the past and would respond well to a schedule allowing her to do her business outside. She is great on the leash and does not pull but walks with you. Mia is an amazing dog that would make a wonderful companion to a loving family.\n\nSadly, Mia tested positive for heartworms.  We need to get her into a home during her treatment. Heartworm treatment is a three months process that requires two vet visits for treatment within the first 90 days and a recheck after a year to ensure all heartworms are gone.  The cost for the heartworm treatment is covered.  We can provide you with more info about her heartworm treatment if you are interested in adopting or fostering her.\n\nAdoption hours at our shelter: Monday - Friday 9am-4pm, BY APPOINTMENT ONLY, and some weekend hours.  To make an appointment or for more information, please call us at 913-321-1445.  If you have a dog, you can also arrange to bring your dog with you to meet our dogs to see if it's a good match.\n\nOur dogs have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped and tested for heartworms (if 7 months or older).\n\nVisit our Petfinder home page at http://kckac.petfinder.com for more info about adopting our pets.",

            "description": "\u2022\u2022 Our shelter will be open this Sunday, January 31 from Noon to 2pm. Come see us! **\n\nZeus is a 5 year old Chinese sharpei mix and he is 57lbs.  He seems to have been abused before coming to us as he is very nervous when being touched. However, Zeus loves affection and will lightly put his paw on your leg to ask for more Zeus is very docile inside and outside and is not interested in toys but would rather walk around and sniff. He has had previous potty training and with a proper schedule will adjust quickly. \n\nZeus is a nervous guy, which makes him kennel reactive and may not get along with every dog he meets. He does not show aggression with cats but definitely notices them. Because he is a nervous guy that was most likely previously abused we suggest being cautious around his food, though he has shown no signs of food aggression. In a loving home we believe he will come out of his shell and be a great companion.\n\nSadly, Zeus tested positive for heartworms.  We need to get him into a home during his treatment. Heartworm treatment is a three months process that requires two vet visits for treatment within the first 90 days and a recheck after a year to ensure all heartworms are gone.  The cost for the heartworm treatment is covered.  We can provide you with more info about his heartworm treatment if you are interested in adopting or fostering him.\n\n\nAdoption hours at our shelter: Monday - Friday 9am-4pm, BY APPOINTMENT ONLY, and some weekend hours.  To make an appointment or for more information, please call us at 913-321-1445.  If you have a dog, you can also arrange to bring your dog with you to meet our dogs to see if it's a good match.\n\nOur dogs have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped and tested for heartworms (if 7 months or older).\n\nVisit our Petfinder home page at http://kckac.petfinder.com for more info about adopting our pets.",

Taz is fairly low energy, requiring daily walks but not much more. Ms. Taz is the queen so if she is in a house with other dogs, they need to be submissive to her or her family needs to take the time to properly set boundaries with her. Taz is good a on a leash and is house trained. She is crate trained and can be left alone for up to 6 hours. T\n\nWhile Taz is good with children, like all dogs, she prefers well behaved, dog-savvy kids. Taz thinks cats are fun to chase, so a cat-free home would be best for her. Taz is spayed, up-to-date on her vaccines and microchipped. We are seeking the best home for this sweet girl. If you would like to meet her, please contact us today.",

            "description": "Apollo is a sweet guy who came to us from the streets of Mexico. His approximate Date of birth is 10-30-2020. He looks to be a Boxer mix with Terrier (possible Staffy or Pit). He is so sweet, obedient, very playful, social, healthy and an active pup. He will do best in an active home with lots of love and attention. We do always highly recommend to sign up with a local positive reinforcement training class as this will help with training your new puppy. He is ready to find his forever home. Because of his adult size no apartments and preferably a home with a yard.\nThe adoption fee is $550 which includes: spay/neuter, microchipping with registration, up to date on vaccines, rabies vaccine (for dogs and pups over 4 months), deworming, and topical flea treatment application (as needed). Please email pardonmeinc@yahoo.com for information and adoption questionnaire.\nOur animals can be seen by appointment only after approved application process. No phone calls please. If you are interested in adopting one of our animals please send all inquiries to pardonmeinc@yahoo.com.\nUnfortunately at this time we are unable to hold events at our location at Petco in Anaheim Hills until Petco Corp. releases the availability of holding gatherings. We will hold appointments for meetings after approved application process.\n**********FOSTER HOMES NEEDED************\nWe are always looking for loving foster homes!

            "description": "Lola is a sweet girl who came to us from the streets of Mexico. Her approximate Date of birth is 10-21-2020. She looks to be a Husky mix with smaller dog as likely will be more of a Medium size when grown. She is so sweet, obedient, very playful, social, healthy and active pup. She will do best in an active home with lots of love and attention. We do always highly recommend to sign up with a local positive reinforcement training class as this will help with training your new puppy. She is ready to find her forever home. Because of her adult size no apartments and preferably a home with a yard.\nThe adoption fee is $550 which includes: spay/neuter, microchipping with registration, up to date on vaccines, rabies vaccine (for dogs and pups over 4 months), deworming, and topical flea treatment application (as needed). Please email pardonmeinc@yahoo.com for information and adoption questionnaire.\nOur animals can be seen by appointment only after approved application process. No phone calls please. If you are interested in adopting one of our animals please send all inquiries to pardonmeinc@yahoo.com.\nUnfortunately at this time we are unable to hold events at our location at Petco in Anaheim Hills until Petco Corp. releases the availability of holding gatherings. We will hold appointments for meetings after approved application process.\n**********FOSTER HOMES NEEDED************\nWe are always looking for loving foster homes!

He is happy, goofy, energetic, and loves everyone and everything. Looking for a jogging partner? Check! Looking for the next obedience star? Check! Looking for a playmate for your other dog? Check! Looking for a loyal, goof ball who will make you laugh on the daily with his puppy antics? Check! Cob is about 1 year old, 60 lbs fully grown. He is smart as can be and food motivated so training him is a breeze! He is housetrained and cratetrained. He is working on basic obedience and doing well but needs a home who wants to continue training him and teaching him manners. He is excellent with other dogs, fine with the cat, and while he adores people of all ages he is best in a home without real young kids since he can be grabby with food and treats and kind of a bull in a china shop. His happy Lab wagging a mile a minute booty sends the littles one flying!  Cob is the ideal dog for an active home who wants a fun buddy who is up for anything. \n\nRequirements: Home with yard space. \n\nAdoption Fee: $450 + tax. This includes neuter/spay, current vaccinations as age appropriate, heartworm/tick testing if appropriate, deworming, microchip, and current preventatives\n\nInterested in adopting?  Fill out a preadopt application here: https://form.jotform.com/203104997748162\n\nYou can email fostersheadinghomek9@gmail.com with additional questions.\n\nThis dog is located in Minneapolis, MN\n\n",

Please watch your spam folders as an application will be attached and this sometimes places it in there. \n\nHIS/HER adoption fee is $550 USD and that will pay for TRANSPORT, all his/her shots up to date, neutered/spayed, microchip and rabies.\n\nPlease e-mail MuttsAndMeows@Mail.com for an adoption application. \n\nThis dog is currently in the Houston Texas area.  Once the application is approved and adoption fee paid, transport will be arranged.\n\nBecause this adoption will be without meeting the dog first, we will need to try to be extra careful that everyone (including you) think this will be a good fit.  We will try to give you as much information about the dog as we can.  Unfortunately, many are fresh from the shelter and we don't know much about them yet. \n\nLike us on Facebook - search Mutts & Meows - and help even more pets find loving homes.",

I'm an 8yr old shepherd/husky mix who needs a new home, it wasn't safe for me at my previous home so my wonderful foster who found me as a stray found my family and my mom explained to her that staying there wasn't safe any longer and although I was loved, I needed a new home. Sky, my foster mom agreed to foster and do the rehoming but she needed the help of a rescue to get the word out.\nI'm a very sweet girl, super smart and know a lot of commands. My foster says I can learn anything in 2 days. I'm perfect for an ESA dog, I'm protective of the one I love, even though I'm 8 years old, I'm very much active, I love hiking and walks so if you're up for exercising,  let's go! I love playing with my toys, playing catch and if you want to stay in, I love getting cuddled all day. I'm a little timid at first around men til I know you're nice to me and I will warm up quickly. I love people and nice to everyone but I love my food, a bit possessive and don't like to share so other animals can't be around,  especially while eating but I'm cool with my humans around my food. It would be best to not have small kids in the home.  I get attached to my person and need someone who stays at home or works from home cuz I have some separation anxiety.  I'm not destructive when left but will start to bark, probably scared you won't come back. It's something we can work on or heck, take me with you, I love car rides and another reason why I'm a perfect ESA dog. I would love a nice yard to play in, run and feel free. I'm potty trained and just an all around wonderful girl!! Please reach out to meet me, I'm worth it, I'm spayed, vaccinated,  chipped and just missing my forever human, my best friend! \n\nContact Sky at (512)  924-2641 or Theskyvanvliet@gmail.com but calls preferred. \nLocated in Santa Clarita, willing to travel for right person.",

This does not mean I don't still have a lot of love to give, it just means I'm a senior with some extra \"stuff\" to think about. Since my arrival the medical team noted I was pretty achy in all my joints, but they started me on some great meds and I already feel miles better, as in lets go walkin! During my neuter procedure Dr. B did find quite a few worrying masses on my skin on my belly. I LOVE laying belly up in the sun and I guess no one told me that wasn't always the best idea. Dr. B did her very best to remove as much of the worrying skin lesions as possible. Our medical team can definitely tell ya about all my medical concerns when you come visit me. Please don't pass me by because I'm a senior guy! I would like nothing more than to hang out with my new forever human and share my Pitbull smile everyday!!",

I am friendly and cuddly with my foster and she is protecting me. I am pretty shy right now, and passing people and other dogs makes me scared and I lie down until they are gone. I need someone that will be patient with my shyness to start. I'm still new so check back here for more on me later!\n\nAdoption Coordinator: Kristen J.\nLocation: Foster\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog/puppy is $475. This fee includes spay/neuter and microchip. \n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\n We also provide free online workshop with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria/Falls Church/DC area. Start your new dog out on the right foot with this valuable, expert guidance FREE!\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters.

He doesn't seem to have any bad husky traits. He's a medium/low shedder. Very affectionate, loves treats. He seems to get along with any dog he meets. He's fine with sharing toys, treats etc. A very special dog for a very special person.\n\nHis adoption fee includes his neutering, vaccines, deworming, microchip. He was born on a reservation we work with July 2014.\n\nWe have specific adoption and Covid rules listed below.\n\nRevised adoption policy\nDue to Covid -19 pandemic and social distancing requirements, we've revised our adoption policy. \n\nFirst, please email (desertpawsnm@gmail.com) to inquire before you fill out the online application to see if the pet is still available. (Please do not call or text). We'll send you a link to the application.\n\nWe are unable to do multi-dog/cat meetgreets or adoption events at this time or bring multiple animals to your house to choose from, so please only inquire if you're serious about adopting this particular animal. If you're just shopping around with several shelters and rescues, please let us know this. \n\nIf your application is approved (which \"could\" take up to one week) then we will contact you to set up a Zoom chat or ph call to answer questions/clarify anything and set up a day/time to bring the pet to you. \n\nSince we can't come into the home/yard due to Covid-19, we ask that you send us pics /video of your home/yard/living area/current pets. \n\nWe will discuss with you about meeting your other pets. At the meeting/adoption at your house (outside) please wear a mask (as will we), keep to a properly distanced social distance and have hand sanitizer and your own leash.\n\nWe adopt locally to Central Abq, Santa Fe, Los Alamos and Rio Rancho. No out of area adoptions inquiries please. \n\nThe animals are fostered and our foster families like to know their fosters are happy, healthy, and cared for during their lifetime. We appreciate staying in touch periodically (just a pic, holiday card, social media, pics/videos  etc will make our work worthwhile :-))\n\nOur volunteers and adoption board are working diligently with an overload of inquiries since Covid to match families and forever pets. Our workload on the reservations has also increased. We're sorry, but if you email us with questions that are already answered here or fill out an application that does not fit the parameters of our procedures we will not be replying to you. Thank you for your understanding on this!\n\nThank you - we look forward to hearing from you and having another furbaby united with a furever family!",

He absolutely craves love and attention and enjoys\u00a0giving big dogo\u00a0hugs and kisses. He would do best in a home with a confident experienced adopter who would work with him on his training and provide him with plenty of exercise.\u00a0He has not been reactive with other dogs and could possibly do well with a submissive female with proper introductions.\u00a0\u00a0We do not recommend a home with cats, small dogs\u00a0or small children. Kurt\u00a0is a big love bug and would be so happy to be someone's adventure buddy. He is currently being fostered in Central Texas but would happily go on a road trip to the right forever home.\u00a0\n\nDogos are a wonderful breed but we urge anyone interested to dig in and do a lot of research before deciding if they are a good fit for your home. They require a lot of attention and training with them never ends!  Boundaries must be enforced and they often need reminders as they push past boundaires you set! Dogos are loving, kind and gentle but don't mistake that for weakness because they are equally powerful and intense as well! Everyone in the home must be on board with having a dogo and play a major role in their daily routines and training. Yes it is work, but the rewards are ten-fold! Lazy homes don't work for dogos as they need stimulation, exercise, and lots of attention too during their younger years.  Our goal in rescue is to be as transparent as we can about each and every dog plus make sure new families really understand the needs of a dogo!",

This dog is also tested with other dogs, kennel-trained, and housebroken. We would love for you to meet this dog and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: While we typically host weekly Saturday adoption events, in order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment and/or adoption handoff. Appointments and handoffs are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, adoption appointments and handoffs are only offered for individual animals. When adopting at an appointment, please be aware that you will be taking the animal home that day. We can not hold animals to be picked up at a later date.\n\nDue to CDC's recommended COVID-19 protocols, we are highly encouraging foster homes and adopters to speak with one another via phone or video chat to ensure compatible matches and limit in-person contact. If meeting in person, our foster homes are encouraged to wear masks, socially distance, and choose an outdoor meeting spot. Should you want to proceed forward with the adoption, all adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees are to be completed electronically. Quick and low-contact animal handoff is also being encouraged amongst foster homes and adopters. As always, we include a one-week trial period with all our adoptions.\u00a0***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption! If you would like more information on our organization please visit our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org.",

I'm hoping to find an active person or family that can give me daily mental and physical exercise through training, games, interactive toys, and outdoor activities. As a Husky, I'm a natural Houdini, so you might not be able to trust me alone in your yard! If you're well versed in the Husky ways, looking for love and excitement in your life, I'm your kind of companion! I really like to talk when alone, sometimes even when I have company. I'm not sure apartment neighbors will appreciate me being a chatty Cathy. I need a home where any children are at least school aged, I may do best where any children are closer to their teens though as I can be a bit rambunctious. I need a home where I am the only male dog, but I may do best as the only dog in the home. I need to meet any children and dogs in the home to make sure it's a perfect match. Ezra will be shown by appointment only. If you are interested in learning more about this animal, please fill out an application by clicking here .

Most of the time I'm a pretty easy-going gal who just wants to soak up all your love and attention. Sometimes, though, I can get overwhelmed if there is too much commotion and my boisterous side comes out. That's why I'm looking for a home where any kids are at least 12 and if there is a resident dog, I'd prefer he be a calm male dog. I would do best in a house with a fenced-in yard, so no apartments, please. Oh, and no cats! I can't wait to meet everybody in the family, including any resident dogs, to see if I'm the pup for you! Stevie is a Diamond Dog and will be shown by appointment only. Diamond Dogs are dogs that are currently receiving special training from staff and volunteers through our behavior modification program.

            "description": "What do you get when you stack cuteness, on top of smart, on top of friendly? You get our boy Staxx. This handsome young man is house broken and loves people and other dogs of all sizes. Staxx is content just laying around the house, playing with his toys, and chewing on his bones. But when you're ready to play so is he. Staxx is super smart and mastering basic commands. Adopt Staxx today, for he'll be out of stock soon. \n\nStaxx is about 4 years old and weighs about 41 pounds (will put on weight). \n\nIf you're interested in meeting Staxx, please visit our website to learn about our adoption process and to fill out an application, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs and cats will be micro-chipped, spayed or neutered, and up-to-date on vaccinations at the time of adoption. For more photos of Staxx, follow us on Facebook Gateway Pet Guardians and Instagram @gatewaypets ... #gpgStaxx. \n\nTo view other adoptable pets from our shelter, please visit, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nGateway Pet Guardians is proud to offer a variety of mixed breed dogs available for adoption. However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

            "description": "Joy is a 9-week-old mixed breed rescued from a high-kill shelter. This dog is current on vaccinations, microchipped, and spayed/neutered. This puppy is currently in foster care learning home etiquette, kennel training, and housebreaking. We would love for you to meet this puppy and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: While we typically host weekly Saturday adoption events, in order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment and/or adoption handoff. Appointments and handoffs are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, adoption appointments and handoffs are only offered for individual animals. When adopting at an appointment, please be aware that you will be taking the animal home that day. We can not hold animals to be picked up at a later date.\n\nDue to CDC's recommended COVID-19 protocols, we are highly encouraging foster homes and adopters to speak with one another via phone or video chat to ensure compatible matches and limit in-person contact. If meeting in person, our foster homes are encouraged to wear masks, socially distance, and choose an outdoor meeting spot. Should you want to proceed forward with the adoption, all adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees are to be completed electronically. Quick and low-contact animal handoff is also being encouraged amongst foster homes and adopters. As always, we include a one-week trial period with all our adoptions.\u00a0***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption!

            "description": "Introducing the sweet Miss Pretzel!\n\nMiss Pretzel is a 12-month-old female American Staffordshire Terrier mix. We believe she may be mixed with a hound breed as she has shorter, cuter legs. She has been spayed, microchipped, current on all of her vaccinations, and has her wellness exam.\n\nShe was rescued with another female dog, and they got along very well together. We have not socialized Pretzel with another dog other than Sunny, so we cannot confirm she will definitely be good with other dogs. Pretzel is crate trained, potty trained and she is very well behaved in a home. She absolutely loves children; she's currently in her second foster home with children and has even exceptionally behaved with a special needs child.\n\nMiss Pretzel is a little shy and timid upon first meeting, and she does warm up to ladies much quicker than gents. Her new family will need to be patient with her and give her time to decompress and settle in. If you are interested in meeting Miss Pretzel,\n\nplease submit a completed\nadoption application found\nat www.doggiebonez.com so that we can schedule a meet and greet. She is also on all of our social media pages IG: @Doggie_Bonez_Inc_ and Facebook: Doggie Bonez.\n\nIf adoption isn't an option, please consider fostering one of our pups. We are a volunteer-run non-profit dog rescue and always welcome new short or long-term doggie foster families. We much appreciate the help and time of our fosters. You provide all the love, comfort, and safety of a home, and we supply you with everything else you may need, dog food, dog bed, toys, medical attention (if required), etc. If you are interested, please visit www.doggiebonez.com to see all of our available dogs who need a foster family while waiting for their fur-ever home and complete the foster application.",

This puppy is currently in foster care learning home etiquette, kennel training, and housebreaking. We would love for you to meet this puppy and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: While we typically host weekly Saturday adoption events, in order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment and/or adoption handoff. Appointments and handoffs are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, adoption appointments and handoffs are only offered for individual animals. When adopting at an appointment, please be aware that you will be taking the animal home that day. We can not hold animals to be picked up at a later date.\n\nDue to CDC's recommended COVID-19 protocols, we are highly encouraging foster homes and adopters to speak with one another via phone or video chat to ensure compatible matches and limit in-person contact. If meeting in person, our foster homes are encouraged to wear masks, socially distance, and choose an outdoor meeting spot. Should you want to proceed forward with the adoption, all adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees are to be completed electronically. Quick and low-contact animal handoff is also being encouraged amongst foster homes and adopters. As always, we include a one-week trial period with all our adoptions.\u00a0***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption! If you would like more information on our organization please visit our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org.",

He is a really good representative for this breed.  He is good with other dogs and fine in the wire crate.  He is also in a foster home with a cat.  He is nice on a leash and overall a really good little dog.  He is sturdy enough to be a nice walking partner for someone.  He is independent and will not need constant attention.  He is currently at CCPAL rescue waiting for his forever home.  He could be adopted locally in Texas which is where the rescue is located or we can work with one of the wonderful transporters to deliver him to Washington, Portland, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Vermont or all along the East Coast.  His adoption fee is 250 and transport is 185.  Rhode Island and Massachusetts are not states we adopt to because of the regulations imposed by these states.\n\nContact Marlene at 210-867-1769 or email to ccpalinquiries@gmail.com if you have questions.

If a dog/puppy is still listed on Petfinder- we are still accepting applications for them***\n\nCoco is currently in Houston, TX and can transport to the PNW mid February.\n\nMeet Coco! She's a 10 month old girl who is full of life! Coco was found wandering the streets, like so many other pups down in Houston, TX. Her finder reached out to us for help after trying to find Coco's owner with no one coming forward to claim her. \n\nCoco is your typical puppy with lots of love & energy. We recommend basic obedience classes to help this sweet girl get to her full potential! Coco walks well on a leash, but could still use a little bit of work, but we know that with some time & patience, this girl will catch on quick to whatever you're trying to teach her! Her finder says that she does amazing in her kennel and has not had any accidents in her house, although after transport sometimes these pups can regress, so time and patience is KEY! Coco has been sweet and playful with all of the dogs she has met so far. Coco has not had any encounters with children yet and due to her energy level we are recommending a home with kids over the age of 8 years. She has not had any encounters with cats yet, so we're not sure how she'll respond to them.\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. ***\n\nThe first step in our process is filling out an application. We will review your application as soon as we are able- there are two of us and we do the best that we can. We review applications on a first come first serve basis and look for the best fit/match for the dog and applicant.\n\nhttps://heartoftheunderdog.org/adoption-application",

If a dog/puppy is still listed on Petfinder- we are still accepting applications for them***\n\nCoco is currently in Houston, TX and can transport to the PNW mid February.\n\nMeet Coco! She's a 10 month old girl who is full of life! Coco was found wandering the streets, like so many other pups down in Houston, TX. Her finder reached out to us for help after trying to find Coco's owner with no one coming forward to claim her. \n\nCoco is your typical puppy with lots of love & energy. We recommend basic obedience classes to help this sweet girl get to her full potential! Coco walks well on a leash, but could still use a little bit of work, but we know that with some time & patience, this girl will catch on quick to whatever you're trying to teach her! Her finder says that she does amazing in her kennel and has not had any accidents in her house, although after transport sometimes these pups can regress, so time and patience is KEY! Coco has been sweet and playful with all of the dogs she has met so far. Coco has not had any encounters with children yet and due to her energy level we are recommending a home with kids over the age of 8 years. She has not had any encounters with cats yet, so we're not sure how she'll respond to them.\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. ***\n\nThe first step in our process is filling out an application. We will review your application as soon as we are able- there are two of us and we do the best that we can. We review applications on a first come first serve basis and look for the best fit/match for the dog and applicant.\n\nhttps://heartoftheunderdog.org/adoption-application",

            "description": "Courtney is looking for a place to call home!\u00a0\u00a0We think she may be around 2-3 years old. She is a really sweet girl who\u00a0loves to snuggle and give sweet dogo kisses. Courtney would do well in a home with a stable male dog of similar size. She seems to need a buddy around to make her feel safe.\u00a0She would prefer a home with no\u00a0cats, small dogs or young children. She\u00a0would love a home that would give her daily exercise and a soft place to land. She craves human attention, although\u00a0she may take a moment to warm up and feel confident. Courtney is currently being fostered in Central Texas but would be willing to travel to an approved perfect home.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDogos are a wonderful breed but we urge anyone interested to dig in and do a lot of research before deciding if they are a good fit for your home. They require a lot of attention and training with them never ends!  Boundaries must be enforced and they often need reminders as they push past boundaires you set! Dogos are loving, kind and gentle but don't mistake that for weakness because they are equally powerful and intense as well! Everyone in the home must be on board with having a dogo and play a major role in their daily routines and training. Yes it is work, but the rewards are ten-fold! Lazy homes don't work for dogos as they need stimulation, exercise, and lots of attention too during their younger years.  Our goal in rescue is to be as transparent as we can about each and every dog plus make sure new families really understand the needs of a dogo!",

If a dog/puppy is still listed on Petfinder- we are still accepting applications for them***\n\nCoco is currently in Houston, TX and can transport to the PNW mid February.\n\nMeet Coco! She's a 10 month old girl who is full of life! Coco was found wandering the streets, like so many other pups down in Houston, TX. Her finder reached out to us for help after trying to find Coco's owner with no one coming forward to claim her. \n\nCoco is your typical puppy with lots of love & energy. We recommend basic obedience classes to help this sweet girl get to her full potential! Coco walks well on a leash, but could still use a little bit of work, but we know that with some time & patience, this girl will catch on quick to whatever you're trying to teach her! Her finder says that she does amazing in her kennel and has not had any accidents in her house, although after transport sometimes these pups can regress, so time and patience is KEY! Coco has been sweet and playful with all of the dogs she has met so far. Coco has not had any encounters with children yet and due to her energy level we are recommending a home with kids over the age of 8 years. She has not had any encounters with cats yet, so we're not sure how she'll respond to them.\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. ***\n\nThe first step in our process is filling out an application. We will review your application as soon as we are able- there are two of us and we do the best that we can. We review applications on a first come first serve basis and look for the best fit/match for the dog and applicant.\n\nhttps://heartoftheunderdog.org/adoption-application",

            "description": "While we normally write our animal profiles ourselves, sweet Dixie\u2019s foster has provided us with an awesome write up for our little senior girl.\n\nDo you need a corner of the room or backyard fence inspector? Do you need to look at the most low-key, yet expressive little face? Do you need a snuggle-snore muffin? Then Dixie is your girl! This little old lady has been with us a day and a half and she\u2019s snorggled her way into our hearts! So far she likes to roam around the house, cuddle- on her terms, and snuggle in her kennel. She\u2019s not really into being carried but will allow it. Dixie grunts and mumbles and reminds me of the lady who just can\u2019t remember why she walked in the room. Was it for a drink of water? She is great on walks and really likes to go fast, shocking for a 13 year old , and the only time she barked this stay was when she saw another dog. We think she might be deaf (or selective in her hearing). She loves our 12 year old human and when grandma visited, her tail was going a mile a minute. Maybe our Mimi reminded her of her original owner that had to go into assisted living. Oh! And she\u2019s housebroken and doesn\u2019t dilly dally about it. \n\nRight now she\u2019s curled up next to my legs, snoring a sweet little song. She\u2019s waiting for someone to make her a permanent lovable fixture. So fill out an application for Dixie today!",

He will likely be about 12-20lb full grown. He needs an active family who will commit to training and social skills. He is not yet house or crate trained but is learning and very smart. He is food motivated and very dog friendly. \n\nThank you for reading about our awesome dog. All dogs came to us from different situations and we often do not know much about their past, but they are rescue dogs who deserve a second chance and need patience on their journey. All of our dogs our are in foster homes all across the bay area. \n\nThe first step of the process is you must submit an application in order to set up a meet and great or talk with the foster family. Once application is submitted the foster parents will contact you to chat more about the dog and make sure they're a good fit and can answer any further question. The application answers most of all of our questions and can best match you. If you do not get the dog you apply for we can use your same application for 90 days towards another dog in our care and simply forward your app to that foster parent. \nhttp://form.jotform.com/underdogca/dog-adoption-application\n\nAll dogs will be fully vetted (Spay/ Neutered, Micro chipped, DHPP and Rabies Vaccinated) and other possible vet care prior to adoption.\n\nThe adoption fee is $400, which is considered a non refundable donation\n\nvisit us at underdogca.com or follow us on FB and IG @underdogca\nhttps://www.facebook.com/underdogCA",

            "description": "Meet cute little 4mo old puppy MJ. He is a chi terrier mix who is a total puppy with no training. He is shy at first, then warms up and is a total busy body. He will likely be about 17-20lb full grown. He needs an active family who will commit to training and social skills. He is not yet house or crate trained but is learning and very smart. He is food motivated and very dog friendly. \n\nThank you for reading about our awesome dog. All dogs came to us from different situations and we often do not know much about their past, but they are rescue dogs who deserve a second chance and need patience on their journey. All of our dogs our are in foster homes all across the bay area. \n\nThe first step of the process is you must submit an application in order to set up a meet and great or talk with the foster family. Once application is submitted the foster parents will contact you to chat more about the dog and make sure they're a good fit and can answer any further question. The application answers most of all of our questions and can best match you. If you do not get the dog you apply for we can use your same application for 90 days towards another dog in our care and simply forward your app to that foster parent. \nhttp://form.jotform.com/underdogca/dog-adoption-application\n\nAll dogs will be fully vetted (Spay/ Neutered, Micro chipped, DHPP and Rabies Vaccinated) and other possible vet care prior to adoption.\n\nThe adoption fee is $400, which is considered a non refundable donation\n\nvisit us at underdogca.com or follow us on FB and IG @underdogca\nhttps://www.facebook.com/underdogCA",

            "description": "My name is Lil Belle! I am six years old and mostly American Staffordshire Terrier (I had a DNA test done). I am described as a sweet portly little lady. I currently weigh 70 pounds, but closer to 50 is the healthy range for me. This means I need a diet and exercise in my new home. I love to meet new people and have no problem handing out kisses! I have been around infants and children 8 yrs and older, but don't always know my own strength, so they need to be prepared for my \"bull in a china shop\" antics. Aside from people, my other favorite things are walks, playing fetch, chew toys, plush toys, blankets, chasing the laser pointer. I am not fond of rain or the hose, but will wade in my kiddie pool. I prefer my people to be home most of the time as I get lonely. I am crate trained, but can also be left free roaming in the home. I used to be a runner in my younger years, so I should be on a tie out or have a fenced yard (which I'm most used to). I have lived with 4 cats and did great with them all. I also lived with a male lab and we were great friends! I do have sensitive skin and sometimes require calming sprays to be spritzed on me. I'm really a loving little lady that would love to find a home!\n\nPlease note:\n- Our website (www.neenahanimalshelter.org) is updated in real time, so we are accepting applications for all animals that are currently listed.\n-Applications can be downloaded from our website. (http://neenahanimalshelter.org/how-to-adopt.html)\n- Our shelter no longer has open visiting hours, so a pre-approved application and scheduled appointment is needed prior to meeting any of our animals.",

This little man was very unsure when first coming to the shelter and needed time to get comfortable. Our wonderful staff and volunteers have worked with him on positive reinforcement which has really helped him. We recommend that you look up certified dog trainers at: www.ccpdt.org before meeting him so that you and him can continue working together on his positive reinforcement training. Spike would do best in an adult only environment without any other pets. He is neutered, microchipped, negative for heartworm, and started on vaccines and flea/tick prevention. Please reach out to our Director of Animal Behavior to discuss Spike's behavior more and set up an appointment to meet him: behavior@bcspca.org or 215-794-7425 x113.",

He makes the sweetest little noises to let you know that he is very happy while getting belly rubs. When he is not napping and cuddling, he loves to run, jump and play with his sister, Viola. He looks like a little bunny when he is hopping around to get a new toy. He loves playing with any and all toys and is great playing with his much bigger foster brothers. Vince is a very good listener and learns basic commands quickly. He is also doing very well with potty training, but he is young so he will need more help once he finds his furever home. This sweet little puppy will be a great addition to any family.",

            "description": "RayRay is the cream of the crop. I've fostered over 200 dogs and he gets top honors: an all around amazing pooch!\n\nHe has a sweet and gentle spirit. I don't have children to test him with, but he behaves perfectly around my 80 year old parents and my 10 pound Poodle mix pups.\n\nRayRay enjoys the company of my dogs and seems to like playing second fiddle to my bossy-boss Poodle. He is potty trained and crate trained. He stays in his crate when I go to work and overnight, in his crate in my bedroom. I'm sure he would love to sleep with you, and would be a perfect bed partner. But, I save that privilege for my little dogs since we're always babysitting foster dogs and puppies.\n\nHe was recently neutered and tested positive for heartworms. Thankfully, he has no symptoms and it's so easy giving him his meds. I just hide a pill in lumps of canned food, and add to his dry kibble. Easy peasy!\n\nRayRay excels on loose leash walks, is a gorgeous boy so gets a lot of attention when we're out and about. I've noticed he can be a little timid around loud construction noises. He's happy to meet polite dogs along the way, but gets his feelings hurt when dogs charge the fence at him, snarling and causing a big ruckus. He settled quickly into our home routine.\n\nHe learned to sit for treats super fast and is treat motivated (and takes them gently). He gets a treat every time we come in the house after potty breaks and will be expecting a treat from you, too, haha. He's building his confidence every day, now that he feels safe and loved and part of a family. \n\nRayRay is the softest, squishiest boy and is guaranteed to snuggle his way onto your lap and into your heart!",

She likes to take walks and her leash training is pretty good considering how little I have had her. We are working on kennel training. I can't get her to stay in without crying and panicking when I leave. Dottie is new to a lot so she needs baby steps when it comes to new experiences like bath time and getting in the car. I take her out 3 to 4 times a day so it's hard to say whether or not she is house trained. I let her sleep down stairs all night and when I wake up there isn't a stain in sight. She has had no accidents.\n\nDottie likes kids and people but it is best to introduce her when you are there. Dottie is smart and you will see gradual progress in her with consistent repetitions. She is okay with sit and I work on her leash respect by reinforcing a relaxed pace with a clicker. She will bark when she sees cats. She doesn't really bark in the house. She recently started to nip at me so I will need to work with her on that. She is a very chill girl and a happy pup.",

            "description": "Meet Date. Born approximately November 2020, she is super cute and sweet and loves everyone she meets. She is curious, bouncy, and fun but also loves to be cuddled.\n\nThere is a lot for a puppy to learn, so she will need to find a home where someone is very available to her in these early days. She loves the companionship of other animals and requires another dog to act as her mentor as she continues to understand her new world's rules.\n\nCurrently, her Foster family is teaching her the difference between her toys and others' prized possessions. This cute little girl is not going to be little for long. Now is the best time to jump in and continue mentoring her. It is going to be so fun watching her fill out and fit into those big paws. Please complete an Adoption Application. Date is only available for adoption in OR.\n\nPUPPIES ARE ONLY PLACED IN HOMES WITH YOUTHFUL, PLAYFUL RESIDENT DOGS.\n\nOur requirements for puppy adoption are simple and necessary.\n\nOur puppies are not livestock guardians, they are family pets that live inside the family home.\n\nPuppies must be placed in homes with a youthful, adult resident dog of similar size. This gives the puppy a mentor and a solid foundation for becoming part of the family.\n\nPuppies are only adopted to homes with someone at home at least part of the day. If no one is home for 6-8 hours at a time, please do not apply.\n\nPreference is always given to those with Great Pyrenees experience.\n\nApplicants must have secure, visible fencing and a socialization plan in place.\n\nThe fastest way to be considered for a puppy is to fill out an application. Adoption is not first come, first served. GPRS and its fosters work diligently to find the right fit for each and every unique dog and puppy.\n\nApplicant's personal pets must be current on vaccines & heartworm/flea prevention and be altered.\n\nAdoption Fee: $450 (Adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm test, rabies, distemper, parvo and health certificate for travel). Northwest adopters pay the cost of transport to independent transport service ($225). Adoption applications can be found on our website at\n\nhttps://www.greatpyreneesrescuesociety.org/\n\nADOPTION, FOSTERING, AND DONATIONS are just some of the ways you can help a rescued dog. We have worked hard to cultivate a large network of volunteers to save this majestic breed. While monetary donations are always much appreciated, you can also help by donating your time as a GPRS foster or volunteer!",

She came to us because her daddy died unexpectedly one night just days before Christmas and sadly she was just waiting for him to come home for snuggles. A friend of dad's desparately reached out for help for this dog that she knows was so loved and cared for.  The landlord said they could just euthanize her but no way was that going to happen!  Her kind veterinarian boarded her for a couple weeks while things were sorted out and we decided to bring Sugar into the rescue even though she ended up not being a Dogo, like her daddy thought! Come to find out, her dad rescued her as just a little pup himself!  We've been told he was an Army veteran that served oveseas and had a big heart, especially for animals. He was driving down the road one day and the car in front of him threw something out the window and he stopped because he knew what he saw. Yes, that was Sugar being launched from a moving car but now save with this new human! It truly is heartbreaking that her time with him was cut so short and we wanted to help her in his honor.\n\nSugar got picked up in Mississippi by one of our fabulous volunteers who took a long road trip and brought her to the good ol' state of Texas! She is doing well and learning all kinds of new things.  She did go through some grieving, confusion, and even a little bit of weight loss but today she is doing so much better!!  She is a cuddly girl that loves to play and get lots of attention by her people.  We know she was around a dog where she lived before and has done well with other dogs where she is. We do not know how she is with cats but that is something we are working on finding out. We don't know how she is with kids either at this time. \n\nThis sweet girl would love to find a home and be the center of attention for sure. Sugar will be 2 years old in May and is a healthy young dog with lots of life ahead of her. She really loved just hanging out with her dad so she seems to gravitate to the man of the house where she is now but also does well with the female humans too!  Please apply if you are interested in giving Sugar a new forever home!\n\n\n",

PLEASE READ ENTIRE BIO BEFORE EMAILING****\n\nDexter and Bella are a bonded pair. They were rescued from Texas, where there are many homeless pets and not enough space in animal shelters. \n\nDexter is the male chocolate lab mix and Bella is the female terrier mix with wirey hair. Dexter is approximately 3 years old and Bella is approximately two years old. Dexter is heartworm negative, but Bella is light heartworm positive and has began treatment. Both dogs are very dog and people friendly and housetrained. They are great at lounging with their people. They would make someone wonderful company. \n\n To apply to adopt Dexter and Bella, please submit an adoption application at \nsnarrnortheast.org \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n-------------------------------------------------------\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

Just check out those black and white spots \u2013 quite the beauty!\n\nMiss Jersey wondered up to a Good Samaritan\u2019s house just outside the San Antonio city limit. With a little food and love, Jersey never left. Since the Good Samaritan already had a full house, she decided to place her in SNIPSA\u2019s adoption program.\n\nJersey is not only stunning but also incredibly sweet. She\u2019ll greet you with her tail wags and kisses immediately. She is a wiggle monster and has youthful energy. She would do best in a home where she would get plenty of exercise or have another buddy to romp with. Being a Pit Bull Terrier, she is also extremely affectionate and friendly- even toward strangers! She is smart, trainable, and devoted.  She would benefit from an owner willing to train her and teach her basic obedience. Though we haven\u2019t tried her in water yet, Pit Bulls typically have an affection for rivers, lakes, and swimming pools. They will retrieve balls and sticks though not as enthusiastically as a Labrador. Jersey\u2019s short coat is also easy to maintain so she\u2019ll be easy-peasy to groom! To sum all it all up- she\u2019s gorgeous, has a wonderful personality, and is smart \u2013 talk about a triple threat queen!\n\nIf Jersey sounds like the perfect companion for you, fill out her application today!",

I'm an extremely sweet girl and the only thing that I really want to do at any given moment is sit in your lap, regardless of what you may be doing. I do appear to become very attached quickly, and therefore seem to have some separation anxiety. But I'm just a little puppy and I know I'll grow out of it when I get big and strong. My favorite thing in the whole world is my purple blanket. I also really love car rides! I am trained to use the bathroom on a pee pad, but am not leashed trained and don't particularly like to be on leash yet. I also love to play with other dogs, regardless of their size.",

She is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4393704.\n\nPoor sweet Yola was very thin and had multiple sores on her body when she first arrived to the shelter. She was found as a stray and had either been living like that for a while, or was not treated very well in a previous home. Yola was growling and exhibited other fearful behaviors when she first arrived to the shelter, but once she knew she was safe and wouldn't be harmed, all she wanted was love. She wags her tail when she sees people, she walks well and calm on a leash, and loves to get lots of pets and treats. It appears Yola is dog friendly, but due to her medical on arrival she didn't get to meet a dog until after a couple weeks at the shelter, she wagged her tail and greeted the other dog but the other dog wasn't friendly. Yola is 5 years old and has clearly been through a lot, she may be a little timid at first when meeting new people, but she's just a friendly girl who wants to know she's safe and be loved! Are you the right home for Yola? Come meet her!\n\nTo visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt.

My name is Tic, and I am a playful young dude who is looking for a lifetime of fun! I'm friendly with everyone I meet: other dogs, cats, and people of all ages. I think it would be a big bonus to have another playful doggie friend in my forever home, and a fenced yard to run around would be awesome, too. I love going for walks - this fluffy stuff my humans tell me is snow is so much fun to bounce through while we stroll the neighborhood! As a younger guy, I would thrive with a family that will help me learn: I am working on potty and crate training, and am eager to start training classes with a family that loves me. I hear training classes are fun, and if you haven't caught on yet, fun is my favorite word! If it is yours, too, I hope you reach out soon!\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS, NO EXCEPTIONS:\n*ADOPTION FEE: $300\n*Be at least 21 years of age\n*Live in a 50-mile radius of Itasca, within the Illinois border\n*Have the knowledge and agreement of all adults living in the household\n*Have approval from owner of residence (written in lease)\n*Have a valid ID with current address (please provide proof of address if ID address is not up-to-date)\n*Be approved as a suitable adoptive home by Fetching Tails Foundation\n*Be prepared to make a lifetime commitment\n\nIf interested please fill out an application on our website at www.fetchingtailsfoundation.org; please make sure you fill in every required field/question or your submission will not go through. Please note that we take time to learn as much as we can about each dog in our care and our bios are our current observations; we are unable to make any guarantees on the future health or temperament of your adopted dog. Most dogs in our care come with unknown pre-rescue history and as such breed and age estimates are an educated guess.",

Our adoption fee is $400-$800. Each biography will specifically list the adoption fee.Adoption Fee: $650\nSesame is a 4-5 month old male Beagle-Lab mix who weighs around 12 lbs. We estimate he will probably be in the 25lbs range when full grown. Sesame was a rescue from Korea. The entire litter and Mom were rescued before being sold to the meat market. Sesame is quite the charmer. With his vibrant, playful, and exuberant personality, he is just the pup for someone who wants a fun and affectionate dog to make them laugh.\n\nWhen Sesame initially meets new people, he is usually very curious and affectionate. He is often very comfortable with people right from the start. Once he gets to know his family, though, his already affectionate personality becomes even more vibrant! While he isn't too much of a cuddler, he is very playful and expressive. He loves chasing and chewing on toys. His fosters like to call him a drama queen because he likes to make his emotions clear. When he is happy, his tail is wagging non-stop. He is also very vocal about his emotions (he likes to talk), but not in an annoying way. Last, he is a bit of a velcro dog. He likes to keep an eye on his humans and will follow people from room to room. He loves to find a nice spot to sunbathe while watching his humans at work or going about their routine.\n\nSesame is working on some basic training and is excelling quite well! He is very food motivated, and as a result has quickly learned \"sit\", \"down\", and \"stay\". In addition, he is housetrained, crate trained, and walks decently well on the leash. That being said, he could use a bit of training to help him improve his confidence. He spooks easily to loud noises like garbage trucks, cars, loud construction sites, and sometimes other dogs. In order to address this, he will need a bit of training. Finally, because he is still a puppy, he is still teething, but is easily redirected to other toys.\n\nSesame has established a daily routine with his foster:\n\"Sesame wakes up little before 8:00 am and goes to a backyard for potty, followed by breakfast, and a quick little walk around a block. Sesame spends the day playing with our dog, Charlie inside and outside, sunbathing, and naps. We all go for a long walk to a park at 5:00 PM followed by dinner. Usually he settles in Charlie's crate around 7:30. They have an indoor wrestling session around 9:00 PM. Last call for potty break around 11:30 then goes to his crate to sleep.\"\n\nWhile Sesame is great with humans right from the start, he does take some time to warm up to other animals. When he initially met his (now best friend) foster dog brother he was very nervous and scared, whining and barking to let people know his discomfort. However, once he realized that the dog meant no harm he warmed up. He now likes to follow the dog around from room to room, never letting him out his sight. He also does well with older children, and currently lives with a 14 year old.\n\nSesame's ideal home will be willing to finish off his training, making sure that he has everything he needs to blossom into a confident adult dog. However, most importantly, Sesame needs a family that will give him all the love and attention he deserves.\nSesame is only an option for those who have had a dog in the last 5 years. If there are children in the home they need to be over the age of 8.",

Rooster is a fun-loving pup that loves his toys and his people. He gets the zoomies and then is ready to cuddle on the couch with his foster family. AKA he's the perfect balance! He'd love a family that would like to play with him and go on hikes (when it's warmer!) and then Netflix and chill. He's also a smart boy and is learning commands quickly in his foster home. He's potty trained and knows basic commands. Apply today for this perfect addition to your family! Rooster's adoption fee is $175. He is up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, neutered, and microchipped.\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, microchipped and if over 6 months of age, heartworm tested and on heartworm preventative in their foster home.\n\nWe require an approved application to meet any of our dogs. We do not have a shelter location and will not arrange a meeting without an approved application.\n\nWe strive to make sure the bios provided for our dogs are complete and accurate; we do understand that mistakes happen, however, so if you absolutely cannot find the answer to your question in the dog's bio, you can contact us for more information.\n\nWe require a home visit for each dog we adopt out, so we adopt within a 2 hour radius of Dayton, OH. If you are outside of this radius, we encourage you to contact your local rescue or shelter.",

She LOVES tennis balls! We think toys bring her comfort, as her family just gave her up and her normal is now gone. She was surrendered because her parents are now empty nesters and don't have time for her. We can tell she is scared and confused because she paces the yard outside and tries to dig under the fence to get away. She is dog friendly, but she is so focused on finding her family that she just ignores other dogs while outside. She really needs someone to step up and commit to her forever. You can just see the heartbreak in her eyes when you look at her. She needs to know that not all humans are bad. She is house trained and very well behaved. She needs an owner that will play fetch with her. We think she would enjoy a home where she is the only dog and gets all the attention, at least for a little while. But she could also live with another calm and polite dog. She is medium energy. Enjoys playing with toys but also knows how to relax. She is fully vetted, spayed, and ready to go \n\nApply for Emmy here: www.whenthegoinggetsruff.org/adopt",

Saint is a bit more timid and needs a doggie sibling for confidence. He is housebroken and crate trained. We are looking for an adult only home for him. He has been fixed, microchipped and he is up to date on vaccines. Saint had surgery in Louisiana to repair a luxating patella that was painful for him. Saints is very friendly with Princess, they can be adopted together or separately. His adoption fee is $300.\n\nHow to Adopt Me!\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about me, and possibly making me part of your family, please go to wagoninn.rescuegroups.org.

            "description": "Meet 1yr old, 70lb Roddy the german shepherd. He is a gorgeous boy who found himself at high kill central valley shelter. He is smart and sensitive. Poor boy likely lived his life as  a yard dog and lacks life experiences. He is very affectionate and is doing well on house and crate training. He is dog friendly, but awkward and has lots of energy. He would do best with older kids or adult home. He loves water and is full of personality. He loves to go for long walks and is learning leash manners and to calm down a bit. He would greatly benefit from an active home who wanted to train.\n\nThank you for reading about our awesome dog. All dogs came to us from different situations and we often do not know much about their past, but they are rescue dogs who deserve a second chance and need patience on their journey. All of our dogs our are in foster homes all across the bay area. \n\nThe first step of the process is you must submit an application in order to set up a meet and great or talk with the foster family. Once application is submitted the foster parents will contact you to chat more about the dog and make sure they're a good fit and can answer any further question. The application answers most of all of our questions and can best match you. If you do not get the dog you apply for we can use your same application for 90 days towards another dog in our care and simply forward your app to that foster parent. \nhttp://form.jotform.com/underdogca/dog-adoption-application\n\nAll dogs will be fully vetted (Spay/ Neutered, Micro chipped, DHPP and Rabies Vaccinated) and other possible vet care prior to adoption.\n\nThe adoption fee is $350, which is considered a non refundable donation\n\nvisit us at underdogca.com or follow us on FB and IG @underdogca\nhttps://www.facebook.com/underdogCA",

However, Maya can also be wary of new people and needs a low-traffic, mature home to succeed. As she makes such a loving, velcro companion, Maya also experiences some difficulty with separation and needs a home with a setup conducive to her adjusting to separation gradually and on her own terms. If Maya sounds like the right fit for you and your family, please fill out a Pet & People profile for more information!\n\nCOVID-19 Adoption Health and Safety:\n\nFor the time being and to help slow the spread of COVID-19 we are scheduling all adoptions.

            "description": "All of our dogs are spayed/neutered, shots current (DHPP, Bordetella and Rabies where applicable), dewormed, flea and tick treated and microchipped.\n* If you are interested in a dog, please first read the biography on the dog (keep scrolling down for the bio!) and then go to our website, www.dpsrescue.com for an application. Our adoption fee is $400-$800. Each biography will specifically list the adoption fee.Adoption Fee: $650\nFlo is a 2 year old female Beagle-Dachshund mix who weighs around 17 lbs. This cutie pie is a huge snuggle bug! With her love of naptime, soft blankets, and warm laps, Flo is just the pup for someone who needs a dog to keep them company and love them unconditionally. Flo was originally a rescue from Mexico. She was placed in a home and the home was looking for a dog who was more sedate and showed more deference to their older dogs. She is more of a take charge kinda gal and the two old dogs in the home were left in the dust. The home also felt like she didn't adjust to the colder weather as she would be cold frequently.\n\nFlo tends to be very timid and shy initially with new people, spending most of her time in her crate. But don't worry! Once given a bit of time, Flo will open up and show you her wonderful personality. After spending some time with her foster she now loves to snuggle and sit on the couch. She has also developed a habit of crawling into people's laps and licking their face if they sit on the ground next to her! She is very affectionate to those she loves. In general, Flo's personality is very chill. She is low maintenance and a big couch potato, spending the majority of her day curled up on soft blankets or basking in a sunny spot on the floor.\n\nIn between naps, Flo is working on some basic training. She is crate trained and potty trained, and walks very well on the leash. She pulls sometimes but once you stop moving, she will understand that she's supposed to walk by your side. She also loves sniffing around while she is outside but doesn't like particularly long walks. After 20-25 minutes, she wants to go home. She isn't a nuisance barker or digger either. Her only area for improvement is her chewing habits. She loves to dig through the trash and chew up things, so she definitely needs a home that is prepared to address this issue through training and puppy proofing. Last, she will benefit from a home that is willing to provide her with socialization to improve her confidence around new people.\n\nFlo has established a daily routine with her foster:\n\"Flo wakes up at ~8AM but stays in her crate quietly until her foster parents let her out. They then take her out for a ~20 minute morning walk. After her walk, she is very excited to get fed. The rest of the day Flo is relatively quiet. You'll likely find Flo snuggled up in a comfy spot near people, but not begging for attention. Flo needs to be taken out ~2-3x during the day depending on how much water she drank. In the evening, close to 7PM, Flo is taken out again for a 20-30 minute walk. Most of the day she is just lounging around as she is not a very active dog.\"\n\nFlo is generally a very sweet dog, but does have her reservations around other animals. She definitely takes her time opening up to other dogs and is often scared of new dogs she meets on walks. That being said, Flo will open up (and even play) with other dogs if she is given time to adjust at her own pace.\n\nFlo is ideal for a home that will give her plenty of time to open up, understanding that she will display her wonderful personality when she is ready. In addition, she will benefit from people that are home often and that are willing to continue her training. However, more than anything else, Flo needs a family to love her unconditionally.\n\nFlo is only an option for those who have had a dog as an adult. If there are children they need to be over the age of 10.\n2/2/21 5:36 PM",

She loves attention and will nudge you with her nose softly to get those much desired pats. Athena is dog friendly but is also perfectly content on her own as well.  She loves her walks and enjoys seeing people, other dogs, and squirrels along the way! She is crate trained but prefers to roam around the house to choose which bed she prefers best. She loves to play.  She also loves to eat and will help herself to your food too if given the opportunity. Overall, she is a very loving dog who really wants to be close to her owner at all times.  Athena would do best in a home where she gets plenty of exercise and time outside.\n\n\nWe are a RESCUE GROUP, not a shelter, and all of our animals are in foster homes. To start the adoption process, email us at adoptions@earstexas.org requesting an application. Submitting an application does not commit you in any way, but helps us make the best match between people and our available dogs. Your current or past dogs must be inside dogs who have been spayed/neutered and are on heartworm prevention.\n\nAll of the dogs in our program are inside dogs and are completely vetted including all vaccinations, spayed/neutered, free of internal parasites, microchipped, heartworm negative and on prevention before adoption. Our adoption process includes an application, check of vet records or personal references, interview, neutral site meet & greet with the dog and your family, and a home visit.",

You can make an appointment to meet available dogs at our ADOPTION CENTER by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet and available cats at MEOW PALACE by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet1. \nFor animals in FOSTER homes, please submit an online application and an adoption team will reply with next steps. We thank you for your patience as we work to keep saving lives during this difficult time. \n\nPLEASE VISIT THIS WEBSITE TO FIND THE ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE: http://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-forms/\n\nWhat a face!

This fee includes spay/neuter and microchip. \n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\n We also provide free online workshop with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria/Falls Church/DC area. Start your new dog out on the right foot with this valuable, expert guidance FREE!\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program",

Because of a painfully-infected mouth and eye, she has recently had many teeth removed and her eye enucleated. However, Bonnie feels like she has a new lease on life! The day after her surgery she was happily snuggling with her human friends and even making some canine acquaintances!\n\nBonnie does require some unique care: she is very skittish, and though she likes people, she is prone to dart away if she feels startled (which is often). She is not yet housebroken, and when let outside, she must be leashed at all times. Despite her age, she is a fast runner!\n\nBecause of her small frame and delicate limbs, Bonnie needs a very gentle forever family. She shouldn't be allowed to attempt to jump down from high (to her) places, and she should only use a plastic crate because of the danger wire crates may pose to her tiny legs. Adorably though, she knows her crate as her \"\"crib.\"\"\n\nIf you think you can provide a safe, gentle home for sweet Bonnie, please reach out to PAWS!",

I love to play fetch with tennis balls, but at the end of a play session, I am ready to cuddle. I'm also very smart and already know commands like sit, paw and down! I can be a little shy of quick or over head movements, but am relativley easy going. I may do well living in a home with children, but I would like to meet them prior to adoption. I am a bit unsure around other dogs and would likely do best with another of similarly low energy. I would also like to meet any canine companions prior to adoption. The Humane Society will be accepting applications for my adoption, so if you are intersted in adding me to your family, please email rcorkrin@hswcmd.org today!",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Henry. I'm estimated to be 2 years old and weigh about 35 pounds. Careful introductions are important when I meet a new dog, since I need time to get comfortable. So, I should meet any other dogs in the household prior to adoption. Because I was reported to have attacked sheep before entering the shelter, I will do best in a home with no livestock nearby that might tempt me. I'm really a very nice guy and I already know how to sit and shake on command. For more information or to set up an appointment to meet adoptable animals, please call the Jackson County Animal Shelter at 541-774-6654. The adoption fee is $150, plus $25 for an annual dog license, if you live in Jackson County.",

She is playful and curious. She adores being with people. She loves cuddling on the couch and doesn\u2019t mind being carried around (though I\u2019m sure that activity will be short lived).  She\u2019s doing great with night time house training and during the day is trained to potty pads. I\u2019m sure she will be relatively easy to house train the rest of the way with individual attention.  Tonight I realized that she has really good focus.  While most of her siblings were distracted and climbing over each other, Grace could stay focused on the treat in my hand.  Such an exciting trait in an almost 10 week old pup!\nIf you have questions about Grace please  email us at scroungydogs@outlook.com. If you would like to meet Grace please fill out an application at scroungydogs.com.",

Brees LOVES other dogs, but kitties not so much. He is house trained and crate trained. He would also do well in a home with older/no children as he has some old injuries we\u2019re dealing with. \nSpeaking of which, due to his history Brees comes with a little baggage. He is heart worm positive, but it was caught in the early stages.  Additionally, it was discovered in X-rays that he has an old gunshot wound with the bullet still inside him and a damaged hip. We are awaiting clearance for potential Femoral Head Ostectomy surgery. Hero rescue will support the foster financially through this process. He will require a couple of transports to Towson Vet. \nBut don\u2019t let all of that scare you away!! This young man with eyes that can see into your soul has loads of love to give. His injuries don\u2019t slow him down either, even if he probably should ? when he is not playing with any toy he can get his paws on, he\u2019s snuggled up to you as close as he can. He sleeps politely next to me all day while I work. He\u2019s even a little spoiled and sleeps at the foot of the bed, but I think he deserves to be spoiled after how much he\u2019s gone through. Can you add this big handsome hunk to your family and help him through recovery? Be his hero ???? \n\n\n\n\n https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/HRMD/Dog",

            "description": "All of our dogs are spayed/neutered, shots current (DHPP, Bordetella and Rabies where applicable), dewormed, flea and tick treated and microchipped.\n* If you are interested in a dog, please first read the biography on the dog (keep scrolling down for the bio!) and then go to our website, www.dpsrescue.com for an application. Our adoption fee is $400-$800. Each biography will specifically list the adoption fee.Adoption Fee: $650\nMeet Dua! Dua is named after the pop singer Dua Lipa and she is a 1 1/2 - 2 year old Corgi and Jindo mix and hails from Korea! We work with a rescue in Korea that saves dogs from the meat market, meat farms and the local city shelter where few dogs are every adopted. She is currently about 27 lbs, and could not be any sweeter. This good girl doesn't have a mean bone in her body. With her love of nap time and snuggles, Dua is just the pup for a low energy person who wants a companion to keep them company and give them cuddles all day long.\n\nDua tends to be very shy and timid when meeting new people. But, don't worry! While she may start off this way, she comes out of her shell if given the time. Her foster says that she took 3-4 days to open up. Once she does come out of her shell, Dua transforms into a complete cuddle bug. She now likes to spend her time getting belly rubs from her foster or curling up for naps in her foster's lap. She is a big couch potato! Even better, despite her cuddly nature, she isn't too much of a velcro dog and is capable of spending time entertaining herself. She is perfectly content just being next to you or in your room while you work or sleeping in her crate. On top of her wonderful personality, Dua is very food motivated and is a sucker for treats this comes in handy when gaining her trust and training her.\n\nSpeaking of training, Dua is working on some basics with her foster. She is now completely potty trained and has not had a single accident in the house. She walks decently fine on leash but she may pull a bit and zig zag because she loves sniffing and exploring! She does not seem to be reactive to dogs but she may be a bit shy walking or passing by strangers. Lastly, she is not a nuisance barker or whiner and tends not to chew unless you give her something interesting to nibble on. Her only area of improvement is her confidence. She will need continued socialization in order to improve her comfort level with new people.\n\nDua has also established a daily routine with her foster:\n\"Her daily routine consists of her waking up around 7am and then we go out for a 45 min-1 hr walk around the neighborhood. After our neighborhood walk, we will feed her around 8am and she has a very good appetite and always finishes her breakfast. From 8am to around noon, she is now content taking a nap or being a couch potato. We will take her out around noon just for a breath of fresh air and a potty break. All afternoon until early evening around 5pm, she continues just to loaf around and nap. Sometimes she will come up to you for belly rubs and kisses. Around 5-6pm, we will take our evening walk around the neighborhood to get some exercise. We will then feed her dinner and she continues to finish her meal. In the evening, she will join us on the couch for some television time and she will curl up against you to make herself comfortable. We will tuck her in around 10:30pm-11pm and she will happily stay in her crate and will sleep through the night.\"\n\nDua has done well with the dogs she has met so far. She also lived with multiple dogs in Korea. She is currently living with a dog in her foster home and hasn't had any issues. While she doesn't like to play much (with humans and dogs), she loves to snuggle up with her foster family's husky. Too cute!\n\nDua is ideal for a home that will give her the space she needs to open up the first few days. She will also benefit from a home that is willing to give her some basic training especially helping her to learn commands like \"sit\", \"down\", and \"stay\". However, more than anything else, Dua needs a home that will give her the unconditional love and attention she deserves.\n\nDua is only an option for those who have had a dog as an adult. If there are children they need to be over the age of 8.",

He currently weighs 27 pounds and will be about 60 lbs when fully grown.  Hank has lots of love to give!\n\nHank is a typical puppy\u2014adorable and super playful. He loves toys and will play independently or with other dogs. He makes sure to let you know when he wants to play.  Hank really needs an active family and one with another playful dog.  Hank can get nervous when meeting new people so will need a family to reassure him.  He will do best with kids 8 and up. \n\nHe is a very smart boy that will need consistent training to be the best Hank he can be. Hank is doing great with house training but the occasional accident should be expected due to his young age. He sleeps well in his kennel at night but isn\u2019t a very big fan of his kennel during the day. He prefers to be with his people when they are home. He knows \u201csit\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d and is working on mastering \u201cleave it\u201d.  \n\nHe would do best in a home with another dog to play with and a fenced-in yard. Hank has been introduced to cats in his foster home. He has not been aggressive towards the cats but does think it\u2019s a fun game to bark at them and get in their space. Hank is looking for a family that will give him lots of ear scratches and playtime. \n\nHank is neutered, microchipped, and current on his vaccines.  His adoption fee is $175.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Hank and make him a part of your family, please contact ForeverYoursOKC@gmail.com.",

Zeb and his three long-time house mates were surrendered by their family to a kill shelter because they were expecting their third child and could not be bothered with them anymore! Ugh! The saddest! All the dogs are so incredibly sweet and loving and friendly. Jeb is so precious and sweet. He is happy to go for a stroll and then crash on his dog bed. Zeb is 5yo and approximately 55lbs. If you are looking for an easy going pal that loves to lounge but also go for a long adventure in the great outdoors this is the guy for you. If you are interested in adopting this great guy and maybe even one of his pals, fill out the application at finalvictoryrescue.com.",

He is a little overwhelmed here at the shelter and likes to make friends on his terms, but is a great companion for those he loves and trusts. He lived with other dogs, cats and chickens and seems to have personality that gets along with all. Poncho is house trained, was good with polite visiting kids, but would really like a home with no kids. Pancho is a very kind and affectionate soul, he just needs your patience while he settles into his new home.\n*If you are interested in adopting Pancho please call the shelter (509 662-9577) to set up an appointment to meet him",

            "description": "This little cutie is Pal.  He is a Border Collie mix, maybe with cattle dog and lab. We are not exactly sure what his DNA says, but we know he is a super cute, loving puppy ready to find his forever home.  At around 13 lbs now, we think Pal will be in the range of 50 lbs when full grown.\n\nBorn in early November 2020, Pal is happy, and loves food, playtime and people. He is smart and active, looking for a family that will include him in everything they do.  He will need great socialization to help him grow into a well-mannered adult dog.  Pal is no couch potato \u2013 he wants to walk, hike, camp and live an active life!  He will also need opportunities to learn through obedience classes and mental engagement (trick training, games, puzzles).\n\nPal absolutely needs a canine sibling in his forever home to help build his confidence and model great behavior. Because of his sharp puppy teeth, homes with older kids will be considered. For his safety, we will also prefer homes with physically fenced yards: he is too young for invisible fencing.\n\nFamilies that work outside the home need to include information in their application about how they will accommodate potty training because Pal may not be left home alone for more than a few hours a day. \n\nPal is located in the Minneapolis, MN area. If you think you're a good fit for him, please fill out an application at hoabcr.org/how-to-adopt \n\nAs a foster-based rescue, we do not have a central facility to visit. Meet and greets with specific dogs are arranged once your adoption application (not an inquiry email through Petfinder) has been received, processed, and approved. We are located in Minnesota and adopt to an area 400 miles from Minneapolis/St. Paul.\n\nThe adoption fee for puppies is $400 + MN sales tax. This fee includes spay or neuter at the age of 5 months at one of our veterinary clinics. Puppies are up to date on vaccinations at the time of adoption.",

She will flop down and just chill and loves stretching out on a cold floor. Coffee is low to medium energy and enjoys getting cuddles. She is food-motivated (and very gentle taking treats), so she should be easy to train further. She is great on a leash. She likes some other dogs and plays gently with those she likes. Come meet this beauty today at LifeLine Community Animal Center, 3180 Presidential Dr., Atlanta.",

            "description": "Ellie Mae's owner purchased her as a young pup from a breeder to be a guardian on her farm. Ellie Mae had no interest in being a guardian, escaped the barn daily to go roam and visit the neighboring farms. Ellie Mae's owner did not want her to get hit by a car or injured/shot on a neighboring farm. She wanted her to have a family of her own where she could be a companion dog and live her best life so she contacted us. \n\nElle Mae is a Great Pyrenees/Aussie mix and we think probably some Husky in her too with that curly tail! Ellie Mae is a very smart girl and a bundle of energy. She LOVES people and other dogs, and is just fine with cats. She has not been around small children. If you love to run, go for hikes or to the lake, Ellie Mae is your girl! She loves water and also loves agility. She had some agility training from her owner. Elie Mae listens well, comes when called and is an affectionate girl. She does well on a leash and is house trained. Ellie Mae will come to you spayed, up to date on vaccinations, up to date on flea/tick preventives, and microchipped. \n\nApplicants must have a secure and visible fence. In order for your application to be approved you must pass a home check and a vet check which includes having at least a two year vet history. Ellie Mae can be adopted in Missouri and surrounding states: Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and Arkansas. We are able to transport Ellie Mae to those states. \n\nBeing fostered in Lawrence, KS",

He has been neutered, had a hernia fixed, cherry eye fixed, and has had all shots.  Toby will need an active family with a securely fenced yard.  He is very fast and can give a good chase.  A home with no small kids is best as he has sharp teeth and can nibble on you. Toby will need some house and leash training.  Toby is a sweet boy that will make a great addition to a family.  \n\nWe are taking applications for Toby at this time.  You can find our online application at bestbuddypetrescue.com.",

I am a neutered male that is up to date on my vaccines, plus I have been micro-chipped in case I ever get lost. I'm really shy when we first meet but once I get used to you it becomes a different story. To be perfectly honest, I have to be the baby of the family. I am really submissive with other dogs and children but I get along good with adults. I would also prefer that I get placed into a house rather than an apartment or condo. If you would like to come and visit with me to see if you want to take me home I am hanging out in the Sternberg dog runs at Cascades Humane Society. If you fall in love with me you can take me home for $310.",

Missy and her three long-time house mates were surrendered by their family to a kill shelter because they were expecting their third child and could not be bothered with them anymore! Ugh! The saddest! All the dogs are so incredibly sweet and loving and friendly! Missy is the most precious of the group! She is happy to take long naps on her dog bed. Missy is 6yo and approximately 50lbs with medium energy. She likes to play and go for long walks. If you are looking for an easy going pal that loves to lounge but also go for a romp in the great outdoors this is the girl for you. If you are interested in adopting this great girl and maybe even one of her pals, fill out the application at finalvictoryrescue.com.",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

As a result, the vets had to amputate his back leg, but he is learning to get around just fine! He is sweet but is a bit shy meeting people for the first time. He would do better with older children in the home. All he wants is a nice fluffy bed where he can enjoy watching some Netflix with his new family. Come check him out!

Dino loves walks, attention and rides well in the car. He has a beautiful mixed chocolate brown coat. He appears to be a blend of shepherd, chocolate lab and Chesapeake bay. Dino would do best in a home that has had prior dog experience. Dino has been working hard on overcoming his fear of men. He is a very good dog and will make an excellent walking and couch companion. We have not tested him with kids or cats. He appears to do okay with some other dogs. \n\nDino is neutered, micro chipped and current on vaccines.  His adoption fee is $375\n\nPlease submit an application if interested in adopting! https://www.onangelswings.org/application-to-adopt/",

Max had never been neutered (he is neutered now), his skin was in horrible condition, he had horrible ear infections in both ears which have now been treated. Max's skin was in horrible condition because he clearly has allergies that have never been treated or tended to so this has  been going on his whole life. Max has been started on some medications and medicated baths to help with his skin and he is doing much better. This will require attention the  rest of his life, the good thing is he is tiny (he weighs 9.6lbs) so the meds won't cost as much as a large dog.   \nMax also has horrible teeth, he likely has never had a dental in his life and his teeth are rotten. We are trying to raise money to have a badly needed dental done on Max, if you would like to donate please contact vegasdobes@aol.com or Brenda at 702-596-9293\nMax is a little love bug, he is extremely sweet, he just wants a soft place to spend the rest of his days. \nFor more info please visit our website at www.LVDDR.com for info about adoptions and/or email Brenda at vegasdobes@aol.com\n\nMax could really use a sponsor,  if you are interested in sponsoring Max please contact Brenda at 702-596-9293 or  email the address provided,",

Prior to my arrival I was living with my previous owner, and lived very happily with his children. The staff here on the ranch like to describe me as a \"great big lovable boy! I love to play with other dogs, regardless of their size. While I think I would love to be a part of any family, I would probably be the best fit for a family with older children, as sometimes I am unaware of my size and strength. I am a very big Great Dane who would be thrilled to be matched with an experienced Dane owner who is aware of our unique needs and abilities. Because of my size and energy level, I really do require a big yard to run around in, or maybe even a farm! I'd love a busy lifestyle where I can constantly be involved in the family's activities. I love people, so whether you'd like me to be your official greeter in your home or if you'd like to bring me out and about with you on your daily activities, I'm your guy. I appear to be mostly potty-trained, and always keep my kennel nice and neat. I have also learned to love going on long leashed walks here at the ranch, and I can't wait to start doing the same with you!",

I've unfortunately have been brought back to TCRAS a couple of times because it takes me a while to adjust to my new home. My friends here at the shelter absolutely adore me. I've heard them talking about me needing a family who is going to be willing to take me to a trainer to help me build up my confidence; they also mentioned that a family with another dog might be helpful as well. I've had a really hard life and the only thing I want is to find a new home that is loving and understanding. I love getting pets, licking hands and Going on short walks.\n \nI just need some time. If you think I might me a good fit for your home please give the shelter a call at 719-686-7707 to schedule an appointment to meet me.",

Greta is a husky mix and 42lbs. Greta has had a journey over the last 3mths, she traveled from a rescue in California to a rescue here in Oregon, she arrived in mid November 2020. Greta was then adopted in early December 2020. Greta ended up at HBPets after she was picked up running loose in Yamhill County. Sadly her new adopter didn't want her back and her Oregon rescue didn't have space for her, so she became an HBPets kid. \n\nWhat we have learned about Greta, she is so so sweet, very intelligent, loves activity, eager to please and really just melts your heart. As she is a husky she needs a home with lots of outdoor activity, like hiking, running, agility training. She is young and doesn't want to hang out in a kennel or inside all the time. She would make someone a great running partner. She has been around children 12yrs and older, seems to like other dogs, unsure about cats. \n\nAs with all young Huskies if they are not getting physical activity daily, they will try to escape, they are not meant to be kenneled all day and they do like to chase other animals like squirrels. As with any dog, they should not be allowed off leash until you have a strong bond with them. \n\n\nMy adoption fee is $225\n\n1. Do you rent or own your home? If you rent can you provide a letter from your landlord stating you can have a large dog. \n2. Do you have a fenced yard? Do you have a large yard? \n3. How many people live in your home and age groups\n4. How many animals and types live in your home \n5. Have you had a Husky before? \n6. Our you active outside the home?\n7. Do you have time to take her for walks everyday or interact with her? Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: White Weight: 42lbs Age: 3yrs 0mths 0wks Animal has been Spayed",

            "description": "Woof! My name is Royal. So, let me tell you up front, I like to chase cats and do not like to share my food. A home without other dogs may be best for me. Now with that out of the way, if you are looking a medium sized companion to hike, run or just play with in the yard, here I am! I about a year and a half, all black and weigh 34 pounds. I'm neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and heartworm tested. My adoption fee is $99\nIn response to the social distancing recommendations from the CDC and WHO, the Roanoke Valley SPCA is modifying our adoption procedures. With these new restrictions, we do our best to be as fair as possible. Pets are adopted on a first come basis. Our challenge is to find homes for the pets in our care as quickly as possible so we can help other pets in need. With the increase in cases in Southwest Virginia, adoption hours are Thursday-Saturday between Noon and 7 pm. Unfortunately, we are unable to hold pets nor guarantee a pet will be available at the time of your appointment, but we do promise to call you if a pet is adopted prior to your appointment.\nIf you are interested in adopting me, please compete our online Adoption Application. Please book your appointment to meet me. Our adoption staff will give you a call to confirm the appointment and answer any questions you may have prior to the meet and greet.\nCall 540-339-9247 Monday - Saturday between Noon and 7 pm to speak with an adoption counselor for more information.",

We aren't sure what breed they are but we do know that they came from a house with several unaltered small breed dogs, so they should stay small as well. They need a patient owner who is ready to work on basic training and housebreaking. Puppies take a lot of time and commitment, so keep that in mind if you are interested in adopting one. \nIf you like to meet Spritz, please head over to our website www.animalcaresociety.org to fill out an application.

PLEASE LEAVE US A VOICEMAIL IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO REACH US. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING.- CCDP STAFF**\n\nHi there. My name is Alex. I'm about 1-2 years old and I weigh about 50 lbs. \nI was abandoned by my owner, then surrendered to the pound. \nI am a very sweet boy. I am very energetic and would do best in a home where I could get plenty of exercise. \nI love people and I get along well with most other dogs. \nI am very clean in my kennel at night and appear to be housebroken.\nIf you're looking for a sweet dog to add to your family, please consider adopting me.\n\nOur adoption fee is $150.00. The pound DOES NOT accept checks for adoption fees. We're able to accept cash for adoption OR Visa/ Mastercard/ Discover Card. A convenience fee of 2.39% will be applied to all credit/ debit card adoptions. If you intend to do a foster-to-adopt, the fee must be cash. ALL dogs/puppies adopted from our shelter will receive their parvo distemper vaccine, bordetella vaccine, rabies vaccine (if aged at 12 weeks or older), be dewormed with a 3 day course of panacur dewormer, be microchipped, receive their current Ohio dog license and will be spayed or neutered. ALL DOGS/PUPPIES WILL BE SPAYED OR NEUTERED unless a health issue prohibits the surgery from being performed. Not all dogs posted for adoption are spayed/ neutered yet. If you're driving a long distance to adopt, please verify that the vetting process has been completed and dog you're interested in adopting is still available for adoption. The above mentioned vetting is all included in your adoption fee. The adoption fee and what is included in the adoption fee is NON-NEGOTIABLE.\n\nAdoptions MUST be done at the pound and in person as there is paperwork to fill out and an adoption contract that must be signed by the adopter. This means you must be willing to travel to our shelter to adopt.\n\nIF the dog you're interested in adopting has medical conditions or injuries which require medical treatment, we ask that you help with the medical bills so we can continue to help the dogs coming in who need additional vet care.\nWe are a county run shelter, therefore we cannot control our intake or the health or behavior of the dogs that come in to our shelter.\n\nAlthough we try our hardest to place all of our adoptable dogs, there are certain circumstances in which any dog in our care could be euthanized at any time and without further notice (IE: sudden untreatable medical condition or injury, temperament or behavioral problems which may not be apparent when the dog first arrives, lack or space, etc.), therefore all dogs at our shelter should be considered urgent. The adoption of a more highly adoptable dog will mean more time for the less adoptable dog in the kennel next to him!\n\nShelter hours are: Monday-Friday: 8 am- 4 pm\nSaturday: 8 am - 11 am.\nSunday: 8 am - 11 am.\nAdoptions are always welcome during hours of operation. We will make special arrangements for adoptions in advance.\nThere is nobody in the office on Saturday and Sunday, so therefore we are unable to answer or return phone calls over the weekend.\n\nCan't adopt a dog? We would love to have more volunteers who are able to spend time with our dogs! The dogs LOVE going for walks and the socialization and exercise helps make the dogs more adoptable.\n\nContact information:\n8455 County Home Road\nLisbon, OH 44432\n(330)424-6663\nEmail: hpecorelli@ccclerk.org",

Our adoption fee is $400-$800. Each biography will specifically list the adoption fee.Adoption Fee: $650\nFern is a 1 year old Dachshund-Beagle mix who weighs 8.7 lbs. She was a rescue from the shelter. She was listed as a stray. This sweet girl is a gem. With her loving, happy, sweet, and playful personality, she has all the best qualities in just the right amounts. She is the perfect pup to brighten up anyone's day.\n\nWhen Fern initially meets new people she tends to be a bit restless, but is always very loving towards everyone she meets. As she spends more time in her new environment she visibly relaxes, becoming much more confident and comfortable with her new people. Her fosters noticed that she became much more snuggly, enjoying napping on laps and spending time on the couch. She is also independent, often choosing to do her own thing if people aren't around to entertain her. Once she gets comfortable, she generally slows down and becomes very chill and low maintenance.That being said, Fern is not a couch potato! Her personality is a wonderful balance of playfulness and cuddliness and she lets both aspects of who she is shine through. She now loves to play with little balls and bounces around the house chasing them, all the while with her cute little ears flopping around.\n\nFern has been working on some basic training with her foster. She is currently completely house trained, crate trained, and walks well on the leash. She is also not a chewer or digger so far. Her only area for improvement is her barking. While she doesn't bark all the time, she does have some tendencies that are in the process of being addressed. She tends to bark at her reflection in the mirror and growls at cat videos on the TV :) She also sometimes barks for attention, which her fosters always correct with a firm \"no\".\n\nFern has also established a daily routine with her foster:\n\"Fern likes lazy mornings. She is in no rush to come out of her crate in the morning, sometimes deciding not to go downstairs with me at 8:00 but rather waiting for my husband to go down later around 9. She enjoys her breakfast and is happy to go on a walk right away or wait until later. She sleeps if we are busy and plays if we are willing to play. And she prefers to go to sleep by around 7 or 8, which is very early for our family, so she will often just go into another room to sleep on the couch, or come sleep on one of our laps until we take her up to bed. She goes into her crate with no fuss and sleeps through the night.\"\n\nFern was in the shelter with other dogs and initially on intake was with other dogs in our rescue. While out and about walking she generally ignores other dogs. She doesn't have a need to address them and clearly doesn't show any signs of distress. Fern is a great option to live by herself as she currently is or join a home that has an independent dog.\n\nFern has a subluxing patella. Right now it doesn't there isn't anything to be addressed. Some dogs live their entire life with it (most) and never require surgery. Some dogs later on do. It's common in small dogs. (It's where the knee pops out when running and causes the dog to skip) However, more than anything else, Fern needs a family that will give her all the love and attention she deserves and desires.\n\nFern is an option for a home that has had less experience. If there are children they need to be over the age of 8.",

            "description": "All of our dogs are spayed/neutered, shots current (DHPP, Bordetella and Rabies where applicable), dewormed, flea and tick treated and microchipped.\n* If you are interested in a dog, please first read the biography on the dog (keep scrolling down for the bio!) and then go to our website, www.dpsrescue.com for an application. Our adoption fee is $400-$800. Each biography will specifically list the adoption fee.Adoption Fee: $600\nBetty is a 2 year old who weighs 9 lbs. She does shed. She came into our rescue very pregnant and had her puppies within days of arriving. This darling girl has been such a good mama to her pups, and now it's her turn to find her forever home! Betty came to us from a hoarding situation, where she and her ten siblings were left in a backyard, and thus emerged undersocialized. In her foster home, with love and patience, she has learned that people can be trusted. Once she trusts you, expect to be greeted in the morning with kisses and cuddles. When she is given a lot of time and space to feel comfortable, Betty is a super playful, goofy, sweet pup. This will take time and does not happen immediately.\nBetty is looking for a family that will give her the time she needs to know she is safe. When she first arrived in her foster home, she was very skittish. Her foster family just let her develop trust on her own time and, as a result, Betty now allows them to pick her up, trim her nails, and give her pets. Developing trust happens by allowing her the first week to just adjust to the home. It doesn't mean forcing her to go on walks, forcing her to interact in any way with people. Rather in her foster home she had an xpen area and she stayed in there until she began to adjust. No one was constantly trying to pet her or touch her or force her to interact and so she formed trust much sooner than had the fosters tried to force interaction. By the end of the second week she was a completely different dog with them.\nBetty wakes up around 8-9 AM, greets her puppies and has breakfast with them. Then she'll run around the house with the resident small dog, Squish. She likes to nap under the coffee table, in any tight corner of the house, her crate, or on a pile of toys. She follows her foster family around the house at a distance just to see what they're up to. Betty needs to be approached thoughtfully, as sometimes when spooked, she will run and hide. At night she has free roam of the house so she can take a potty break (she is potty pad trained) and come back to sleep in the bedroom.\nBetty was very excited to stop nursing her puppies because she could then go outside on short walks around the neighborhood. Leash training is a work in progress, but she has improved a lot already. She tends to stay close to her foster family's feet or walk around them in circles. Betty is not afraid of the outside world at all! She's a brave girl. There is construction right outside her foster house now, and she doesn't seem to mind the noise or people who walk by.\nBetty is a very skilled table surfer, and any food left on the table is hers if within reach. Her puppies taught her a bit about play, so eventually, she will likely enjoy some chew toys to play with, especially toys that have treats hiding inside. Betty is also a very good climber and escape artist, so doors will need to be shut and any holes under the fence will need to be patched up. Her foster family is currently working on keeping her calm whenever the front door opens so that she doesn't feel the need to bolt out. Betty likes to scavenge for trash in the garbage can (especially when bored), so all doors need to be kept closed at all times. She will bark if people come home or come downstairs just to alert the family, but responds well with verbal cues to be quiet.\nBetty is a social butterfly with other dogs! She gets along incredibly well with one of the foster family's resident dogs. She cleans his face, climbs all over him when she sees him in the morning, and likes to eat out of the same food bowl as him. Having a friendly dog at home definitely helped her come out of her shell. On the other hand, the other dog is old and grumpy, so she knows to stay away from him - so respectful! Betty is also scared of the resident cat and wants nothing to do with her, which works out because the cat wants nothing to do with her!\nWith time, Betty makes for a wonderful, sweet companion. She just needs time and space.\nBetty is only an option for a home that has had a dog in the last 5 years. If there is a resident dog who is confident that is a bonus. If there are children they need to be 12 and older and have grown up with dogs in their home (not just visiting other's dogs).",

I might be young, but I\u2019m already learning so much - I am crate trained, walk really well on leash and learning commands like \u201csit\u201d and \u201ccome\u201d. I\u2019m still not fully potty trained, but getting better! I get scared when meeting new people and dogs, but once I know you\u2019re friendly, all I want to do is play and cuddle!  I will need a friendly dog in the home to continue my confidence and keep me company.  \n\nPACA is a foster based rescue with no shelter to view our dogs.  We have temporarily stopped all our public adoption events due to COVID-19, however we are still placing dog into loving homes by private appointment with approved applications.  \n\nCompleted applications will be given to the foster to coordinate meetings as everyone feels comfortable.  This application helps us get to know you and your family a little better so we can find the perfect match! Application are found here:\nhttp://nmpaca.org/images/pdf_files/PACA_Adoption_Application.pdf\nPlease email completed applications to pacadogs@aol.com \n\nAll our animals are spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for tic born illness and heartworm prior to adoption.

PLEASE LEAVE US A VOICEMAIL IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO REACH US. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING.- CCDP STAFF**\n\nHi there. My name is Claire. I'm about 5-6 years old and I weigh about 51 lbs. \nI was found in the East Liverpool area after a call was placed to the police department about hearing a dog barking in the woods. I was found tied in the middle of the woods with no food/water/shelter. There were no houses near by. \nI am a very timid girl, but very sweet once I get to know you. \nI get along with some but not all other dogs and should meet any other dogs I would live with in my new home, prior to adoption. \nIf you're looking for a sweet dog to add to your family, please consider adopting me.\n\nOur adoption fee is $150.00. The pound DOES NOT accept checks for adoption fees. We're able to accept cash for adoption OR Visa/ Mastercard/ Discover Card. A convenience fee of 2.39% will be applied to all credit/ debit card adoptions. If you intend to do a foster-to-adopt, the fee must be cash. ALL dogs/puppies adopted from our shelter will receive their parvo distemper vaccine, bordetella vaccine, rabies vaccine (if aged at 12 weeks or older), be dewormed with a 3 day course of panacur dewormer, be microchipped, receive their current Ohio dog license and will be spayed or neutered. ALL DOGS/PUPPIES WILL BE SPAYED OR NEUTERED unless a health issue prohibits the surgery from being performed. Not all dogs posted for adoption are spayed/ neutered yet. If you're driving a long distance to adopt, please verify that the vetting process has been completed and dog you're interested in adopting is still available for adoption. The above mentioned vetting is all included in your adoption fee. The adoption fee and what is included in the adoption fee is NON-NEGOTIABLE.\n\nAdoptions MUST be done at the pound and in person as there is paperwork to fill out and an adoption contract that must be signed by the adopter. This means you must be willing to travel to our shelter to adopt.\n\nIF the dog you're interested in adopting has medical conditions or injuries which require medical treatment, we ask that you help with the medical bills so we can continue to help the dogs coming in who need additional vet care.\nWe are a county run shelter, therefore we cannot control our intake or the health or behavior of the dogs that come in to our shelter.\n\nAlthough we try our hardest to place all of our adoptable dogs, there are certain circumstances in which any dog in our care could be euthanized at any time and without further notice (IE: sudden untreatable medical condition or injury, temperament or behavioral problems which may not be apparent when the dog first arrives, lack or space, etc.), therefore all dogs at our shelter should be considered urgent. The adoption of a more highly adoptable dog will mean more time for the less adoptable dog in the kennel next to him!\n\nShelter hours are: Monday-Friday: 8 am- 4 pm\nSaturday: 8 am - 11 am.\nSunday: 8 am - 11 am.\nAdoptions are always welcome during hours of operation. We will make special arrangements for adoptions in advance.\nThere is nobody in the office on Saturday and Sunday, so therefore we are unable to answer or return phone calls over the weekend.\n\nCan't adopt a dog? We would love to have more volunteers who are able to spend time with our dogs! The dogs LOVE going for walks and the socialization and exercise helps make the dogs more adoptable.\n\nContact information:\n8455 County Home Road\nLisbon, OH 44432\n(330)424-6663\nEmail: hpecorelli@ccclerk.org",

This big boy just turned 6 years old on Christmas Day (his DOB is 12/25/2014) and he is looking for a new forever home. \nRiddick  was given up because his mom lost her job in Las Vegas and had to move to  California (she was able to get a job there) but her tiny apartment does not allow big dogs. \nRiddick was raised with cats and small dogs and does great with them, he is good with large breed female dogs as well.\nRiddick was raised around children as well as does fine with them except he  does not like to be hugged, he has a very strong reaction to being hugged and we therefore think he should not go into a home with small children, older kids who would understand not to hug Riddick should be ok.\nThis boy is very sweet and well mannered and polite, he is housetrained and dog door trained as well. \nIf you are interested in meeting Riddick please email Brenda at vegasdobes@aol.com to request an adoption application.    Please visit our web page at www.LVDDR.com to view our adoption requirements. There is an adoption fee of $400.00 required at the time of adoption.",

I am a little bit shy at first and I will need some time to be comfortable in my new home. I was around other dogs in my previous home that weren't very nice to me, I don't seem to mind some dogs here at the shelter. If there are any dogs in my new home I will need to meet them to see if I want to be friends! I would do fine with older children that play nice with me and if I have some time to get used to them I could like cats too! I like to have a nice blanket to curl up on when I am ready for a nap! I do like to play with toys but I will destroy them if they aren't durable! I love to get treats and I will take my time eating them! I am looking for a patient family to adopt me I am ready to check out my new home today!",

He came into the shelter with his buddy Sasha and seems to like all the other dogs. He is between 1 and 3 years old and weighs approx 50#.  Since he is high energy, a home with older children would be best. \n\n\nFOR ADOPTERS: please contact Kelly, our Adoption Coordinator, with any questions at taylorcodogs@gmail.com or inquire directly via Petfinder. There is a link to our online ADOPTION APPLICATION on our Petfinder home page. You may also request an application via email. Paper copies are available at our shelter.\nWe always recommend a meet and greet with our dogs available for adoption. We are not able to assess dogs with cats since we are set up for dog intakes only. If you have cats, we advise a proper introduction while keeping the dog on leash in your home.\nWe are volunteer-based, so please be patient with our response time.\n\nFOR RESCUES: Taylor County is rescue friendly! If you are a rescue, please contact our Rescue Coordinator, Diana, at deed1123@aol.com\n\nDONATIONS: We are always in need of donations to help care for our dogs. We feed IAMS Adult Mini Chunks (green bag) and IAMS Smart Puppy. If you can assist financially, please mail a check payable to Taylor County Humane Society at PO Box 243, Grafton WV 26354 or visit our website to donate via PayPal. http://www.tchswv.com/donations/",

She went unclaimed by her owner, even though we left messages that she was at the shelter. Sophie is ready to find a new home, where she will be loved and spoiled and have a family to spend time with, She is a wonderfully sweet and loving girl. She will need to be an inside dog with a secured fenced yard to have supervised play and exercise time in. She loves other dogs, loves play time, will need an active family, and needs some training. She's a fun girl. We believe she will be great with kids but a meet & greet is always needed. She does walk on a leash once you're able to get 1 on her, since she thinks that part is a fun game, and she is working on her housebreaking skills.\n\nSophie is current on basic vaccinations including Bordetella, been dewormed and is microchipped. She has tested Negative for Heartworms. \n\nSophie is scheduled to be spayed on 2/4/21 and will receive her required Rabies vaccination at that time. She will need about a week to recover from her surgery before leaving to a new home. applications are being accepted..\n\nFor more information, please contact the City of Corsicana Animal Shelter at (903) 654-4928. The shelter is open Mon, Tues, Thurs and Fri from 12:00pm - 6:00pm and on Sat from 12:00pm - 4:00pm.",

            "description": "To apply to adopt, please go to www.adoptgoodkarma.com/adopting/ and fill out the online application. \n\nLilly is 6.5 years old. Her owner recently passed away. She is 91 pounds. She can be shy at first but warms up quickly. She is spayed, heartworm negative, up to date on shots and preventatives. Due to her size we are recommending she be with kids 13 and older.\n\nShe is part of our foster to adopt program. The rescue will cover her getting vetted by our veterinarians during the foster period. If it is a love connection the foster gets first dibs to adopt. Please fill out an application if you are interested in fostering her. Typically the adoption fee is $300 but if you foster and decide to adopt we show our gratitude by providing a $50 discount plus her vetting.\n\n\nPlease do not send inquiries asking if animals are still available, if you see it online, that means it is.  We only post available animals.  In order to adopt one of our puppies or dogs, an application must be filled out prior to being invited to meet the dog.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nPlease note that these animals in most cases are abandoned and therefore breeds and sizes are our best estimates based on years of experience.  Many times we do not know the parents, so we are guessing.  If you are looking for a specific breed or size maybe rescue is not for you, it is very possible you will adopt a puppy we say will be medium size and the pup may be smaller than estimated or may be larger than estimated.  We do our best but many times we are wrong so please beware of this before rescuing from us.",

She came into the shelter with her buddy Spencer and seems to like all the other dogs. She is high energy and would probably do best with older children. She is approx 45# and between 1 and 3 years old. \n\n\n\nFOR ADOPTERS: please contact Kelly, our Adoption Coordinator, with any questions at taylorcodogs@gmail.com or inquire directly via Petfinder. There is a link to our online ADOPTION APPLICATION on our Petfinder home page. You may also request an application via email. Paper copies are available at our shelter.\nWe always recommend a meet and greet with our dogs available for adoption. We are not able to assess dogs with cats since we are set up for dog intakes only. If you have cats, we advise a proper introduction while keeping the dog on leash in your home.\nWe are volunteer-based, so please be patient with our response time.\n\nFOR RESCUES: Taylor County is rescue friendly! If you are a rescue, please contact our Rescue Coordinator, Diana, at deed1123@aol.com\n\nDONATIONS: We are always in need of donations to help care for our dogs. We feed IAMS Adult Mini Chunks (green bag) and IAMS Smart Puppy. If you can assist financially, please mail a check payable to Taylor County Humane Society at PO Box 243, Grafton WV 26354 or visit our website to donate via PayPal. http://www.tchswv.com/donations/",

Veterinary/Medical expenses are constant for an animal rescue. Our adoption fees not only help to provide vetting and care for the animal being adopted, but they also help to cover heartworm treatments and other treatable ailments that many animals, that would otherwise be euthanized, need in order to be made available for adoption.\n\n\n\nPlease understand that adopting an animal is a LIFETIME COMMITMENT to that animal and there will be veterinary expenses throughout their life that can often cost several hundreds, if not thousands of dollars (without pet insurance), especially without annual checkups and preventative care.\u00a0 As a potential family for this pet you are responsible for their safety and that includes keeping them on your property.\n\n***If you are not in the middle Tennessee area, transport can potentially be arranged to approved homes, depending on distance and local adaptability. We normally do not allow adoptions outside of 1.5 hours driving distance.\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt, foster, or aid in the rescue efforts of RARE!",

She should arrive in February or March. Constance MAY be cat friendly.

            "description": "Dobie 's owner surrendered him because of financial reasons but 3 days later felt she was shattered, got a job a new place and pleaded to get him back. We gave him back but only a short month later, he comes back to the rescue. The owner had a breakdown and has now been hospitalized and Dobie is a bit out of sorts. We knew before he needed to lose weight and has allergies. He did get allergy treatment but we are still noticing some scratching. It had been a month since he received the allergy injection so we gave him another and put him on medication and had his thyroid retested. He remains on thyroid medication as well as allergy medication. He does get a little food possessive, whenever food is around, towards other dogs and does seem to have some separation anxiety. He needs a home to keep up with his allergies and someone who is home more and will adhere to a diet to get him to lose the weight. He now needs a stable environment that will stick with him until the end. He is about 9-10 yrs of age. He is a happy guy and really loves his walks. He can go miles.\n\nadoption fee is $200 Adoption fees go back to and cover all of the medical for all of the dogs. All dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated and micro chipped upon adoption and many have received further treatment for such things as lump removal, severe ear infections, leg injuries, etc..\nFor more information or to submit an adoption application, please visit our website at http://www.southernnevadabeaglerescue.com . We are also on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/SouthernNevadaBeagleRescueFoundation . Come meet and play with our available dogs at Las Vegas area dog parks. Times and locations can be found at http://www.meetup.com/beagles-207/ . Contact us or check our Facebook updates ahead of time if you are interested in meeting a particular dog. All our dogs are in foster homes so not all are available to attend all our park meetups.\nOur meetup group playdates allow you to socialize your beagle with his/her own breed at dog parks with large fenced areas where the beagles can run and play off-leash.

            "description": "Star had a very sad life. She lived in a rabbit hutch and was solely used for breeding. Where she was, her life was only valued by how many puppies she could produce for profit. She spent 9 years in that box. When her owner passed, no one knew she was even back there. About 3-4 weeks later, a utility worker spotted her. By then her hay had so much urine and feces on it, that lime grew and she ended up with chemical burns. She had parasites and heartworms. She has been treated for all of that. She was transferred to us from our Mississippi partners. She recently had a veterinary evaluation to see if any medications could be adjusted or taken away. She was taken off of heart meds and we treated her for an ear infections. The doctor believes she is mostly deaf and blind. We have her scheduled for a badly needed dental and a fistula repair ( meaning there is a hole between her mouth and nose)Once that is done, she will be ready for a home. What Star needs is a forever home where she will be loved and kept safe and warm.\n\nadoption fee is $200 Adoption fees go back to and cover all of the medical for all of the dogs.

Please fill out your application at Hhfrescue.org The adoption fee includes vaccinations, bordetella, deworming, rabies, spay/neuter, microchip, a lifetime registration of the microchip, and sales tax. If adopting a puppy, the rabies and spay/neuter will be done at the same time by our vet once they are 4 months old and billed to us.

He does really well with other dogs, both male and female. His foster family doesn't have any cats so we aren't sure how he interacts with them. He loves children but does tend to get overexcited when the space is encroached on.\n\nBunker loves to play fetch but also is quite quick and will attempt to follow you out the door. He is a sweet, fluffy boy who can't wait to find his forever home!\n\nPlease visit our website if you would like to s\nubmit an adoption application.\n\nBunker's Adoption Donation Fee is $350. Bunker is neutered, current on all vaccinations, has received a wellness exam and is microchipped.\n\nI Dream of Home Rescue, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) Non-Profit Organization.\n\nTAX ID: 81-0780050\n\nI Dream of Home Rescue\nPO Box 7612, La Verne, California 91750\n\nwww.idohr.org\n\nwww.facebook.com/IDOHR.ORG",

Sociable by nature, she enjoys human (including children) and canine companionship and will greet you with a wagging tail while holding a toy in her mouth! She is always ready to play and is the right balance of walking buddy and couch potato.\n\nZoey is housetrained and crate trained and has a tendency to follow her nose. Containment is KEY for this girl, so a fenced yard is required. She is reportedly good with cats, although not living with any in her foster home. She is just a great family dog!\n\nPlease fill out an application at www.maggiesmissionrescue.org.",

She has heartworms that are being treated. Her old owner surrendered her to fur babies knew she had heartworms and a bad ear infection they said they wouldn't treat it and she was to old to breed to old to hunt so they didn't want her. Fur babies wouldn't stand for this we took this baby in and we are making her healthy. She has a lot of love to give and is still a little spunky and likes to play. With her age she does walk a little different in the back but run and plays just fine. Reilly gets along with dogs and kids. Old souls are the greatest souls there are. This baby only wants love and a family to share it with. Her adoption fee is $85.00. If you would like to adopt Reilly go to www.furbabiesadoptions.org print off a application and email it back in and a Rep. will be with you shortly.",

(We are still getting to know Riley, but he seemed pretty fearful of other dogs and needed space to be comfortable). \nRiley cannot be in a home with small children (or visiting grandchildren), no exceptions. He would be fine with children age 12 and up, but can and will be snappy with small children who get into his space.\nHe is house trained and crate trained and would make an ideal pet for a family with a quiet home and who are willing to allow him time to settle in and get comfortable.",

Athena was born around September 2020 and is ready for a furever home! \n\nPart of the fun of adopting a puppy from an animal rescue is the surprise that comes along with their growth. Their size at adulthood is simply a guess and cannot be guaranteed. When you adopt a puppy from GPG, we trust that you will love and care for this animal regardless of their actual adult size and physical appearance.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Athena, please visit our website to learn about our adoption process and to fill out an application, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs and cats will be micro-chipped, spayed or neutered, and up-to-date on vaccinations at the time of adoption. \n\nFor more photos of Athena, follow us on Facebook Gateway Pet Guardians and Instagram @gatewaypets ... #gpgAthena. \n\nTo view other adoptable pets from our shelter, please visit, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\nGateway Pet Guardians is proud to offer a variety of mixed breed dogs available for adoption. However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

Tokyo was born around September 2020 and is ready for a furever home! \n\nPart of the fun of adopting a puppy from an animal rescue is the surprise that comes along with their growth. Their size at adulthood is simply a guess and cannot be guaranteed. When you adopt a puppy from GPG, we trust that you will love and care for this animal regardless of their actual adult size and physical appearance.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Tokyo, please visit our website to learn about our adoption process and to fill out an application, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs and cats will be micro-chipped, spayed or neutered, and up-to-date on vaccinations at the time of adoption. \n\nFor more photos of Tokyo, follow us on Facebook Gateway Pet Guardians and Instagram @gatewaypets ... #gpgTokyo. \n\nTo view other adoptable pets from our shelter, please visit, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\nGateway Pet Guardians is proud to offer a variety of mixed breed dogs available for adoption. However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

In playgroups with other dogs here at the shelter, I have been social and playful. I've already learned some commands and know how to sit, shake, and lie down. For more information or to set up an appointment to meet adoptable animals, please call the Jackson County Animal Shelter at 541-774-6654.

            "description": "Hi, my name is CHICKADEE and I would love to meet you. I am a Spayed Female Pit Bull Terrier. The shelter staff think I am about 1 years and 0 months old. I have been at the shelter since Oct 16, 2020. Meet Chickadee! This pocket pittie is slowly gaining her confidence in a loving foster home. She has had a rough start in life, and she is looking for a family who is willing to give her a steady routine, as familiarity is where she finds safety and success. She would like a quiet adult-only household with shy/fearful dog experience, who will go to the moon and back for her. Chickadee likes to be told what is a happening and when, as she is very unsure about most things in life, and communication helps her understand. She may do well with a friendly pup in the home - a pup that is able to read her body language and give her the space she needs. She just needs to learn the joys of a warm bed, and a loving home. For more information about Chickadee, please email adoptions@thehumanesociety.org",

When I meet new people, I like to greet them by jumping up and giving kisses, playing games, and running around in circles. I even like meeting some dogs, too! When I get very excited, my tail wags so fast youd think I was going to take off! I also really love food. I love eating food almost as much as I love playing games, and boy do I like playing!

DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF APPS/INQUIRED WE RECEIVE, WE WILL NOT RESPOND TO APPS/INQUIRES THAT DO NOT MEET THE CRITERIA FOR THIS DOG. Thank you! \n\nMeet Alba!\n\nAlba is a pocket pittie at approximately 40 lbs and around 2 years old.  She is spayed,  up to date on vaccines and microchipped.  Poor girl was found as a stray with a large open head wound seeping with infection, fractured skull, and very skinny.  Her wound is a distant memory to her now as it\u2019s just the last of the scabs healing now.  She has already gained over 10 lbs and looking and feeling great!  She would do best with dogs her size and bigger as she likes to be a bit bossy and play rough with her dog friends.  She is a dominant female who would do best with male dogs or submissive females that don\u2019t mind her being the more dominant one.  She is crate and house trained.  She needs help with her manners like jumping and mouthing, she is making improvements on it but will need an adopter to continue with that as well.  Because she is still working on her manners we recommend kids 10 and up.  Cats are unknown but we can cat test her if needed.\n\nAdoption fee is $250.00. \nAdoption application & home visit required.  Alba requires a fenced in yard. Adopters must live within 30 miles of Cleveland. \n\nIf interested in Alba fill out an app on our website www.muttsinarutrescue.com",

I'm the kind of guy who would be perfect for all of your outdoor adventures. I've not spent too much time indoors, so it may take some time for me to get used to inside living. I have lived with other dogs before but I may be very selective about which dogs I'd like to be friends with. I'm old enough to be considered a senior but I've got lots of spunk. I will need daily exercise to keep me happy. I like playing with toys but I'll need some extra strong chew toys to use. I will lean up against my human friends when I want some pets and really like being scratched behind the ears. I'm looking for an active family who can keep me feeling young!

I have so many names! And I know them all! Officially my name is Xena Princess Warrior Wiggle Butt, but you can call me Xena for short, and also wiggle butt, and wiggle. My best quality is eternal happiness- I have never been sad, well until anyone leaves the room. I don\u2019t know what they are doing but I have followed my humans back and forth ten times! I\u2019m not perfect- I like to collect things- but I don\u2019t chew them up, I just bring them to my human. Ok I am naughty cause I like the way toilet paper feels when I pull it apart- that\u2019s why they call me naughty, Whatever that means. But they say naughty and then they say pankin and I tuck my ears and chase my tail- but I don\u2019t know what that means- I just like to act like nothing is wrong so I act cute. It works every time. I almost forgot! I have a windmill tail! It\u2019s shaped like an S and when I wag it I create energy like a windmill and my butt wiggles SO SO much! My humans look at me and wiggle and I wiggle back. If they say wiggle wiggle wiggle I go crazy! I love the sound of kisses so when I play I make that sound when I grab my toys. I want to sleep in your bed and if you let me I will sit on your lap!\n\nOur organization only adopts within the United States.\n\nFaith and Hope is a multi-state rescue with locations in Texas, Washington and Oregon. All dogs are rescued from the state of Texas to and transported to our Washington and Oregon locations with placement in their adoptive families. Our $475 adoption fee includes all core vaccinations \nDHPP, rabies, spay/neuter, microchip)\n\nIf interested in learning more, please email us at faithandhopeadoptions@gmail.com or fill out our online application.\n\nhttps://www.faithandhopefoundation.org/adoptionapp\n\nIf interested in learning more about our adoptable dogs and adoption process, or our foster home program, please contact us at above email.\n\nDue to the number of requests that we receive on our puppies and dogs, please be advised that all adoption applications are processed in the order received. Once we send you an application, your place in line does not get reserved until your application is returned to us.\n",

I have so many names! And I know them all! Officially my name is Xena Princess Warrior Wiggle Butt, but you can call me Xena for short, and also wiggle butt, and wiggle. My best quality is eternal happiness- I have never been sad, well until anyone leaves the room. I don\u2019t know what they are doing but I have followed my humans back and forth ten times! I\u2019m not perfect- I like to collect things- but I don\u2019t chew them up, I just bring them to my human. Ok I am naughty cause I like the way toilet paper feels when I pull it apart- that\u2019s why they call me naughty, Whatever that means. But they say naughty and then they say pankin and I tuck my ears and chase my tail- but I don\u2019t know what that means- I just like to act like nothing is wrong so I act cute. It works every time. I almost forgot! I have a windmill tail! It\u2019s shaped like an S and when I wag it I create energy like a windmill and my butt wiggles SO SO much! My humans look at me and wiggle and I wiggle back. If they say wiggle wiggle wiggle I go crazy! I love the sound of kisses so when I play I make that sound when I grab my toys. I want to sleep in your bed and if you let me I will sit on your lap!\n\nOur organization only adopts within the United States.\n\nFaith and Hope is a multi-state rescue with locations in Texas, Washington and Oregon. All dogs are rescued from the state of Texas to and transported to our Washington and Oregon locations with placement in their adoptive families.

I just arrived in New Hampshire from a crowded southern shelter and can't wait to experience a wonderful life with you!\n\nI'm a petite, 3 year old black brindle with the most beautiful brown eyes. I weigh 47 lbs., am spayed and current on vaccinations. I can be a tad bit shy at first but I quickly warm up to really nice people. I'm a happy girl who loves to walk (although, the cold weather up here will take some getting used to for me!). I'm finding toys to be really fun as well! What I want the most is your affection. I really want to be your best friend and I promise to shower you with kisses and wiggles!\n\nI will need to meet any potential canine siblings to ensure compatibility. Children ages 10 older would be best and I need a cat-free home. \n\nWe kindly ask, if you have questions regarding Tiger, PLEASE EMAIL:\n\nadoption@popememorialcvhs.org\n\n*************************************************\n\nHow To Adopt a Pet\n\nWe are currently offering adoptions by appointment only, due to the Coronavirus. The Adoption Center remains closed to drop-in visitors.\n\nThe process to schedule an appointment begins with the submission of an application, which can be found on our website. Once the application is approved, we will reach out to you to schedule an appointment. Please bear with us, the new process has slowed our response time.\n\nIf you do not see an animal that would fit into your home, we highly recommend checking our website weekly as new animals may become available. We do not offer a waitlist for specific breeds, types, etc. \n\nAs always, adoptions are first come, first serve, meaning the applicant who is approved first gets their choice of available appointment times and thus his/her choice of animals to meet and adopt. We are not able to extend holds on any animals at this time, so we ask interested adopters to make their adoption decision during their appointment and be prepared to take their new pet home with you.\n\nThe easiest way to communicate with us with any questions is via email to: \n\nadoption@popememorialcvhs.org\n\n\nNo phone calls please - Submit an application here ----> \n\nhttps://popememorialcvhs.org/adoption-application\n\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.

He recently came to us from one of our rescue partners in Mississippi, so we don't know much about his past, but we are sure his future is bright! He has been diagnosed with heartworms and has begun treatment for them. Our vet staff will be happy to speak with you about this if you decide to meet with him. Benson loves to play, but also loves to curl up with someone and just be pet. If Benson sounds like the pooch for you, apply to meet him today!\n\nThank you for your interest in our adoptable animals! Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we do require appointments to see our adoptable animals. Please complete the adoption application and a Customer Care Associate will be in contact with you. PLEASE NOTE: We ask that when you submit your application, that you are available to schedule an appointment within the next 24-48 hours.",

I like going on walks, but just need to learn a little bit about manners and leash training. I mean, how do you guys not jump around when you're excited?! I know how to sit for my treats and I am really nice about taking them gently. So when are we going to go work out? Come by the shelter today and meet me!",

That is until the great people at Texas Humane Heroes took me in. I have spent lots of time with the ladies here and I am slowly learning to love people. At first, I didn't know what a leash was. It SCARED me! I can still be nervous when I get leashed up but I also know that means I am going to go for a walk which is something I have learned to love as well. Come spend some time with me and see if I would be a good fit for you. I think I like other dogs but they would need to be calm. I am not sure about kids yet. It would probably be best if I was in a home with older teens and adults only. I appreciate you coming to take a look at me.",

Nellie wants to be your new best friend and hiking or running buddy, and is ALWAYS down for a car ride. She's a smart girl and would love an adopter who can keep her physically and mentally active. One thing to know about Nellie: she is very dog-reactive and will not be a good fit for dog parks or doggy daycare. She would do well with an adopter who can continue her training exercises to learn how to disengage from the sight of other dogs and instead focus calmly on her human. But even if she isn't social around other dogs, she makes up for it by being VERY social with people! If you have a home without other dogs, cats or children under 5, Nellie would love to meet you!",

Fill out and submit our online Adoption Application.\n2. Please only submit ONE Adoption Application. (Our Application is for general pre-approval, not for a specific adoptable animal).\n3. Once received, the Allen County SPCA will review your application. Applications are reviewed in the order they are received.\n4. We will contact you to let you know your Adoption Status and schedule an Adoption Appointment. Applications may take up to 1-2 days to process. Please give us a call at the shelter at 260-744-0454 if you have not heard back from us within 48 hours.\n5. If you haven't found your perfect match at the shelter, that's okay too - pre-approved applications are valid for 6 months!\n\nCome prepared! Please bring proof of a current rabies vaccine for all pets living in the home. If you have another dog, you are welcome to bring him or her with you so that we can safely perform a dog interaction.\n\nUnfortunately, animals cannot be held for you.\n\nA Special Note from the Allen County SPCA:\nRemember, pets are a lifelong commitment. We at the Allen County SPCA ask that you take adding a furry family member to your home seriously, and do your research on the different breeds before adopting. We also ask that you are able to keep up on yearly vaccinations, monthly preventatives, a good diet, daily exercise, training, and most of all, LOVE. If you ever have an issue with a pet that you adopted, please contact us right away; we may be able to help, or we can put you in touch with someone who can. All set? Come in and adopt today!",

It is unknown at this time if she is spayed. \n\nIf you believe this is your missing dog, please contact the shelter at (541) 689-1503. Since this dog is new to the shelter and we are still looking for their family, they are not viewable on the adoption floor at this time.\n\nThe shelter staff is giving me some time to settle in and adjust to this new place. As we get to know each other a little better, the behavior team and veterinary staff will then be evaluating my needs. Please stay tuned for my updated information!\n\nOur shelter software requires that we choose a primary breed for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs can be unreliable and for most dogs we are only guessing at their primary breed. We get to know each dog as an individual and do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not breed label.\n\nThis pet is located at Greenhill Humane Society. 88530 Greenhill Road, Eugene, OR 97402 (541) 689-1503.

She will be spayed, and is already up to date on vaccinations, dewormed & micrchipped. \n\nLea has lived her whole life outside on a chain with a dog house to shield her from the elements, but her owner recognized that is not enough and turned her over to us to find a better home. She will require a fully fenced in yard, and an active family. \n\nShe is good with kids, had no reaction to the lazy cat in the foster home and is learning to trust people. She has also met 3 dogs individually, and done considerably well. Her foster will continue to allow her supervised play time with their personal dogs to socialize her. She is also learning what living indoors is like. She is working on leash skills, and crate training, as well as potty training. If you think Lea would be a good addition to your family, please apply at thepitbullpen.org",

We suspect this adorable redhead has multiple breeds in there some boxer? some beagle? who knows what else. He's a small dog, fully grown at 25 lbs. Spago loves to run and play. He needs a home with a physically fenced yard for high-speed zoomies. Spago is dog and kid friendly, but will chase kitties. Spago is not well-suited to apartment living. If you'd like to meet this beautiful boy, please fill out a foster-to-adopt application at dreamhouserescue.org.\n\nAll of our fully-vetted adoptable dogs go to prospective homes for a one-week trial foster-to-adopt period to make sure the dog and home are the right fit before an adoption is finalized. We only adopt dogs into homes where all current pets are spayed/neutered and current on vaccines and heartworm and flea and tick prevention. We do check veterinary references to make sure adopters are compliant with standard veterinary care.",

            "description": "**This is a courtesy post for Australian Shepherds Furever Rescue. Please see further in the bio for adoption instructions**\n\nSweet Delilah, an Aussie/cattle dog mix, is looking for a family who will love and cherish her. Through unfortunate circumstances, she has had 4 homes in the past 4 years, including time at a city shelter. That hasn\u2019t stopped her from loving and trusting people, however, as she adores her humans. We\u2019re told she\u2019s around 10 years, but you\u2019d never know it by her energy level and love of playing.  \n\nDelilah\u2019s foster mom says she loves to play fetch and run in the yard. She loves squeaky toys, especially her squeaky pig. She enjoys going on walks and likes to explore. She hasn\u2019t met a stranger and is excited to see people on walks. Sometimes she\u2019s a little too excited and wants to jump on people but stops when reminded about all 4 on the floor. She loves to be near her person but isn\u2019t anxious or needy about it. She also loves soft things, like chairs, couches, beds, and her memory foam dog bed. When her foster parents are tired from playing, Delilah sometimes makes her own fun by chasing her tail. She\u2019s only actually caught it once, then looked at foster mom as if to say, \u201cwhat is this?\u201d  \n\nShe knows her basic commands and is happy to show you \u201csit\u201d, \u201cstay\u201d, \u201cpaw\u201d, and \u201cdown\u201d. Her foster family says she can be trusted out in the house when they\u2019re gone, and they haven\u2019t had to crate her. She is completely housetrained.  \n\nDelilah will be an excellent companion for someone who can give her all the love and attention. She needs to be the only dog in the home and cannot live with cats. She was not given proper opportunity to exercise in her prior home, so she\u2019s been working on getting back to a better weight and has made great progress. She\u2019s working on losing another 10-15 pounds (currently 68) and will need her family\u2019s help to do this. After the first few days in her foster home, realizing there was no 24-hour all-you-can-eat buffet, she\u2019s settled into and really enjoys her exercise routine.  \n\nDelilah has been given a clean bill of health from our vet. She is up to date on all vaccines, spayed, microchipped and heartworm negative. She is on monthly heartworm, flea and tick preventatives.  \n\nDelilah is being fostered in the St. Louis, MO area. If you\u2019d like more information or are interested in meeting her, please fill out an application here\u2026 http://www.australianshepherdsfurever.org/adoption\u2026",

            "description": "Sweet Rosalie came to us with her buddy Opal as unclaimed strays. While they would love to find a home together it is not a requirement. Rosalie is an affectionate lady looking for love. She can be shy at first and likes to greet people at her own pace. She appears to be housebroken and/or crate trained from what we have seen here at the shelter. She knows some basic commands like sit, shake, lay down and drop it. She is treat motivated and has nice leash manners. She does well with her buddy Opal but seems unsure of other dogs. If you are interested in meeting Rosalie, please submit an adoption form found on our website: FairfieldCountyDogs.com. Once received, we will contact you to arrange a visit.

The new family will be required to complete a basic obedience course of their choosing. The pup's adoption fee is $375.

ARF is an all volunteer organization. Due to a high volume of applications, we are often unable to respond to questions until your application has been approved.

I adore food, so training should be a cinch. I'm not a fan of sharing my stuff and because of this, I will not be able to go to a home with exposure to children. I can be jumpy when I get to know you, but training can help with that. I would do best with an experienced owner that can give me the support and structure I need. Are you willing to take me to training classes to show me the ropes? If so, please fill out an inquiry to come meet me.",

This overly social juvenile pup is as sweet as pie. She was found as a stray on the Wind River Reservation and no one came to claim her at the Paws For Life Riverton shelter. She is a happy go lucky girl that is still a puppy and will benefit from some training and consistency but will make a great adventure buddy. She has done well with all walks of life so far and can't wait to find her forever home!\n\nPlease note, Animal Adoption Center cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have no history prior to them entering the rescue.

If we feel that an animal and a potential owner are not a good fit we reserve the right to refuse adoption.\n\n-For more info on this pet, to fill out an adoption application, and find out who we are and more our adoption process, please go to our website www.animaladoptioncenter.org  \n-We require potential adopters to foster a dog for at least one night prior to adopting once they have an approved application submitted.\n-We welcome out-of-area adopters, but please be aware we do require prospective adopters to come to our facility and meet the animal in person. You may either foster the dog locally in pet friendly lodging (preferably with any other dogs you own) or if you choose to drive the dog back home you agree to drive the dog back to Jackson if the dog isn't a good fit. Before you make the trip we encourage you to fill out an adoption application and submit it, to be sure you will qualify to adopt. Adoption applications can be filled out on our website. We cannot \"hold\" any animal. We have a \"first qualified adopter can foster first\" policy. \n-We will not ship animals. \n-Feel free to send over an inquiry or fill out an application for a dog you are interested in!\n\nPlease note, Animal Adoption Center cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have no history prior to them entering the rescue.
