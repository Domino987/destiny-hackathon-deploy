            "description": "Suki is a gorgeous white dog with black spots and big, sweet brown eyes. Her coat is soft and silky.\n Suki is a gentle, low-energy sweetheart who loves leisurely walks and relaxing. She is quite independent, no-nonsense, and spends the majority of her days resting and napping. Because of partial hearing loss, she has a loud Woof, so she would do best in a free-standing house rather than an apartment or a condo. \nShe is completely house-trained and can be left unsupervised and uncrated with no issues. Suki has been the only pet in her foster home, so her ability to live with other dogs, cats, or young children is unknown. However, on our daily walks around the neighborhood, she is great when meeting other dogs, has a couple of toddler-aged human friends who give her full-body hugs and treats while she wags her tail, and even has a neighborhood kitty friend who walks up to her and flops on his back while she sniffs and nuzzles him. \nWe have had a couple of doggy playdates, and Suki wears out pretty easily and has trouble settling with another dog around. She would do well as an only dog, but may be able to live with a calm canine companion. Suki occasionally barks to communicate with her people that she wants food or to go outside. \nMost details of her history are unknown, but it is clear that she has had multiple litters of puppies. In just a few short months, Suki has transformed from timid and depressed to happy and bright-eyed. This strong and gentle girl now wags her tail, gives kisses, and loves being petted.\nSuki is an absolutely adorable dog, and will make a wonderful companion in her forever home. She just needs a loving, caring home where she can relax, continue to blossom, and lead a secure and happy life.\n Suki was surrendered to a rural shelter.\n Read more about Suki on the Independent Animal Rescue website at https://animalrescue.net/dogs/d-20-170/.",

I am spayed, heartworm negative, current on shots, micro-chipped and on flea/heartworm prevention.  I have also had a negative fecal.  My adoption is $200.\n\nMy owner passed away and his elderly mother can no longer take care of me.  I am really hoping that I can get a new home pretty quickly!  I am a bit shy (hence the spelling of my name). \n\nPlease email for an adoption application.  Once the application is approved, we will arrange for you to meet and adopt. \n\nWe do not adopt out of state.\nDue to many bounced checks, we now require that adoption donations be cash only.  However, if you make a general donation to the organization (not associated with the adoption of a pet) we do accept checks and paypal.  If you are unable to adopt right now, won't you please make a donation to help care for the pets?  THANK YOU!!",

She is up to date on shots, spayed, heartworm negative and weighs in at 10lbs.  \n\nRiko came to APAC almost naked due to fleas and poor nutrition. Her hair is returning.  She has some hearing and vision loss.  She can see shadows and that is enough to see her human 6ft away and run to them.  Don't let all that fool you. Miss Rico is the most confident and independent girl you could meet. She uses the doggy door with no problems.  She loves to wander the yard and and uses her nose to tell her what is going on.  She maneuvers the house easily and following her human to \"help\".  Rico will bark to let her wishes be known, like time to eat, time to snuggle and hey the doggy door is closed. She loves to dress up in pretty clothes. \n\nRico hasn't been with children under 10 but enjoyed the ones she has met.\n\nHer adoption fee is $125.  If you are interested in meeting Rico, please send your application to myhappytail@yahoo.com.  Applications are found under the How to Adopt menu on our website at www.myhapptyail.org\n\n",

This snuggle queen will find a way to burrow into the best spot on the couch with you. She is very content to lounge on the sofa for hours, and her cute snorts will let you know she is happy. When not in lounge-mode, Alexa would love to join you on a car ride, or tag along to hang at your favorite lunch spot. She gets excited by tennis balls and does zoomies around the yard to show you she wants to play. She is happy to entertain herself with toys and bones while you do your work. Alexa loves to meet new people and dogs, wagging her tail and wiggling that big body. She likes to greet people with a lick on the face. She is especially good at using a sad puppy face and her big, pretty eyes to get the attention she wants - usually a belly rub, her favorite activity! She loves going on walks, and does an adorable prance. She is a great sleeper, if a bit of a bed hog. She is fully house-trained, and very comfortable in a crate. Alexa would do well in a house with adults or older kids. She's also been friendly to other dogs on walks, so should get along well with them. She is undergoing heartworm treatment, at APA!'s expense, and is recovering. Come meet your new best friend - let her win you over with her puppy dog eyes!",

Since then, some of my pups have found homes, but my girl Sophey and I arrived, and we are looking for our forever homes (separately). I'm a sweet dog, who is underweight, undersocialized, and I've only spent time on leash since arriving at FRGSR, so I need work in lots of areas, including dog socialization, obedience and house manners. I've been a doting mom to my pups, and I've been warming up to FRGSR volunteers very nicely. I would love to find a home with a patient adopter who can show me the ropes on many levels. Until now, all I've known is where I've come from where human attention was sparse at best as well as exposure outside of my home. I have to say, that since arriving at FRGSR, I'm loving all the attention I'm receiving, and my hope is to find a forever home soon, but as a mom, I'm hoping for my daughter Sophey to find her home first! My adoption fee is $350 and if you are interested, please go to adoptagsd.org and submit an online application.\n\nAlthough we do our best to keep our adoptable animals page as current as possible,the animals you see may already be in an adoption process.\n\n2/1/21 8:33 PM",

            "description": "Welcome to the family, sweet Lulu!\n\nLulu is an adorable 9 months old female American Staffordshire Terrier/ Cattle Dog\n\nmix. She is spayed, fully vetted, vaccinated, healthy, and weighs about 48 pounds.\n\nLulu and her 4 siblings came to us at 4 months old. At first, she was very timid and a bit shut down towards people, but we noticed very quickly that she was most comfortable around other dogs. We held on to her to help her socialize more and build her confidence while living with another big nurturing dog.\n\nLulu is pretty perfect. She's on the petite side, very fast, agile, and has been training with her foster mom to run on trails. She is an absolute doll and gets along with small and large dogs, kids, and yes, even cats.\n\nWe are looking for an active family with another big dog for Lulu to play with and continue to build her confidence. Lulu is now ready to find her forever home and needs a family that has a home with a large yard so she can run free and play with her toys. Lulu can't be trusted off-leash, being so timid, and will run when she gets scared. In the house, she is gentle and calm, but she needs her daily activity and running to make her happy and at peace.\n\nIf interested in meeting Lulu, please submit a completed adoption application found at www.doggiebonez.com so that we can schedule a meet and greet. She can also be found on all of our social media pages IG: @Doggie_Bonez_Inc_ and Facebook: Doggie Bonez.\n\n\nIf adoption isn't an option, please consider fostering one of our pups. We are a volunteer-run non-profit dog rescue and always welcome new short or long-term doggie foster families. We much appreciate the help and time of our fosters. You provide all the love, comfort, and safety of a home, and we supply you with everything else you may need, dog food, dog bed, toys, medical attention (if required), etc. If you are interested, please visit\nwww.doggiebonez.com\nto see all of our available dogs who need a foster family while waiting for their fur-ever home and complete the foster application.",

            "description": "Roomba is a SPECIAL NEEDS, 8 year old, 12 pound neutered male Pekingese who is paralyzed in the back end and needs assistance urinating several times each day. Roomba is very vocal and would not be appropriate for an apartment, condo, or townhouse. Roomba needs a home with a one level living area and tile, hard wood or linoleum floors. His adopter needs to help him embrace his challenges but continue to encourage his independence. Roomba's favorite past times include hanging with his people, being scratched, going for walks in his wheelchair, sunbathing and rolling in the grass. His special needs requirements are assistance in urinating (he will prop himself on a toilet for this), going up and down stairs, and getting on and off your lap. He loves his independence and is very capable in scooting at a rapid pace or using his wheelchair during outings. Roomba has even figured out how to work sliding into his movement to get places quickly. Roomba wears clothes to help protect his lower extremities from abrasions. He dislikes a drag bag as it inhibits his ability to move easily. Roomba is not appropriate for children. \n\nIf you wish to be considered for this animal, please download an application at http://fallstonanimalrescue.org/adopt/ or email fallstonrescue@aol.com to request one. It can take up to 2 weeks to process an application; we suggest following up by email on the status if you have not received a reply within 3-5 days. We are an all-volunteer based rescue and we ask for your patience if we are slow to respond.\n\nPlease understand that we fit the dog with the home we feel is best suited and will accept multiple applications for one dog. We have strict requirements for families with children under 10 since many of our dogs are grumpy and may not do well with children. Some dogs will have fence requirements, while others may not. It is preferred you are within a 2 hour drive from our Rescue Center in Fallston, MD and preference will be given to local applicants.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment and it is our duty to do our very best to place them correctly the first time around. We do not take the adoption process lightly. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!\n",

            "description": "Bruno is a 9 year old mix rescued from a puppy mill. This chubby boy is now happy, social, and friendly. When he came into rescue he was pretty sick with constant vomiting and lethargy . He had been vomiting whole chickens in addition to various parts of chicken (beaks, talons, feathers, wings etc). He was rushed to our vet the moment he came in due to the non stop vomiting. We discovered he was previously fed the live sick chickens on the farm where he lived so they wouldn't have to buy dog food . As a result he currently has no clue what dog food is and isn't eating great despite being offered dry and canned. He is much happier now and feeling better though, so he's on the right track. He loves people and will happily follow you around and sit when asked. Due to his history of being fed live animals ,he will not be placed with cats or other small animals. He is good with other dogs, but can get jealous if they others are getting more attention than him. \n\nHe will come fixed, chipped, vaccinated, and heartworm tested negative. \n***If you are serious about adopting, you must first complete and submit an application on our website. We will not do anything without a completed application. Do not contact us through pet finder or emails us as All info is contained here***\n\nPlease be sure to read all about our organization before you apply to adopt. If you are serious about adopting you must complete an application on our website. There is information on our petfinder home page and our website www.phoenixanimalrescue.com . Our adoption fee for adult dogs is $450. We will not adopt a pet to you if all of your current pets are not spayed/neutered. This is a non-negotiable policy of Phoenix Animal Rescue",

            "description": "Meet Cleo!  She came to us from a family that didn't have enough time for her because of really long work hours.  She spent most of her time in a crate without receiving enough exercise or training.  She is now in a foster home where she is getting both.  She is a dog with lots of energy so her new family must be active and willing to play ball or take long walks.  Cleo is crate trained, getting much better on leash and LOVES to play fetch.  She is being fostered in a home with other dogs and cats.  She does enjoy chasing the cats so a home without is probably best.  Cleo is a friendly girl that will thrive with a family that can give her the structure every puppy needs.  If you are interested in Cleo please fill out an application at www.placingpawsrescue.org.\n\nBEFORE CONSIDERING A PUPPY FOR ADOPTION:  Please keep in mind that puppies need attention during the day.  They need frequent potty breaks, playtime, socialization and often a mid day meal.  Please consider your daytime schedule before applying for a puppy.\n\nSPAY/NEUTER POLICY:  Our adoption fee covers the puppies spay or neuter at our vet in Libertyville.  If the puppy is adopted prior to the spay or neuter being done you will be required to bring the puppy back to our vet within 30 days for the surgery.\n\nADOPTION FEE: $400.00 The adoption fee includes all age appropriate vaccinations including rabies, HW test if age appropriate, de-worming, microchip, fecal, spay or neuter, Heartworm and flea and tick preventative.\n\nADOPTION PROCESS: PLEASE READ CAREFULLY\nThe first step in the adoption process is to fill out an application online at www.placingpawsrescue.org.\nOnce we review the applications, those applicants that are thought to be a good match will be contacted as quickly as possibly. We ask that you please be patient with us as we are all volunteers. Then a telephone interview will take place, references checked and a home visit will be conducted. We will then arrange for you to meet the dog. We require that all family members, including current dogs meet the dog prior to adoption.  We put all of the known information in the animals description. If the animal is listed on the website, we are still accepting applications for that animal. We only remove the animal when the final adoption paperwork is signed. The best way to contact us is by email at placingpaws@yahoo.com. It is very difficult for the limited numbers of volunteers to return all calls. Thank you. \n",

Must have fenced yard.\n\nResidents of VA, NC, or SC Click to apply for Mora\nPlease Note: This link will take you to Blue Moon Shepherd Rescue.\n\nMy name is Mora and I'm 4 years old. I'm a long haired shepherd with a beautiful silky coat. My foster mom says I'm a combination of a super model, professional ball player and rocket scientist. I walk well on a leash, enjoy car rides and taking adventures.\n\nI know my basic commands and am very eager to learn new things. I take treats gently from your hand and am learning to be patient and wait for my food. My foster mom says I am very smart and when treats are involved I can train all day. Sometimes my foster mom wonders who is training who. I'm a typical female shepherd so I know my own mind but I am loving and very sweet.\n\nI like dogs and hanging out with my foster pack. I've been to the park on pack walks with other dogs and I did great. I'm learning how to settle when I'm out of my crate and need some supervision but, I am not destructive. I would like to be an only dog so I can get lots of love and attention that I never got when I was a puppy. I love petting and affection.\n\nFrom my foster mom: Mora is a wonderful girl. She has come so far and learning more each day. She is learning to trust and starting to enjoy life. Mora is a happy girl, very confident with great nerves and a wonderful temperament. At times, she can be pushy but that's because she is a confident girl but, with light verbal correction she listens. She is very affectionate and super sweet. Mora is a beautiful girl and needs an\nEXPERIENCED HANDLER THAT HAS OWNED PURE BRED GERMAN SHEPHERDS\nand understands the intelligence of the breed.

We rescued him from the Downey shelter where he was a staff and playgroup favorite. \n\nBROWNIE is affectionate and loves getting pets and nuzzles his head in your lap asking for more when you stop.  He is very easy on leash and likes short easy strolls. Brownie is good with other dogs and has a confident easy going grandpa vibe and is happy to watch the youngsters play. See additional video of him when he was at the shelter: https://www.instagram.com/p/CG3Fg8zhHUf/ . \n\nHe recently spent a weekend with one of our volunteers who gave him an A+ report with comments like:\n \"Unbelievably sweet and gentle! He has such a unique personality. He connects with you like you\u2019ve had him since he was a puppy...He settled quite quickly and made himself comfy. I didn\u2019t catch him trying to get into anything, chew furniture, etc...He is such a cuddle bug, really loves affection and rubs...has a very happy, yet mellow temperament.\"\n\nBROWNIE has some arthritis which is currently being managed with medication. He is currently at our kennel and while he's settled in with ease, we'd love to see him live out his retirement years in a nice warm home with a soft bed for his joints. \n\nBROWNIE is neutered, microchipped, and current on shots. If you are in the Los Angeles area and interested in meeting BROWNIE, please fill out our brief online questionnaire (copy and paste link): www.downtowndogrescue.org/adoption-questionnaire\n\nAdditional Downtown Dog Rescue information email: adopt@downtowndogrescue.org or call: 818-407-4145\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Meet Eleanor! Born around February 2019, this sensitive, loving girl will likely weigh around 75-80 pounds after she gets adequate groceries.\n\nEleanor was found wandering the streets of a Dallas suburb. She was dirty, afraid, had scratches on her nose, and had missed too many meals.\n\nEleanor's happy place is with a sweet, calm, nurturing family that is home with her a lot. She is truly an angel. Sher loves being with her people, and she loves being petted.\n\nShe is great with older children. She adores hanging out and relaxing with them. With her family nearby, she enjoys laying in a window seat while looking out into the woods or resting on her bolster bed.\n\nShe would be best as an only dog. She seems to have had bad experiences with other big dogs and tends to go on the offensive. She does not like small dogs at all.\n\nEleanor is house trained. She has basic leash manners. She rides nicely in a car. She is crate trained, but has no need for one.\n\nShe seldom barks, only vocalizing sometimes at varmints behind the fence. She happily comes inside when you open the door for her.\n\nEleanor will be a great family dog. Because she can startle easily and become frightened, she needs a relaxed, serene environment with a sweet, tender forever family. Any children in the home should be laid-back and at least 11 years old.\n\nSPIN Pyrs are all in foster homes in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Potential adopters are asked to make travel arrangements if they live elsewhere. All SPIN dogs are spayed or neutered, current on vaccinations and on heartworm prevention. Please go to our website www.SpinRescue.org and fill out an application for this great Great Pyrenees!",

He\u2019s now safe and sound in our care.  A DNA test on Luke's brother showed that Luke and his siblings are 50% Belgian Malinois, 38% Greyhound, and 12% either Deerhound, Wolfhound, or Borzoi\u2026! \n\nLuke is very sweet, very smart, but also VERY VERY SHY.  He\u2019s looking for someone who will give him time and understanding while he learns that the world is not a scary place. He follows whatever his brothers do and is most comfortable in their company. He\u2019d do great in a home with another dog who can show him the ropes and who wouldn\u2019t mind his puppy antics. He does love to play! Once Luke trusts you, he will almost certainly be a snuggle bug! Right now he is especially attached to his \"foster dad\" at the adoption kennel, and 13-year-old boy here who likes to hang out quietly with him in his kennel. \n\nLuke can jump a 5-foot fence. We are ONLY CONSIDERING homes for Luke that have a minimum 6-foot fence. We are ONLY CONSIDERING homes for Luke where he will not be the only dog in the home. Luke needs a dog-experienced person who can keep him safe and help him learn about the world. He would benefit greatly from a shy-dog socialization class. Luke's siblings are doing great in their new homes and coming out of their shells. Luke needs his chance. He is an adorable boy who has a lot of love to give.",

The staff in the shelter love her. She has even gotten to spend time in the front office. The shelter believes she would be best in a home with no small kids and should be an only pet.  Teagan has been spayed and microchipped.  She will be heartworm tested upon adoption.  She is waiting in run 77.  ID 625835\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information.

            "description": "Snow White is a 9 year old yellow lab that was on the euth list due to a medical concern, but thankfully made it safe to rescue. She is comfortable in her foster home and receiving all the love she deserves. Snow gets alongs with other dogs and children. She really is well mannered and as sweet as they come! \n\nSnow White was recently diagnosed with Cushing's disease, which affects her ability to control her weight and fight infections, among other things. She takes a daily pill for Cushings. And she happily takes it wrapped in a small piece of ham. More details will be posted as vets and rescue volunteers find out more about Snow White.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Snow White is $250. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

Once you\u2019ve earned his trust, Taz is very gentle and affectionate, and friends for life. Taz would do best in a quiet home.

She is not a high maintenance gal. We have put Pippa on a diet since she came to us very overweight, and that coupled with her typical senior pet arthritis is not a great combination! She is feeling and looking so much better these days! \n\nThis sweet girl's personality is really blossoming, she loves to nudge your hand for pets and she snores while sleeping and snorts like a pig when awake! She is super cute, super laid back, and a really gentle spirit who just needs a forever home in which to spend her golden years. Pippa has never met anyone she didn't like. The only time she gets animated is when she sees a squirrel cross her path on walks! \n\nHer human like expressions will keep you entertained just like they do her foster mom! Pippa is house trained, quiet, cuddly, loving, and low maintenance. What is not to love?!\n\nPippa's adoption fee has been fully sponsored by one of her many admirers.\n\nPlease submit an application for darling Pippa today!",

He is friendly with everyone he meets and he is fine with children and is dog friendly.\n\nNote from a volunteer - Yoshi went for a run today at the Blue Hole. We ran 3 miles and it went well. Yoshi pulled a bit (so he needs to run with someone who has a good pace) however, he was so happy all the way. Never stopped wagging his tail. No problems with people or other dogs and honestly at the end he didn't even seem tired. He is great in the car when in a crate (no whining or barking).\n\nYoshi is a sweet 45 pound, 1 year old. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting Yoshi please fill out an adoption application on our website, wimberleywagrescue.org, and someone will contact you.\n\nThank you!",

            "description": "Maggie is a sweet girl. She is 12 years young. She was brought to us by a foster home to find this dear one her forever home. She would do well in a home where she would be with large dogs- or where she would be the only dog in the home. She is good with children. We will get her teeth cleaned and all shots brought up to date promptly.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

She does not understand why things had to change and she is not happy at all.  She has made friends with some of the staff and a few volunteers.  But that can change from one day to the next.  She does like, or should we say, puts up with some, but maybe she'd be happier as a only dog.  ARL just needs to find that right person that will change her mind.  My adoption fee is $125 which includes my spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations,  heartworm disease test,  microchip/registration fee and collar .  ADOPT ME TODAY and find a friend for life!

He has not given reason to believe he is not house trained, however will still need to adjust to any new home setting. Ruger needs to be dog tested before going to a home with another dog. Ruger's former owner says he's already house trained and walks well on a leash. He is crate trained but may have some degree of separation anxiety. He is super full of love and is looking for a human to be loyal to. He understands \"\"no\"\", \"\"sit\"\", and \"\"down.\"\" Ruger is up to date on his shots and his monthly flea/tick medication, neutered, microchipped, and heart worm negative!\nIf you're interested in meeting this animal, please contact us at (972)-450-2845 or addisonanimalcontrol@addisontx.gov! We don't have a shelter so we will arrange a time for you to meet this cutie. Our adoption fee is $10.\n\nCurrently, masks are required at adoption appointments and we request that you limit the number of people at the appointment to 2 people maximum. If you'd like to schedule a video chat appointment before coming to meet an animal in person, please let us know and we can arrange that!",

She's incredibly friendly, sweet, and affectionate. She loves spending time with people, dogs, and cats alike. This girl is the perfect package. Only one thing though she does suffer from some pretty intense car sickness. For that reason Oreo will need to be adopted to a local middle Tennessee family. Her future family will need to understand that she won't be able to travel by car except for emergencies. Oreo is very food motivated and very smart. She should be a breeze to train. Oreo also enjoys going for walks and hikes, so an active family would be her best fit. This beautiful girl should fit in just about anywhere. Oreo is spayed, current on all her shots and microchipped. To be considered for her forever family please contact Vivienne at viviennejames@comcast.net or 615-943-7311.

My name is Dugan,  and I'm a male mixed breed born around October of 2018.   \n\nMy adoption fee is $175.\n\nHanover Humane will only be adopting me to a home in Hanover County, Virginia or a locality that is part of the Richmond, Virginia metropolitan area.\n\nI'm happy, smart, active, friendly, and oh, sooo sweet - however, I'm pretty unsocialized with humans and while I'm VERY friendly and cuddly(I really WANT to be with people), I don't really know what to do with myself when I am. Everything is new to me and I'm so happy to be rubbed and petted,  I just need a patient human who's will to show me the ropes and teach me how to be a good boy. I'm smart and very attentive and want nothing more than to please you.  I'm very affectionate and love attention from people. I seem to like other dogs, but my energy vibe and lack of social skills can irritate other dogs. I'm not a good fit for small children as I would unintentionally turn them into human bowling pins. I'd probably be a challenge for an inexperienced first-time dog owner, but for a dog-savvy owner with some previous experience that's willing to put in a little time with me, I'd make an excellent companion and be your best bud for life.\n\n I've been neutered/spayed, am current on all of my vaccinations (DHLPP, Bordetella and Rabies), tested for heartworms (and am negative) and put on heartworm preventative, and microchipped.  My new owner will receive a month of free pet health insurance at adoption. \n\nIf you are interested in me, please submit an adoption application at www.hanoverhumanesociety.org.",

His owner wasn't experienced to work with Beary's newly developing behavioral issues, so she kept him shut in a bathroom for 12+ hours per day. This treatment made Beary worse and we have had to work for 3+ years to reverse the psychological damage it caused.\nSince back with Rockstar, Beary had improved, but still had preferences with regard to people. He is a very smart, intelligent dog that calculates and sizes you up the second he sees you. (You can see the gears turning, LOL). We opted to move him to a board and train environment where he could get extended help and more one-on-one training.\nBeary is currently residing at our Board & Train facility for behavior modification. Our trainer agrees that Beary is \"special needs\" with regard to behavior. He requires an experienced dog owner, a strong leader and continual training (One day per week)\n\nAny inquiries for Beary will require numerous discussions to explain Beary's needs and go over your family situation; house/apt, family members in the home, other pets, children, etc... Once you have been deemed a good candidate you will then meet Beary at our Board & Train facility and discuss Beary's needs futher with our trainer. \n\nBeary is not for first-time-adopters. He is a WONDERFUL dog who was wronged and deserves a good life with a strong leader and someone committed to understanding and working with him FOR LIFE!\nSERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY",

Keller is about 5 years old who has been diagnosed with advanced cataracts, that he has likely had for most of his life. Since they were left untreated for so long, he is not a candidate for cataract surgery, and has very limited vision. However, you would not know it if you met him. He chases his foster siblings around the yard, finds any food that drops on the floor, frequently follows his foster mom around the house, and has figured out how to open the baby gate. The only treatment he needs for his cataracts is eye drops 3 times a week, which he will allow in exchange for a few treats. Keller has also had a few seizures since coming to Norsled. He is currently taking medication and has not had an seizures since starting it. While it sounds like a lot, 99.9% of the time, he behaves like any other dog.\n\nKeller is a happy-go-lucky boy who gets along well with other dogs. He knows \"sit\", \"down\", and \"in the crate\", uses the doggy door when he wants to go outside, and loves to go for walks. He does well on the leash, but because of his visual limitations, needs verbal warnings when encountering steps or other terrain changes. Like most huskies, Keller is smart, food motivated, and independent. He will follow commands if he feels like it, but is usually easily persuaded with the promise of a treat.",

Below the map is our logo and the link to click on to access adoption forms, contact info or to donate. ALL DONATIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE.\n\n\nAdoption Fee: $150.00\n\n\nThis sweet girl is Sylvia.  She is a Shih Tzu approximately 12 years old and weighs 11 pounds with black and white fur. She's already had her left eye removed and has partial site in her right eye. Sylvia was a stray when SCMR agreed to take her from the animal control that had her.\n \nShe had growths removed from her head and foot, and has had a dental. Sylvia was scheduled for a spay and hernia repair, but the doctor felt, with her heart murmur, it would be best to wait to do the remaining surgeries.  The growths that were removed were cancer, but her veterinarian got clean margins when removing them and said she will be okay from that surgery. We are so happy for her!\n\nShe loves attention and will make a terrific companion. She sleeps all night in the big bed without moving and seems to be perfectly house trained.\n\nSylvia is living in Largo, FL enjoying a new lease on life!\n\n\nNOTE: SCMR DOES NOT adopt to homes with children under the age of 10 years or homes with Electric Fences\n\nOut-of-state adoptions are possible; however, the approved adoptive home is responsible for making the necessary arrangements to pick up their new little one.",

            "description": "Cameron is a very sweet, loving and well-behaved dog looking for her forever home with a fenced in yard! Cameron loves being outside, whether it's in her yard or going for walks. She is still getting used to walking on a leash and does pull some, but with the Easy Walk harness, it's a bit more manageable. Cameron loves being with her people and wants to be wherever her humans are. She'll follow you around the house to be with you and even though she's a bigger dog, she'll climb in your lap and shower you with hugs and kisses. She would prefer to be your one and only pooch in the home.Cameron is not a big eater, but she loves veggies sprinkled on her dry food, especially broccoli, carrots, and green beans, but no peas please. She does great with the cats in her foster home and would do best with someone who is a home body, unless she can go somewhere with you. If you are interested in this sweet girl, you can apply at mpravl.org.\n\nAll Mountain Pet Rescue (Asheville) animals are up-to-date on vaccinations, spayed/neutered and micro-chipped before adoption. Contact the foster parent or Mountain Pet Rescue at pets@mpravl.org for more information.\n\nPlease note that visual breed identification of companion animals has been proven to be unreliable, so for most of our animals we provide a best guess at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each of our animals as an individual and do our best to describe and place pets based on personality not breed label.\n\nMountain Pet Rescue is a 501(c)(3) non-profit tax deductible charity (EIN 82-3039637) located in Asheville, NC.\n\n2/2/21 3:20 PM",

            "description": "Gino is reserved gentlemen pit mix that is around 8 years old, and is around 80 lbs. He was found without the use of his back legs and after examination it looks like it is a permanent paralysis. He has been at the shelter in a playpen area and taken out to potty twice a day. It seems as though he has some feeling in his bladder but unable to control it completely. The staff uses a sling to walk his back end out and once he gets started he is eager to get moving. He will walk around supported and then will let them know to take the sling off to pee. He is pretty good at emptying his bladder, but may need help to prevent infection. Gino does have his own fitted wheelchair, but the shelter has trouble using it because of the stairs. Gino will require extra attention for sure but we think he is eager to try and can have a good quality of life in a foster home. He will warm up to people in time, loves stuffed animals, and a kong filled with stuffing is his favorite. He is unsure with other dogs right now and we think that is because of his paralysis. We really want to give this guy a chance at a great life. We are looking for a home with no little kids, cats or other dogs.\n \nVideo of Gino: https://fb.watch/1IZJuRhOU3/\n\nMy adoption comes with a leash, collar, durable dog toy & up to $100 of training. \n\nFor more information: \nhttps://ws.petango.com/webservices/adoptablesearch/wsAdoptableAnimalDetails2.aspx?id=45638487&css=&PopUp=true",

In October she was handed out thru a car window to a homeless man who also didn't want her. A pretty bumpy year for Lady, we're thankful this man saw the wisdom in helping her find a new and forever home through our rescue.\n\nNow thriving in her foster home, Lady has a very sweet temperament but is timid at first; geez, who wouldn't be after being handed off to so many different people? Despite this, Lady is fluent in giving kisses and just recently found the joy of toys! Speaking of joy; she also got to meet Bruser, another foster in this home and wowza...he's the best thing that's ever happened to her! We should mention; Bruser feels the same attraction to her and has never responded this way to any other dog in the home. They play together constantly and have formed a deep bond. We'd love to see them find a home together, if possible. Lady is not a fan of a crate, but she is crate and house trained.",

He is not afraid to bite a stranger and will not be available to anyone with children or young grandchildren who visit. This boy loves to carry his toys around and go for walks. We are asking anyone interested in adopting him to visit several times so that Marvin can get to know you. At this point he has bonded with our dog associates and is good with them but feels a need to protect them. Please read about German Shepherd breeds and make sure it is a commitment you want for the long run. They are very smart and need a routine and even a job to keep their minds stimulated.\nAll of our animals are tested for disease, microchipped, up to date on shots, given parasite prevention and spay/neutered.

            "description": "Scarlett is a beautiful dog who is looking for an active family. She would do best in a non urban environment. She can be a bit reactive on leash, but can play with other dogs with slow, proper introductions, but needs to be the only dog in the household. She would love to live on a ranch or farm and have a job to do. Her favorite pastime is fetching.\n\nFoster Notes: \n\nScarlett is absolutely lovely. She is super intelligent. She loves people and children (has only been around children 8 years and older, but lots of them). She loves \"her people\" but is completely welcoming to others. She is friendly and open to strangers and invites them to throw her beloved ball. She absolutely loves to play fetch with her ball and can happily play for hours! She now takes treats gently from your hand and patiently waits for her food. She has very good manners and wants to please. Her super high intelligence and sweetness is obvious to everyone who meets her. She absolutely loves to be outside. She is loyal and just loves people. She is beautiful, quick, and athletic and impresses everyone who meets her. We just love her!\n\nShe showed some anxiety traits when she first arrived, like chasing her tail around in a circle when inside. She stopped doing this by day two, although she briefly chased her tail yesterday in a circle when one of our boys moved one of her puppies (this was also inside). She also is slightly obsessed with her ball and asks someone to throw it for her quite a lot. When she first arrived, she would bring us a rock, asking us to throw it for her. We immediately switched her to a ball, but occasionally she will still bring us a rock. I don't think she was used to being inside, as she seems much happier outside. I think she needs a home with direct access to an outside space and a family/person who can devote lots of attention to her. In return she will be incredibly loving and devoted. She is loving, super intelligent, wags her tail a lot, is eager to play and please. \nScarlett is a spectacular, impressive dog and whoever adopts her will be very lucky!",

            "description": "I am a volunteer/foster at VBACAC and just spent two weeks watching Grumbler while his foster dad was out of town. I wanted to share what I learned about this sweet boy. Grumbler was a pleasure to have in my home. He is a velcro dog who will follow you everywhere. He believes he is a 10 pound lap dog and has absolutely no concept of personal space. He is 100 percent house trained and crate trained. Grumbler has some hip issues and did OK on my hardwood floors but he did slip and fall a few times so he would probably do best on carpet (although he does pretty well with stairs). He is a bit of a \"bull in a china shop\" kind of dog who is clumsy and will occasionally barrel into things. He is playful and loves toys. He seems to like other dogs- a small off leashed dog ran up to him and Grumbler was perfect and wanted to play with him. He is not good with cats. He seems a bit hard of hearing, although he can hear some things. He knows how to use a doggy door and he loves car rides. He doesnt bark a lot- I only heard him bark twice when he was looking out the window and saw something he wanted to alert me of. Grumbler has nubs for teeth and is a pretty messy drinker so keep a towel ready. He is pretty good on a leash. He has some skin issues, which is common with blue pitties so his new family should be able and willing to deal with this. Grumbler is incredibly friendly and loves people of all sizes, although with his size and clumsiness, he would probably do best with older kids as he may knock young kids over. Grumbler is an older guy who is still fun and playful but is also perfectly happy to hang on the couch with you while you watch the Super Bowl. He is receiving his last heart worm treatment on Thursday and is ready for adoption. Please call the Virginia Beach Animal Care and Adoption Center to meet him. 757-385-4444.",

She tends to walk low to the ground and \"crawl\" over to you for belly rubs, which are her absolute favorite. Once she is comfortable, it's clear that she also has a lot of energy to burn and will occasionally jump into your lap as if she's a small dog. Callie is an intelligent girl that is eager to please. She knows \"Sit\" on command and walks quite well on a leash. Callie is friendly with big, friendly pups. No small dogs or cats. Older Kids only please.

Please take a moment to read the pet\u2019s ENTIRE description which should answer many of your questions.\n\nROXANNE, 6 yo spayed female Plott Hound, striking golden brown brindle, 55 pounds.  Roxanne, a local girl, is quiet, sweet, and lovable.  She charms all who meet her.  Although she spent her former life living outside, she has adjusted quickly to indoor life.  Children 10 years or older.  As her picture shows, she isn't shy about asking for belly rubs!  Roxanne gets along very well with male dogs.  Her ideal home would have a fenced yard and a male dog to play with.  She is crate trained and housebroken when kept on a schedule.  Adoption fee: $200.\n\nSome of our general policies:  1) Pets can be seen at pet adoption clinics or BY APPOINTMENT TO APPROVED APPLICANTS ONLY.  Application and general adoption fee schedule (exceptions noted in pet's description) at www.capp-petplacement.org .  For our weekly pet adoption clinic schedule, like us on Facebook.  2) For the safety of the dog and children, we generally DO NOT place senior dogs or dogs under 35 pounds in households where children under 8 years old either reside or visit frequently.  3) Note that, unless we have prior records on a rescued pet, ages, grown weight for puppies, etc. are estimates only.  4) If you are interested in a CAPP pet, read CAPP's Program page on our web site which fully explains our adoption process or talk to us at a pet adoption clinic.",

Rocco came to us with an odd wound on his back that is all cleared up. Rocco was a little scared when we rescued him, to help him he has spent 2 weeks in Board and Train with our good friends at Royal K9 Academy. He has excelled and is now ready for a home. Rocco is very well mannered, good with other dogs, has been learning his basic commands and is a very loving guy. Rocco would do best in a home without other dogs as he likes all the attention to himself and kids 8 and up just because the young ones can make him nervous. Let's find Rocco an awesome home!\n\nEmail dogs@labradorsandfriends.org or fill out our online application at\nwww.labradorsandfriends.org\nRocco is located in Southern California",

            "description": "***COURTESY LISTING***\nFor more info about this dog, please contact person listed below.\n\nDuni is a male Australian Cattle Dog and 4 years old.  I took him out of a neglected home in El Paso, TX, where he was tied up on a short rope and wore a shock collar to control his barking.  He received little attention, was malnourished and sunburnt.  He has been in my care since July 2020, in New York City.  I\u2019ve been training him and working on his fears.  He has some basic commands down, sit, stay, lay down, leave it is hit or miss. We play \u2018find it\u2019 often, he\u2019s very good at it.  Duni would really like to be around his owner 100% of the time if possible, he\u2019s as velcro as they come.  He has a lot of potential, just needs patience and training.  I have had him meet other dogs while on leash and all (25 or so) have been positive, except one, my other dog.  She can\u2019t stand him, and they fight. I keep them separated and there is peace in the house.  To meet other dogs, the other dog should be extremely well socialized, and tolerant of ill-mannered dogs (Duni is essentially a puppy, but 44lbs).  He can be fear-reactive towards strangers, but counter-conditioning with high reward treats works, it will take time.  I believe he would excel in a single person or couple household, with no kids or other pets.  He doesn\u2019t seem to want a lot of exercise, just to be with his owner.  He is crated when I am away from home and at night.  I want to find the best possible home for this guy. He's neutered and vaccinated. His adoption fee is $150.

He is a healthy boy who loves to run, is very affectionate and loves to sit on your lap.  . He\u2019s also a very sociable guy, is used to living among multiple dogs, so would do well in a home with a back yard and another dog to play with. \nIf you are looking for a real cutie, have lots of patience and understand that he is still a puppy,   you will have yourself a wonderful, beautiful little dog.

If you have questions concerning a specific animal, PLEASE fill out an application and the foster parent will be in touch. We will not arrange any home visits with any of our dogs and cats until your application is processed. Please understand our foster parents are precious to our 2nd Chance family; without them we cannot function, so we do our best to not burden them with multiple appointments. Our foster parents will choose their top 3 applications and arrange home visits with these applicants. The adopter will be chosen at that time. The process can take anywhere from a week to a month. We want to make sure our little furry ones are placed in their 'forever home' and never have to go through a rehoming again!Well hello there. My name is Salvador and I know it so don't try to change it!!! I am fearless, I know I am the boss (well in my head anyway)! I love attention. I will not live without another dog to keep me company, they cannot be a bully because that would make me very sad :( I have a bum knee that I am too old to want fixed! No anesthesia risks for me!!!I require a fenced yard and a fur buddy. Only local adopters being considered at this time. If you meet my requirements lets have a date and see if the 'stars align' for us!Please fill out an adoption application:\nAdoption application (Dog)\nAdoption Application (Cat)\n\nPlease understand we do not adopt out dogs to\nfamilies with children under the age of 5. We do not adopt dogs to renters. Some dogs will have fence requirements while others may not.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment. The dogs and cats in our system find themselves there, for the most part, because their humans did not have the same loyalty to them as they did to their owners. We do not take the adoption process lightly, and will do everything in our power to make sure the animal is placed correctly the first time around for your sake and theirs. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!",

I'm Pietro, but everyone calls me Petey, because I'm a little rascal\n\nI'm a one year old American bully mix and baby, I was born to work!\n\nWhen I was new to Rescue Rovers I was a lot to handle. It took some time to figure me out. They thought I was dog selective and maybe a little crazy, lolol. Luckily, I'm SUPER lovable and pretty much everyone who met me was all \"oh Petey, what a sweet boy you are\" and \"we just need to find you the right people, Petey!\"\n\nThen, a couple of weeks ago, one of my foster mom/trainers said \"let's give him a try with GRC\"\n\nDo you know what GRC is? I did not. But let me tell youit's a.maz.ing. It's my jam. It's the bomb. It's the highlight of my LIFE and I am a superstar at it.\n\nAlso it stands for Gameness, Relationship, Control and it's a dog sport. We get to run and pull and climb and tug.\n\nOne of the super cool things about it is that you can get an idea of whether a dog would be good at working and you guysI definitely would be. The people I work with say I would excel at all kinds of things, but *especially* Search and Rescue. Can you just imagine? I can see the headlines now - Petey To the Rescue! Petey Saves the Day!\n\nOkay, anyway, that was just a little daydream of mine. Back to real life.\n\nOther important stuff about me\n\nI'm potty trained and crate trained. I can be kind of noisy in my crate but it's important for me because if I'm left unsupervised, I can get a little curious and rambunctious and, well, naughty. I always quiet down after a bit and then I'm a good boy.\n\nI am good with dogs, but they need to have the right energy match for me. I am a bit \"much\" for many dogs. I do LOVE to play, though! If I'm going to have a doggy sibling in my forever home I will need an owner that knows how to manage energy and interactions. I am not good with cats or small animals.\n\nI am great with humans of all ages, but we're looking for kids over about 12 for me for 2 reasons - first, because I can be pushy with people I feel will allow me to be, and second because people with younger kids often don't have time for the kind of work I will need. If you think your home and kids are different you can definitely apply to meet me and we'll see how it goes.\n\nI'm also super snuggly and a really big lover. I haven't focused as much on what a great cuddler I am in this bio, but you guys - I am the whole package. I'm good looking, smart, athletic and I will keep you warm and feeling loved, too.\n\nWhat it comes down to is this - I'm really looking forward to my own forever home. I would love to find a home where I can do a job (and/or be a hero, who knows) or a home where I can keep doing GRC. Either way, I don't want to keep bragging, but I am a natural athlete.\n\nAnd also I promise to be loving and loyal, even if Hollywood comes calling because I'm so handsome and talented I would NEVER leave you.\n\nIf you think I could be the guy for you, apply to meet me today at rescuerovers.org",

            "description": "Companion Animal Outreach Society would like to thank you for taking the time to read about Dre. Dre is very dear to our organization. Dre as a special needs dog. Dre is will have continued challenges with pain management and separation anxiety. It is our my opinion that Dre gets as much exercise as possible. We recommend hydrotherapy (swimming) and Holistic veterinary treatments such as acupuncture, chiropractic, and massage therapy. \nDre needs training we feel like a trainer that is very experienced special needs dogs and especially knowledgeable on separation anxiety would be beneficial \n\n\nDre\u2019s Current medication he needs to be on for life:\nGabapentin 100mg 1-tab bid (every 12 hours) OR tif (every 8 hours)\n        This is approximately $30-40/ month\nTrazodone 100mg 1-tab bid\n        Approximately $33/ month\n\nDre has a very hard time with food. This is can be a big challenge. He is currently on homemade food or dehydrated food. \nHe would be great for someone needing a support dog that he can be with all the time :)\n\n\n\nDre\u2019s Dos and Don\u2019ts\n\nDos\n\u2022\tLoves playing tug o war \n\u2022\tLoves playing with rubber balls (working on fetch)\n\u2022\tYou can pretty much get Dre to go where he wants with a leash. When he sees a leash, he because overly excited. This can be used when Dre is having a temper tantrum and does not want to get off of beds etc etc or to go outside for bathroom breaks. Use the leash always when Dre seems to be growling or upset. \n\u2022\tLoves snuggling and spooning\n\u2022\tLoves to play with other dogs- can become protective and dominant so ensure he is watched. He makes very loud growling sounds when playing with toys and other dogs but be sure to watch if he becomes to stimulated it can turn into a fight. (Dre has never hurt another animal while in shelter or at my home)\n\u2022\tLoves to wake up at 3am \u2013 this is something that is challenging. While in my care I get up and take him outside and give him a snack then we go back to bed you need to tell him to lay down and go to sleep sometimes you have to raise your voice a little. Unless you will let him in bed with you this is what he wants in the end is to snuggle he goes to be straight away. \n\u2022\tLoves walks\n\u2022\tLoves to be goofy. He reminds me of a bucking horse. \n\n\nDon\u2019ts\n\n\u2022\tPicking Dre up can be unsafe at times. You need to ensure you are never touching his back end when doing it and to ensure that your face and other limps are no where near his face. I put my arm under is stomach and another arm under is front leg and his head under my arm pit every time I pick him up and put him down. \n\u2022\tDon\u2019t let Dre get away with bad behavior such as howling, aggression and getting into garbage or other things he shouldn\u2019t.\n\u2022\tNail trims is something that he really hates (but once the he has been on trazadone it may help with that) previous owner always took him to the vet to get done. \n\u2022\tVet clinics are Dres least favorite place. Ensuring he has the most positive experience at any vet clinic is key. Building relationships with vets is very important. \n\u2022\tBack end, he does not like anyone touch back there and his legs so please avoid that area at all costs.\n\n\nPlease contact Erica at 587-272-0390 or email president@caosab.ca if you are interested in adopting Dre or have more questions.",

            "special_needs_notes": "Companion Animal Outreach Society would like to thank you for taking the time to read about Dre. Dre is very dear to our organization. Dre as a special needs dog. Dre is will have continued challenges with pain management and separation anxiety. It is our my opinion that Dre gets as much exercise as possible. We recommend hydrotherapy (swimming) and Holistic veterinary treatments such as acupuncture, chiropractic, and massage therapy. \nDre needs training we feel like a trainer that is very experienced special needs dogs and especially knowledgeable on separation anxiety would be beneficial \n\n\nDre\u2019s Current medication he needs to be on for life:\nGabapentin 100mg 1-tab bid (every 12 hours) OR tif (every 8 hours)\n        This is approximately $30-40/ month\nTrazodone 100mg 1-tab bid\n        Approximately $33/ month\n\nDre has a very hard time with food. This is can be a big challenge. He is currently on homemade food or dehydrated food. \nHe would be great for someone needing a support dog that he can be with all the time :)\n\n\n\nDre\u2019s Dos and Don\u2019ts\n\nDos\n\u2022\tLoves playing tug o war \n\u2022\tLoves playing with rubber balls (working on fetch)\n\u2022\tYou can pretty much get Dre to go where he wants with a leash. When he sees a leash, he because overly excited. This can be used when Dre is having a temper tantrum and does not want to get off of beds etc etc or to go outside for bathroom breaks. Use the leash always when Dre seems to be growling or upset. \n\u2022\tLoves snuggling and spooning\n\u2022\tLoves to play with other dogs- can become protective and dominant so ensure he is watched. He makes very loud growling sounds when playing with toys and other dogs but be sure to watch if he becomes to stimulated it can turn into a fight. (Dre has never hurt another animal while in shelter or at my home)\n\u2022\tLoves to wake up at 3am \u2013 this is something that is challenging. While in my care I get up and take him outside and give him a snack then we go back to bed you need to tell him to lay down and go to sleep sometimes you have to raise your voice a little. Unless you will let him in bed with you this is what he wants in the end is to snuggle he goes to be straight away. \n\u2022\tLoves walks\n\u2022\tLoves to be goofy. He reminds me of a bucking horse. \n\n\nDon\u2019ts\n\n\u2022\tPicking Dre up can be unsafe at times. You need to ensure you are never touching his back end when doing it and to ensure that your face and other limps are no where near his face. I put my arm under is stomach and another arm under is front leg and his head under my arm pit every time I pick him up and put him down. \n\u2022\tDon\u2019t let Dre get away with bad behavior such as howling, aggression and getting into garbage or other things he shouldn\u2019t.\n\u2022\tNail trims is something that he really hates (but once the he has been on trazadone it may help with that) previous owner always took him to the vet to get done. \n\u2022\tVet clinics are Dres least favorite place. Ensuring he has the most positive experience at any vet clinic is key. Building relationships with vets is very important. \n\u2022\tBack end, he does not like anyone touch back there and his legs so please avoid that area at all costs.\n\n\nPlease contact Erica at 587-272-0390 or email president@caosab.ca if you are interested in adopting Dre or have more questions.",

If you have questions concerning a specific animal, PLEASE fill out an application and the foster parent will be in touch. We will not arrange any home visits with any of our dogs and cats until your application is processed. Please understand our foster parents are precious to our 2nd Chance family; without them we cannot function, so we do our best to not burden them with multiple appointments. Our foster parents will choose their top 3 applications and arrange home visits with these applicants. The adopter will be chosen at that time. The process can take anywhere from a week to a month. We want to make sure our little furry ones are placed in their 'forever home' and never have to go through a rehoming again!Please fill out an adoption application:\nAdoption application (Dog)\nAdoption Application (Cat)\n\nPlease understand we do not adopt out dogs to\nfamilies with children under the age of 5. We do not adopt dogs to renters. Some dogs will have fence requirements while others may not.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment. The dogs and cats in our system find themselves there, for the most part, because their humans did not have the same loyalty to them as they did to their owners. We do not take the adoption process lightly, and will do everything in our power to make sure the animal is placed correctly the first time around for your sake and theirs. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!",

His past story is a mystery but he is ready to write his next chapter that is guaranteed to be a much brighter and happier one. Archie was discovered in a high kill shelter in Tx. He was just hours away from being euthanized when we were able to step in and pull him out just in time and bring him to Colorado. Archie needs his forever human. When he is with humans he is the happiest. He is quickly learning to trust humans again and relax, but he will cry when left alone-only for a short time then finds his way to the couch where he will cuddle up and take a nap. He like playing with his toys and now that he know about cookies, anxiously wait for one. He is learning to walk on a leash. Knows sit and no. He will just up as he get very excited to see people but calms down quickly. He is a very sweet boy who just wants to please and love someone who will be patient, understanding and give him that unconditional love that he some much want and so much deserves. This is one dog that shows you how grateful he is for being saved and giving him the opportunity to live his best life. If you think you are the one that Archie can put all of his trust and love into to be HIS best human ever and show him that unconditional love then please apply for him by filling out an adoption application at fromforgottentoforever.com/adoptionapplication. We want to make sure he finds his best forever home ever. He is so worth it.",

He knows sit, down (lay down), come, stay, and ok (when it's ok for him to exit and enter the front door behind a person) and almost understands and follows the commands drop and kennel. He's house trained. Being such an intelligent puppy, he needs help staying out of trouble. He spends the majority of the day in his crate with productive (training) let-outs. He pulls at the leash but is improving every day in giving his foster his attention when she redirects. He whines a little bit in his crate sometimes, but knows he won't get attention when he does this. It happens less and less often. Initially he barked in the crate, but he discovered that this doesn't work, either, and is a rare occurrence. He is quick to pick up on new habits.\n\nIf he's left unattended, even in cordoned off spaces, he will be tempted to find something new to chew on. In fact, he still needs to learn what to do with his chewing urges--until then, anything nearby may be up for grabs (including furniture/walls/doors). His previous family returned him due to guarding a bone, and his current foster hasn't addressed this, although he shows no aggressive behavior. His training sessions are kept short so he doesn't lose focus or get over excited. When he gets over excited he may bark, bite, and jump. He could be a good cuddler, but he needs to figure out how to self soothe his chewing before getting living room rights (with its many temptations).\n\nHis perfect match would be someone with a fenced-in yard who is interested in training a very intelligent dog and has the time and patience to do so slowly and is willing to wait for cuddles and free range of the house until Mooshoo can understand what acceptable behavior looks like. He would also do best as an only pet in the home with only adults in the home.\n\nIn the meantime if you have questions or are interested in me, please fill out an adoption application at www.ruffstartrescue.org.\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal.\n\nPlease check out our website, www.ruffstartrescue.org for more details and additional pictures on any of our animals!\n\nAll Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs).\n\nRuff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue. Animals are located in homes throughout Minnesota. We do not have a facility where animals are kept.\n\nRuff Start Rescue Adoption Policies: http://www.ruffstartrescue.org/info/display?PageID=11744",

When I was found I had a deep wound around the circumference of my neck from an embedded collar. Imagine trying to eat, drink, and live life that way, it was awful. Despite that, I am great with people and other active dogs. They say I am one happy and bouncy fellow. They estimate that I was born in early 2018. I weigh around 43 pounds. I am feeling much better now thanks to my wonderful vet staff at Furry Friends and I am ready to have a fun and loving life. \n\nI am a great walking or running partner and I have plenty of energy to help you get your steps in and meet your New Years resolution. \n\nCome in to our Jupiter location and meet me! \n\nAdopt Don't Shop\nSpay and Nueter to control the pet population",

After several nights of Toby spending the night on their front porch, the thin and dirty dog was saved by this kind lady took him in, got him a nice bath and took him to the vet.  \n\nToby is a pleaser and he lovingly seeks attention - he really craves human attention and finds it comforting when he is talked to.  He is very friendly, loves to play with safe pet bones, he will sit on command and offer his paw when a treat is involved.  He likes to sleep in a very cuddly, snuggly crate and he likes to get a bone before bed.  And during the day he likes to sit on top of his crate and enjoy the day.  He was on his own for quite a bit running around being a typical hound but now he seems very interested in just pleasing his humans while he was fostered and playing as much as he could.  Toby will alert you with a bark when he wants food or a treat.  He is a very handsome boy with a heart of gold....please stop by to meet this hound dog!  The staff has worked with Toby on his housetraining and he has done excellent and is housetrained now!  Please note Toby is NOT good with cats....but good with other dogs and kids.",

A very sweet, gentle boy. Sudden movements scare him, so he will need a quieter, patient home and one with a canine companion. As he sees other dogs getting attention, he is slowly learning that this affection thing isn't so bad. Hermes will need a home without cats and is not suitable for an apartment/condo/townhome. Hermes is unlikely to be ok with children, only because sudden movements and loud noises scare him.\nSponsored by Jordan Rodgers, in honor of Colleen Rodgers and Sam Morgan\nSponsored by Betty Gawronski, in honor of Sue Curtis\nFind out how to sponsor Hermes by going here: https://www.greyhoundpetsinc.org/support/sponsor-a-dog/\nGreyhound Pets, Inc. - www.greyhoundpetsinc.org - 877-468-7681\nWHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS TO ADOPT A GREYHOUND?\nRead Greyhound Pets, Inc.

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 8/7/2020\nReason for being in rescue: Gus was surrendered to a shelter in AR by his family. Carolina Poodle Rescue pulled him from the shelter.\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Gus is obese. He is on a special diet with daily exercise to help reduce his weight. Since arriving in rescue he's lost 9 pounds. He is on a prescription W/D diet and needs to continue this. Gus also has bladder stones. These are breaking up with diet and weight loss.\nWeight: 15.5 lbs and losing! Gus is on a serious diet!\nHeight: 12 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $299\n\nFence needed? No\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Gus is looking for a home with active retirees. He wants to be with people and does not enjoy being crated or being left alone. Gus will be happy with another dog or cat, or as the only. He just wants his people, a quiet life, and lots of lap time. Gus is a dog that does things on his terms. He can be nippy if you try to pick him up and he doesn't want to be held. If you give him time to come to you, he will spend his entire day in your lap. Given his propensity to nipping if he doesn't want to do something, we do not recommend Gus for a home with children or frequent visitors that are children.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Gus is a happy-go-lucky man who LOVES food. You can tell from his photos that food is Gus's love language. He arrived in rescue at an obese 27 pounds and we're working hard to get some much needed weight off of him. So far he's down to 18 pounds!! As Gus has lost weight, some of his other medical issues have also improved.\n\nWe don't know a lot about Gus's life before being surrendered to a shelter in AR, but it must have been quiet. He is okay on a leash, but it is clear he hasn't spent much time walking on one. He does enjoy going for short strolls and will mark everything he can find along the way. Gus is great with other dogs and with cats. He really just wants to be where people are, frequently bumping into his caregivers when they stop walking because he is so close on their heels.\n\nGus doesn't like to be made things he doesn't want to do. He isn't aggressive, but will be grumpy. He prefers laying inside on a cool floor or outdoors on a shaded patio to any sort of activity you have in mind. Gus does not like crates and will tell you all about it. He will also guard his food in his crate if other dogs walk by.\n\nGus is looking for a Netflix and chill sort of family that will take him for daily walks.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Friendly\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Gus's estimated birthday is 7/10/2012\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

We were eating scraps and garbage in the middle of the road, and a lady pulled her car over, whistled a sweet little tune, and we both went running.  I decided that riding in a car seemed like a cool thing to do, so we hopped in for a ride and were both taken to the vet to get looked at.  Overall we both checked out as skinny and a little scuffed up but healthy.  My pup went on to find an amazing home, so now it is my turn.  \n\nI am about 1.5 years old and so full of life and love to give. I've been working on some walking on a leash manners and have mastered the art of \"sit\" while I wait on my forever home, but I would really love to show you just how smart I am by learning all the rest of the cool indoor doggy manners.",

A home WITHOUT KIDS is a must for me due to my nervousness and reactivity to certain things.\n\nI really enjoy snuggling up to my human on the couch, in the bed, about anywhere you will let me!\n\nI love belly rubs too!\n\nI do ride great in the car in my booster seat as I love to be able to look outside.\n\nI am not good with strangers initially but if they leave me alone and let me go to them, there won't be any problems.\n\nMy foster mommy can tell you how to deal with all of my peculiar qualities so that I can live a long, happy life in a new home.\n\nI will require some patience so know I am not going to adjust in a day or two.\n\nBut I wanted you to know I am a very sweet girl and would love to be in a new home soon so that I can get settled into my forever home with my forever family.\n\nPlease let Angels know if you would like to hear more about me!\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal.

Thanks to his microchip we were able to find out he was adopted through Montgomery animal shelter, and we were given his owners contact information. Unfortunately his adopters wanted nothing to do with him and the shelter refused to take Prince back into their program.\n   That's where we stepped up and gave Prince the chance that he deserves. Prince did not know love, or how to love people, and was very absent. Over the past (almost) 2 years, he has learned what love is and has become a best friend to his rescue foster family. He has learned to look and ask for attention and has done phenomenal in his training.\n   Prince loves his tough dog chew toys and playing \"fetch\" in the backyard. He is the perfect office buddy and loves napping in his comfy dog beds while you work. He has to be adopted in a home as an ONLY PET and we recommend Prince be placed in a home with children 10 +.\n\n   If you are interested in adopting Prince, please click the \"More about Rogues Rescue Ranch\" button to the right >>> and fill out our adoption application.",

My ID number is 334954\n\nI am available for adoption; however due to my breed my adoption will have to be facilitated through a rescue organization. Please see the front desk staff or contact the Shelter at (248) 858-1070 for more information.\n\nMeet Shea! Looking for an active and fun new friend? Shea is a great fella who wants nothing more than to make you smile, keep you company and be your new companion! He is eager to meet people and might even jump up to kiss you...oops! Shea is a happy boy and looks forward to making his new people happy, too! This fella deserves to be in a safe, secure and loving home, one where he is able to live his best life!\n\nThe following descriptions describe behaviors that were observed during testing and/or veterinary examination: Evaluated for temperament with 334953 (female) and 334941 (male). Did well with both. Goofy, playful and strong. He jumps on people and can knock down a smaller person. Recommended training basic commands. 10/29/2020\n\nAmerican Pit Bulls are a misunderstood breed; for this reason, we implore adopters to these beautiful dogs to be very vigilant in training and socialization. This breed is very energetic and will need daily exercise. Because of their strength and energy, apartment living may not be the best fit. This breed can be loving, loyal and very smart. \n\nThe above behaviors and personality traits have been observed while at the Shelter. If this animal was relinquished, information is gathered from the owner regarding behavior. Our wonderful volunteers spend time with these animals and give input on behaviors and traits. However, this description may not be all inclusive to how this animal will act in a loving forever home. Introduction to established family pets should be slow and monitored always. The same goes for children and other family members. Adopting a pet is a big decision and should be thoughtful. We suggest researching different breeds to match traits and personalities to your lifestyle. When adopting a pet, please know that this pet will be with you for their lifetime; patience and consistency will make for a successful adoption.\n\n**Age is estimated** Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: White Weight: 65lbs Age: 1yrs 9mths 0wks Animal has been Neutered",

No inquiries, please, without an application.\n\nThis happy and smiley girl is Summer.  She was rescued from a horrible situation in Northern New Jersey a few months ago.  This beautiful girl knew nothing about a real home, comfy couch or the warm and love of humans.  Summer needed a while to decompress before she could start to be trained and socialized.  Summer has made a complete 180 and is now so fun loving and playful.  This 4 year old girl loves children and would do best in a home with kids over 10 years old due to her size and energy level.  She loves to go for walks and play with her favorite ball.  Summer needs a home where she can play in the back yard or get lots of quality walks.  Due to Summers upbringing and lack of interaction with multiple dogs, we believe she would do best in a home as an only pet.\n\nIf you think Summer is the right dog for you, please go to bfdaaa.com to complete an application.",

She would prefer to be your one and only pet but really loves the company of adult humans.  Due to her need to play and be a little rambunctious, a home with children 16+ is required.  Penny is around 5-6 years old and is fully vetted.  Her favorite activity is playing fetch in the back yard alone or with someone!!!  Penny would make a great couch companion in those cold winter nights.  She may take over the couch, hog the pillows and blankets and steal your popcorn, but that doesn\u2019t matter....right???\n\nIf you are interested in Penny, please go to bfdaaa.com to complete an application.",

It\u2019s great when a dog can amuse herself with a toy! She seems to prefer smaller dogs and a meet and greet is required if you have a resident dog\n\nPrincess is quiet, gentle, easy, and happy to join in with whatever you want to do. Show her a treat and she\u2019ll follow you anywhere!!\n\nA lover of long easy walks followed up with snuggle time our Princess is ready to find her new royal family. \n\nShe\u2019s spayed, up to date with vaccinations, microchipped, and cordially accepting adoption applications. \n\nPlease fill out this application by copying and pasting the link into your browser\n\n https://poshpetsrescueny.org/dog-application/",

She is ready for a break now and certainly deserves a good family!!  She is very friendly and happy.  Once she dries up we will get her spayed and vetted. But she is one of our favorites! So loving and sweet!\n\n\nAdoption fee includes spaying/neutering, shots, micro-chip and heartworm testing.\nPlease contact foster mom Dinesha at 972-896-6313 or email at adbadoptions@yahoo.com.  To see dogs please download an application from our website, www.adifferentbreed.org and email to foster parents address above. We will arrange a meet and greet. Dogs that have been housebroken may need a refresher course or just learn your new routine.  Maybe they used a doggie door or rang a bell to go out.  Please have patience and give them some time!",

            "description": "Hi! I'm Duke. I'm a 7ish year old chiweenie mix. My foster mom describes me as cuddly, affectionate, loving, and people-oriented. My preferred place is in your lap, or laying next to you, or with my head resting on your knee. I will make the rounds in a room, saying hi to every person. I want to be where the action is, but then I like to go to a quiet place when I've had my fill and just chill and nap. I'm a certified oxytocin booster because my foster mom says my one of my very best qualities is my affectionate nature. I'm also loyal and have an easygoing temperament and since I'm a grown-a** dog I know how to behave around the house. As an added perk I'm also clean, and my short hair doesn't shed much. Although I'm a wee bit older, I'm still pretty spunky and I look like a forever puppy - so really its like the best of both worlds! I can't wait to come home to my people, and I hope there's enough room for me in the bed because I like to spoon too.\n\nMy adoption fee is $200. This includes a spay/neuter, up-to-date vaccines, deworming, a microchip, a heartworm test, and, if needed, heartworm treatment.\n\n________________________________________________\n\nFor all animals that have not been spayed or neutered a $100 deposit will be required in addition to the adoption fee. The deposit is refundable upon completion of the spay / neuter surgery.\n\nFor more information email: adopt@animalrescueneworleans.org.\n\nTo complete an application, please visit: https://animalrescueneworleans.org/adoptfoster/.\n\nPlease visit our facebook for more information about adoption specials, and adoption events. Events are a great way to meet multiple animals at a time!",

My name is Stefler and I am a 3 (ish) year old cutie pie! \n My nickname is Grumpy Potato, and yes I do respond to this. (I bring my foster mom potatoes from the kitchen when she is working to let her know I want something)\nI enjoy walks two - three times daily (sometimes more) and some backyard time with my foster family as I tend to get bored and rambunctious sometimes and the activity helps keep my energy in check.\nI will do just about anything for a treat and I adore beef liver! \nI do sleep in my crate ( but I want a treat to go in there), and my foster mom suggests putting me in my crate when you are not home as I don't like it one bit when my humans leave me.\nI LOVE fuzzy blankets, lots of attention, and my toys.\n \nMy must haves are:\nTough chewer toys,\nSticks, \nFuzzy Blankets, \nSnuggles, \nhead pats, \nCar rides,\nand Treats!\n \nThings I don't like:\n*Plase don't trty to make me jog or run, I am simply not built for that life and I tend to try to slow folks down when they try to do this.\n*Please don't mess with my food, blankets, and toys, I tend to guard my resources; To get things away from me, please trade items with me. \n*Please don't crowd me until I am 100% comfortable with you, it makes me very scared and I may try to protect myself.\n*Please don't keep me with children for prolonged periods of time, I do not get along with them very well and I have my limits.\n*I do like other dogs, they are cool outside on a leash, none are cool inside my house right now (I like my privacy and I am the king of my castle!).\n*no pets please, I like to chase things and try to play with them the wrong way.\n*no small children please, when they get excited and rowdy it scares me and I don't like them touching me much. Older teenagers and up are more my pace.\n* I am reactive towards vets (and ear cleanings, especially); stay with me please as I need comfort and they often use a muzzle for my own safety so I will need lots of reassurance..",

            "description": "Well bonjour!\n I'm Louis aka \"\"Louie\"\". I've got the cutest look that will melt your heart and at my best will give you more love than you knew was possible. I'm a little misunderstood and people like to label me as a bit of puzzle. While that can be true, it's only because I've had such a rough past that trusting humans takes time for me. If you are willing to be patient with me and work on some of the things that I'm not so good at, then you'll see that deep down inside I'm full of love. I'm doing much better now that I'm on a regular schedule. My current foster parents aren't early morning people and I'm alright with that. I do my daily doggy yoga and stretches while they sip on their first cup of coffee and then I'm ready to seize the day. My previous life on the streets was hard but now I've learned to enjoy the daily adventures that the city has to offer living in downtown Toronto. I meet new dogs and people in the elevators and I'm fine with most of them. Except the small yappy dogs that get in my face, I'm not a fan of them. My foster dad is my favourite but I'm getting used to my foster mom too since she's around more during the day, as she works from home. I think she's happy that I haven't chewed on any furniture or her shoes. If they are both around, he's the one I'll go to first for sure. I won't give you much trouble, I'm crate trained for sleeping at night and will actually go there myself when my foster parents are busy doing human things that I'm not interested in. I won't go in the house unless I am having tummy issues because I got new treats or ate something I wasn't supposed to. You see, I'm very food driven and will be with you in the kitchen all the time so when I see a chance to be a bit of a thief then I will take it. But sadly human food doesn't agree with me as much as I agree with it. The same thing happens when you give me overprocessed treats, especially if they have potatoe fillers. Let's stick to freeze dried chicken and pumpkin treats please. Now let's talk about what you can do for me. Please pet me in moderation but give me lap naps everyday to show me you love me. I don't like any kind of grooming or the vet so you are going to have to take some classes from the dogget training program to work on my displeasures. I won't put on any winter gear and will not let you touch my paws. That being said, over the last month my leash skills have gotten a lot better while training with my foster parents so I'm sure we can fix the rest of my quirks! Looking forward to spending time with you in my fur-ever home Love Louis\n\n-Experienced home\n- no kids please ( unless they are teens)\nLocated in Toronto",

She enjoys meeting other dogs and would do great in a home with dogs. Cherry is a perfect lady when she's left on her own at home, and will curl up in her favorite spot while you are away. That way you can relax while you are out and about running errands. She is still learning basic commands, but she knows how to fetch and will play as long as you are game. Cherry is polite and respectful of humans and loves to cuddle. She would stay by your side 24/7 if you let her, and she also thinks she is a lap dog. She is very affectionate and sweet, and adores human interaction - she is always looking to cuddle! Cherry would fit in with most homes and would love a home with a backyard, but is fine as a house dog. Are you looking for a sweet cuddlebug? Come meet Cherry Pie today!",

She is an absolute bundle of joy, energy, play, affection, and devotion. Our favorite thing about Dutchess is her ability to communicate.

Dutchess may not be able to speak, but she's so expressive you will feel like you're talking to a best friend. She will be an incredible companion for the lucky human that takes her home. Equal parts of play and couch potato, and when she flashes that winning smile, you will fall for this special soul. You can definitely count on Dutchess for playtime and chill mode.

While Dutchess loves exercise she can chill like a champ, and this girl will be your bestie forever. Come meet this regal supermodel, she's waiting to be your Dutchess!",

SPONSORSHIP INCLUDES UPDATES ON YOUR ORPHAN.  Please contact us for more details about our sponsorship/adoption program.\n\nWe have a huge debt for lovely little Hermione who was sick on and off again for over a year.  Hermione has recovered from Pancreatitis which took over a year to identify, diagnose, and finally treat, costing us almost $5,000 altogether, from her first 2:30 AM Emergency Room visit and in-hospital stay, and the following visits with two of her other regular vets.  None of the highly skilled veterinarians thought to give her a pancreatic test because the scary symptoms did not resemble pancreatitis !\n\nHermione is now on expensive \"Just Food For Dogs\" and also \"Hills Prescription I/D Low-Fat Special Diet, and is fed several times a day, with supplements and vitamins.  We need to pay off the debt for saving Hermione's life.  Hermione's life was originally saved from the Orange County Animal Shelter, where she was out of time.  She lived in several foster homes until she ultimately came to live back with us - now permanently.\n\nFor more information about Hermione, and to help her, please contact:  theanimalsleftbehind@socal.rr.com  (Also our Paypal donation/sponsorship email address)",

            "description": "OLLIE needs a quiet home without children of any age. He is very fearful of strangers, so if any children visit the home, he is not the dog for you.<P>\n\nOLLIE is a 1-year-old, 28-pound Labrador Retriever mix.\n\nFrom OLLIE's foster guardian:\n\n\"OLLIE is very affectionate with \"his\" people but is fearful of strangers.  He knows basic commands and loves other dogs, but he does not like cats.  He walks well on a leash and requires a couple of walks a day (even if just around the block) or he will get rammy.  He loves to play fetch and snuggle.  OLLIE is a lap-dog through and through and would be happiest in a quiet home with a loving family or person.\"\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIf you would like to meet, foster or adopt this pet, please fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser. EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

We don't know much about his past except that Bear spent a lot of time outside and developed some anxious behaviors.  But his future is looking much better!  Bear has quickly made himself a staff and volunteer favorite!  Bear was evaluated by Foundry Dog Works and is working on activities to improve his anxious behavior and get him into a better state of mind.  This super sweet boy loves walks, belly rubs and giving kisses!  Due to his lack of socialization, he would do best in a home as the only dog and with someone who is committed to continuing his training.  If interested in fostering or fostering to adopt Bear, apply on our website www.realtimerescue.org.",

We are unsure of her origins and backstory but we do know that she is very, very sweet. She is very people-oriented and eager to please. We have also noticed that she is very smart and has the potential to be a great dog! She is HW+ and is undergoing treatment. She does well with other dogs with a proper introduction. She would absolutely love a foster or adopter that she could devote herself to.\n\nAmazing Grace Bully Rescue is a foster based rescue in the Pensacola, Florida area. We do not have a physical building. If you would like to meet any of our pups, the first step is to fill out our online application so we can contact you.\n\nOur adoption fee for Diamond is $200 and includes her spay, current shots, rabies vaccine, and a registered microchip.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this Amazing dog, please fill out our online adoption application at www.amazinggracebullyrescue.org\n\nIf you have any questions, please text your question to 723-2037.

Midnight Lee is 45 pounds of pure snuggles, wanting nothing more than your cuddles, love, and attention - oh, and plenty of toys! He is around 2 years old, house trained, has good leash manners, and does well with other dogs. Midnight Lee is still learning a few basic commands (sit, down, stay, quiet etc.) and how to like his crate, but is responding to training well as he is very intelligent and treat motivated. Midnight Lee asks that you introduce him to new places and people slowly. He does tend to get a little overwhelmed at first, but once he gets comfortable, he's back to being his normal, silly self. Let's get this sweetheart adopted!\"\n\nMidnight Lee has a secret obsession ... he loves toys and is an excellent demolition man for breaking down cardboard. He is perfectly happy rolling about in the toys he has conquered.\n\nThis handsome boy will require someone to teach him the ropes of living in a home. He would love someone who can give him undivided attention at times, as he loves to lay in your lap for snuggles and calm petting.\n\nThis gorgeous boy is Midnight Lee and he really is as sweet as he can be! He would like nothing more than to ring in the new year with a new family. Be prepared for lots of snuggles as this boy is a lap dog who loves for you to shower him with attention. Midnight Lee is around two years old and has good leash manners. Please help spread the word, let's get this sweetheart a home!\n\nInquiries: adoptions@plannedpethoodrockymount.com\nAdoption Application Link: https://www.plannedpethoodrockymount.com/adoptions\n\nClick here to view our general adoption fees. Our adoption fees help to provide a portion of the care that we provide our animals.\n\nPrior to adoption, all of our animals are altered, vaccinated, microchipped, tested for heartworm (dogs), and placed on a monthly preventative, in addition to other necessary treatments.\n\nAdoption Center Hours:\nTuesday - Friday:: 12-6p.m.\nSaturday:: 11-4p.m.\n\nAt FCHS, we commit to our animals; for this reason, all of our animals have a lifetime commitment from us.

This beauty has become more comfortable with her new life at the rescue, replacing her tentative attitude with her loving, sweet self. She walks next to you with great leash manners and is always looking for your hand to lean against so you can pet her. Thus far she seems on the calmer side. Baroness is delighted to meet other dogs, as she enjoys the company of furry friends. She does great in the play yard, but her main focus is on her people, whom she follows around and whose attention and affection make her happiest. This delightful young lady is ready for a cat-free, forever home. Could yours be the one to make her forever dreams come true?\n\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website and Facebook page!

Outgoing and confident, this girl has a wonderful medium energy level and loves going for walks (she might pull a little to let you know how excited she is, but only if you let her take charge)!  She can be incredibly affectionate with her people \u2013 she has made many human friends at the rescue and is quick to ask for some much-loved petting.  She needs some help with her doggy socializing, but she\u2019s working very hard at the rescue!  She can be pushy at first in playgroup, but she takes corrections well and avoids confrontation.  She wants to be a playful pup \u2013 she just needs a firm hand to teach her how to behave.

This young cutie with the dark eyes and tidy, spotty coat has come so far in his short time at the rescue, he's now a happy and outgoing boy with people and other pups. Duke throws himself into everything, including onto your lap if he can. He gets excited about getting out and will jet out ahead, but he\u2019s getting good about listening to direction, especially if you are consistent. His spirited nature also extends to his interactions with other dogs.  He can come on a bit strong for some but, with the right equally playful partner he'll happily play and play. He is adorable, loves fun and is great company. For that reason he\u2019s looking for a home that will add experiences and adventure with boundaries and structure. Duke has flourished with the security, guidance and routine at the rescue. He is looking for a cat-free home please.\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website!

She was surrendered by her original owner for financial hardships. The Stars team swooped in and promised to find this bundle of joy, a new home. Some friendships are worth melting for. \n\nClick on www.starsrescue.org to complete an application to be pre-approved to adopt this pup. As you can imagine, we get a lot of interest in our rescues and kindly ask that you are patient with us while we review applications as it may take a few days.We will contact you regarding your application, during which you can ask more questions about this specific pup. If pre-approved we will coordinate a date for meet and greet.\n \nOur adoption fee is $500. This includes spay/neuter, microchipping, deworming, and all age-appropriate vaccinations\n",

            "description": "To make the adoption process faster and easier, please visit www.almosthomeohio.org and complete our online application!\nDogs posted are currently up for adoption unless otherwise noted. Our goal is to match dogs with a suitable home/family so that at any time, dogs shown here may already have a potential match. We post dogs as quickly as possible however there may be some not yet pictured. We allow our dogs time to settle in with their foster families so that we can evaluate their health and personality.\n\nMeet Buddy, our 3-year old collie who is blind, but does not seem to regard this as a disability. He quickly mapped the home where he is living and now only occasionally bumps into anything. He has also mapped his outdoor yard and requires a fenced in yard for safety. When he is outside, he feels secure and explores now that he knows where the fence is.\n\nBuddy loves his people but also enjoys the other dogs in the household. He would enjoy a companion dog as long as it were not too boisterous since he cannot see. He is mellow and relaxed and understands \"sit,\" \"shake,\" his name, and comes when he is called. He views his crate as a safe spot and is only put there with the gate closed when the family is gone or when they go to bed, both for his safety. He hasn't been around kids but does fine with cats. He is house trained, rides well in the car but does some drooling when it is moving. His hearing is sensitive, understandably, so he is not fond of loud noises like thunder and fireworks and squeaky toys scare him but doesn't mind household noises like the vacuum cleaner. When meeting new people, he is a little shy at first but quickly warms up to them. He does know what he wants and is not shy about going for it. Once when he wanted to reach his crate and it was not time for bed, he crawled through the cat gate to get there. Another time he managed to find a bone which was bought for him, at the bottom of a grocery sack. He took the plastic off and started gnawing at it without damaging any of the other packages.\n\nDogs who are blind need homes where things are kept in the same location so they can be secure as they navigate. He shows a strong dislike of concrete, refusing to walk on it, and if he has to, he trembles, but has no trouble with linoleum. He quickly learned to manage the 4 steps on and off the deck. His foster mom tells him \"step up\" or \"step down\" as he approaches them but he does not use a full staircase. He is a lovable, smart dog, who is ready to curl up beside you in his forever home. As with other dogs who are blind, Buddy needs a home where the family is experienced with dogs who are blind or willing to get training to help him live to the fullest. The adoption fee for Buddy is $300Dont forget to visit our informative website, www.almosthomeohio.org, for valuable information and interesting features. 1/25/21 5:18 PM",

Toffee likes playing chase in the yard, and likes to play fetch, though she forgets to bring the toy back sometimes! She is gentle, loves to nap on the couch, and talks to you when she is ready to play. Toffee is afraid of men, so she must go to a female-only home. Due to her shyness and dislike for loud noises, it is best that she not be in a home with small children. Toffee warms up quickly to the ladies in her life though, and she truly is a wonderful pup with tons of love to give!! She is also a perfect playmate with the Yorkie she currently lives with, so she'd likely do well with other dogs as well though supervised meet and greets would be needed. Toffee has not been around cats. She is house trained and uses a dog door, and rides well in the car. Toffee is spayed and up to date on vaccines. If you are a female-only home, and you can give Toffee the loving, safe home she deserves, please email us at Lasthoperescuefl@gmail.com! \n",

She is a sweet, happy, medium energy girl who likes kids and other dogs and loves going for car rides.  She can be a bit bossy, likes to play rough, and will herd other dogs if given the chance so a home with other dogs who would tolerate her play style and help her drain her energy might be ideal.  She would do well in a house with a tall sturdy fenced yard and an active person/family cuz she's a big, strong, athletic girl!  She is housebroken, crate trained, spayed, fully vaccinated & microchipped.  \n\nFor more information about Miss P, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org.

About 3 years old, they came to us pregnant when their owner said he could not take care of them anymore. Their puppies have now been adopted, and as soon as they completely dry up we will have them spayed and shots updated.\nSuper sweet dogs, weigh about 12-14 lbs. Do not have to be adopted together!\n\nAdoption fee includes spaying/neutering, shots, micro-chip and heartworm testing.\nPlease contact foster mom Dinesha at 972-896-6313 or email at adbadoptions@yahoo.com.  To see dogs please download an application from our website, www.adifferentbreed.org and email to foster parents address above. We will arrange a meet and greet. Dogs that have been housebroken may need a refresher course or just learn your new routine.  Maybe they used a doggie door or rang a bell to go out.  Please have patience and give them some time!",

But if you are patient his kisses are worth it..Once he is comfortable he is fun loving, full of energy, and gets so excited when it's time to go outside to play, walk, and enjoy his time with other dogs and kids alike! Eddie is house trained and can calmly hang out inside on his dog bed or in a crate, where he feels safest. He is cat selective and can do well with some cats, but it depends on the personality of the cat whether he would enjoy a cuddly relationship or chase them. Car rides make him a bit nervous, in a crate makes him feel safest . Eddie was born in December 2017 and weighes@ 65lbs. Eddie and his mom Trixie are still waiting for their special familues could that be you??https://petlover.petstablished.com/pets/public/902958",

            "description": "Hera \n\nIm Hera, Im a 2 year old GSD mix and I have lived the life no dog should have to. \n\nI came by plane to this rescue from a life I would rather forget about, but I am so happy to have been saved and me and my 2 babies were given the opportunity to live great lives. I however.... wasn't too sure about humans and had little to no trust in them, infact... my foster mom thinks I may have been feral for quite some time, but now after spending more time with me she thinks that that is only partially true. Humans have clearly shown me evil, and have hurt me to the point where I have no trust for strangers. \n\nIt has taken me close to 3 months of being with my foster family to realize that I can start being a real dog. I have opened up and have started to trust my foster mama little by little, but it has taken me time, love, and patience. She is so so great though... and I have even been giving her kisses. I'm REALLY liking how it feels to be loved!\n\nI am not a dog that you can throw into chaos, and I prefer to take baby steps while learning how to be a dog and part of a family. If I am put into an uncomfortable or unfamiliar situation I will shut down, and roll like a little alligator and try to run away... because that's all I know, fight or flight. I also prefer women to men so it's very important that a woman who is kind natured by in the home with me.\n\nAlthough I have connected with one main woman in the home I'm in now, I have done better and better with the other men and women living in the house. What I love the MOST you ask.... OTHER DOGS! I am LOVING the ability to play with other dogs!! Wow, how fun!!! So it is VERY important in my new home that another playful, submissive and kind dog be present as this will greatly help with my confidence and teach me how to be the best girl and family member. On the flip side though, I need a home without children, adults only please!\n\nMy foster family though is helping me in different situations, meeting new people and exposing me to things that may be scary... but learning that I can be safe and happy.\n\n \n\n \n\nIdeally whoever wants to adopt Hera will need to understand that this is going to be a lifetime commitment, and she may never fully come out of her shell due to how much evil she has been shown by people. \n\nBUT she does have the potential to come out of her shell and love again. It is just going to take an incredibly special soul to help mend hers. \n\nShe doesnt mind the cats at all, and is crate trained. \n\n \n\nHera really is such an amazing dog with a beautiful soul, she just needs the right person to show her that. To love her, and to give her the gift of patience while she learns that the world is not the awful place she has been shown it is for the last two years. We would want to start with a foster to adopt situation ideally as she is going to need someone to invest a lot of time into her, and if it isnt the right fit wed like her to come back here instead of being passed around. \n\nShe has so much potential, and we really believe she will be a good dog for the right person. \n\n \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org/available-dogs",

My very favorite thing in the world is to be out exploring - whether it's a walk around the neighborhood, or a hiking trail, I love being out and moving. I would definitely have the stamina to accompany you on a long day hike, or even a long run (after I finish my heartworm treatment that the rescue is going to take care of for me!). Now, I probably didn't spend a lot of time inside in my past, and while I LOVE people of all sizes, I was never taught not to play with them without using my mouth, so I will need some training on that, as well as some basic house manners and obedience. I'd probably do best in a home with no kids, or at least older kids who can help me learn the right way to play. I'm house trained and crate trained, and I love to snuggle up with you on the couch at night. Because of my high prey drive, I'd likely do better in a home without cats. Please come meet me and let's talk about what kind of adventures we can take together!\n\nMiko is neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, microchipped and will be undergoing heartworm treatment at the full expense of the rescue. Please do not delay in completing an application to have Miko become a member of your family today!\n\n*Homeownership required!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

            "description": "Well hello there folks! My name is Little Debbie. I\u2019m a 2 year old who was found as a stray and brought to animal control. I\u2019m sure many of you have seen my photos and videos and thought, \u201cOh that poor thing. She must be suffering with those legs!\u201d \nWell let me tell you how wrong you are. Yes, my rear legs are deformed and are angled at 90 degrees, and my front legs are bowed out, but that doesn\u2019t slow me down one bit. In fact, if you don\u2019t watch out, I\u2019ll go scooting past you so fast your head will spin! Now I can\u2019t take stairs, but luckily I only weigh 28 pounds and my foster parents carry me out to do my business, or to put me on the couch with them so I can snuggle! \nAnd let me tell you I love to snuggle! If you cradle me like a baby and stroke my belly I\u2019ll purr like a kitten! Speaking of kittens, I am very intrigued by the cat who lives in my foster house. I look at her with my big eyes and listen with these great ears. I don\u2019t miss a thing in this house, and if they would let me, I\u2019d probably chase that cat! I\u2019m also very interested in my foster brother & sister and I think I would do fine with other dogs. \nNow I mentioned before that my foster parents carry me out to do my business. I know that I\u2019m supposed to go outside but I\u2019m not perfect yet and I do have some accidents. But I look at them with my big eyes and their heart melts and so will yours if you adopt me. I\u2019ve been spayed and I\u2019m perfectly healthy except for my legs which are going to be evaluated to see if physical therapy will help. I have a very healthy appetite and love treats! I will also let you know when I want attention with a throaty growl which makes my foster Dad laugh because it comes out of this little body!\nSo, if you\u2019re looking for a feisty, loving, snuggling bully who just needs a little extra TLC, I am your girl! Love to all!\n\n\nIf you would like to donate to Little Debbie's care, please go to our website at http://shopcebr.com/products/donation.\n\n\nHOW TO QUALIFY FOR A CEBR BULLY To determine if you qualify to adopt one of our adorable bullies start by viewing our Adoption Area Map.

DOB 10-3-19), female, 33 lbs., vetted, is or will be spayed, and micro-chipped. Zina ended up at the shelter in NC due to being seized by Animal Control in a cruelty. We don't know the details but we do know she is super sweet! She is a little shy at first. She tested well with other dogs, takes treats gently, and knows her name! Stay tuned for more information as Zina is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Zina please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out her Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

            "description": "NAME: River\nBREED: Shepherd/Pit Bull Mix\nBIRTHDAY: 2012\n\nThere is never a day when we don't get requests to help dogs. Not one, not two, but literally dozens of emails and messages. Every. Single. Day. We are the smallest rescue ever, so we have to say \"no\" over and over and over. It's never easy, but some cases are harder than others, and some stories and faces stick with us more than others. Such is the case with River, a sweet and loving girl in South Carolina. A volunteer reached out to us, desperate and dedicated to help River find a rescue or forever home before she has to spend yet another winter on the concrete floor of the shelter. This will be River's FIFTH winter in the pound: she has lived there since she was three years old, and as a mature lady of eight she is now even less adoptable.\n\nSo why is River still in the shelter, after so many years? There are two reasons, one negative and one positive. This poor girl has a lot working against her- she's not young, she's a bully mix, she's dog-selective and dominant, she chases cats, and she has \"degenerative joint disease in her back knees, luxating patellas, and a torn ACL that has reattached with scar tissue\" (per the shelter vet's diagnosis). But let's think about it this way... after five years, this mess of a dog is still alive in a SC pound... and it's because she's an awesome dog. So here's the positive, which has kept her from euthanasia: River is a NICE dog, friendly and happy to meet new people. She loves to play any chance she gets, and although she doesn't love all dogs she is friendly enough to have a kennel mate. Most young dogs would deteriorate mentally after being cooped up for so long, but not River- her bright spirit has sustained her and kept her tolerant and manageable despite unfavorable living conditions. She's a fighter and a survivor, and she deserves some attention and some HELP!\n\nWe'd love to take River, but with so many dogs and cats here it's just not a good fit here. So we need YOU to help us! Please spread the word far and wide, with people and rescues who may have a spot to squeeze in just one more good dog. Transportation is available to anywhere River needs to go, and any medical expenses will be covered by very generous volunteers from the shelter. Personally we wouldn't do much more than good pain meds for those old legs, but if a vet recommends surgery that will be covered as well. There's nothing to lose and everything to gain by helping the helpless- please take a minute to help River!\n\nFor more information please email GoodOldTails@gmail.com",

If you like those things, then you will LOVE our newest hound intake, Goofy! \nThis sweet, playful goofball (approx) 8 years old was abandoned by his lifelong owner when she decided to get a chihuahua that Goofy didn't get along with him so away to the pound he went. He found himself stuck in a shelter in MO where no one showed any interest in adopting him. We busted him out of the shelter and we welcomed him with open arms to Helpless Hounds. Goofy would do best as the only dog in the home but is fine with cats! He is extremely chill and sweet. He makes a great \"work from home\" buddy as he just loves to hangout in his bed and chew on a bone. All Goofy wants is home to live out his golden years. Is it yours? \n\n\"Goofy\" is neutered, utd on shots, pretty laid back.  He does have a chronic ear infection that is now being treated and said to have some allergies.\n\nGoofy needs a new home that will appreciate a slightly chubby, sweet older guy who has a lot of love to give. If you can help, please message us.",

            "description": "Still Needing work and may never be a cuddle dog. \nPamela came to us shaking in a corner and wouldn't move. Any space open she found a small corner to hide in. She was at the county shelter where she had no change and we were her last hope. Pamela has since come out of her shell in many areas. She's very excited about her outdoor time and has started jumping on me to get her leash on (big step). Sometimes if I'm not quick enough I have to wait for her to come back over to me again to get her leash on. She's highly intelligent and has learned many basic words like, come on and crate, let's go. From the first day I met her I knew how smart she was. The way she tilts her head trying to understand me when I'm talking to her. I thought I was in trouble with this one. The first day was rocky. I made the mistake of letting her freeroam in the house and all it did was scare her and it took a couple of us to get her out from behind the washer. After a few days though, she started coming around. I'd make her go out on the leash to potty. She'd do a stop and go jester. Stop and jump forward, stop, and jump forward. eventually, she figured out where we were going and was first out the door. She's now going out with 3 to 4 other dogs on potty breaks in the play yard and as long as I keep to the structure she's perfectly fine.     \nThe other day I tried to allow a stranger (volunteer) to take her out in another direction for a potty break and she didn't understand and fought against it and that is what made me decide she was ready for adoption. I believe she can bond with her people but will always be fearful of strangers. She needs you, if you've read this so far then you are probably just that person to give her the love and time to bond with. I'm a rescuer, I rehabilitate dogs like this all the time and there's more out there that need me. So it's time for Pamela to go to her person. Her people that can give her, her forever. She certainly has the potential to bond, especially if you have food. She's ready and I will help you help her. \nPlease consider Pamela \n\nGet your applications in!\nhttps://www.causendogrescue.org/adoption-application.html \n\nWe only do meet and greets for approved applications.\n\nAdoption fee is $250.\n\nAll dogs will be Up-to-date on Shots, worming, Spayed/Neutered and Microchipped.   We will also do random, periodic vet checks to ensure all dogs adopted from us continue to have the best care.  We will check for any follow up visits needed and that they are on a monthly Heartworm Prevention.\n\nIf you rent or own a home, we prefer you to have a fenced in yard. \n\nApartment living is also ok but prefer a fenced in area if close to the road.\nAll adults in the home will need to know they are getting a dog and will need to sign the adoption agreement.\nWe do not adopt to college students with multiple roommates. \nMilitary will need to provide a backup plan.\nWe require all pets in the home to be spay and/or neutered. Because too many dogs are being killed, due to there not being enough homes per dog in need. Only the lucky ones end up here.\n*\n*\n#adoptdontshop #adopt #adoption #puppy #puppylove #puppyoftheday #puppies #puppiesofinstagram #rescuedog #rescue #rescuedogsofinstagram #rescuedogs #dogs #dogsofinstagram #rescuelife #causendogrescue #petstagram #happypuppy #happydog #petsagram #support #donate #dogstagram #volunteer #NorthCarolina #Pet #foster #pets #petsofinstagram #petlover",

Young munchkin kiddos, kitties, and tiny fluffy dogs are not a suitable match for her, but look at all the other types of homes she could get along with! She can tolerate little kids in small doses, but not 24/7. Big Red has thrived in our play group sessions, when she finds the right dogs to jive with! Big Red sadly has been adopted and returned twice now, and she is looking for her perfect match. It's been a bit of trial and error finding that match, but we are confident there is the right family out there for Big Red. She's a beautiful girl with a striking red coat color. She has a sweet and gentle demeanor and loves to match your energy - you want to go for a long walk? Let's go! Want to chill on the couch in the AC for a bit? Game on!\nWhere ever life takes you, think of how Big Red could be right at your side, your faithful companion. All you need to do is apply now and schedule your adoption visit!",

DOB 3-16-18), male, 30 lbs., vetted, is or will be neutered, and micro-chipped\n\nMikey is the sweetest, happiest, most loving boy. He's a dapper, dandy and handsome dude! He's approximately 4 years old and 30 lbs, fully vetted, heart worm neg and neutered.\n\nMikey is high energy and looking for an active guardian who will take him places and keep him entertained and experiencing life. His person needs to be dog savvy and able to \"read\" what Mikey has to say.\n\nMikey needs...\n\nAn active life style,\n\nA home with a fenced yard,\n\nNo small/young children,\n\nBest to be paired with a well balanced female dog,\n\nA dog savvy person, willing to help Mikey transition to a new home.\n\nMikey's accomplishments...\n\nWalks well on leash and loves to go,\n\nLearning to ride calmly in a car either with a bully stick to chew or with the window cracked (while tethered) so he can look out and smell the roses,\n\nCrate trained and does well with enough exercise and a Kong or chew,\n\nSleeps through the night,\n\nIs not a nuisance barker.\n\nMikey is currently in a foster home with 3 medium sized females. He is walked daily, is learning house manners and training, how to calmly sit and wait before coming through a doorway or getting in and out of the car. He has to sit, stay and look his foster mom in the eye before his food bowl is placed on the ground. Watching him learn to TEAR his eyes away from the bowl in order to be fed was hysterical! He likes hanging in the yard, lying in the sun and leaps as he chases his ball.\n\nMikey will be man or woman's best friend if given a bit of time to trust, adapt and settle in.\n\nHe's a Passion 4 Paws rescue who is available for adoption, foster to adopt or foster in Upstate SC and surrounding area.\n\nStay tuned for more information as Mikey is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Mikey please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out his Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

Their bond is very strong and they must be adopted together. They are both approximately 25 lbs and Gabby is estimated to be 4 years old, while Gigi is thought to be 5-6 years. With their terrifying shelter experience behind them and a little TLC, they are now blossoming and the lucky family who adopts them can count on a double dose of daily joy! Their foster mom says they are charming, playful and ridiculously affectionate. They are very social with people once they get to know you, and they like other dogs and even cats, with proper introductions. They need space (inside and outside) to run around and play. They follow their person around like ducklings, because they want to be your everything, so they will do best with someone who is home for the most part. Their favorite position is snuggling with each other, preferably on top of a human, for hours! If you have room in your heart and your home for these two delightful characters, please apply to adopt at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

I can be stand-offish with new people, particularly men and strangers. I do get protective over my person. Once I get to know someone, I'm the most loyal dog! I would do best in a house or an area where there will not be too much traffic from strangers since I can take some time to warm up to new people. My foster momma says I am a very sweet boy, and I love to cuddle (I'm a ladies man and love my foster mommy).",

We rescued her with her five puppies from a very high kill small shelter in South TX. She was so emaciated and had trouble breathing. Once she arrived we did an X-ray only to discover at some point all the bones in her throat were crushed and basically didn\u2019t exist any more. It\u2019s like her throat is a pocket that catches air ... you will understand when you hear her ? snore. She is a happy girl and her snoring doesn\u2019t bother her at all! \n\nShe is an angel on earth... so gentle, loving, and sweet. She loves to play fetch and carry any toy she can find around in her mouth. She is great with kids, dogs, and cats. She is so deserving of a forever family and we know once she finds them they will love her as much as we do ??\n\nIf you would like to meet Leto, the first step in the process is to complete an application.  Please go to roadtrip4paws.com and click on the Adopt tab to find a link to our online application.  \n\nHome visits required for all dog adoptions\n\nWe reserve the right to refuse placement of an animal for any reason",

He was sadly returned to us in August and picked up some unruly\u00a0habits like being reactive on his walks and when people enter his home. He loves his person and bonds quickly but is fearful when new people approach. Our goal is for him to gain his confidence back\u00a0and feel comfortable in his space which he has, but will need continued work on that. He will need a confident and committed owner to continue with his training and set the boundaries and structure he needs and thrives with. Trust us when we say he will not disappoint in the loyalty or loving department. He is a pro at cuddling and will enjoy the downtime with his companion. We suggest an adult only home so you can stay committed and dedicated to Emmett. His world needs to be kept small as he is not a sociable dog so a low key, low traffic home is best. He is such a good, loyal boy-we know his person is out there!",

For the 1st 6 years of my life, I spent most of my time shut in a room with Camo. Then 2 years ago, a couple moved into the house where I lived & worked really hard to socialize me. I've made major improvements! When I meet someone new, I will bark at them. But if you give me lots of soft treats, I'll warm up to you & be your best buddy! Besides Camo, I've also been around cats & I'm fine with them. (I'm dominant with other dogs). I'm basically housetrained, but if you don't let me out, then I'll go in the house. For the past 2 years, I'm used to going out several times a day, & I will whine when I need to go outside. I enjoy playing tug-of-war! I've been around children & I'm fine with them. But it's important to take your time introducing me to strangers & let me get to know them at my own pace. I'm neutered. There is a hard lump on my hip that needs to be removed ASAP. I'm in a foster home now & will have my surgery soon! Please think about making me part of your family. I love being part of a family & loved!",

            "description": "Elegant and graceful, Bailey is a soft spoken lady wholl complement any family. Her beauty is obvious, but its her charming personality that seals the deal. She may seem a bit nervous when you first meet, but a calm homelife will definitely build her confidence, and those jitters will surely disappear. Bailey is a pleaser. She enjoys people. Making her person happy, makes her happy. She does exactly what is asked of her, and she does it well because she wants to. It should come as no surprise that Bailey walks fantastic on a leash. She appears to like to go for walks, and she would not only make a stunning walking partner, she would also be fantastic company. She seems very trainable, and most likely excel in obedience classes. Bailey is one of our Unicorn Dogs! If you are interested in fostering or adopting, please contact us about our Unicorn Program",

My foster mom had to start carrying me out to potty because I was so big and I would roll down the steps. Being pregnant was very stressful and all of my 8 puppies died.  \n\nI was not sure about all the new things in my new home but I started to trust my foster mom and we have become inseparable.  I do have separation anxiety when my foster leaves the house. It takes me a while to warm up to new people. I bond closely with my person. I would do best in a home as an only dog and no children. \n\nI really need someone to be patient with me. I am a good girl and am looking for a special person who will love me forever. My foster mom cuddles me and sings me songs. I really like to do that most of all. I use a dog door. I do not use a crate and sleep in the bed. \n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes up to date shots, heart worm test, microchip and spay. I can go on a home visit  with you for 1 week to see how things go! If interested in adopting Daisey Mae, send an email to adoptions.spspca@gmail.com",

She is a high energy girl that loves playing with anything and anyone! She's still learning her manners when she gets excited and would love parents that like to teach as much as she likes to learn. Ziggy is a very smart girl so she'll be a quick study, especially if you have some delicious treats to offer! She would also love it if you took her on all the hikes and adventures she can handle! Once she's all tuckered out, you'll be hard pressed to find a better snuggle buddy! Ziggy is growing up at McKamey- we wish for her to have her very own forever family and loving home. If you're ready to add a whole lot of fun to the party, come in and spend some time with Ziggy today! Primary Color: Brown Weight: 56lbs Age: 2yrs 3mths 1wks Animal has been Spayed",

But I also enjoy lazy evenings by your side as well watching TV, I know I look big but I think I am the perfect size to sit on your lap or right next to you. I can just lay there and look into your eyes ? I am goofy and love my toys, sometimes my ears have a mind of their own and get stuck backward.  I am a little shy of people at first and might bark or give a little growl, but don't be afraid because I will be forever faithful to you once I get to know you better. I am an 11-month-old Shepard/Lab mix.  I would love to be home with you for the Holidays.",

My prior owners made me live outside 24-7 and when I got bored and hungry, I dug in the trash and the garden.  They didn't like this and took me to the shelter.  I swear I'm a good dog and it really hurt my feelings to be betrayed by my family, but I'm ready to start a happier chapter with you!  I chase squirrels, but I get along with dogs, cats and kids.   I have never met a stranger and I ride like  a lady in the car.   My foster says I'm house trained and am a mellow, sweet cuddler.  So far I'm \"low maintenance\" but it takes a few weeks for a dog's true personality to shine.   Don't you want my wiggle butt to welcome you after a long day?  I'm 6 years young and have so much love to give you.  \n\nI'm heartworm positive and this is very common in Texas for dogs who are not kept on monthly heartworm prevention (it only takes one mosquito bite to infect your dog!).  The rescue is paying for my heartworm treatment and is happy to talk to you about what my recovery will entail (mostly rest!), but please don't let this stop you from applying to adopt me! \n\nDaisy \nFemale \nLab Mix \n6 years Old \n47 lbs \n\nhttps://nhanimalrescue.org/adoption-information/",

            "description": "Dewey and Sky are back with us in rescue. They originally came from a hoarding case in Iowa last year. Sky came to us pregnant and had 7 healthy pups who have all been adopted. Dewey and Sky were adopted in May and were wonderful guardians on their farm, enjoying what they like to do and are good at. They have been guardians for goats, sheep, llamas, chickens, and goats. Unfortunately the neighboring farm recently began shooting tannerite and the explosions scared Dewey and Sky so badly they discovered they could jump the fence. With that discovery made, they jump the 4 ft fence easily and roam all day. The neighbors that scared them threatened to shoot them, so we brought them to safety as quickly as we could. However, they are really missing their livestock and their farm. \n\nDewey and Sky are 2 years old and such gentle spirits. They are wonderful guardians to all the animals on the farm. Dewey loves everyone big and small and is Mr. Personality! Sky is shy when meeting new people. She is sweet, but nervous and takes awhile to warm up. Dewey likes sleeping by the animals and Sky likes to sleep in her kennel. We think it makes her feel safe. Swimming in the pond is one of their favorite activities, they love to wrestle, and are learning to walk on a lead. Sky and Dewey will come to you neutered/spayed, up to date on vaccines, up to date on flea/tick preventatives, and microchipped. \n\nApplicants must have a secure and visible 6 ft fence. In order for your application to be approved, you must also pass a home check and a vet check which includes having at least a two year vet history. Dewey and Sky can be adopted in Missouri and surrounding states: Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. We are able to transport Dewey and Sky to those states. If you would like to give Dewey and Sky their furever home, please fill out an application on our website. \n\nBeing fostered in Ruthven, IA",

            "description": "Leonardo is a smart boy in search of a little courage. He needs a confident owner and a quiet home in order to blossom. He likes other dogs his size with goofy, playful personalities and would benefit from a furry sibling that could show him the ropes. He's a bit on the nervous side, so a home with older children and no cats to chase would be ideal. \n\nIn the home Leo is a true gentleman - smart, assertive, and playful with a touch of couch potatoe. He knows all of his basic commands and will happily show them off to you for some treats! He loves to snuggle and be near his humans, but can play independently when left alone as well. \n\nOutside the home, Leo can be timid and may require a slow introduction to new people. While he enjoys other dogs, his nervousness can make him a little reactive when greeting them on leash. This reactive behavior stems from uncertainty and the feeling that he has no ability to run away when he's restricted by the leash. If he can't run away from the scary new dog approaching him - he will bark LOUDLY to get them to go away. Off leash, however, Leo is a star. He feels free to greet other dogs on his terms and is often put into group play with his trainer to help build his confidence and keep him socialized. \n\nAt the end of the day, all Leo wants and needs is a quiet home to call his own, a patient owner to show him the ropes and a few longs walks a day to stretch his legs. In return, you will get the unconditional love of a dog that's been misunderstood for most of his life. A dog that just wants someone to finally call his own. If you think this may be you, please contact us for a private meet and greet with our Leo! \n\n \n\nFollow us on Facebook for additional updates and sneak peeks of new dogs! https://www.facebook.com/reachrescue",

            "description": "***PLEASE READ ENTIRE BIO BEFORE APPLYING***\nMeet Miss Marilyn Monroe! Aptly named after a true diva, Marilyn is as dramatic as they come. She likes to cuddle and love on her people, but only on her terms.\u00a0She loves to play, but she can be sensitive if it\u2019s \u201ctoo much\u201d. And she plays well with dogs of all sizes, but she insists on being in charge. \n\nMarilyn is a smart cookie and incredibly food motivated. No matter if she's napping or playing, she's always ready to work for a treat. She would love nothing more than to find an adopter who wants to teach her a bunch of tricks.\n\nWe believe Marilyn came from an abusive situation, because she was fearful of being touched in certain places. She has nipped in the past, but after a lot of rehabbing, she is much more trusting. She will need an adopter who is patient and experienced, and understands that rehabbing an abused dog is an ongoing process. \n\nIf you're interested in adopting this pet please fill out our matchmaking questionnaire (www.rescuefromthehart.org).  We are volunteer based and will do our best to get back to you within 72 hours.  Please do not call as our phone is intended for emergencies only. If we feel that one of our dogs is a good match we will set up a private meet and greet  We do not have a physical location where you can come and meet all the dogs at once, so meet and greets may take a little time to coordinate.  Our requested adoption donation is $350 and all adopters are required to fill out an adoption agreement.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website. All of our dogs and cats are in foster homes and we have no paid staff. If you have questions concerning a specific animal, PLEASE fill out an application and the foster parent will be in touch. We will not arrange any home visits with any of our dogs and cats until your application is processed. Please understand our foster parents are precious to our 2nd Chance family; without them we cannot function, so we do our best to not burden them with multiple appointments. Our foster parents will choose their top 3 applications and arrange home visits with these applicants. The adopter will be chosen at that time. The process can take anywhere from a week to a month. We want to make sure our little furry ones are placed in their 'forever home' and never have to go through a rehoming again!Prince is an amazing little dude. He is doing great here at the ranch with all the other dogs. He loves to play with Murphy and the two of them beat up on each other :) They would make a great pair to go together :)Prince can try to be 'bossy' with other pups so we need a family that will not allow him to do so. He LOVES people and is going to make someone a fantastic family member :) We are requiring the following in an adopter so please do not apply if you do not meet his needs1. Fenced yard2. Another pup for him to have as his forever friend.Please fill out an adoption application:\nAdoption application (Dog)\nAdoption Application (Cat)\n\nPlease understand we do not adopt out dogs to\nfamilies with children under the age of 5. We do not adopt dogs to renters. Some dogs will have fence requirements while others may not.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment. The dogs and cats in our system find themselves there, for the most part, because their humans did not have the same loyalty to them as they did to their owners. We do not take the adoption process lightly, and will do everything in our power to make sure the animal is placed correctly the first time around for your sake and theirs. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Over night 1/30:\nPirate is a sweetheart! He's so well behaved, loving, and an easy going dog.\n\nWhile Pirate was away for his overnight, he enjoyed a walk around the block, shopping at Pet Supermarket, playing with toys, relaxing and snoozing. He appeared to 'watch tv' while we were hanging out before bed.\n\nPirate rides well in the car. He'd probably prefer to ride shot gun if the front seat is open. He was fine in the backseat if both front seats were occupied. He settled into the house quickly, was perfect inside, and preferred to stay close by us. He looked forward to his meals and didn't waste any time finishing his dinner and breakfast.\n\nHe was good on the leash as we walked around the block in the neighborhood. We spent some time walking around in the yard several times because he didn't want to go much further. Pirate has a playful nature. He tugged and played with a squeaky llama and then fell asleep next to it. We got him a Nerf infinity tug toy at Pet Supermarket, and he enjoyed playing tug o war. He also liked using it as a chew toy.\n\nPirate is super chill, doesn't bark much, and is great companion.\nDog for a day with Pie Pie 1/14:\nWhen we first met him, he was so sweet. Seemed very open and excited to meet new people, keen for cuddles and any opportunities to play tug-of-war with his rope toy! . He was really great and calm in the car- stayed put pretty much the whole time. Inside our home, he was also very respectful. He is a good listener and responds to any 'No' and other basic commands really well. He was quite funny with his little tug-of-war rope toy and regularly brought it to us or dropped it at our feet as a signal for playtime. Also loves just chilling out and being pet/cuddled. On walks, he was great on the leash. Rarely pulls, and if you give a little tug to change direction, he will easily follow your lead. Otherwise, he usually walks right beside you. Lastly, we took him to an open field park and were able to let his leash go to play fetch with his rope toy, which he really loved. And even off-leash he listened very well and always came back to us after fetching his toy. Overall, a very great day with a sweet and fun dog.\nPER OUR VET AT THIS TIME PIRATE WOULD BENEFIT BY EATING ZD DRY FOOD. ZD IS GOOD FOR THE SKIN AND ALLERGIES.\n\nPirate is an Old English Bulldog but our system doesn't carry his breed. Pirate is a super sweet, loveable dog. Tug a war is his favorite game and just like any other bulldog, he loves food. Now Pirate has to be food that won't affect his skin. Even though he is big he wants to be a lap dog if given the chance.\nPirates little companion Molly got adopted leaving Pirate at the rescue alone. Pirate did have some medical concerns that have all been taken care of. Now it is his turn to go home. It is recommended that he be the only pet. He is a very easy dog despite his size. He will go outside do his business and then be happy to watch tv with you. Regretfully, Pirate's owner was not able to care for him any longer. Pirate is good with all children and people. He is a very loving dog.\nPirate does not particularly care for other dogs and is fine being only pet. Pirate is easily startled when he's asleep, and owners suggested not just walking up to him, but to talk to him/call his name as you approach him. He is almost 8 yrs after all, and is entitled to some senior quirks~Pirate, like many dogs, will go and hide if there is heavy rain or a thunder storm. Pirate is a wonderful dog for an adult home where he can share their loving personalities and have safe place to spend his golden years:)",

I may be heartworm positive but don't let that scare you away from my sweet personality. Also don't my age fool you because I am as active as a 1 year old pup. I do amazing on walks and I ignore distractions such as dogs and golf carts. I love to play with other dogs, however I would prefer to NOT go home with cats. The nice workers here suspect I was an outside dog so I do need some house manners. I am a fun-loving pup looking for a forever family that I can constantly give kisses to!\n\nIf you would like to meet me, contact the Humane Society of Manatee County to schedule an appointment.\n(941) 747-8808 ext. 313 or 312 email us at adoptions@humanesocietymanatee.org",

They finally caught me after I gave them a good run, so here I am rescued, getting fatter by the day and having a great time in my rescuers\u2019 home.  \nI get along well with everyone here as I love people (and other dogs as well), and am super playful. I am now concentrating on getting myself adopted, looking for a home with a nice family and if they have another dog that would be the best.  I would love a home with a backyard, (with grass to just lay on would be awesome)!  If you are looking for a super sweet little guy who is pretty easy going please keep me in mind.  I have all of my vaccinations and am neutered.  \n",

Much like his prison buddy, Jimmy,  he came to us not knowing much about anyone or anybody.   His obedience is good and his social skills much improved.   He can still play a bit on the hard side so we recommend older children and if there's another dog in the home,   one that young enough to match his energy level.   TEX needs a fenced in yard and would not be appropriate for leash walking only.   If interested in adopting TEX,  our process begins with the application which can be found on our website www.adoptmebluegrasspetrescue.com",

Bronx is a brick wall of sexy that looks like he ate pre-workout for breakfast and then mainlined an entire bottle of protein powder. He's a wrecking ball of love that crashes into you with slobber and dirty paws and insists that you rub his belly. He's more power lifter than distance runner so he tires out quickly and would be a good couch potato with a little bit of regular exercise everyday. He's too clueless about his size to be good around small children but is friendly and would do fine with older kids we think. He'd rather be the only pet and center of attention and is big enough that there's plenty of love to go around!",

            "description": "Boris is a male mixed breed dog, who came to our shelter as a stray in October. He is being overlooked, perhaps because he has a poor kennel presence. He is like a teenage boy who needs direction on how best to channel his happy energy. Boris loves to play in the yard with toys, he\u2019s pretty good on a leash, is food motivated, so easy to train. He already knows sit, and Paw.\nBoris is a good dog that has tolerated such a stressful shelter environment for several months, which is testament to his stellar personality. Boris recently got to go on an adventure with a volunteer. She reports that Boris was great in the car and really enjoyed sticking his nose out the window to smell 'all the things'. She took him for walks in City Park, Armstrong Park and Uptown and he was a gentlemen with people he met and when he saw another dog he was curious but not overbearing.\nNot surprisingly, Boris is more relaxed outside of the shelter environment and wanted to be pet and loved on. Boris is waiting for his forever home. Is it you? \nBoris is a 2 year old black mouth cur mix (we think)....\nhe\u2019s neutered, 59 lbs, up to date on shots, and ready to play! His adoption fee is $67 and he is at the Jefferson Parish Animal Shelter in Louisiana. Boris loves to play with stuffy toys and rope toys. He really likes to play tug o war!! Boris isn\u2019t a \u201cHugger\u201d and is a little aloof. We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because he\u2019s a bit on edge at the shelter, or if in general he\u2019s aloof. He will let you pet him, but he\u2019s not needy. He does love a good game of \u201ckeep a way\u201d and takes immense joy having you try to \u201cget the toy\u201d from him. Boris knows \u201csit\u201d, \u201cstay\u201d, and \u201cpaw\u201d. He tested well with another dog at the shelter but a meet and greet is recommended as Boris  can be a 'humper'. . Boris is heartworm negative, yay! To meet Boris email ryeaton@jeffparish.net or call 504 736-6111 to make an appointment!\n\nAdoption fee includes vaccinations, spay/neuter, heartworm test, and microchip.\n\nCall 504 736-6111 to meet Boris!\n*Dogs are pending behavior and other-animal assessment unless otherwise noted here.\n\n\nAvailable for adoption, foster, or rescue at:\n\nJefferson Parish Animal Shelter 1 Humane Way, Harahan, LA 70123\n504 736-6111\nPlease provide ID number when visiting shelter.

Can you believe that for the first 9 years of my life I didn\u2019t know what a toy was? Yeah, I didn\u2019t live like most \u201chousehold pets\u201d live, because well\u2026. I wasn\u2019t a \u201chousehold pet,\u201d but we don\u2019t need to rehash old details. Let me ask you this:  are you looking for your first dog ever? If so, then we wouldn\u2019t be a good fit. You see, I\u2019m not a perfect dog, but here\u2019s a friendly reminder:  no dog is perfect, especially not us rescues. But rescue pooches are the best pooches because you get to see us blossom! So yeah, I\u2019m a work in progress, but deep down, I\u2019m a really sweet guy ? I\u2019m learning so many new things since coming to TGRR. I\u2019m learning that I don\u2019t have to bark at new people, how to walk on a leash, and they\u2019re teaching me how to \u2018sit\u2019 and \u2018stay\u2019 and other things like that. Here\u2019s the good news:  I am a really smart dog, and once I get to know you, we\u2019ll be BFFs forever! I\u2019d love to live in a quiet place, with no kids in the house and no cats, and I\u2019d really like to be an only dog and have you all to myself!  In other words, if you will rescue me, then I\u2019ll rescue you.\n\n**Our adoption applications are not open, if interested in River please fill out a CONTACT FORM ON TGRR.ORG!",

When I was a puppy someone threw me out of the car and it has left me with some minor difficulties... I don't have the best balance with my hind legs and sometimes end up flopping over and I can't hold my bladder as long as others. I would need frequent walks to lessen the chance of an accident in the house and would most likely do best around older kids or adults only so they don't accidentally hurt my back. I would do best as the only pet in your life, I don't really like other dogs or cats. I love walking and loving on people! I am pretty laid back and can be a couch potato! \n\n\n\nPlease call 863-577-4615 with questions or to schedule an appointment to meet me! It would make my day!\n\n\n\nMolly is incontinent and will never be housebroken. She has limited control over her bowel moments.",

My name is Iggy and I'm super excited to meet you. I've been living in Minneapolis for the last eight months. I came from a tough situation in Texas where I was called Chong, but Iggy is my preferred name. I weigh 50 pounds (all muscle!) and recently celebrated my first birthday! Woohoo!\n\nMy breed is Blue Heeler (Australian Cattle Dog) and Bully mix with a little bit of German Sheperd. I am a high energy dog and I have a big silly wiggly happy personality. I make my mom laugh every day. I love playing hard with the other dog in my house. I also try to play with the cat. Sometimes he plays with me but sometimes he swats at me. I can't figure him out! I would do best in a house with a playful tolerant dog or dogs that can help keep me busy. I would do okay in a home with no other pets if there are people at home most of the time who can give me lots of walks and attention. Also I am not into dog parks. Too many dogs at once stresses me out! But I love playing one-to-one or in small groups in my yard.\n\nI am looking to join an active home where we will go on daily walks (or runs or hikes!) I can go and go. Also, I do great walking on a leash when it is attached to my harness. Although sometimes I'll pull when I see a squirrel!\n\nIn addition to daily exercise, I need a home where I can get a lot of human attention. Otherwise, I get bored. And when I'm bored, I let you know by barking and bringing you my toys. You can keep me entertained with puzzle toys, tug toys, fetch, chews, brain games, training games, or a frozen peanut butter filled Kong is great! Did I mention I completed basic training? I'm a good listener and eager to please. An advanced training class would be something fun we could do to bond together!\n\nAt the end of the day, I love to cuddle up with you. Best of all is my head on your lap. I'd love to sleep in bed with you too. I am great snuggler and I give very gentle kisses.\n\nA couple things you should know about me: I should only live with adults or older kids who know how to be calm. Sometimes I bark at new people until I am sure they are my friend. I mean no harm! Sometimes I jump up on people but only because I want to give my new friend some affection. If you remind me, I do a pretty good job of sitting & staying, especially if you have some treats in your pocket when new people come over!\n\nI hope you will take chance on a great guy like me. We are going to have so much fun together!\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal.\n\nPlease check out our website, www.ruffstartrescue.org for more details and additional pictures on any of our animals!\n\nAll Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs).\n\nRuff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue. Animals are located in homes throughout Minnesota. We do not have a facility where animals are kept.\n\nRuff Start Rescue Adoption Policies: http://www.ruffstartrescue.org/info/display?PageID=11744",

Echo is deaf and because of this, she will need an owner who will be willing to use training methods that will fit her needs such as teaching her hand signals. Because she cannot hear, sometimes when she gets excited she makes a lot of silly noises. She is kennel trained and keeps her run at the boarding facility very clean. She loves to burrow under her blankets. She also loves to play with stuffed animals and rope toys. Echo is not dog aggressive, but she is very fearful when meeting new dogs. She would be best either as an only pet or in a home with a very mellow dog friend. Also because she can be fearful of dogs, she will most likely need multiple intros with any potential doggy friends.\n\nEcho is an incredibly smart dog and learns quickly. She has the cutest wiggle dance ever when she is happy to see her humans. Echo has a lot of energy and will thrive with someone who will give her plenty of daily exercise. Echo needs a home without cats. She is GREAT with kids.  She is very affectionate and can sometimes be a little overexcited and may knock over a small toddler. This is something can be worked on but older kids may be better suited for her energy level.",

My sister, Lilah and I were dumped out like trash one day; we were lying in a ditch on the side of the road when a kind stranger picked us up and took us to ARFhouse!\n\nI am a super sweet, energetic Pit Bull mix and I LOVE to play! I need a fenced yard to run and play; I would not be suitable for an apartment. I am approximately 6-8 months old and I currently weigh 30 lbs., but will likely weigh around 55 lbs. fully-grown. I need some basic training but heck, I\u2019m a puppy! I am very smart and eager to learn; I will make a great addition to your family.\n\nThe fee to adopt Daisy is $200.00; this includes spay/neuter, deworming, vaccinations and a microchip. If you are interested in adopting Daisy, please visit our website. www.arfhouse.org and fill out an adoption application. \n\n**Please Note: Daisy is currently located at our facility in Sherman, Texas. Adoptions are by-appointment only; if you would like to meet Daisy, please fill out an application on our website. Once we have your application, our Adoption Coordinator will follow up with you ASAP with any questions she may have, or to set up a meet-and-greet.",

Buddy is a brindle and white possible boxer and Bailey is a brindle possible retriever mix. They have always been together and are what you would call Ying and Yang. They are both incredibly loving, Buddy is more of your chill and Bailey energetic. They never meet a stranger they don\u2019t like, and are always eager to please and get some cuddles. They both love to go for walks outdoors and do well on a leash, Bailey could use some  more training. He would rather be curled up in your lap. They haven\u2019t shown any aggression toward the other animals at the shelter but a meet and greet is always recommended. Bailey does seem to be iffy with some dogs and prefers to just have Buddy by his side. Big Buddy seems to enjoy having the attention of children, Bailey has not shown much interest though would probably do well in a home with older children. They would do very well in a family home where they can get lots of love and attention from lots of people. Come meet this pair today and let their adorableness win you over!",

Bubby is a brindle and white possible boxer and Bailey is a brindle possible retriever mix. They have always been together and are what you would call Ying and Yang. They are both incredibly loving, Buddy is more of your chill and Bailey energetic. They never meet a stranger they don\u2019t like, and are always eager to please and get some cuddles. They both love to go for walks outdoors and do well on a leash, Bailey could use some  more training. He would rather be curled up in your lap. They haven\u2019t shown any aggression toward the other animals at the shelter but a meet and greet is always recommended. Bailey does seem to be iffy with some dogs and prefers to just have Buddy by his side. Big Buddy seems to enjoy having the attention of children, Bailey has not shown much interest though would probably do well in a home with older children. They would do very well in a family home where they can get lots of love and attention from lots of people. Come meet this pair today and let their adorableness win you over!",

He is an incredibly sweet boy who absolutely loves attention and cuddles! He is a bit shy with new people but warms up quickly when shown affection. He would love a home with lots of room to run around outside, and a family with lots of time to give him attention. He was surrendered due to a highly unfortunate situation to no fault of his own or former owners. He may be okay with some bigger dogs, but he is stand offish at first. Meet and Greets are always a must and especially in this case. He was the only dog in his home, so ideally, he would benefit most if it's kept that way. He walks well on a leash and understands his basic commands. With this fella, the best thing to do is start slow. He doesn't have 'trust issues' but he was very much attached to his former owner who was male and it shows. He responds well to a strong male voice in return as well for commands. Older kids would be a better suite for him since he hasn't been around kids BUT LOVES TO RUN and certainly has the energy for older kids. Someone with the same energy level would be great as well!  Come meet this sweet boy today!",

After a rough start of mistreatment and abandonment by his prior owners, Moose simply wants to feel safe and learn to trust. This boy is house trained, leash trained, crate trained and knows sit, lay down and no. He is also working on bell training for his potty needs! Moose is trustworthy with free roam but does have separation anxiety when left for long periods of time. He will bark to alert, but knows not to dig or chew. His favorite hobbies include chasing a ball, playing with squeaky toys or enjoying a treat filled Kong. Moose does well with other dogs, cats and kiddos are unknown at this time but at this point we suggest older only. This handsome young boy will thrive in a positive environment with proper boundaries and love and affection. Could you be the new family Moose so desires?\n\nGiant Breed Experienced Homes Only.\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

Great dogs like me end up in animal shelters every day- I know, it\u2019s so hard to believe but it\u2019s true!\n\nMy name is Heath, and I just joined the adoptable doggy crew at Providence Animal Center after traveling here from North Carolina. I'm around 1 & 1/2 years old, about 62 pounds, and I'm all set to move right into your heart & home today - already neutered, microchipped & up to date on vaccinations. \n\nThe kind staff back in NC call me 'a happy, young soul' and the PAC staff & volunteers describe me as a friendly, nonstop wiggle butt who is sweet and loves to cuddle. The staff think that I'd probably do well living with humans who are 16 & older. And I happen to LOVE other dogs, so I'd likely do well with a doggy pal in my forever home!\n\nIf I sound like I could be your new BFF and you'd like to meet me in person, just schedule an appointment here: ProvidenceAC.org/AdoptADog. My paws are crossed I will see you very soon! XOXO Heath\"\n\n-------\nDuring your appointment, you will be able to meet a selection of pets in the Kennels or Cattery that day. New pets are arriving daily!\n-------\n\nProvidence Animal Center relies on adoption fees and donations to save pets! Adoption fees vary per pet. To find out this pet\u2019s adoption fee or for more information, please call the Adoption Center with this pet\u2019s ID number.\n\nCan\u2019t adopt? Consider fostering or donating! Visit https://providenceac.org/support-us/ for more information on how you can support the lifesaving mission!",

We have discovered that Gempler calms down and finds security in the comfort of human arms, so caregivers and volunteers are making sure to cuddle him often. Otherwise, he is sort of lazy and loves hanging out in the sunshine. Winter in Nebraska will be a shock to this little Texan, so Gempler needs to find his new home as soon as possible. Another small dog in the house will likely help him with a smooth transition.\n\nVisit Gempler at www.hua.org!",

He is very shy and skittish and takes some time to warm up to humans, even when they're providing soft blankets and nutritious meals. He prefers to play outside in the sunshine but being in Nebraska will make even that favorite pastime impossible once the weather turns. Percy needs a person to love him unconditionally, with no expectations. He will eventually get his bearings and learn to enjoy life so patience will be the key to his happiness.\n\nVisit Percy at www.hua.org!",

            "description": "1-22-21 update: Smoot has returned from his adoption. Here is what his adopter had to say about Smoot in a home environment.\n\n\"Smoot was perfect in every way except for he wasn't completely house trained , destroyed his bed and could not walk on a leash.  The main reason I returned him was because a couple days after I got him I was given a promotion at work and started spending 16+ hours at work and no time at home and had no time for him.\"\n\nSmoot is neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, and tested heartworm positive. We do provide a voucher for the treatment with adoption.\n\nHere is a copy of his behavior assessment: \n\t\n1.  Kennel Approach \u2013 fearful, regression with not aggression cautious. But good in kennel\n\n2.  Possession \u2013 shows no interest in toy. Sniffed toy but wouldn\u2019t take toy to engage\n\n3.  Touch/Handling \u2013 seeks attention. Over stimulated. Gets mouthy.\n\n4.  Food \u2013 indifferent or friendly. Can take bowl and touch all over with no problem\n\n5.  Correction - slow to correct. Multiple corrections. Needs a strong handler\n\n6.  Dominance \u2013 Stiffens up in reaction\n\n7.  Dog to Dog Intro -   Interested social toward other dog. JayPaz- super excited to meet him, tail wag the entire time. Both jumped all over each other.

Post rescue, she is receiving the veterinary care that she deserves and is resting comfortably in a foster home.\n\nDespite Diva's past, she is one of the most sweetest, docile angels that you will meet. She loves people - both adults and children, enjoys going for walks, is housebroken, and crate trained.\n\nShe often will go outside for a little Vit. D while sunning herself on a chaise lounge. She enjoys playing with her toys and chew sticks. She also likes to protect her home from visiting squirrels. She is very smart, and obeys direction and commands easily. Diva is a doll who will fit into any home.\n\nIf you think this beautiful girl is one you want to join your family, please fill out an application at www.doggiebonez.com so that we can schedule a meet and greet.

I think I would do well in a home with kids older than 14.\n\n4.\tThe words that best describe me are adorable, sweet, friendly, and affectionate. \n\n5.\tAlthough I\u2019ve mostly only met larger dogs, so far I haven\u2019t found a canine that I didn\u2019t get along with.  As long as my new owners were willing to give me a proper introduction to their dogs, I think I could happily live in a home with other pups.   \n\n6.\tI\u2019m very interested in the resident feline in my foster home.  I am learning to be redirected but the jury is still out if I can be trusted to cohabitate with cats.  \n\n7.\tMy two favorite things are getting attention from humans and playing with toys (I\u2019ve been known to carry a ball or bone around with me on my walks!).  \n\n8.\tI am housebroken, wonderful in the crate, and I am perfecting my leash skills!\n \n9.\tI have osteoarthritis in my both my back and front legs.  It doesn\u2019t bother me too much but I will probably need to take medication and/or supplements for the rest of my life.  While I can and do go up/down a small flight of stairs at my Foster Home, a home with no more than a short flight of stairs would be best.  Luckily for everyone, I take medicine and treats very gently.\n\n10.\tI am fully vaccinated, heartworm negative, neutered, and microchipped. \n\nReady to give Teddy the forever home of his dreams?  Fill out our Adoption Application, located at www.bullpenrescue.org under the 'work with us' tab.\n\nWe highly recommend that our potential adopters fill out an online application as soon as possible, as it greatly expedites the process of finding the right dog for your situation.  \n\nOur dogs are available for adoption nationwide but preference is given to adopters willing to do an in-person meeting.  Please understand that our dogs are not adopted on a first-come, first-serve basis, but rather we strive for a \"perfect placement\" so we know that they will not be failed again.",

Once animals are posted, we immediately begin receiving applications. With one volunteer available to review all applications, we appreciate your patience as you wait for an email response. Adoption appointments are scheduled in the order that approved applications are received. You can find our adoption procedures and online application at warmhearts.org/adopt.\n\nThelma and her sister were both surrendered to us after being found stray. She is a sweetheart who loves people and attention. Although Thelma is a bit shy at first, she'll melt at your feet for belly rubs. Thelma would do best in a home with a fenced yard where she can get plenty of exercise safely. Thelma's estimated DOB is 8/1/2017. She weighs approximately 50 pounds now and shouldn't grow much larger in size. We cannot be sure if Thelma is house trained; she walks good on a leash. Currently on HW restrictions. Treated 10/27-10/28/20\n\nHSPC's adoption fee is seventy-five-dollars through December 31, 2020, unless stated otherwise within the pet's description. At times, our adoption fees are lowered during special events that are posted to our website or Facebook page. Every pet that is available for adoption has been spayed/neutered, microchipped, and is up-to-date on vaccinations including heartworm preventative (canines). Adopters are required to schedule a wellness exam with their veterinarian at their cost within 7 days of adoption.\n\nPlease only submit one application. Once you are contacted by email, you will have an opportunity to provide us with any additional animal(s) under consideration.",

            "description": "BUNNY is a beautiful, happy-go-lucky,  9 month old terrier-pit mix.   She loves to play outside, run around in the yard and play in her kiddie pool.   She loves peanut butter, sticks, and all types of chew toy.  Bunny doesn't realize she weighs almost 50 pounds and thinks she is still a lap dog!       She loves any type of chew toy, cuddling her humans, and will even enjoy a bath if she can enjoy licky pads with peanut butter!   She is smart, and goofy, and 100% puppy.  Bunny is still an energetic puppy and will make an amazing addition to any family. \n\nAll our adoption fees include spay/neuter, micro-chip, up-to-date vaccinations, including rabies thru date of adoption. This pup tested heartworm negative, and is on regular monthly heartworm prevention & on flea/tick prevention. \n\nIn order to be considered for one of our beautiful pups, please go to our website and complete and application: https://www.mustluvdogs.org/adoptable-pets.\nPlease note that we are a DUE DILIGENCE adoption organization. Part of our approval process requires, among other things:\n* Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered.\n*The majority, but not all, of our pets require a fenced yard or secure enclosure.  In the case of apartments, we require Landlord approval and designated dog area in complex.\n*Verifiable good veterinary history INCLUDING regular vaccination/visits and good Heartworm Prevention history is a MUST!\n*Adopter must be able to have time to spend with the pup and be able to provide the pup a safe environment to live.\n*ALL our dogs are expected to be primarily INSIDE dogs.  They MUST sleep inside the home.  We truly understand that some folks have working dogs (i.e. farmers, ranchers,etc); however, the majority of our dogs have had a rough life prior to coming to us & we want to make sure that they are showered with LUV & maybe even a bit spoiled for the rest of their lives. \n\nOther facts are also considered, including whether children or other pets are a good fit with the dog. \n\nMust Luv Dogs reserves the right to deny any applications that we don't think are a good fit with the pup. Our first & foremost concern is the dog's best interest. It is our MISSION to place them in a home that is a great fit for their needs for a lifetime of luv & being part of a family.\n*We will consider adoptions in any area; however, will do not ship or transport puppies under the age of 12 mos. We will ONLY transport an adult dog on a transport approved by MLD, at adopter's expense.\n* In order to be affordable and afford every family an opportunity to have a pup of their own, we keep our Adoption Fees low; however, please keep in mind that the fees we charge do not cover all costs for the pup.  Any additional donations are greatly appreciated!\n\nPlease note that all of our pets are in private foster homes. In order to reduce any stress or confusion for our pups, we require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meet & greet for any of our pups.  Alternatively, you are always welcome to come meet any of our pups at one of our regular Adoption Events.   Our events are always posted on PetFinder OR on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/mustLUVdogs.org.\n\nFinally, THANK YOU for considering Must Luv Dogs for your next pet. \n\n*Most dogs require a fenced area in yard. \n*Apartments okay IF nearby dog park or walking trails (with landlord appoval).\n*ALL dogs must be INSIDE dogs and treated a part of family. \n*We are a DUE DILIGENCE Adoption Rescue.  \n*Must have good Vet history & Heartworm prevention is a MUST!\n*ALL dogs are fully vetted, spay/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption.\n\nFYI:   Even though this pup tested heartworm negative, we provide the following procedural information for your information:  Any of our pups who test HW+ are treated with the *slow kill method of treatment.   The *slow-kill method, simply stated, is a 30 day regiment of  doxycycline followed by a monthly dose of Advantage Multi for 12 months, then retesting.   Most dogs test negative after one year of following this treatment; however, we always recommend that potential adopters consult & follow the advice of their family veterinarian upon adopting any of our hw+ pups.   Although the fast-kill method is still considered the \"gold-standard\" by the AVA, and may be preferred by some vets; the slow-kill method has proven to be effective in our rescue. The main reason we utilize this method is due to our limited financial constraints and the high number of our rescue pups that are infected.   In the cases of severe infection and if the pup is highly symptomatic, we sometimes use the fast-kill approach instead.   Again, we recommend for you to consult with your veterinarian after the adoption is complete and follow their recommendations.",

Not a bad thing at all.\n\nHe deserves a home where he can nap most of the day and come to you for some serious loving when he wants it.He prefers soft blankets and plush beds so he can fluff them to his liking.\n\nHe is a little hard of hearing, and maybe his sight too. And he has hip dysplasia. But that really doesn't change much. He loves when his foster mom sings to him and dances around the house. It makes him feel like a spring chicken! He loves it.\n\nWe are here for a lifetime of support for this boy.He just needs someone who can look past his imperfections and give him a soft landing.\n\nAdopt Buddy and find your new best friend. He has wisdom and lots of love for the right people. Apply at doghouserescueacademy.org",

            "description": "Pachino is around 1 year old and weighs 40 pounds. His ideal weight is approximately 47 pounds. He was rescued as an emaciated stray. While gaining back weight, we searched for his potential owners to no avail. He is now on the look-out for his forever home! His adoption fee is $465 which covers the cost of his neuter, all core vaccines (Rabies and Distemper/Parvo), microchip and microchip registration. If you are interested in adopting, please complete an application, available on our website, poochmatch.com, under the adoption tab and please read the paragraphs below for more details on our process.\n\nIf this listing is still posted, we are still accepting applications for him/her. We do not do out-of-state adoptions on highly adoptable dogs; we would only consider out-of-state adoptions for dogs that prove hard-to-place locally. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nUPDATE: ADOPTION EVENTS CANCELLED DUE TO PANDEMIC AND SOCIAL DISTANCING. If you are interested in meeting any Poochmatch dog at our weekly adoption event on Saturdays at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda, CA (5521 Mirage St.) between 1-5 PM, please fill out an application from our website, poochmatch.com, and submit it no later than 11 AM on Fridays. Upon receipt AND approval, the dog you are interested in meeting will be made available to meet on a Saturday. Due to the high volume of dogs and puppies in our foster homes, it is impossible to bring them all every Saturday. The only way to ensure that the dog that you are interested in will be at the adoption event is to FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AND BE APPROVED. Otherwise, we cannot guarantee that the dog you are interested in will be at our adoption event. If you cannot make the time frame of our events, appointments can be made at another time and location solely at the discretion of the foster parent. Please understand that private appointments will be coordinated to meet the convenience of the foster parent/transporter. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nAll adoption fees cover the mandatory and non-negotiable spay/neuter, rabies, microchip, microchip registration, full sets of core vaccinations (rabies and 1 set of distemper/parvo for adults, 4 for puppies) and deworming. Adoption fees vary based on age, breed, size and the costs incurred on the dog's behalf by us i.e. medical, behavioral training, etc. and they range from $225-$495.\n\n\nCOVID-19 PROCEDURE:\nIn an effort to create a safe environment for our potential adopters and our staff, we have changed our protocols and procedures during these difficult times. Starting immediately, our procedures will change from what\u2019s written on our website and other social media platforms. Our weekly adoption event at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda is temporarily cancelled due to COVID-19 and social distancing. The only way to meet one of the dogs/puppies we have available for adoption is through completion of our adoption application through our website, poochmatch.com, before 11 AM on Fridays. On Fridays when we review the applications, we will pick the best fit for each dog or puppy applied for and coordinate mutually agreeable appointment times for the applicants who are approved that week. Private appointments are currently only scheduled on Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday of each week. Masks or bandanas are mandatory; faces must be properly covered.\n\nWith the overwhelming desire of the public to adopt at this time, we have received as many as 30 applications for one dog in just one week. Working with a staff of volunteers, we are only able to reach out on Fridays to the people we have approved to adopt. If you have not heard from us by Friday, we have selected a different applicant. If you have multiple dogs/puppies that you are interested in, please indicate each dog/puppy of interest on the application at that time so we don\u2019t rule you out for another dog/puppy available for adoption.\n\nPlease understand, we have an influx of texts, phone calls and emails that makes it impossible to get to each and every one of you. Not just for adoption interest, but also from veterinarians, people who must relinquish dogs, people who have found a stray dog in need of pick up, etc. We are currently not in need of fosters. Due to the fact that there is such a high demand, we are sticking with strict protocol to not adopt out of Southern California. We apologize for this inconvenience and difficulty to be able to get in touch with us while there is an overwhelming desire and demand to adopt at this time. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we navigate through these difficult times with every intention to keep the public and our staff safe.",

He came to us from El Centro where he was going to be euthanized only because is a little older and has some hind end weakness believed to be from an old injury. He can get around ok and sadly it seems that there is not much to be done except to provide him time to heal to see if meds and supplements will continue to bring improved mobility. He has a heart of gold and loves everyone he meets and is polite with all of his 4 legged friends also. He does fine on a leash, is crate trained, and will potty outside if brought out frequently enough, though is not completely housetrained (capable of notifying reliably).. If you are looking for a cuddle bug and loyal little pup, then Asiago is the one!!",

He will let you know when he wants to go outside, but hes not house trained yet, though hes working on it!\nHe is good with other dogs, and is a pretty mellow guy!

            "description": "Oliver and Olivia are 1-2 years old and each weigh not quite 40 pounds. They were born in open desert and survived thanks to the kindness of strangers who left food and water on a daily basis. We were able to catch them and their mother. A TOUGH CATCH! They are wholesome, healthy and sociable with other dogs. A little shy at first, they would do best in a home that is willing to help them build confidence. Their adoption fee is $825 as a pair, which covers the cost of their spay/neuter, all core vaccines (Rabies and Distemper/Parvo), flea & tick medications, fecal-testing, microchips and microchip registrations. If you are interested in adopting, please complete an application, available on our website, poochmatch.com, under the adoption tab and please read the paragraphs below for more details on our process.\n\nIf this listing is still posted, we are still accepting applications for him/her. We do not do out-of-state adoptions on highly adoptable dogs; we would only consider out-of-state adoptions for dogs that prove hard-to-place locally. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nUPDATE: ADOPTION EVENTS CANCELLED DUE TO PANDEMIC AND SOCIAL DISTANCING. If you are interested in meeting any Poochmatch dog at our weekly adoption event on Saturdays at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda, CA (5521 Mirage St.) between 1-5 PM, please fill out an application from our website, poochmatch.com, and submit it no later than 11 AM on Fridays. Upon receipt AND approval, the dog you are interested in meeting will be made available to meet on a Saturday. Due to the high volume of dogs and puppies in our foster homes, it is impossible to bring them all every Saturday. The only way to ensure that the dog that you are interested in will be at the adoption event is to FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AND BE APPROVED. Otherwise, we cannot guarantee that the dog you are interested in will be at our adoption event. If you cannot make the time frame of our events, appointments can be made at another time and location solely at the discretion of the foster parent. Please understand that private appointments will be coordinated to meet the convenience of the foster parent/transporter. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nAll adoption fees cover the mandatory and non-negotiable spay/neuter, rabies, microchip, microchip registration, full sets of core vaccinations (rabies and 1 set of distemper/parvo for adults, 4 for puppies) and deworming. Adoption fees vary based on age, breed, size and the costs incurred on the dog's behalf by us i.e. medical, behavioral training, etc. and they range from $225-$495.\n\n\nCOVID-19 PROCEDURE:\nIn an effort to create a safe environment for our potential adopters and our staff, we have changed our protocols and procedures during these difficult times. Starting immediately, our procedures will change from what\u2019s written on our website and other social media platforms. Our weekly adoption event at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda is temporarily cancelled due to COVID-19 and social distancing. The only way to meet one of the dogs/puppies we have available for adoption is through completion of our adoption application through our website, poochmatch.com, before 11 AM on Fridays. On Fridays when we review the applications, we will pick the best fit for each dog or puppy applied for and coordinate mutually agreeable appointment times for the applicants who are approved that week. Private appointments are currently only scheduled on Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday of each week. Masks or bandanas are mandatory; faces must be properly covered.\n\nWith the overwhelming desire of the public to adopt at this time, we have received as many as 30 applications for one dog in just one week. Working with a staff of volunteers, we are only able to reach out on Fridays to the people we have approved to adopt. If you have not heard from us by Friday, we have selected a different applicant. If you have multiple dogs/puppies that you are interested in, please indicate each dog/puppy of interest on the application at that time so we don\u2019t rule you out for another dog/puppy available for adoption.\n\nPlease understand, we have an influx of texts, phone calls and emails that makes it impossible to get to each and every one of you. Not just for adoption interest, but also from veterinarians, people who must relinquish dogs, people who have found a stray dog in need of pick up, etc. We are currently not in need of fosters. Due to the fact that there is such a high demand, we are sticking with strict protocol to not adopt out of Southern California. We apologize for this inconvenience and difficulty to be able to get in touch with us while there is an overwhelming desire and demand to adopt at this time. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we navigate through these difficult times with every intention to keep the public and our staff safe.",

            "description": "Oliver (white) and Olivia (golden) are 1-2 years old and each weigh not quite 40 pounds. They were born in open desert and survived thanks to the kindness of strangers who left food and water on a daily basis. We were able to catch them and their mother. A TOUGH CATCH! They are wholesome, healthy and sociable with other dogs. A little shy at first, they would do best in a home that is willing to help them build confidence. Their adoption fee is $825 as a pair, which covers the cost of their spay/neuter, all core vaccines (Rabies and Distemper/Parvo), flea & tick medications, fecal-testing, microchips and microchip registrations. If you are interested in adopting, please complete an application, available on our website, poochmatch.com, under the adoption tab and please read the paragraphs below for more details on our process.\n\nIf this listing is still posted, we are still accepting applications for him/her. We do not do out-of-state adoptions on highly adoptable dogs; we would only consider out-of-state adoptions for dogs that prove hard-to-place locally. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nUPDATE: ADOPTION EVENTS CANCELLED DUE TO PANDEMIC AND SOCIAL DISTANCING. If you are interested in meeting any Poochmatch dog at our weekly adoption event on Saturdays at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda, CA (5521 Mirage St.) between 1-5 PM, please fill out an application from our website, poochmatch.com, and submit it no later than 11 AM on Fridays. Upon receipt AND approval, the dog you are interested in meeting will be made available to meet on a Saturday. Due to the high volume of dogs and puppies in our foster homes, it is impossible to bring them all every Saturday. The only way to ensure that the dog that you are interested in will be at the adoption event is to FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AND BE APPROVED. Otherwise, we cannot guarantee that the dog you are interested in will be at our adoption event. If you cannot make the time frame of our events, appointments can be made at another time and location solely at the discretion of the foster parent. Please understand that private appointments will be coordinated to meet the convenience of the foster parent/transporter. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nAll adoption fees cover the mandatory and non-negotiable spay/neuter, rabies, microchip, microchip registration, full sets of core vaccinations (rabies and 1 set of distemper/parvo for adults, 4 for puppies) and deworming. Adoption fees vary based on age, breed, size and the costs incurred on the dog's behalf by us i.e. medical, behavioral training, etc. and they range from $225-$495.\n\n\nCOVID-19 PROCEDURE:\nIn an effort to create a safe environment for our potential adopters and our staff, we have changed our protocols and procedures during these difficult times. Starting immediately, our procedures will change from what\u2019s written on our website and other social media platforms. Our weekly adoption event at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda is temporarily cancelled due to COVID-19 and social distancing. The only way to meet one of the dogs/puppies we have available for adoption is through completion of our adoption application through our website, poochmatch.com, before 11 AM on Fridays. On Fridays when we review the applications, we will pick the best fit for each dog or puppy applied for and coordinate mutually agreeable appointment times for the applicants who are approved that week. Private appointments are currently only scheduled on Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday of each week. Masks or bandanas are mandatory; faces must be properly covered.\n\nWith the overwhelming desire of the public to adopt at this time, we have received as many as 30 applications for one dog in just one week. Working with a staff of volunteers, we are only able to reach out on Fridays to the people we have approved to adopt. If you have not heard from us by Friday, we have selected a different applicant. If you have multiple dogs/puppies that you are interested in, please indicate each dog/puppy of interest on the application at that time so we don\u2019t rule you out for another dog/puppy available for adoption.\n\nPlease understand, we have an influx of texts, phone calls and emails that makes it impossible to get to each and every one of you. Not just for adoption interest, but also from veterinarians, people who must relinquish dogs, people who have found a stray dog in need of pick up, etc. We are currently not in need of fosters. Due to the fact that there is such a high demand, we are sticking with strict protocol to not adopt out of Southern California. We apologize for this inconvenience and difficulty to be able to get in touch with us while there is an overwhelming desire and demand to adopt at this time. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we navigate through these difficult times with every intention to keep the public and our staff safe.",

            "description": "Jethro is the biggest sweetheart when it comes to the people he knows. He is a 70# bundle of medium-high energy who thinks he's a lap dog and loves to cuddle. Jethro LOVES balls. He has been house-trained and is good with recall (come), sit, down, heel, place (to his bed), and a few other commands. He is also a decent running/walking partner, but does need to learn to be around other dogs while on a leash better. Jethro has shown some resource guarding behaviors with treats and his home territory, and therefore, we think it is best he go to a home without children and reduced traffic in and out of the home. Jethro does well with people and other dogs after he has met them and is comfortable with them, but can be unfriendly with people/dogs he doesn't know. For this reason, dog parks would not be a good option for him and an invisible fence has not worked well for him in the past. He is good with cats, but will chase and try to play with them. \nYou can also watch for stories, pictures and video's about me on our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/groups/40103261297/\n \nAdoption fee: $375\n \nAdoption fees for all dogs/puppies include a $50 refundable training deposit. Complete your basic training program and provide a copy of the certificate within 4 months (120 days) of adoption and we will refund $50 of the original adoption fee.\n \nAll dogs/puppies have been fully vetted including spay/neuter, micro-chipping, worming, heartworm testing and preventative treatment, flea/tick preventative, and all required age appropriate vaccinations. As required by Wisconsin Act 90, all dogs will have received a veterinarian exam (CVI) within the past 30 days.\n \nOur adoption process requires the submission of an application. Applications and Adoption Rules can be found on our website, on the \"HOW TO ADOPT\" tab. Upon receipt of the completed application, we will process the application including: contact with your veterinarian and completion of a home visit. Please be sure to include the contact information for your vet as we will call. If your vet requires an information release, please be sure to contact them as soon as you submit your application. We are a group of volunteers with families and jobs, so please be patient and allow a few days for our response.\n \nJR's Pups-N-Stuff Dog Sellers License 270089-DS",

While not all are in the immediate area, once we have processed and approved your application, we will move the dog to our adoptive area for you to meet, greet and hopefully adopt. Sometimes we will have more than one application on a dog. That does not mean it automatically goes to another family but you should be aware of the fact that until you are approved and set up for the meet/greet.. the dog could get adopted by another applicant.NOTE - TUCKER IS LISTED AS A COURTESY FOR AUGUSTA DOG ADOPTIONS IN STAUNTON, VIRGINIA. POTENTIAL ADOPTERS MUST TRAVEL TO STAUNTON FOR THE MEETING.For more information and to apply to adopt, please visit www.augustadogadoptions.orgTucker is a 10-11 year old pit mix who weighs about 60 pounds. Poor Tucker has just never been able to find a family who loves him unconditionally and can make a commitment to him!Tucker is a very laid back guy who enjoys lounging in the sun, napping and watching TV. He is also happy to go for runs or chase balls around the yard. Tucker does not care for other animals and does take his possessions at little too seriously at times. He would be successful in a quiet, adult only home where he can play when he wants to play and relax when he wants to relax. He is house trained and has very good house manners.A reduced adoption fee of $100 does apply for Tucker, our seniors, special medical and behavioral needs dogs and other 'slow to adopt' dogs!Augusta Dog Adoptions is an all- volunteer, foster- based rescue. We take applications online and are scheduling individual adoptions in the Waynesboro, VA area during the pandemic. A $175.00 adoption fee ($300 for puppies under 6 months old) helps us take care of all the dogs we rescue. All dogs are spayed/neutered, tested for heartworm and tick borne diseases (if old enough), microchipped, and vaccinated for rabies (if old enough), distemper/parvo and bordetella. They are also treated for internal and external parasites. Many dogs also receive extensive medical care such as dental work and major surgeries.

            "description": "Meet Zyan! He is about 1.5 years old and 117 pounds. Our Giant lovebug Cane Corso Zyan is still battling for his health and happiness. Brought to PCAS several months ago, as an owner requested euthanasia because they chose not to give him the medical attention he desperately needed, Zyan was a BIG BOY with BIG BILLS and we stepped in to help him. Since then, he has seen multiple specialists who all agreed surgery wasn't the path to take. They also agreed Zyan could live a long, happy life if given the continued care he needed. So instead of surgery, Zyan has been undergoing treadmill hydrotherapy 3 times a week and physical therapy in addition to that. All of this is in an effort to help his stability, improve his mobilization, and avoid total hip replacement on this very young dog. There is no guarantee this won't be the only option in the future... but the 8-12 weeks of combination therapy is his best shot at a quality of life he deserves. This is a significant undertaking of both FUND$ and TIME and we are beyond grateful to his foster family for committing to Zyan's medical rehabilitation so completely (driving him to and from appts, helping him at home, etc). yan is also on the hunt for his forever home and can be moved there if there is an angel on earth looking to take on our big boy.\n\nDonations to Zyan's care or care can be made via PayPal.me/maxxandme; Venmo @maxxandmepetrescue; checks mailed to 12157 W Linebaugh Ave #181 Tampa, Fl 33626\n\nZ He is wonderful with his young foster kids but Leary of new children. He LOVES toys and squeakers and tug o'war and prancing around the house playing with them all by himself. His bark is imposing and intimidating but it belies the giant goofball he really is. He LIVES to snuggle and is loving all the books he's reading and screen time he's getting with his foster kids when they settle in the evenings. He's potty trained and well-mannered. He doesn't counter surf, is non destructive, wants a yard to enjoy and a family of his own to continue to grow with and learn from. He's being fostered as an only and is fine with that but was also in senior play groups when he was in boarding and did great with other dogs. Is yours the family to bring Zyan across the finish line of his journey? He deserves a champion and he's ready to have that now.\n\nZyan is neutered, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped. Adoption donation is $250.\nIf you would like to meet any of our dogs, please fill out an adoption application on www.maxxandme.org\nMaxx & Me is an all volunteer, all foster home rescue and do not have a shelter. Please allow at least 48 hours for applications to be processed (missing information may slow the process, so please take your time and be thoughtful in your answers). All dogs posted are available (so no need to ask). We place dogs based on best home for each dog and not order of applications received. Email us at maxxandmerescue@gmail.com for updates and questions. Thank you for choosing rescue.",

I am house trained, mostly crate trained, and learning to walk nicely on leash. I am very teachable and eager to please!  I would do best in a home where I will get daily exercise, not too much alone time, and some continued training and socialization.  I love my people so much, I hate to be away from them, can you blame me? \n I can get really excited  especially on a leash and this leads me to barking and pulling towards dogs, especially on leash but I am working on my manners when this happens so I will need someone who will be patient with me while I learn what to do instead! \nI would like a home without another dog at this time but I do enjoy going to play with dogs outside of my house! \nA house with a yard would be a bonus too! Do I sound like the perfect buddy for you?!?\n\nDue to the current events, the rescue is not able to host adoption events.  Please fill out an application and we will conduct phone interviews and set up outdoor meet and greets! www.thegooddogrescue.org\n\nMy adoption fee is $250 and I am neutered, microchipped and up to date on vaccinations",

I was a street dog and going to have puppies and unfortunately got a terrible infection and had to have surgery.  Sadly, my puppies did not survive.  My rescuers took good care of me and I was lucky to have recovered.  Now my life has changed a lot and I have a warm place to sleep and food to eat as well as lots of love.   I am a super loving dog and just need a little time to get to know you, but once I do, the sky is the limit.  If you are looking for a real sweetie who will give you lots of kisses and love then I am your gal.   I am a terrier mix, weigh approximately 35 lbs have all my vaccines and am fixed\n\n",

She came to our rescue as an owner surrender when they became disabled and were no longer able to care for her. \n\nShida had some health issues and was overweight when she cam e to us. She has since lost over 50lbs and gotten her health issues under control. She also recently had a dental and is all set with her clean teefies!\n\nShida loves people and enjoys walks, and lounging outside or on her bed. Shida does resource guard her treat/food/toys so will need a family experienced with that behavior. Shida can do well with dogs but no overly excited, hyper or dominant dogs. And she will need to be watched as she will get snappy with other dogs when it comes to her toys, food, ect. \n\nKids over 12 and no apartments, condo, or townhouses.  She's loud when she wants your attention.\n\nLarge dog breed experience required.  There are maintenance issues for large breeds that owner should be aware of.\n\nShida is UTD on shots, microchipped and spayed. Her adoption fee is $400.",

I love running, eating and wrestling with my foster siblings!\n\nI love toys too (unfortunately the \"stuffed\" ones don't last long around me :)\n\nI used to be chained up lot before I was rescued - so I need a home that has a big fenced yard where I can run! Squirrels and bunnies entice me and I love to chase them, I just can't help myself.\n\nInitially I was nervous about everything and now I'm getting the hang of this being a well loved pet. My foster dad is taking me to doggie stores and I'm meeting new people. These people are giving me treats so I LET them pet me . Sorta a WIN/WIN!\n\nI think I'll be an amazing family dog for someone but you might need to be patient and let me fall madly in love with you on my terms (might be 2 days or 2 weeks). AND, I really could use a companion animal to remind me how to \"dog\" as I'm still working on the play thing.\n\nIf you think we would be a good match, please submit an application.\n\n~Looking forward to meeting you\n\nDate of birth (estimated):\n9/25/19\n\nGood with Dogs: Yes (with proper introductions - no small dogs)\n\nGood with Cats: No\n\nHouse Trained: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee:\n\n$300\n\nIf you are interested in meeting or adopting this animal, please read the following before submitting an adoption application on our website - fureverhomerescue.com.\n\nAdoption fee includes spay/neuter, microchip, age appropriate vaccinations, 4Dx test (covers tick-borne diseases (Anaplasmosis , Lymes, Ehrlichiosis) as well as heart worm) & de-worming. We ask that our dogs live indoors unless otherwise stated & agreed upon. Applicants must live in MN within a reasonable distance from the Twin Cities Metro Area. We do not adopt out of state.",

She was pregnant again and gave birth 12/3/20 to several Pit/Mastiff puppies which will be adoptable 1/28/20. She weighed 48 lbs when she came in. Kindra has had a tough life so far, but hopefully after being pregnant so much and in 2 shelters, she can find a good home after she is spayed, which should happen  end of January, beginning of Feb. 2021. Kindra has a heart of gold and is very calm and tolerant, happy for any scrap of attention or comfort. The first few pics were taken closer to her coming in. The last few pics were taken after she gave birth and was nursing. Call (434) 374-807, or email lakecountryspca@yahoo.com if you can help Kindra. Visit LCSPCA at 11764 Hwy. 15, Clarksville, VA 23927 Mon-Sat. from 12-4 pm.",

I would be happy living with you in a house or apartment! \u00a0I am currently battling heart worm, but as soon as I am all good (probably about February), we can start living our best lives together!  Fill out that application and the rest of our lives will be full of magic!\n\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

            "description": "Meet Ollie. He is a Gulf Coast Treasure and the quintessential Lab that you can count on. He is loyal, smart, dog-friendly, and a great companion. And, like most labs, he is food-driven and enjoys treats after every retrieve. At 5 years old and 176 pounds, he needs to lose around 75 lbs. Who can't stand to lose a few COVID pounds? You can navigate that goal together. So gear up and get out there, he will be with you every step of the way sharing experiences that become your legacy.\n\nDisclaimer: Please know this is a recently rescued dog that is still transitioning into a new home environment. Training, and even personality and energy levels are constantly evolving as the dog starts to feel better emotionally and physically. Your new dog will take days or even weeks to fully settle into his or her true self. What you read in this bio is a snapshot of this dog\u2019s evolving personality. Additionally, the age listed is an estimate provided by the shelter and/or veterinarian. Different vets can provide different age estimates. So always consider the lab you are adopting to be within an age range of a couple of years of what is listed. Also remember, while we are a lab rescue, we do not have papers on these dogs, we cannot confirm any breed specific claims, and many of these dogs may be mixed with other breeds.\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING ONE OF OUR DOGS... please visit us at www.luslabs.org and fill out an adoption application.  Once submitted, one of our Adoption Coordinators will be in touch!",

            "description": "Duffy is a one year old boy looking for his forever home. He was found stray in Louisiana and brought to a nearby shelter. He was absolutely terrified and it was clear that people hadn\u2019t been kind to him in the past. With some TLC at the shelter from wonderful volunteers showing him love, Duffy was able to move on to a Paws4Rescue foster family. They were very patient and kind with him and allowed him to come out of his shell little by little until he gained confidence and could enjoy being with the other dogs in his foster home.\nAt first, he was afraid of most everything. \u201cI think of him as a budding rose,\u201d his foster mom says. \u201cWhen he first came to us, he wouldn\u2019t even make eye contact, but now he has blossomed into a beautiful, comical dog! He occasionally needs some encouragement when something catches his eye he\u2019s unfamiliar with, but he even walks well on leash with us now. He enjoys riding in the car and running errands with us. He\u2019s not very treat motivated, but he loves cheese! We will miss him lots, but we look forward to him finding his forever family.\u201d\nDuffy weighs about 40 pounds. He is housebroken, crate trained, neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines. If you\u2019d like to adopt Duffy, please go to Paws4Rescue.org and send us your application.",

            "description": "Jazy was a stray roaming the streets of NYC in August and brought to the NYC Animal Care Centers.  She wasn't in good shape.  She had pyoderma and some behavioral issues such as anxiety and fear.  She was then listed for euthanasia due to overcrowding at the shelter,  Pound Hounds was able to save his life due to a foster stepping up.\n\n\nJAZZY'S STATS:\n\nApprox 3 years old\n\n47 lbs\n\nCrate-Trained:  Does NOT like the crate but fine alone in the house.\n\nGood with dogs with proper introductions. \n\nKids over 16, please\n\nUTD on vaccinations, spayed and microchipped.  \n\nGood with Strangers: Needs to take the time to sniff and bark. Easy to get to know women but has a tougher time around strange/new men.       \n\nOn Leash: As she gets to know you, she will tug on the leash quite a bit. It ends up being her favorite toy to play with. But, as she has gotten used to the neighborhood, that behavior has lessened tremendously. Continuing with treats, training, having her on a harness, and sticking to a schedule will continue to lessen the behavior. \n\nHousetrained:  Once Jazzy is on a set schedule, she does not go in the house. She has to trust that you will be taking her out. Before that trust is there, she gets a bit confused and may have a few accidents.             \n\nHere is what his foster mom has to say:\n\nJazzy needs a really energetic home that can keep up with her. Also a lot of patience!! Don\u2019t give up on this loving girl. When you are her person, and she trusts you, all she wants to do is cuddle and be with you. She also needs a strong leader who will be strict with her training. Remind her not to jump on people, etc. \n\n\nTHINGS I KNOW ABOUT JAZZY:\n\nShe sighs a lot, especially when she\u2019s trying to sleep and YOU\u2019RE still awake. It is actually really funny, she will always let you know when you are bothering her. She has such a big personality. \n\nShe will drink out of the toilet!! Make sure she has water when she needs it (she will pee a lot if you don\u2019t watch her water intake) but just keep the bathroom closed if you are worried about this.\n\nHer medication (flea, tick, heartworm) is due on the 3rd of every month!\n\t\nShe is the type of dog that stares into your eyes, with love \n\t\nHer tail will still wag even when she is barking at someone. She is always trying to see if she trusts someone\u2026. \n\t\nShe just wants to play with other dogs, gets really excited especially while on the leash\n\nSquirrels and rabbits are her things! She will really really try to chase after them, always keep an eye out.\n\nShe was a stray, she\u2019s used to the rain and she will get into the garbage if you let her. It\u2019s what she is used to. \n\t\nShe really enjoys ice cubes. You can randomly give them to her throughout the day and she will play with them.\n\t\nShe does not let you cut her nails. This can be a huge thing for her because she can get stressed out when it comes to her paws. Cutting her nails is a no but we have gotten her more used to wiping her paws when she comes into the house. \n\nMy time with Jazzy has been everything that I thought having a foster dog would be! In the beginning, she is earning your trust and figuring out who her people are. Once she is more and more comfortable, she really makes the house her own. Jazzy would sleep all day if you let her but then that means she will have the zoomies all night!!! Because of this, she needs a bit more of an energetic household that will help her explore and learn more about being a dog. Jazzy can be stubborn, because of this, she needs a leader who will continue her training and be consistent and PATIENT! This is a dog who deserves all of the love and cuddles on this planet but she also deserves someone who will put the work into her to train her and keep her in your focus. Right now, Jazzy is in a female-only household with no other pets. She could really thrive with another dog who can help get her energy out but she is also really great just with her people! She is a very versatile dog. If you want a dog with a big personality, she is definitely the one for you. Jazzy hasn\u2019t had a lot of time around men, she can get very protective and will bark but has never given us the impression that she would ever bite. She just doesn\u2019t trust them yet, this is where a lot of positive reinforcement and treats will come into play. She needs consistency. If you are at all interested and have questions, please feel free to reach out!! \n\n\nThe best home for Jazzy would be out of the city, in a quiet setting.  A quiet home with not too many people coming in and out.  \n\n",

I am a very well mannered boy that must relocate soon.  The shelter made sure that I had all of my vaccinations, that I was heartworm negative, that I had a microchip, and that I was neutered.  So far so good\u2026..I am only worried about one thing. I am about seven years old. Will anyone be willing to give me a home at my age? Oh I sure hope so, because I have lots of \"mature\" doggie love to give to my new family. FYI.....When I go outside, I take care of all of my \"business!\"",

            "description": "This handsome hunk of a husky is Marshmallow! He is a 2 year old male husky mix. When in his kennel, this giant boy loves to let you know he's back there and stuck in his kennel. As much as he loves to howl, he would much rather be outside all day in our yards so he can run and play! This energizer bunny has hours and hours of energy and seems to be incapable of sitting still. He will need a large yard and preferably daily walks or hikes to help him curb his spazzy tendencies. We would not recommend young children with this boy as he does not know his own strength and is not so gentle with treat taking. If you are interested in adopting Marshmallow, please call the Trinity County Animal Shelter located in Weaverville, CA at 530.623.1370 to make an adoption appointment today!\n\n\nIf you would like more information or would like to inquire about adopting, please call. We do not do online adoptions and we do not often have time to answer questions via Facebook or through Messenger. Please call 530.623.1370",

She\u2019s a silly playful cuddly girl loves to be held, car rides, and behaves well going everywhere in her little kangaroo pouch ?. \n\nKanga is nervous and distrustful of new people, especially men, and will try to chase them away from her \u201cmom\u201d... if they are patient and ignore her/toss treats and don\u2019t force themselves she will relax but she\u2019s made it clear she can\u2019t handle living with more than one person in her household.  She doesn\u2019t like to share the attention with other dogs either and wants to be your only pet.  \n\nIf you are a gal who enjoys living alone with just a doggie best friend, email njwoof@cs.com to meet her\n\nDue to COVID-19, we will not be holding our Sunday adoption events until further notice, but we can schedule socially distant appointments with a specific dog outdoors at our vet\u2019s office:\nVCA Morris Plains Animal Hospital \n3009 Rt 10 East \nMorris Plains (Denville on GPS) NJ 07950\nNow is the perfect time to open your home to a needy dog!  Submit an application from our website www.secondchance.petfinder.com to speed up the adoption process\nAll our dogs reside in foster care in Northern NJ until adoption.

He spent several months with our awesome trainer working on a few issues that set him up to now be in a home with a foster and other dogs and cats. Howie has done wonderfully since transitioning from the trainer to living in a home. He is both small and big dog friendly, however needs a home with no cats. He seems to really love women and takes more time to come around to men. He LOVES walks on the leash and does great. He is kennel trained. Howie will do best in a home with someone who has no kids and not alot of people in and out and has patience with him. He is very slow with introductions but has warmed up fairly quickly and doing great with his foster.\n\nIf interested in adoption, the first step is to visit our website chipnsnip.org to complete our adoption application! All current pets in the home must be up to date on vaccinations, heartworm preventatives and altered unless medically unfit. Our approval process includes an approved application, reference check, home visit and once approved, a meet and greet with the dog. Applicant must live within a 3 hour radius of the Houston Area to adopt.",

I\u2019m always happy to see every human and dog I meet. I have never met a stranger and I\u2019m literally the Wal-Mart greeter of dogs. The only complaint a person would have walking me in a busy area, is that I will stop to say hi to every dog and child, and person I see.\n\nI love to play with my foster siblings! My foster home consists of two little guys smaller than me and a large female who has a few pounds on me. I love to play and wrestle with my big friend but I\u2019m polite and appropriate to the smaller dogs in my foster home. Don\u2019t let all this playing talk scare you though-I\u2019m also down to cuddle on the couch and binge Netflix with my foster parents. I\u2019m like Velcro and am never far from my humans. If you want a social dog that is also down for a calm night in, submit your app today!\n\nIn order to qualify for ALIVE Rescue Memphis's program all of the following steps must be met:\n\n \u2022You must be at least 21 years of age and be able to provide ALIVE with proof of age.\n\n \u2022Any current pets must be up to date on vaccinations, and be spayed/neutered. Exceptions to this will only be considered if proof of a medical explanation is provided.\n\n \u2022If you currently rent, you must provide a landlord\u2019s phone number and a copy of your executed lease.\n\n \u2022All members of the family living in the home where the animal will be placed must be interviewed.\n\n \u2022Applicant must live within 50 miles of Memphis if interested in adopting and within 30 miles of Memphis if interested in fostering. \n\n \u2022Allow an ALIVE Rescue Memphis representative into your home for a visit to insure that your home is safe for the potential new pet.  \n\n  \u2022You must allow an ALIVE Rescue Memphis representative into your home for a visit to ensure that your home is safe for the potential new pet. \n\n  \u2022You must be able and willing to spend the time and money necessary to provide training, medical treatment, and proper care for a pet.\n\n  \u2022Currently, adoptions fees in Memphis are $275 for a dog over 4 months of age, $300 for a dog under 4 months of age. \n\n  \u2022We require an additional $75 training deposit at the time of adoption. You will be required to enroll and complete a training class with your new companion at one of our approved training facilities. Once ALIVE Rescue Memphis receives proof of the completed class, this $75 deposit will be refunded.",

We hope to find him a family who would enjoy doing some training with him as he really aims to please his human companions. He likes other dogs as well although his exuberance will not make him a great companion for small children. He is crate trained, neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, and heartworm negative. Six foot fencing of adopter's yard will be a requirement for adoption. His adoption fee is $150 and interested adopters can contact carpathiapaws@gmail.com for an application.",

After being pulled from a high kill facility he will finally get a chance to learn how to be a couch potato and hang out with human companions. He prefers female canine companionship, if any; he would also be happy as an only dog. We do not think he was ever socialized with cats. Simon is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and heartworm negative. His adoption fee is $150. Interested adopters can contact carpathiapaws@gmail.com for questions or to submit an application.",

Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet him.\n\nKnight is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~7\nWeight: ~50 lb\nHousebroken: Working on it! Needs to be on a strict schedule. \nCrate trained: Working on it! Takes 30-45 minutes to settle. \nDog sociability: Friendly with other dogs on walks. Prefers dogs that are on the calmer side like him.\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Not a match - can guard high value items/bones\nIdeal home: Knight is a chill guy looking for a chill home. He isn't the biggest fan of stairs (he's working on it!) so he'd prefer a home without a ton of them.\n\nKnight is a sweet, confident, and well-mannered gentleman who knows what he wants out of life...food, belly rubs, food, leisurely walks, food, a quiet place to hang out/nap, and some good chews to gnaw on. And he isn't afraid to let you know when he'd like some pets or is absolutely dying of starvation! He would prefer that you introduce potential guests to him before they come into his home (hint: he can be won over with treats!). He also takes his food and chews very seriously and asks that you respect his space when he's enjoying them. Although he's usually the quiet type, he will be sure to tell you if he hears any knocks, dings, barks, or squeaks that you should know about (real or televised!). His favorite bonding activities are being brushed/petted and learning new things while being given lots of treats. He knows 'sit' and is currently working on 'stay' and 'wait'. If you're looking for a buddy to lounge around and enjoy life with, Knight's your guy!\n\nHis adoption fee is 150. He is neutered, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. Knight has arthritis and will need medical management. He will need dental cleaning and tooth extraction, which OTAT will cover at their Ellis Clinic.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***\"",

I am happy I am in a foster home where they have shown me so much love.  \n\nLet me tell you a bit about me.  I have gained so much more confidence since I\u2019ve been in my foster home and now greet new guests with a smile.  I would do better in a home with other dogs that will continue to build on my confidence.  I definitely need a playmate.  I am also much better on my leash manners.   I am laid back but still have my moments of playfulness and chasing the other doggos in the yard or house.  My favorite thing in the world is to try and snuggle with you on the bed or couch.  Mostly I stay in our crates when my foster mommy is working.\n\nMy ideal home would be a loving family with no small dogs or cats since I have high prey drive.  A family with another dog is definitely a must but even better if that family adopts my mommy Angel too. \n\nI am house broken and crate trained.  I am spayed, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped.  \n\nWould you give me a forever home?\n\nAdoption fee is $325\nApply at www.HuskyhavenFl.org",

I am your typical sassy husky with a lot of attitude.\n\nI love to talk all the time; my foster mommy says I have something to say about everything and tell it to everyone.  I love to give kisses, snuggles, and be close to you as best as I can. I am super smart and am currently working on other basic commands.  I am laid back even though I get super excited when it\u2019s time to go out and play with my foster fursiblings.\n\nI prefer a home with no small dogs or cats since I do have high prey drive.   I love my foster mommy and prefer to be the queen of the house.   I take treats gently because that\u2019s how a lady should be.  \n\nMy new family needs to be husky experienced and one that will continue with my training with some of my resource guarding which is very minimal.  Also, no small kids just because I might bee too much for them.\n\nI am also very close to my daughter Dena, we would love for both of us to be adopted together, but if not, a home with another dog, would be great as well. I am selective of which pack I can join but I am easily trainable since I\u2019ve learnt so much from my foster family!\n\nI am house broken and crate trained.  I am spayed, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped.  \n\nAdoption fee is $325\nApply at HuskyhavenFl.org",

As soon as he sees you, that tail whips back and forth and he bounds to you. Koa is a happy boy and has nothing but love to give. He loves to play with everyone he meets-dogs of all sizes, kids of all ages|he even tried to make the office cat his friend (unfortunately for him-the friendship did not work out as our office cat can be a bit grumpy). Koa is a young adult so he still has that puppy energy and will do best in a home where he will have a lot of stimulation. Whether that's through play time with toys, other dogs, the kiddos, or walks and runs through the neighborhood-he'll be one happy boy. Koa is house trained, walks well on a leash and crates well. A working dog breed, Koa does have a lot energy and is super smart so an active, attentive home would be best for this boy. Sound like your kind of pup?

Constance is such a little fighter, and lucky for her a group of construction workers witnessed her being dumped on their rural job site, and instantly brought her to us.  We feel strongly that she was either dumped because she was one of an unwanted litter, or was bought or gotten as a young puppy, then dumped when she grew up.  You will not find a more uniquely colored pup.  She is a gorgeous silvery fawn color with the prettiest eyes.  Constance was not properly trained and for that reason, she will need manners reinforced or formal training, but we feel she is going to be a fabulous girl with some hands on care, love, and training.  She craves attention, as any pup would, but certainly because she has likely never known what true love is all about.  Constance is heartworm negative, spayed, microchipped, and up to date on vaccinations.  If you think your family would be a good fit for her, please submit our adoption contract at www.animalharbor.org.     \n\n\n\n",

She is affectionate, likes to cuddle, and give kisses. Rose also loves everyone she meets! Rose is currently living in a foster home with another dog and loving every minute! She is great at sharing food, toys, and playing with her canine foster brother. She is perfectly crate trained and potty trained, too! Rose's perfect home would be with a  doggy friend who can help her work through her anxiety. She hasn't shown any major separation anxiety, but a well matched dog friend and an attentive family could show her that there is no reason to be afraid and help her build her confidence. She is blind in her right eye due to an old eye injury, but it is not causing her any issues. Rose would do well with children, but no cats for this girl.\n\nIf you'd like to meet Rose, please contact adopt@love-a-bull.org",

I am a high energy girl that is dog friendly, with a proper introduction, but can get a little too excited and jumpy. Sometimes I can be a little bit mouthy so I would probably be the best fit for a family that doesn't have young children at this time. I also have a strong prey drive and would not be a good fit for a family with feline friends or any other small animals that I might confuse for a toy! I would benefit from some obedience training to improve my leash skills, as well as a big yard and active lifestyle. An experienced dog owner who can help teach me the difference between right and wrong would be preferred. I have enjoyed learning how to walk on leash here at the ranch and I love to take walks now. I also have never found a toy that I didn't like! I love adventures so take me everywhere with you!",

I can be a very anxious pup and I would do best in a home with a new owner who likes to spend most of their time at home with me because separation is something that I struggle with. I love to play with other dogs, particularly other big dogs! I don't think I'd enjoy living in a home with young children because of my anxiety so if you have an adult-only home, I'd love to come join you! I'd benefit from an experienced dog owner who knows how to handle a dog with anxious energy and can help calm me down when I am scared. I do tend to howl rather loudly when I am anxious. I would love to find a home with a big yard, but make sure that you have a nice high fence because I can be a jumper! I could benefit from some additional training and is not quite potty trained yet but is very sweet and would love to get to know you!",

            "description": "COURTESY POST: Meet Raven. She was rescued by a Good Samaritan and Paws for Life is helping her find a loving, forever family for Raven. So allow us to introduce you to this sweet girl. Raven leans into you, smiles up at you with her lolling tongue, then melts into a puddle of love on the floor for some belly rubs. She loves sitting on the couch with you, rolling around and being goofy. Her clumsy and puppy-like behavior will have you laughing out loud. She loves squeaky balls. At the age of about 2-3 years, she is full of life and full of love. Raven is a people-pleaser. She is learning to \u201csit\u201d on cue, but she likes to do a cute thing where she sits then puts both paws up for you to hold hands with her, then she starts to fall backwards and you have to hold her up. It's adorable! Although shy at first, Raven will form a strong bond with her \u201cperson\u201d and become their constant companion. Could you be the one to teach this beauty what a loving home really is? She can\u2019t wait to hear from you! Raven is 65 lbs, and her amazing foster momma from My Sidekick Dog Training is covering all her medical care, so that she'll go home vaccinated and spayed. If you can foster or adopt, please email AshleighRose312@gmail.com or call Ash at 248-921-2145.\n\nApply online: www.pawsforliferescue.org\n\nShop at Amazon to help Paws for Life earn needed donations: http://smile.amazon.com/ch/26-2505458\n\nNOTE ABOUT BREED LABELING: Visual breed identification of dogs  is unreliable and usually inaccurate. So, for most of our adoptable  dogs, we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to  know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n\nWhy is labeling a dog such a big deal? A label will stick with  a dog for the rest of its life. A label can mean discrimination, losing  its home or even death. Labels are a problem for the dogs when we, as  the local experts on animals, allow adopters, politicians and community  members to think that the label we assign can predict who that dog is or will be.\n\nAdoption Process: Complete the application at www.pawsforliferescue.org or go to the direct link at https://form.jotform.com/81935638982170. We then arrange a location, date and time for you to meet some pets. If the meeting goes well and everyone is happy, you begin the mandatory, minimum two-week adjustment period with the pet as part of your family. You will pay the non-refundable adoption fee at the start of the two-week adjustment period. This pending period allows your new dog or cat time to adjust to their new home, new people, new routine, etc., and for you to decide if it's a match and the right pet for you. At the end of two weeks (some people extend the adjustment time as needed and that's fine too), if everyone is happy, then we finalize the adoption. Feel free to email if you have any questions.",

He enjoys long walks and playing tug with his family.  He loves to get attention and he loves to chew on his kong (especially when stuffed with peanut butter).  He is a strong alpha male so not recommended around other male dogs but seems to do well with the female neighbor dogs.  Also due to his high energy and not realizing his size, he would be better suited for a family with older children.  *Warning you have to accept extreme cuddles, he loves to cuddle up next to you and fall asleep. If you are interested in adding Trooper to your family please visit https://www.watersedgegreatdanerescue.com/adoption-process\nIF THIS LISTING IS STILL POSTED WE ARE STILL ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS FOR THE DOG.

This is a sweet dog, not as active as most Border Collies due to an old leg injury that has fully heeled. \nFor most of us who are not running 10 miles every day, that is not a bad thing.  Border Collies are extremely intelligent dogs and fast learners, so learning new tricks would be great. Bailey is also very content playing around, cuddling on the sofa and just being a perfect family dog.\nTo adopt or foster, please submit a fully completed application on our website at www.nalasrescue.org/adoption-application.\nWe are located in Palm City, FL and we adopt mostly in a 30 miles radius. We always do home visit, and personalized meet and greet, to ensure that your new companion will be a great match for your family.\n\n\n",

One and half years old, this energetic English Coonhound mix is looking for an active family.  He is ideal for anyone that enjoys outdoor adventure and fun.  Chimmy would love to hit the trails with you.  He enjoys wide open spaces with plenty of green hills to run through and explore.  Fond of rough and tumble play, Chimmy is perfect for a family with older children.  This boy is very faithful and forms a strong bond with those he loves.  He just wants to be your friend and loyal companion.  He doesn\u2019t, however, care for other dogs or cats.  Humans are much more fun!  Chimmy prefers to go on grass but may need supervision until he adjusts to your home.  A large fenced in back yard will give him a safe place to run and play.  Chimmy would love to bust out of here and begin a life with you.  Are you ready to meet him?  \n\nTo adopt this pet, Click \"More About Us\" and then \"Adoption Application\" to be directed to our online HSNWGA application form.  You will be contacted by our Adoption Coordinator once your application is reviewed and approved.  Due to high volume of applications, we are only able to contact those applicants that best meet the needs of that individual pet.",

Bootsie does not have usage of her back legs, but it truly does not slow her down.  As soon as Bootsie was fitted with a wheelchair, she has been on the go!  The exercise is also helping her drop some pounds.  Once she gets down to her 11-pound goal, there may be no stopping her.  Bootsie loves special attention\u2026and she\u2019ll demand it if desired.  \n\nThe ideal home for Bootsie would be one level or an environment where stairs will NOT pose a danger.  Bootsie requires bladder and bowel expressions.  She\u2019ll thrive with someone who understands her physical limitations yet sees Bootsie\u2019s limitless capacity to love and entertain.  This lady is an Olympic snuggler.  Show her some love, and you\u2019ll have a shadow and buddy for life.\n\nAdopters must live in the Los Angeles area.",

            "description": "Meet Wimberley! This dog friendly girl is a 2 year old Shepherd mix. She is pretty timid around people as she learns to trust assistance and love from people. Her foster family has been working on crate training, but she can be left out over night or when not home if she is with another dog.\nAt this time she is too timid to walk on a leash. Wimberley's ideal home is one with another dog to help ease her into her new life as a family dog. She will make a great companion for another dog! Wimberley has a super sweet demeanor, she just needs the patience, love and commitment of a forever family. \n\nWimberley is available for adoption in Texas only.\n\nAs a small organization, we cannot answer emails about each of our pets. Please fill out an application for more information on this dog, and one of our adoption coordinators will contact you.",

Maggie is excellent with other dogs and her new home MUST have a friendly, outgoing resident dog for her to bond with. She is quite nervous and slow to trust new people, so her adopter will need to be understanding of her nuanced personality.  Having a well-adjusted, friendly dog already in the home, will help in getting Maggie acclimaated to her new environment as smoothly as possible.  Maggie will require a patient adopter who is experienced with Nervous Nellies.  A fenced-in yard is a MUST for this little lady.  Maggie was not socialized particularly well, so she's pretty chatty when new people come over.  Her wonderful foster is working with her to help her ditch those old habits. \nA low-key, low traffic home would be best for her.  We have found, that around the 7-10 day mark, Maggie feels comfortable enough to come ask for cuddles.  She'll take time, but she's absolutely worth it. \n\nIf you're interested in meeting Maggie May, please submit an application on our website!!\n\nhttp://mustlovepawsrescue.com/",

He loves to play and is super active so he would do best in a home that can help him have fun and keep busy! He is still learning and can be mouthy when he plays so older kiddos would likely be better. He loves playing with dogs but he is ROWDY so an equally rowdy dog would be best as he might drive a more mellow dog crazy. With a little time and effort Rhino will make a great companion! \n\nAGE\n10 months\n\nHOUSE-TRAINED\nWork in progress-he\u2019s a puppy! \n\nGOOD IN A HOME WITH\nOther dogs, meet and greet required. Cats unknown. Older kids.\n\nInterested in Rhino? Fill out an application at boisebullybreedrescue.com",

She used to be shy and unsure about her surroundings. In her foster home she has really blossomed into a social butterfly. We love to watch her zoom zoom around the yard and roll in the grass. \n\nBlondie is housebroken, crate trained and walks well on a leash. She is good with children and other big dogs.\n\nTOTAL FEES FOR ADOPTION:   Adoption Fee of $275 + Texas Sales tax of 8.25%  + $150 transport fee for a total due of $447.69. The adoption fee includes all age appropriate vaccinations (spay/neuter, microchip, health certificate) and the transport fee covers transport to the Pacific Northwest on the next available date).\n\nTRANSPORT: Currently we have monthly transports. It will be up to the adoptive family to meet the transport to pick up your new family member. Please be advised that our dogs are adopted to their forever families prior to being transported to the Pacific Northwest. Unfortunately at this time, we cannot bring dogs for a typical meet and greet situation, due to the extensiveness of the transport distance and it being unfair for the dogs who are not adopted to have to make the trip back. \n\nDue to the number of requests that we receive on our puppies and dogs, please be advised that all adoption applications are processed in the order received. Once we send you an application, your place in line does not get reserved until your application is returned to us.",

No kitties or small dogs for this guy. He could also live with children 13+ just due to his size!\n\nAs always, he's neutered, utd on vaccines, flea tick and heartworm prevention, and micrcohipped!\n\nApply here to adopt:\nhttps://docs.google.com/\u2026/10SYor_3AsB1-SbkILGZNF7vNhx3\u2026/edit",

He gets a long great with other dogs, has not shown any reaction to cats that he has seen, but has not been cat tested in the home. River is low to moderate energy, he will romp around the yard, fetch a ball, and play a little with his fur pal, but for the most part is pretty low key. He is a little nervous around new people and new things / noises. We are working on getting him out on walks, to training, and introducing him to new people to help build his confidence. It does not take long for him to warm up to people, and once he does it's all about the pets, the cuddles, and some treats please.",

In her time away from us she was unfortunately hit by a car and we are working with our vets to determine the best treatment for her front limb. Right now she drags it everywhere she goes and we are working on making her a sling to wear until it can be removed.\n\nThelma likes to the doggy door in her foster home. This allows her to access the yard for bathroom needs as she deems necessary. She tries to keep a clean den and likes going out for walks. She has a ton of energy and fits an older Jack Russell Terrier mix to a T as she can sometimes have a little attitude. As you can see she also enjoys rolling around and being upside down. Does well with cats and other dogs.\n\nInquiries: adoptions@plannedpethoodrockymount.com\nAdoption Application Link: https://www.plannedpethoodrockymount.com/adoptions\n\nClick here to view our general adoption fees. Our adoption fees help to provide a portion of the care that we provide our animals.\n\nPrior to adoption, all of our animals are altered, vaccinated, microchipped, tested for heartworm (dogs), and placed on a monthly preventative, in addition to other necessary treatments.\n\nAdoption Center Hours:\nTuesday - Friday:: 12-6p.m.\nSaturday:: 11-4p.m.\n\nAt FCHS, we commit to our animals; for this reason, all of our animals have a lifetime commitment from us. If an adoption does not work out, for any reason, we ask that all FCHS animals be returned to our facility.",

            "description": "This short little chunk monk is about as cute as they come! This girl has a great smile and loves to be with her people. She does well with almost all male dogs and easy going females, but is definitely too excited about cats to have those in her home! Blanche can have bursts of high energy, but more often is content to spend time hanging out and snuggling! She is about 2 1/2 years old and is so ready to have her very own forever person or family!Luling Animal Welfare Society is a 501c3 organization that supports the care and adoption of animals at the Luling Municipal Shelter. If you would like more information about any of our adoptables, please email us at adoptatlaws@gmail.com, message our facebook page, or call 512-745-1103 for a LAWS volunteer (this is a personal cell phone, so if no answer, please leave a message and your call will be returned as soon as possible.",

            "description": "Say hello to Astro! This silly boy is just shy of a year old and has a happy puppy disposition. He's currently living with a loving foster family and learning lots of good-boy skills until his perfect family finds him. Astro is crate-trained and learning plenty of commands...he likes learning and is eager to please! He's house-trained, too, but still needs to be let out a couple of times per day. Astro has that irresistible puppy energy, so he loves to bounce and play with whomever will take him up on it. And when it's time to rest, he enjoys a good, long snooze on the couch next to his people. The ideal home for Astro is one where his people can continue his training and give him lots of attention and love. He's a happy, bouncy pup, so small children would need to be careful around him. He also likes other dogs, so a home with animal friends would be great, too! Astro deserves the perfect forever home. Could that be with you? Apply to adopt Astro today! All Dallas Pets Alive adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon adoption. The standard minimum donation for dogs over six months to seven years is $200, puppies under six months is $250, dogs eight years and over are $100 unless specified otherwise. You can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallaspetsalive.org/adopt/adoptable-dogs/ For more information, you can email adopt@dallaspetsalive.org",

            "description": "XENA\nPrincess Warrior\n\nXena is the cutest little warrior princess you'll ever meet with a fiesty spirit that will win your heart quickly. Xena is house trained and great in her crate. Xena is good with most dogs with a proper introduction but would do best with bigger playful dogs. Xena spent her early days around cats and has been ok with her foster home\u2019s guinea pigs.  Xena is a bit shy and takes a bit to warm up to new people, but once she decides your cool, then she loves you to pieces. We suggest that she goes to a home with older children, she can be a bit rambunctious with the little ones. She is a smart girl that loves to learn and has done well in training. We highly recommend that she continue with her training classes to help her blossom into the wonderful dog that she is. Xena is going to make some lucky person the Best Friend ever!  \n\nXena will always have some food restrictions and may require a little extra veterinary care over her lifetime, but she is otherwise expected to live a normal life. We spoke at length with our vet and spent some time determining if we should repair her cleft. In the end we decided that she is doing well with it and the dangers of the surgery were too great for her needs. Xena eats kibble out of a bowl and drinks out of a regular water dish. She does sneeze some of the water out and occasionally gets food stuck in her cleft, but she usually clears it herself. Xena can\u2019t have any soft or wet foods. She must be kept on dry kibble. No canned or mushy foods, and no liquids other than water. She can have kibble, jerky-style treats, cooked meat, chews, etc.; just nothing with a goopy or liquid consistency that could cause her to aspirate. Plain water is fine. Her new family will need to watch and make sure Xena does not get anything stuck in her cleft that she cannot clear and keep an eye open for any infection.",

For more information, please email: amy.farner@gmail.com\n\nThis amazing pup is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4465679\n\nMateo is a sweet black and white american pitbull terrier mix. He's a little chunky at 92lbs and could do with some extra walks to get him into shape. Because of his mellow personality, he's a great dog for smaller spaces, despite his size. Mateo enjoys sniffing on walks and walks at a leisurely pace when off leash in the play yard. He does tug a little on the leash, but nothing a little training won't cure. Mateo is a selective of his friends and would be best as an only dog. Mateo likes treats and knows how to sit, so he's ready to learn new tricks if you've got the patience to teach him. At four years, he's still young enough to keep up on long walks and hikes, but past all the puppy behavior and nonsense. If you're looking for your next buddy Mateo just might be him.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours.

Archie is about 3 years and ready to have his forever home. Archie  is very playful so he will do best in a home with a dog who will want to play with him or just a family that will keep him active. This cutie loves humans but he can still play king of rough so a home with kids over the age of 8 would be better. This cutie will love to find a forever home that can give him the love he deserves. Archie is super fun and he is is always ready to learn something new and go on an adventure. His foster is pretty active and this cutie loves going hiking and meeting new people. \n\nHere is a video of Archie playing with another dog\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Y8VwGlGcGQ8\n\nIf interested in Archie please visit our website www.bravebullyrescue.org and fill out our adoption application",

Snoopy and his brother Archie were surrendered to a shelter in Houston due to their family not being able to afford them. Snoopy is a dominant male so he will do better with dogs who are submissive and chill or just as the only baby at home. Snoopy also prefers dogs his size of bigger. Snoopy loves humans but he will do better with kids over the age of 10 since he still needs to learn some manners so we don\u2019t want him to accidentally hurt a child. This cutie needs an owner who is confident, will give him time to decompress, structure, and lots of love. This cutie is a bit shy and can be a little territorial once he gets comfortable in a home. Snoopy is a dog who loves to snuggle and give kisses. This gorgeous boy has a great trainer In Houston who is helping Snoopy be the best dog he can possibly be . \n\nIf you think you could be a goof fit for this handsome boy then please consider adopting or fostering him. \n\nIf interested in Snoopy please visit our website www.bravebullyrescue.org and fill out our adoption application.",

She is spayed, vaccinated and microchipped. \n\nMona is a VERY timid and shy dog until she gets to know you and feel comfortable, which will take time. Mona absolutely loves playing and being with other dogs. She bonds with dogs faster than humans. She likes to curl up and sleep under the covers and hang out on the bed or couch. Mona doesn't leave the house or go on walks because she's too nervous, she likes to feel safe and protected in her home. She is potty trained and doesn't care for crates but is fine in an xpen. She needs to go to a very low key household (not a lot of foot traffic) and will need to be with another dog(s). Mona is an inside dog only! We don't recommend her going to a home with children. \n\nIf you think that you can open up for heart and home and be the family that Mona needs or have any questions please email Findingabestfriend@gmail.com \n\nIt is a requirement for for any current pets in the home to be altered  and vaccinated.\n\nThank you!",

She is spayed, vaccinated and microchipped. \n\nMona is a VERY timid and shy dog until she gets to know you and feel comfortable, which will take time. Mona absolutely loves playing and being with other dogs. She bonds with dogs faster than humans. She likes to curl up and sleep under the covers and hang out on the bed or couch. Mona doesn't leave the house or go on walks because she's too nervous, she likes to feel safe and protected in her home. She is potty trained and doesn't care for crates but is fine in an xpen. She needs to go to a very low key household (not a lot of foot traffic) and will need to be with another dog(s). Mona is an inside dog only! We don't recommend her going into a home with children. \n\nIf you think that you can open up for heart and home and be the family that Mona needs or have any questions please email Findingabestfriend@gmail.com \n\nIt is a requirement for for any current pets in the home to be altered  and vaccinated.\n\nThank you!",

He has come A LONG WAY!  He has learned that humans can be kind.  Humans can be compassionate.  Humans can be loving.  Humans can be TRUSTED!  He is a medium energy dog who gains confidence from other dogs.  He loves to run and play with his fur buddies, but is calm and cuddly in the house.  He is crate trained, but has excellent house manners so doesn\u2019t need a crate.  Charlie is ready to find a family of his very own!  His Christmas wish is for a family with a healthy pack and humans that will love him forever!",

            "description": "Dear little Poppy is just 1-2 years old. 8-9 lbs, though she may need to gain weight.\nNice folks found her homeless; kept her a short while and then to B&B. Few days later she had three wee puppies. Only one lived beyond a couple of days....a little black/white boy....Muffin As of Thanksgiving, he is 8 weeks old and 1 pound! Poppy's milk dried up after just a few days, so Muffin has been bottle fed, then eye dropper and ultimately laps from a saucer. He's a demanding little squirt. We had to feed him every two hours round the clock - and this is not anywhere the first time B&B has chowed down on such a task.\nWe're not gonna show either of them until all their vaccines have been given...2021 Poppy will be spayed. If someone knocks us out with an application, we might consider a foster home. And this may not happen. Poppy and Muffin are doing just great here - they get a lot of attention from a variety of people and Poppy with other dogs, too. She is housetrained. We have no time to spend talking with folks who want them. Too much work to do and we are thin staffed. So, do not feel bad or upset if we do not respond to you. Move onto another dog in need. We update our web daily and are always rescuing doggies who become super companions.\nIn the meanwhile, you can email your application to B&B.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

            "description": "Bronson is so handsome - a true Catahoula leopard hound, state dog of Louisiana. About 7 yrs young and 50 lbs. He was in a great rescue facility for a year where he got to show his smarts, get some training, lots of attention and had loads of fun. We have worked with this group before and sometimes a change will be the magic touch. We've no doubt that Bronson can succeed in a hound-loving home. He would love a forever home where he would be the one and only fur baby.\nHe loves to play ball. He can play all day long as shown in his four photos: 1) waiting for ball; 2) ditto; 3) caught ball, in mouth; 4) waiting for ball.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

            "description": "Hi my name is Derby (HWTH#20224A).  I am a Manchester Terrier, born on 12/12/2012 and I weigh about 15 lbs.  I was relinquished to Halfway to Home after my owner passed away.  I was very sad and confused when I got here about a month ago so the volunteers have been spending a lot of time with me which has made me feel a lot better.   I am now looking forward to finding my forever home!  I need a quiet adult-only house or ground-floor apartment/condo where I am the only dog.   I have arthritis in my legs so my walk is a little funny. I am starting to learn to walk on a leash and it is important that I get regular short walks to keep my joints moving.    I am a friendly boy but I can be moody sometimes.  I may growl when I need some \"me\" time but I am not at all aggressive.  I am also house-trained!   With time, patience, and love, I think I will make a wonderful canine companion.  Please consider making me a member of your family.   If you would like more information about me, or would like to make an appointment to meet me, please call Sandy at 661-824-4495 (this is a landline).",

            "description": "We a proud to present to you the most beautiful and sweet-natured 3 yr-old German Shepherd girl named \"PAIGE\".\n\nSummary: \nPaige is the sweetest girl that needs a new forever home as the only dog OR with smaller dogs due to 'hip dysplasia' and rough housing with other dogs could potentially hurt her hips! She is such a special girl who gets along with all dogs, is good with other animals AND adores children but needs a calmer environment to preserve her hips for the future! \n\nBackstory:\nPaige was rescued from a puppy mill at 6-months old and was pregnant. Unfortunately she lost her puppy's and struggled giving birth. She was spayed immediately and has lived a happy life belonging to her original owners with two other doggy companions. \n\nDue to her doggy friends playing quite rough, Paige has needed to be separated from the others to protect her delicate hips. This has proved to be discomforting for her original owners, as Paige would love to play with her friends, but has to be constantly stopped due to her health conditions. \n\nPaige really is the pawfect dog!!:\n- She really is as lovable and adoring as you see in the pictures!\n- She does amazing with children and animals of all kind!\n- Knows basic and some advance obedience!\n- Is used to doing physical therapy (and all PT equipment would be included!)\n- Is up-to-date on heart worm prevention and wears a Seresto collar. \n- Is eager to learn and please and is bursting with unconditional LOVE!\n\nThe future ahead:\nIn order to make sure her hips aren't worked too hard, Paige would need loving owners that could maintain her monthly injections and physical therapy to make sure this girl has a long and wonderful life!\n\nEstimation of costs: \n\n1) Adequan injections - approximately $130 for 2 bottles. \n2 bottles = 6 months worth of injections. \n\n2) Glycoflex supplements - approximately $40 for a bag of 120. \nShe gets one a day so the bag lasts for approximately 4 months.\n\n3) Dasuquin supplements - approximately $45 for a bag of 84. \nAt one chew a day, the bag lasts for just under 3 months. \n\n*A prescription is required for the Adequan injections, but is not necessary for the two supplements. \n\nPaige deserves a loving home where she will be cherished as a member of the family and has still has so much life and love to give! Please consider giving this precious girl another chance at life and she will reward you with unconditional love and loyalty! \n\nIf you\u2019d like more information or are interested in giving this precious girl a wonderful life, please text 4-6 photo's of your interior/exterior home and yard (including fence if applicable) to Judy (423-718-0939).\n\n- - -\n\nPlease Note: Inquiries through Pet Finder may be slower to respond and the best form of communication/inquiry would be through text message at the number above. Thank you.\n\nSearch for \"A PAW AND A PRAYER DOG RESCUE\" on Facebook to see ALL our available dogs for adoption updated daily!",

He is approx 2-4 yrs. old and is already neutered and vaccinated. \n\nHe came to the rescue in pretty bad condition and with a lil TLC he's doing so much better and looking for a family that will love and adore him like he very much deserves. Liberty is the sweetest guy and gets along with everyone but is scared of cats. He does not like crates. \n\nIf you'd like more information or to meet Liberty please email Findingabestfriend@gmail.com \n\nAny current pets in the home must be fixed and vaccinated in order to be considered. \n\nThank you!",

            "description": "Location: Gloucester, VAHello there! My name is Daenerys. Those of you who are fans of \"Game of Thrones\" will know that I am named after the beautiful blond woman on that show. She is strong and beautiful and so am I. I was surrendered with my sister, Arya, through no fault of our own. I am the big sis, at 4 years old, and 77 pounds. Hey, more to love, right? I have a beautiful white coat, with just a couple patches of brown, one right on the top of my head! As you can see from my pictures, I am always smiling and am hoping to find myself my forever home. The nice folks at the pound say I appear to be housebroken, as I do my biz as soon as I go out the door. Sometimes I pull hard, as I am just so excited to go. I am a big strong girl, and so would like a big strong human to help me learn to be more patient. I have a harness which helps me too. And, of course, a big fenced in yard would be fun too, where we can all play together. I have lots of energy but would still like to be your couch buddy too.\n\nSadly, I am heartworm positive and have begun treatment, the cost being covered by the local humane society. Until my treatment is complete, a foster to adopt agreement would allow me to come live with you. Then the adoption would be finalized once my treatment is completed. I would love that as it would be so nice to go through this with my new loving family.\n\nIf you would like to know more about me and my sparkling personality, please contact my friend, Joyce. She is a volunteer here at the Gloucester Animal Control Pound and works with me everyday. She can be reached at 757-376-8360 or jemerson60@hotmail.com\n\nEven tho I am at the pound, my adoption would be administered by the Gloucester Mathews Humane Society. To arrange a meet and greet or to apply to adopt me you can email to animalplacement@gmhumanesociety.org\n\nPlease come visit. I would love to meet you and maybe make you my new forever family! That would really make me smile!!\nGloucester County Animal Control\n6584 Beehive Drive\nGloucester, VA 23061",

He needed a eight extractions and is now tip top. Sweet boy who is about the best couch potato/chi you've ever met.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

We of course took them back! The perfect home for these girls would be one with a yard and not very many stairs. Belle has elbow dysplasia, which is managed really well with CBD or pain medication, but she does find stairs difficult to navigate. Both she and her sister can be a bit dog selective, and do best with mellow dogs that aren't overly interested in them. \nIf you would like to give these girls their forever home apply at www.gotdrool.org",

            "description": "DEXTER ~2-3 years old. Good with older considerate children and large dogs. Not good with small dogs or cats. Requires a fenced yard.\n\nGSRA adopts to residents of VA, NC, and SC only\n\nHi, my name is Dexter, and I am 95lbs of pure friendly! I have heard German Shepherd Dogs can be aloof? I don't know the meaning of the word! In my three years on the planet, I have never met a person (including young people) I haven't liked! Of course, I can always like them better if they skritch me behind the ears!\n\nDexter is as loveable as he is good looking! He is house-broken, crate-trained, not a barker, will not get on furniture without invitation, does not mess with people food, does not jump up inappropriately, or pull on his leash. He entered our foster care with a crate, but swiftly earned 24hr. free roam of the house. He is calm and quiet through the night. He has had limited training, but is very smart and excited to learn new skills. His intense people-focus would make him a great candidate for advanced training with a motivated owner, but his outgoing personality makes him a poor choice as a watchdog. He needs daily moderate exercise (walks-he will Heel on lead) and could happily become a jogging buddy if invited. Dexter's tail has been docked following an episode of uncontrolled chewing. Food allergies are the suspected cause. He is currently on an anti-itch medication (Apoquel) and a restricted diet. Further evaluation to determine underlying causes will be indicated. Potential allergies may require ongoing management.\n\nDexter is usually a people-pleaser, but he does sometimes exhibit an independent streak. He also has a frisky side, and when he is feeling perky he tends to want to mouth dogs and people. He has excellent control and a gentle soul, but he is large and his playful mouthing could be misunderstood by some people or other dogs. He loves to rough-house when given the chance! Small dogs would be a poor fit. Given his size and occasional bursts of exuberance, he is not a good choice for homes with small children or unsteady seniors. Dexter has a strong prey drive, so no cats. He is great around strangers and good around most large dogs-but not all. Very occasionally he will meet a dog to whom he takes an instant dislike, so he needs some social supervision.\n\nDexter would do well as the only dog in a family who could give him a lot of attention and a sense of purpose. Someone working from home would be ideal. He would also be a lovely addition to a family of multiple dogs with compatible personalities. In either case, he really needs to be around people to thrive. He is a charming dog. It is hard to spend any time around him and not fall in love!\n\nFor more information on our adoptable pet list please visit: Adoptable Pet List\n\nPlease join us at our next Event(s):\n\nCurrent Scheduled Events:",

He was made to live outside for nearly a year after his previous owner got two new puppies and decided they didn't want three dogs in their house. Like a true lab, he can be quite energetic but can also be a cuddle bug who is content quietly laying on the couch! He is very petite at around 35-40 lbs.\n\nHe knows basic commands and is very treat motivated. Despite living outside, he is house broken. He doesn't do well in a crate but has not had accidents other than when he was crated. He loves toys and loves attention. He has done well with other medium sized dogs but can be a little too rambunctious around the smaller ones. Not sure if he has been around cats but has done fine around children. He is a content, handsome little fella who would love nothing more then to have a family of his own!",

His long term prognosis is excellent! (See below)\n\nHe loves everyone and every critter he meets! He'd love to come meet you too if you love playing and then snoozing on the couch!!!\n\nHistory of heart condition: His treatment was January 13, 2021 and He has a follow up appointment set for mid April.\n\nUpon further testing at MU Veterinary Health Center, it was confirmed through Echocardiogram that Eddie has Pulmonic Stenosis (PS), categorized at moderate to severe. Patients with that degree have the potential to develop complications such as exercise intolerance, collapse, arrhythmias and congestive heart failure.\n\nEddie is a good candidate for Balloon Valvuloplasty (BVP), which is a minimally invasive, palliative surgical procedure that reduces the degree of PS, along with the risk of future complications.\n\nWe are currently raising funds so that Eddie can receive the much needed surgery to live his life to the fullest as someones best friend and loyal companion.",

He will go up to humans and give them his puppy dog eyes until he gets a head or back rub.\n\nIf Rolly hears a neighbor dog, he wants to see what's going on and can jump pretty high so he will do best with a good 6 ft block wall. He is gentle in most everything he does. He is not food or toy aggressive. He can walk well on a leash, but if he encounters another dog his owner will need to know how to be avoidant of interactions.\n\nRolly is great with\n\nboth adults AND kids!! However, he does not get along with other animals so he needs to be the only pet in the house. He would also do best in a home with someone that's home for a good part of the day. He also very much LOVES his naps!\n\nRolly loves the following most of all:\n\n Cuddles\n\n Being pet while right by your side\n\n Playing ball\n\n New squeaky toys\n\n Freshly washed blankets\n\n Sitting and laying by his human while they are working, sleeping, and relaxing\n\n Car rides\n\n Meeting new people\n\n Watching his human cook\"\n\nIf you're interested in meeting ROLLY, please visit our website for our application www.underdogaz.com",

You see, I\u2019ve been around the block a time or two and, now, I\u2019m ready to settle down and take it easy. I do love to be petted, and that\u2019s when these tippy-tappy feet break out in my own version of an Irish jig.I think it\u2019s heavenly to cuddle with my special ones. It makes me curl into a tight little ball, so innocent and sweet. I\u2019m leash-trained and leisurely walks keep me in shape and looking good. In fact, I look so good I sometimes enjoy staring at my own reflection in the mirror. If you\u2019re ready for the good life with a leisure-loving gentleman, send in your adoption application right away.\n\nIn order to qualify for ALIVE Rescue Memphis's program all of the following steps must be met:\n\n \u2022You must be at least 21 years of age and be able to provide ALIVE with proof of age.\n\n \u2022Any current pets must be up to date on vaccinations, and be spayed/neutered. Exceptions to this will only be considered if proof of a medical explanation is provided.\n\n \u2022If you currently rent, you must provide a landlord\u2019s phone number and a copy of your executed lease.\n\n \u2022All members of the family living in the home where the animal will be placed must be interviewed.\n\n \u2022Applicant must live within 50 miles of Memphis if interested in adopting and within 30 miles of Memphis if interested in fostering. \n\n \u2022Allow an ALIVE Rescue Memphis representative into your home for a visit to insure that your home is safe for the potential new pet.  \n\n  \u2022You must allow an ALIVE Rescue Memphis representative into your home for a visit to ensure that your home is safe for the potential new pet. \n\n  \u2022You must be able and willing to spend the time and money necessary to provide training, medical treatment, and proper care for a pet.\n\n  \u2022Currently, adoptions fees in Memphis are $275 for a dog over 4 months of age, $300 for a dog under 4 months of age. \n\n  \u2022We require an additional $75 training deposit at the time of adoption. You will be required to enroll and complete a training class with your new companion at one of our approved training facilities. Once ALIVE Rescue Memphis receives proof of the completed class, this $75 deposit will be refunded.",

            "description": "OLIVER is a sweetheart. He was born with craniosynostosis (human babies get this as well) - it just means that when the soft skull bones were growing, they grew in a slightly asymmetrical line. In Oliver's case, it just created an absolutely adorable face. He's healthy in every other way and it doesn't bother him and other pets don't notice. He's just gets more hugs :-) \n\nHe is robustly affectionate and immensely loves back scratches. He loves to give kisses! He gets a huge smile on his face when he plays with his puppy girls (two six month old puppies, one of whom is deaf). It's \"tongue-out-Tuesday\" all day whenever he gets to play with them. And they love him too! He tolerates them jumping all over him and kissing him :-)\n\nHe is house trained, crate trained, neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, and about 5yrs old.\n\nWe have specific adoption and Covid rules listed below.\n\nRevised adoption policy\nDue to Covid -19 pandemic and social distancing requirements, we've revised our adoption policy. \nFirst, please email (desertpawsnm@gmail.com) to inquire before you fill out the online application. (Please do not call or text). \n\nWe are unable to do multi-dog/cat meetgreets or adoption events at this time or bring multiple animals to your house to choose from, so please only inquire if you're serious about adopting this particular animal. If you're just shopping around with several shelters and rescues, please let us know this. \n\nIf your application is approved (which \"could\" take up to one week) then we will contact you to set up a Zoom chat or ph call to answer questions/clarify anything and set up a day/time to bring the pet to you. \n\nSince we can't come into the home/yard due to Covid-19, we ask that you send us pics /video of your home/yard/living area/current pets. \n\nWe will discuss with you about meeting your other pets. At the meeting/adoption at your house (outside) please wear a mask (as will we), keep to a properly distanced social distance and have hand sanitizer and your own leash.\n\nWe adopt locally to Central Abq, Santa Fe, Los Alamos and Rio Rancho. No out of area adoptions inquiries please. No young children for our adoptions please. Please consider adopting one of Oliver's \"puppy girls\" with him! (Daisy who's deaf and Folie).\n\nThe animals are fostered and our foster families like to know their fosters are happy, healthy, and cared for during their lifetime. We appreciate staying in touch periodically (just a pic, holiday card, social media, pics/videos  etc will do :-)\n\nOur volunteers and adoption board are working diligently with an overload of inquiries since Covid to match families and forever pets. We're sorry, but if you email us with questions that are already answered here or fill out an application that does not fit the parameters of our procedures we will not be replying to you. Thank you for your understanding on this!\n\nThank you - we look forward to hearing from you!",

She is a big girl, but she is a gentle and loving soul!\n\nPearl loves people and kids, is very friendly, affectionate and loves to ride in the car! She also enjoys fetch and a good run in the yard!\n\nPearl can only be placed with laid back, older dogs who will leave her alone and pretty much ignore her. She just doesn't really like other dogs that much, so we are being careful about her placement.\n\nShe will do best with a privacy fenced-in yard. She LOVES to go on walks and is the Queen of snuggling. She is so sweet, and she has been ready for her forever home for awhile now. Where are her new people? Make this holiday season happy for her, call about her today!\n\nIf you are interested in this dog, please contact volunteer Amy at amyh@rescuednready.com or at 918-688-0755.\n\nADOPTIONS ONLY TO PEOPLE LIVING IN THE NORTHEASTERN OKLAHOMA AREA.  \n\nThe adoption fee is $200.00 and includes all current vaccinations, negative heartworm test, worming, microchip, and spay/neuter surgery.  Go to www.rescuednready.com to learn about our adoption process and download our application.  \n\nCALL or EMAIL US TO MEET ONE OF OUR ADOPTABLE DOGS! Call Amy at 918-688-0755 or email at amyh@rescuednready.com.\n\nLIKE RESCUED 'N READY ON FACEBOOK!!",

            "description": "ADOPT GUS Gus is an 8yo Beagle mix who weighs about 35lbs. He has been with me for a few weeks while healing from an eye removal. He is technically blind but can see shadows when in a well lit area. Nothing stops this little guy though. He walks the neighborhood with purpose & uses his nose & head to find his way around. He's pretty amazing for adjusting so quickly. When prompted to go up, he easily navigates the stairs to go inside. He is a fast learner. Gus is also a great snuggler & enjoys spending time just hanging out with his people. Gus would do best with low key dogs. He does fine with my 12yo son & doesn't chase the cats (just sniffs them). Gus had a tough life before coming to SAAP but you wouldn't know it by his sweet demeanor. He truly is a special dog & he's looking for a forever to call home. Apply to adopt Gus at adoptastray.comAll SAAP animals are vet checked, UTD on vaccines, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, and given flea and heartworm preventative as age appropriate.\n\nOur website is: http://www.adoptastray.com/\n\nTo check if this animal is still available visit our master pet list on our website at:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/adoptable-animals/\n\nHave questions:\nPlease email us at saap@adoptastray.com for more information about this animal or to answer any questions you may have.

            "description": "Elias is a 4 year old Bull Terrier mix, about 60 pounds. He previously lived and got along well with a female senior dog, two cats and a bearded dragon. He also loved the family, including two children but has come back to SAAP to find a new home.\n\nElias is very sweet and loves all the snuggles and attention he can get (at least when he's awake). He rides great in the car, and is house and crate trained.\n\nHe gets around like a champ (jumps in and out of the car, runs up and down stairs, plays with other dogs) but has some pain in his back left knee that can cause him to give a warning bark/nip if he is startled while sleeping or if it is touched when he doesn't expect it--no reports of ever making contact/biting a human or pet. He has seen a vet who recommends pain medicine as needed, but surgery isn't necessary. He would need a family who can give him space to feel safe and relax.\n\nIf you would like to meet Elias or learn more about this chunky hunk, submit a no obligation application at www.adoptastray.com.All SAAP animals are vet checked, UTD on vaccines, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, and given flea and heartworm preventative as age appropriate.\n\nOur website is: http://www.adoptastray.com/\n\nTo check if this animal is still available visit our master pet list on our website at:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/adoptable-animals/\n\nHave questions:\nPlease email us at saap@adoptastray.com for more information about this animal or to answer any questions you may have. You may also contact us at (859)391-1234.\n\nCompleting the online application when you find an animal you are interested in speeds up the adoption process. We can hold your application on file for a period of time if you are still looking for that perfect new family member.\n\nTHE APPLICATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS LINK:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/dog-adoption-application/\n\nINTERESTED IN FOSTERING:\nWe welcome your interest and ask that you complete our on-line foster application:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/foster-application/",

He will need training and structure, as well as kennel/crate training. He currently does have accidents in his kennel, and is very prone to marking. Crate training will help him understand his boundaries and being out of the shelter environment will also help this. His demeanor is calm. If you are about the house, he will be happy to follow you around and be your partner. Contact us for more info!",

All new animals (40/week) are added to the site 2 weeks before their availability date to give you time to fill out your adoption application and get the family ready to come out to the shelter that day. As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. \n\nPlease fill out an online application and we will give you a call as soon as we receive it. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

RDDR is covering this treatment for him. His new person may need to do some bandaging and washing of his wound.\nCats: NO\nDogs: Yes- But if he is going to to live with another dog, this dog should be extremely playful as well.\nKids: Over 13 please due to Cody\u2019s size and energy\nAdoption fee: $475\n\nMeet Cody!\n\nThis young fellow is full of energy, life, and love! Cody has had quite the journey coming into care, and is currently recovering from a trauma to his foot. This medical challenge has not stopped him from being a happy and friendly guy. In other words, this hiccup is not holding him back from being a young, energetic dog.\n\nCody is enjoying life inside a home very, very much and loves all the comforts that come along with it including stuffy toys, especially if they squeak! He has caught on to housetraining quickly and sleeps through the night like a champ. We have introduced him to crate training and this is being done a little bit each day. He has quickly mastered sit, and we are working on other cues and finding good ways for him to work out his husky- mix energy. Cody is currently living with two older dogs who refuse to play with him despite his repeated efforts. He has been friendly with dogs met while on walks. Leash training is ongoing, and considering he did not know a leash, collar, or a harness prior to coming into Rosier's care he is doing very well.\n\nCody needs a home with a yard, and a person who is active. Walking, running, hiking....Cody would love all of it. Cody requires daily physical and mental exercise and will need a committed family.\n\nWe recommend kids 13 yrs of age and older as Cody can play hard and is still learning to not play with his mouth.\n\nCody will thrive as the only dog with all of the attention, he could live with another large and playful dog. Cody has a lot of love to share and is looking for his furever home.\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Cody, please fill out an adoption application at www.rosierdays.com/adopt\n\nThe application must be submitted and reviewed before a meet and greet will be arranged.\n\nPlease be patient in waiting to hear back from us as the dogs care is our priority and all of our volunteers work as well as run the rescue in their spare time. You should hear from us within 72 hours.",

            "description": "Meet Henry! This spunky fellow is just over one year and weighs 35 pounds. He has high white socks on his front legs--like a pro basketball player! He is working on proper leash skills and doing super. He would really love a yard to chase a ball around in. With his tail wagging and his ears flopping, he is one happy pup when he runs! Henry enjoys meeting new people and playing with the foster family's resident dogs. Henry would do best with kids over 10 as he is working really hard on learning not to jump in excitement. Henry loves sleeping on his dog bed and curls up into a content and lovable ball as he snoozes. When his family is in the kitchen, he sets up shop on the mat in front of the sink. Whoever does the dishes needs to step around him--he just wants to be close to his pet parents. Henry's new family must be committed to his continued training-he is eager to learn more and is super smart This pup would make a perfect pup for an active household, tweens, and a yard!  Henry is house broken and crate trained and ready to go home to his very own family.  \n\nHenry is neutered, heartworm negative and up to date on age appropriate core vaccines. Adoption fee is $350. As with all rescue animals, breed determination cannot be validated without genetic testing. Visit www.tinymiraclesrescue.org and click on the APPLY tab for an overview of Tiny Miracles adoption process. Thanks for adopting and saving a life -- you are Henry's hero!",

I love to go for nice walks around the neighborhood, and I love love love to go out to the yard and sniff around. I'm an introvert and independent type so sniffing and exploring are my kind of fun. After LOTS of sniffing I'm always ready for attention so I'll go to my hooman for some petting. I'm a sensitive guy and like gentle petting. I don't care too much for toys but sometimes I get excited and feel a little frisky so I will pick up my ball and start playing. I like to play case the ball then run away with it. It's so much fun!! I enjoy other doggy companions but would like to meet my new friend first. Once inside I like to chill out, and enjoy some quiet time. Right now I'm learning to lay in this thing called a crate. I'm training hardright now I'm working on crate training, housetraining and learning to sit. Training is not my favorite thing to do. The hoomans over here say that I would require a patient trainer who has plenty of creativity and uses positive training methods. because remember I'm a sensitive guy. I'm very devoted and protective of my family but I can be reserved and aloof around strangers. The hoomans at the shelter say I'm a great guy and mild mannered. While I like it here at the shelter boy, would I be excited to find my forever hooman! We can sit around and watch some Lobo Basketball and go for walks in the sun. Wouldn't that be fun?! Stop into the Westside Shelter to meet me, I sure would like to meet you. Weight: 76lbs Housetrained: no but working on it Dogs: good but would need a meet and greet Cats: Unknown Children: Over 14 years old due to Handling sensitivity, afraid of fast movements and certain type of touch",

He is happy to be outside running around or playing a couch potato right next to you if you\u2019ll let him.  Tank hasn\u2019t had a wonderful life to this point, he was neglected for while but he\u2019s past that and looking forward to finding his forever home.  He is neutered, up to date with vaccines and microchipped.   We haven\u2019t seen any aggression with other dogs but proper introductions would need to be done.

He came to the shelter as a lost pup 10/9, and no one has come looking for him.  Eustus will sit when you ask him to and is nice on leash. He would make a good running partner.  He is about 3 years old and 61 pounds.  He will be neutered, microchipped and heartworm tested upon adoption.  Come in and meet him - he is in run 831.  ID 625413\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

He needs slow introductions to new people, but once he trusts someone, he is loving and eager to please. Max needs a foster or adopter who has the skills to observe body language and wait for his seal of approval. He likes a lot of other dogs, but they don\u2019t all like him, so if you have another dog, pre-foster/adoption meet and greets and slow, supervised integration in the home are very important. Max needs an adopter that sets very clear boundaries, but not in a confrontational way.

It was one of the saddest cases we have come across as this five year old boy is super loveable and adores all people!\n\nHAZE is housebroken.  He will need his person to continue to teach him how to walk on his leash as he is strong and tends to pull more than walk while outdoors.  We believe that HAZE may not have ever been taught how to walk on a leash and may have had a yard or a place to run out, relieve himself, and return.  Therefore, he will need continued leash training to continue to develop leash manners.\n\nHAZE would do best as your one and only fur baby in the home as he has not had much exposure to other dogs and does not know how to respect physical boundaries while walking.\n\nHAZE is not a fan of cats so he can not have one as his roommate.\n\nAre you ready to give HAZE the FUREVER home that he deserves? If so, please email Forblakessakerescue@gmail.com to complete an application!\n",

            "description": "Apply at: http://www.plannedpethood.org/adopt/available-dogs.html\n\nCharlotte might be one of the prettiest pups you ever meet. Golden blonde fur, sweet brown eyes and a wonderful smile. Charlotte is energetic and smart. She warms up to new people right away and wants to be a human\u2019s best friend. \n\nCharlotte loves car rides, she loves to play, she adores adventures outdoors. But there is one thing Charlotte cannot seem to love: other dogs. Charlotte needs to be the only canine in her home. She tolerates walking past other leashed dogs at the park and at the vet but Charlotte displays guarding tendencies and a strong discomfort being around dogs in close proximity. Charlotte needs a family who understands her feelings towards other dogs and is willing to make her feel safe and comfortable. \n\nCharlotte has been working on manners while being fostered at Central Kennels. We would like to have Charlotte attend follow up training to assist her new family as she settles into her home. If you would like to meet or adopt Charlotte, please complete our application. Please note that Charlotte would be best as the only pet in a home.  Her adoption fee is sponsored!\n\nPlease understand the statements about this animal are based upon the foster home's evaluation of the animal.  The animal might behave differently (negatively or positively) in your home.  While the animal might be good with the current foster\u2019s dogs, cats, children, etc., it may not be with your animal(s) or children.  The animal may be housebroken or litter trained in the home of the foster but may relapse in your home.  The animal is represented to the public as it performs in the foster home and any statements made regarding the animal are conditional to that foster home setting.  Those interested in adopting should have read all information about the animal and understand they cannot claim they did not understand the facts about this animal as understood by Planned Pethood and/or the foster.  Planned Pethood and vet(s) do our best to provide accurate age and breed of the animal, but sometimes they are educated guesses.  Please understand that statements made regarding this animal are simply overviews and are not guaranteed.  Your adoption fee is non-refundable for any reason.",

A wonderful woman working from out of town had picked them up and worked all day to find somewhere for them to go. We stepped in and here they are! They are young kids, not far from being a year old it appears, good demeanors and they sure are handsome! If youd like to foster Crosby and/or Nash(we hate to separate but they are confident and will be okay), or adopt, please fill out an application at carerescueok.org. Possible Great Pyrenees mixes!",

            "description": ",Due to COVID-19, all adoptions will be by appointment only. To adopt, complete our online adoption application and an Adoption Counselor will contact you within 48-hours to schedule your adoption appointment. Adoptions for any pets in foster will be completed offsite at our PetSmart Claiborne location on a case by case basis. The safety of our foster parents and community is of utmost importance to us and it will be at the foster's discretion if they'd like to meet at this time. Thank you for choosing adoption! \n\nWatson is a wise soul among dogs.  He came from rough beginnings and worked his way up the ranks to Dog Detective.  He sacrificed a lot including having a family in order to pursue his career.  Watson ended up burning out after the case of French Quarter Rats 2020 and came to us needed a mental health vacation.  He has spent a lot of time working on himself and is now in a place to love again.  He gets along with dogs and cats and while he can be a little aloof, he really enjoys close knit families.  His fur is the softest this side of the Mississippi river.  While he has some health issues he doesn't complain and he has a bright future ahead of him.  Please think of welcoming this mellow fella into your home in 2021.\n\n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

But we\u2019re determined to make his future full of love, happiness, and security. \nCarson deserves that. \n\nHe takes a minute to warm up to strangers, but once he does he\u2019ll be glued to your hip and sleeping right next to you in bed. He\u2019s so happy now and we want to keep it this way!

            "description": "Welcome Dahlia! This precious 4-year-old pup weighs in around 35 pounds. She finished raising her litter of 8 beautiful babies, and she did such a wonderful job being a good mama and watching all of them grow up and join their forever families. Now, she is ready to find her own, and we can\u2019t think of a pup more deserving of a loving family than this little angel!\n\nShe is already housebroken and completely crate-trained. Dahlia lets dad know when it\u2019s time for a potty break by waiting patiently by the door. Since becoming an empty-nester, Dahlia has bloomed into a well-behaved, independent woman. She knows how to sit, lie down, leave it, and wait on command. She\u2019s also working on \u201cfocus\u201d and will have that down in no time. \n\nDahlia is happy to play with other dogs or do her own thing, depending on her options. However she is more accepting of other dogs if she can have a slow, structured introduction. Dahlia can entertain herself with toys or exploring in the backyard solo. In addition to being able to befriend any canine sibling, Dahlia is also cat-friendly. Dogs just don\u2019t come much more flexible than this girl! \n\nDahlia loves to get one-on-one attention from her humans, and she is perfectly content to lay around and have a lazy day with the family if that\u2019s what\u2019s on the agenda. That being said, she does get her occasional bout of zoomies, and she loves to spend time outside in the fresh air. When Dahlia gets really excited, she loves to pick up her toys and show them off to anyone who will look.\n\nThis mama absolutely loves anyone that comes along her path, and from the moment she meets a new person, she wants to be their new best friend. When you are sitting down, she\u2019ll crawl into your lap and invite herself for all the snuggles she can get, but if you\u2019re standing, it\u2019s a bit more challenging for her to figure out how to cuddle up (but that doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t try!). Even though she\u2019s a snuggler, she also understands that her people can\u2019t be around her all the time, and she can entertain herself with a chew toy when people are busy or need some space. \n\nLike so many mamas out there, Dahlia is patient, forgiving, and always looking to make those around her smile, and she is SO GOOD at it. She has done a wonderful job focusing on her babies, but it\u2019s time to let this mom get pampered and put herself first! Could she be the perfect addition to your family? Contact us today!\n \n\n\nIf you\u2019d like to be considered to adopt, the first step in the process is to submit an application through our website: http://athenscaninerescue.com/adoption-procedures/. Our adoption fee is $250 per dog over the age of 6 months and $300 per dog 6 months or younger. We accept payment by Venmo, PayPal, or card.\n\nThis includes: basic vet care (i.e. basic vaccinations, including boosters completed after adoption, spay/neuter, heartworm/flea preventatives, and treatment for any health needs while in our care), a microchip, a week\u2019s worth of food for the trial-period, and a harness lead.\n\nWe typically adopt to homes within 30 minutes of Athens, GA, as we require a basic home check to ensure all dogs are placed in a safe environment. If you are further away than that and are interested in one of our pups, please still fill out an application and we can discuss your options. WE ARE CURRENTLY NOT ACCEPTING OUT OF STATE APPLICATIONS. \n\nWe do not have a facility and operate through a network of foster homes. Thus, we do not have a phone number. If you\u2019d like to discuss potential adoptions, please email at adopt@athenscaninerescue.com.",

Summer is an absolute gem of a dog and not only loves to run and play, but will happily climb into your lap for some cuddle time as well. Although not required, Summer gets along wonderful with other male dogs and would love a social male dog in her new home too.\n\nWhile Summer is all-around wonderful, she is going to need a family that is prepared to give her some space when she arrives at home to decompress and settle in. Once she has had proper time to settle in, she will surely show you her fun and loving side and she will surely win you over! Summer is a smart girl who would love a home that is willing to do fun puzzle games or toys with her too, or maybe even some new tricks and let her use her brain. Summer would also make a great adventure buddy, as she is not overly energetic but still has plenty of energy to join you on hikes or trips to the beach.",

            "description": "Hi there!  My name is Schultz!   For some reason, my former owner left me all on my own. I don't know why because I try to be a good boy.  I was really scared and boy, was I ever happy when a nice human came along and took me to this great foster home where I\u2019m getting plenty of TLC.  I had heart worms and some other infections, but the nice rescue folks made sure I got the treatment I needed and now I\u2019m a happy, healthy boy all set to hang my leash with my forever family.\n\nI\u2019m 2 years old and weigh 75 pounds.  They tell me I'm a black lab mix, maybe with collie, but that's a best guess..  My foster dad says that whatever my breed mix is, I am a very loving boy.  I do like to please my humans.  I enjoy all kind of toys\u2026balls, sticks \u2013 you name it \u2013 I like to play with it.  I also love water!  It\u2019s so much fun when my foster dad sprays me with a hose.  I still have plenty of puppy energy so an active family that will take me on hikes and walks would be perfect for me.  There are no children in my foster home, but I know I would enjoy living with older kids -  about 12 or over.  I would never be mean to any kids but, I wouldn't  want to overwhelm the younger set with my playful self.\n\nI\u2019m fully crate trained and working on my house training.  I was an outside dog before, but with a regular routine and positive reinforcement, I\u2019ve been learning my inside manners and will have them down.  I still need some practice walking on a leash, but I'm sure my new family will continue to work with me on that, too.  I prefer a slow introduction to other dogs, but once I get to know them, we get along fine. Cat are not for me.  I'd love it if someone is with me during the day. I think I would get lonely by myself. And, if my home has a fenced yard, that would be perfect! \n\nI\u2019ve been neutered and I\u2019m up to date on my vaccines.  I even have a cool thing called a micro-chip.  I\u2019m not perfect yet, but if you have the time to spend with me, I promise to try real hard to become the best dog I can be.  If you\u2019d like an application to adopt me, please email Chris at rescue3@earthlink.net for an application and she\u2019ll send one right out. My adoption fee is $375.  Can\u2019t wait to meet you! \n\nLike us on Facebook at www. facebook.com/pawsclawsnewengland\nFollow/tag us on Instagram: @pawsclawsne or #pawsclawsne\n",

            "description": "YOU MUST HAVE AN APPROVED APPLICATION IN ORDER TO MEET OUR PETS.\n\nBentley is a cute little 10 year old who was pulled from a county shelter by LPIA. We do not know his history. He seems to be a non or low shedding breed, maybe a Shih Tzu or Lhaso Apso mix?\n\nFoster mom says he is a happy guy and a good companion, just prefers gentle, respectful handling on his own terms and at a slow pace. He would not appreciate small children and their sudden moves or grabbiness.\n\nHe does need time to acclimate to a new home, surroundings, routine and family.\n\nBentley loves to play with toys though he mostly prefers just hanging out. He walks well on a leash (short walks are all he needs), is well behaved on car rides, and sleeps all night. He seems to be good about baths, gentle brushing and having his nails trimmed.\n\nHe has been fine with the other dogs and cats in his current foster home but is not one to play with other dogs. He should be fine with low key dogs that will not pester him.\n\nHe loves eating and has not shown any food or toy possessiveness. But, if he is being naughty and has something new in his mouth that he should not, he can feel possessive (he will happily trade for a good treat!).\n\nHe will bark when he wants something or wants to be with you and cannot see you, so he is best in a house setting instead of an apartment. He likes to know where you are and be able to see you. However, his foster mom leaves him in a baby gated kitchen when she goes out and he is usually just sleeping when she returns.\n\nBentley loves to be in the same space with his people and he would happily hang outside in a fenced yard with you all day! He loves outside and would be a lovely companion while you are gardening or just relaxing outside.\n\nHe is working on his housetraining and does have some old man dribbles at times. He  will happily wear a belly band in his new home to prevent accidents. \n\nHe will need some time to adapt to a new home and potty routine and will definitely need to wear his belly band during that adjustment period. You will need several so that they can be changed and washed routinely.\n\nAn absorbent pad under his bedding would keep his doggie bed or crate nice and dry.\n\nBentley has been sleeping happily in a crate at night and even puts himself in it if he feels ready for bedtime before you. He likes to wake up slowly in the morning and lets you know when he is ready to wake up and got out to potty.\n\nHe is not a fan of being held and snuggled (this could be a back/ribs/knee discomfort or pain issue), but is fine with being gently picked up when needed. \n\nHe eats dry kibble but really prefers wet food mixed in the dry.\n\nHis back legs tend to splay out at times and an X-ray showed an old injury.  He has a heart murmur and some skin issues that should resolve with continued good quality food and treatment. He has diminished hearing and sight so may not hear commands but he eats well and responds to treats.\n\nWe are really hoping that Bentley will find a great new quiet, adults only home that will celebrate his many good qualities and understand the special needs of a senior pup. Every dog deserves a happy home, especially seniors!\n\nPlease submit your application so that you can set up an appointment to meet Bentley and see if he is the one for you!\n\nAdoption donation $175.\n\nPlease note that we do not ship animals. We also require a home visit before finalizing any adoptions so preference is given to applicants within a 90 mile range. You will be required to come to High Point, NC to meet/pick up your new pet.\n\nHOW TO APPLY:\n1. Go to www.lovingpetinnadoptions.org\n2. Click on the \"Adoption Application\" link on the left side of the page.\n3. The application will open as a PDF and you should have the ability to fill it in from that page. Be sure to complete all fields.\n4. Save the application to your computer, then attach in an email and send to petprojectnc@gmail.com\n5. Someone will review your application as soon as possible, usually within 24 hours, and will be in touch with next steps.\n",

I'm SMART and a super fast learner! \nAn adult only home is perfect for me, no kids cause I might knock them over by accident. \n\n\nPlease head on over to www.bulliesandbuddies.com to fill out an adoption application if you think we are a good fit ok?\n\nLove, HAM SAMICH aka Handsome Hank \n\nI am in the Southern CA area-sorry but my rescue does NOT adopt out of state",
