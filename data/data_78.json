She is happy now and as sweet as they come and loves people. She loves walks and insists on several a day. She gets along with our Boxer, but does need supervision when toys are present. She is house broken and sleeps in our bed, but goes to the floor also. She needs supplements as most seniors do. She is a sweetheart.",

She has great manners in the house. \n\nMotita is UTD on shots, spayed, microchipped, however she is heartworm positive. She has been started on slow kill heartworm treatment and will go home to her new adoptive family on this easy to give treatment provided by DFW GSR.  \n\nAvailable now!\nAdoption fee $350 plus tax\nFostered in Weatherford \n\nInterested in adopting??

I am clean in my kennel but will still need some basic obedience training. I am no couch potato and prefer an active lifestyle.\n\nI am recommended with a physically fenced in yard and I may require it pending your previous dog experience, location and plan for containment.\n\nI should be okay with kids in the home who are 8-10 years old or older. I can be a little obnoxious with other dogs, a meet and greet is possible pending current dogs' personality. I am not recommended to go to a home with cats.",

His rescuer was told he had a doggie friend, but he was no where to be found. This sweet boy is so gentle and loving. He enjoys car rides and walks well on a leash.\n\nBuddie was born around 9-2016 and currently weighs 47 lbs., he is neutered, current on vaccines and micro-chipped. Buddie can be protective of the ones he loves, we need an owner who will be the alpha in their relationship. When company comes over, Buddie will need to be put away, to ensure he doesn't fail. Training will be included with his adoption.\n\nHe is in boarding waiting for a home or foster!

            "description": "Blue - 6 year old Staffordshire. Needs a home with a fenced yard.\n\nMeet Blue! This handsome fella is about 6 years old and he is just stunning!\n\nBlue is a sweet and affectionate boy that would be quite happy being the only dog in the home. More snuggles for him!\n\nBlue is reactive on the leash and this needs some work. His foster has been diligently working with him and a trainer and Blue is making progress. He is not suitable for places like dog parks, as it is common for his breed to be selective with other dogs they randomly meet.\n\nIn the home he is a calm boy who loves to eat, sleep like a couch potato and get cuddles. Belly rubs are his favorite! He is not a barker in the home. Blue is great with kids. The kiddos in his foster home are his buddies.\n\nWe would like to see Blue in a home with someone who is experienced with his breed and who can be an advocate for him.\n\nHe is vaccinated, chipped and neutered. His adoption fee is $395.\n\nWe cover the medical to prepare the pet for adoption and the adopt donations go directly to cover those costs and range from $295-$495. Thank you for stepping up to save a life!\n\nTo expedite to meet with this dog, please go to our site at www.savinggreatanimals.org and fill out an application. We look at the first applications to arrive, so we hope to hear from you soon!",

Consider one of our Well Seasoned Seniors who are truly wonderful and have so much to offer. Need help finding the best fit? We'll help with that too. Please fill out an application and let's get you all matched up with a loving new \"furever' companion and friend. You'll find the application on the \"Available Dogs\" page.\n\nNOTE:\n\nAdoptions to Central/South Texas residents only\n\nStandard Adoption Fee Adult Dog: $250 ea. Puppy Adoption Fee: $300 ea. Reduced rates for Seniors dogs (10 and up). Reduced rates for pairs (when adopted together). All adoption fees are subject to sales tax per the State of Texas. DDRTX only adopts in Central/South Texas.\n\nEmail: ddrtxinfo@gmail.com Primary Website: www.DDRTX.org\n\"If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.\" At least, that's what my Dad said!\n\nHi! My name is Marty McFly and I have IVDD and even though I have NO deep pain sensation and NO nerve sensation in back legs, I HAVE LEARNED TO WALK AGAIN!!!! I do what is called \"spinal walking\", which is like walking based on muscle memory-- it's wobbly, but I can even RUN!!! I'm not in any pain, my foster mom is expressing my bladder several times a day, and I'm easy going about my limitations. I'm a calm, sweet dog who loves people time, cuddling, naps, and my physical therapy. I CLEARLY used to be a really active guy and I haven't let this injury stop me. I take off with the other dogs every chance I get and I don't seem to think there's anything different or wrong with me. I worked hard at getting my mobility back and it was slow going, but I had a miracle recovery because I wanted to RUN! I want to play with the other dogs, I want to snoop around! I'm bored and I want to go DO STUFF! Don't get me wrong, I've tooootally fallen in love with lounging in the big bed with my foster family... but running with other dogs is super fun. I like other dogs, love kids and babies, adult women are great, but I'm a bit picky about adult men so I might take a bit of time to accept or warm up to you.\n\nFor a couple weeks we were working with a wheelchair but I actually prefer the freedom of walking unassisted! All my bloodwork issues have completely resolved and I'm totally perfect now. I am now 100% totally normal and happy, I just have a few special circumstance that an adopter would need to consider if they want adopt me! 1. My bladder needs expressing every 4-6 hours and it's really easy 2. I need physical therapy (at home or professionally) a couple times weekly to keep me strong 3. At home TENS therapy (very inexpensive) every few days seems to make a big difference in my ability to walk 4. I walk like a drunken sailor and will always need special considerations as I can't control my back end: jumping, climbing stairs, etc.\n\nPlease don't let any of that scare you! I'm a happy, healthy, loving guy with a FANTASTIC personality. My foster mom would be happy to be involved in helping you learn how to care for me so it will be very easy! I'm really an easy guy once you get the hang of me.\n\nListen friends and dachshund lovers, because of you, I am walking again. Your contributions helped me get to this point and I thank you.... if you'd like to help contribute to my continuing care, click the \"Sponsor This Pet\" button under my picture and you can be part of my journey.

They were fearful that they were going to have to euthanize Stoney and we stepped in! Stoney is approximately 5-6 months old, up to date on vaccinations, neutered & microchipped. \n\nStoney is house trained, kennel trained & knows his basic commands/manners. He is an active young pup who is learning his boundaries along with socialization. His adopters must be willing to work through his obedience but allow him to be a fun loving pup also. Stoney is a sweet and playful guy who is just looking for a place to call his own. \n\nInterested adopters can fill out an application at canehavenrescue.com. \nAny possible questions about Stoney, please email canehavenrescue@gmail.com \n\nCane Haven Rescue will transport any of their adoptable dogs to the right home. We do require adoption fees that are based on the age & health status of the adoptable dog. The adoption fee covers every single dog in CHR with vaccinations, heartworm test, deworming, microchip, spay/neuter & medications. All CHR adoptable dogs are current on their monthly  heartworm and flea medication. A CHR representative will do a home check to ensure the pets are placed in a secure and loving home. \n\nwww.canehavenrescue.com",

After not one, but TWO neck surgeries and a years worth of exercise- she's no longer in pain and is at an appropriate weight. Lilly has one more appointment scheduled and will need to have periodic ultrasounds to make sure nothing changes. Lilly takes daily blood pressure medication, as well. She was noted to have an enlarged adrenal gland (this has been monitored for a year and there has been no changes). \nLilly is a 7 year old Beagle mix who loves people and having a routine. She is currently an only dog at her foster home but we believe she might enjoy a calm dog friend. She has tested well with our house cat, Charles.",

I have had an extremely rough life and just hoping my life will get a lot better which I have no doubt that it will from here on out. I landed up here for a reason and I believe that reason was for me to find someone that will treat me like I need to be treated. I am more of a dog that wants to be in a single person home and also a one dog home. I feel like I will do better with one on one attention. Which is perfectly fine with me for I get more loves and attention. I am a misunderstood girl that needs to be appreciated and of course, understood. I've always dreamt about someone that loves to let me cuddle with them, daily walks, out adventuring, or just simply in the back yard playing fetch. I'm such a love bug that also loves sitting in laps and giving kisses!",

Ciroc is a big goofball who loves human interaction and showing affection. \n\nInterested adopters can fill out an application at canehavenrescue.com. \nAny possible questions about Ciroc, please email canehavenrescue@gmail.com \n\nCane Haven Rescue will transport any of their adoptable dogs to the right home. We do require adoption fees that are based on the age & health status of the adoptable dog. The adoption fee covers every single dog in CHR with vaccinations, heartworm test, deworming, microchip, spay/neuter & medications. All CHR adoptable dogs are current on their monthly  heartworm and flea medication. A CHR representative will do a home check to ensure the pets are placed in a secure and loving home. \n\nwww.canehavenrescue.com",

She is good with older children and other dogs. She has moderate energy, likes to play with her toys and to run in yard.\n\nLoud noises and thunderstorms frightens her and she needs your voice to let her know it is going to be ok. She is however an excellent guard dog; she will let you know when someone is around. She will protect you unless you tell her it is OK.\n\nJezebel weights 16 lb. She is leash-, crate- and house-trained. She is fully vetted, spayed, tested heartworm negative, microchipped or can be with a voucher.\n\nShe can be seen by appointment to approved applicants.

We are searching for the right home for Cooper, we want him to live happily for his life somewhere that he can roam. NO OUT OF STATE ADOPTIONS AT THIS TIME.\n\nCooper is a 16 month old gray and white mixed breed Kormordor/Old English Sheep dog.  He is extremely large and playful. A fenced yard is a must. He requires training, as he has not had any. He has fur that grows long so regular grooming is necessary. He requires a home where he is exercised regularly. A home without small children is required. He is very large and will jump on people until trained, so caution is recommended. Cooper is a loud barker and cannot be in a neighborhood where he is a nuisance. This is why a farm is recommended. No apartments, no condos, no neighborhood with homes close together.  \nThings to keep in mind with Cooper:\n*large hearding breeds\n*He requires some training as he still has some puppy tendencies... Only 16mths old\n*Roam-maybe Exercise is \n*Would be good with \"public\" farm (like pumpkin patch or farm stand ect..)\n*He is very large weighing 115lbs and standing 5.5ft on his hind legs.. \n*Good with farm animals and some dogs as long as they are up for large active playmate\n*Nuisance-wake the neighbor's lol\n\nFor more information call the shelter at (401) 294-2754 or email at animalshelter@exeterri.gov \n\nDO NOT APPLY ONLINE, please apply in person at the shelter. Adoption fee $75\n\nFollow us on Facebook, search Friends of the Exeter Animal\n",

This darling girl was picked up as a stray with her mom Reba, and she is hoping to find a loving family in time for the holidays and the new year. Still very much a puppy, McEntire is playful and enjoys running around with her foster siblings or entertaining herself with different toys. She does love a good chewing session when it is down time, so she would like to have a large selection of chews for her to munch on instead of other inappropriate objects. This young pooch will do anything for attention, making her the pyrfect training pal. She has the sweetest personality and gets along well with everyone. McEntire is used to having playmates around, so it will be great if she can have a sibling to keep her company and help her settle down in a new environment. This young girl will thrive in a household where her people will commit time to engage in positive reinforcement training, and help her navigate the rules of the human world as she matures. McEntire was shaved due to matting, but her coat is soon to grow in beautifully. We are positive that this girl will mature into the most pyrfect companion in no time!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nNGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY. View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

Cane Haven Rescue pulled her from the shelter to give her another chance at life. Kay is approximately 3 years old, up to date on vaccinations, spayed & microchipped. \n\nKay is house trained, kennel trained & knows her basic commands/manners. She is dog selective and a meet and greet is absolutely mandatory. Kay does really well with children that understand boundaries. She is a ball of energy that loves belly rubs and going on walks. \n\nInterested adopters can fill out an application at canehavenrescue.com. \nAny possible questions about Kay, please email canehavenrescue@gmail.com \n\nCane Haven Rescue will transport any of their adoptable dogs to the right home. We do require adoption fees that are based on the age & health status of the adoptable dog. The adoption fee covers every single dog in CHR with vaccinations, heartworm test, deworming, microchip, spay/neuter & medications. All CHR adoptable dogs are current on their monthly  heartworm and flea medication. A CHR representative will do a home check to ensure the pets are placed in a secure and loving home. \n\nwww.canehavenrescue.com",

My ideal adopter would be one who knows a lot about my breed. I would do best with larger kids as I am also a large guy. I would love to go home with another dog! I have not been tested with cats. My ideal home would be one with a yard that has space for me to run and play. If you are interested in meeting Tango, please fill out an application survey at Buttehumane.org.

Blair and her sister were turned into a county shelter when their family moved. It\u2019s so sad when the dogs aren\u2019t considered part of the family and allowed to go along. Her sister was adopted from that shelter, but Blair sat waiting to be noticed. Well, we sure noticed her and snatched her right up! Now she\u2019s hanging with us and having a good time until her forever family comes along. Blair is pure sweetness! She can be a bit wary of new things, but warms up quickly. She\u2019s easygoing and loves attention, but has obviously not been exposed to much as new things seem to scare her a little and she looks for reassurance. Blair appears to be housebroken and is very polite. She loves to go for walks and does well, but will hesitate with loud noises. Her ideal home would be with another dog that is confident enough to teach her that she is safe. Blair is loving, affectionate, and great company. She will make a great hiking buddy and will snuggle close on the sofa to watch a good game. If your family is missing a good snuggler, you may want to meet our Blair. Start the process by filling out an application today.\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/91891552799173\n",

            "description": "This dog is part of our shelter outreach program where we take dogs from overcrowded shelters in hopes of finding them a forever home here! We generally do not have much background info on them and cannot guarantee they are housebroken. They are all up to date on vaccines, spayed/neutered and microchipped.\n7 1/2 years old. 45lbs. JJ made his way up to us from TN where he was pulled from an overcrowded shelter. Poor boy was heartworm positive so he was treated by the rescue down South. His poor teeth are so worn down, he may have lived his life outside on a chain chewing rocks. He was in such bad shape and suffered major hair loss. After many medicated baths and a good diet his fur has grown in nicely. JJ keeps his kennel quite clean and does potty when taken outside. He loves his walks with volunteers and staff and walks pretty well on the leash. JJ is a special boy who needs a kind, patient soul after the rough life he has had. He loves to play with his toys and play fetch. Once he gets to know you, you will have a loyal friend for life. Likes to cuddle too. Breed experience would be great and an adult only home preferred. If interested, please fill out an online application on our website www.jerseyshoreanimalcenter.org*Per JSAC policy, puppies and kittens under 6 months will not be adopted to families with children under the age of 6 years.",

I've got a purple dot cause I'm so darn scared here at the shelter, so I gotta go to a home with an experienced dog owner, and no kiddos! Right now, I'm on a medication called Fluoxetine to help with my anxiety, and it helps me a lot, but a calm environment is going to be super important to help me feel at home. I don't mind taking my meds though, I eat them right up with a good snack to wash it down! I'm nervous around other dogs, but I don't mind the company of a calm cat. My foster tells me I'm a real good boy; I'm totally housebroken and I don't need to be crated at night! I don't enjoy car rides very much, but I'm still on my best behavior when we're out for a drive. I'm not exactly what you'd call a social butterfly, but if you could take me home and show me a little love, I'd be ever so grateful!\n\nI'm in an Ambassador foster home! I'm not at the shelter, so please call to set up a meet and greet appointment. You can talk directly with my foster parent to know exactly what I'm like in a home. \n\nWhat's HW+? I've completed the treatment for heartworms, I'll just need to keep a calm lifestyle for a little while longer. Please don't be deterred, my lifespan isn't shortened, and I'm not contagious to your other pets.\n\nTake me on a Slumber Party! You can bring me home for a 3 day - 30 day trial period. HSSC will provide food, medications, and necessities. If I'm not the one for you, just bring me back to HSSC and provide feedback on what would be the best home for me.",

Because of this, he has been sitting in a shelter in Texas, waiting for someone to see past his flaws for the past 2 months. He has the sweetest disposition and huge eyes that he uses to get all the love from the shelter staff. He is very calm and so so sweet!\n\nClyfe made a doggy friend or two while at the shelter, but preferred to roam and get booty scratches rather than play. He is very calm and clean while in his kennel and perhaps that hurt his chances for adoption at the shelter. Sadly, if you don't stand out, you don't stand a chance.\n\nBut Clyfe has now been rescued by NorthStar Pet Rescue so he is safe and loved. He is being treated for heartworm in Texas and he will not be coming to New Jersey until late February/early March. Although Clyfe is fine with dogs outside of the house he cannot live with another dog.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Clyfe when he arrives and giving this guy all the love he's been missing, please fill out an adoption form at www.northstarpets.org & ask for CLYFE TX!",

That feature is a default with petfinder, and is not a part of our adoption process.\n\nThe first step in our adoption process is the application. Completed applications take priority over inquiries. To apply to adopt, please copy and paste the following url:\n\nhttps://fs30.formsite.com/legacygsd/form4/index.html\n\nIntroducing Willis! Willis is a lab mix. He weighs about 65lbs and is around 5 yrs old.\n\nWillis was at a small shelter in MS. They put out a plea for their medical cases and we just had to scoop up this cutie patootie! Willis had heartworms. Heartworms are an epidemic in the south. It is a process to get treated but Willis did great! He is completely recovered and is ready for his forever home!\nWillis is a goofy boy. He loves to play and be silly. He enjoys playing with other dogs and Doing zoomies is one of his favorite activities. He loves to chase balls but doesn't really get the concept of fetching and retrieve. He is currently being fostered in a home with young children, other dogs and a cat and he does great with all. He is crate/kennel trained. He is learning his house manners and is doing well. We recommend kenneling him when he will be unsupervised. This is the routine he is used to and he can't get puppy mischief while he is tucked away in his \"house\".\n\nWillis is fully vetted, up to date on vaccines, sailed through heartworm treatment, is neutered and microchipped and is one monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention.\n\nAs with all of our dogs, we recommend a basic obedience class to help him understand what is expected of him, and this also helps with the bonding process.\n\nWillis's adoption fee is $475, which covers all his vetting, preventatives, fostering costs and other associated expenses. We do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.\n\n",

            "description": "Thanks for your interest in Churro! He's a 15 year old male Chihuahua. He came from an only dog home, but he is doing well with other dogs in his foster home. Since he is 15 years old, he did have a little urine leakage from time to time when he's excited, but we have put him on Proin and that has pretty much resolved the issue completely. He does need to be on Proin for the remainder of his life. However, it's very cheap. This is his medication, just for reference: https://www.1800petmeds.com/Proin-prod10304.html\n\nOtherwise, Churros is in good shape. He is heartworm negative, neutered, and up to date on his vaccines. Please let me know if you have any other questions about Churro. He's a sweet old man who enjoys snuggles. \n\n\nThank you for your interest in adopting! All of our animals live in foster homes in the Starkville, MS area, so we do not have a shelter facility that you can visit. If you are interested in meeting or adopting this pup, please complete our application at www.tiny.cc/garapp. Then, an adoption coordinator will contact you via email to set up a meeting. All of our meetings and adoptions take place in Starkville, MS. All of our animals are spayed / neutered, microchipped, current on vaccines and heartworm / flea prevention, and dewormed. All pups also come with 30 days of complimentary emergency pet insurance.",

After 2.5 months in his foster home and relearning to trust people again, he has really become a sweetie pie! He's very loving, loyal, funny, and gentle! He spins and dances on his hind legs every time you take him out for a walk. He lavishes you with kisses and begs for butt scratches... yes he LOVES butt scratches! LOL! He is always right next to you wherever you are... waiting for attention, pets, and scratches. He instantly loves all men - even huge 6'6\"\" men!! He still hesitates before you pick him up but he relaxes really quickly and settles into your arms. He is comfortable at home by himself now. He'll bark for the first 2 minutes and then settle into his bed and patiently wait for you to come home. He takes treats from you very gently and appreciate you putting a jacket on him when he's cold... he'll give you more kisses to show appreciation. He also now plays with the other foster dogs and walks around wagging his tail in confidence. He hardly marks in the house anymore and has learned that people do love him and won't hurt him.",

She loves other dogs, big and small, and would do well in a home with at least one other active dog that she can play with. She loves to hike and she dances when she is excited. She has not been officially cat-tested, but her first known encounter went well. She is very interested in other wild critters who may wander or fly in the neighborhood, though. She is a sweet, gentle, and loving dog who bonds easily with humans. She was recently spayed and had a dental, so she is ready to shine brightly in her forever home.",

My foster mom thinks I am as handsome as Harry Styles and could make a great impression on everyone you take me to meet! I am extremely sociable as I love other people and other dogs. I tend to be more submissive, as even one of our volunteer's small dog barked at me, and I knew they were the boss. I am looking for a family to call my own, one where I could possibly even run around the yard as my family hangs out outside, and if there is barbecue that would be a plus! I'd love to have a bite or 2! Once I get my energy out, I am very relaxed in the house. I just lie and flop right around. I am crate and house trained, so leaving me at home when you need to go run an errand is totally cool with me! If you are interested in meeting me, reach out to my foster mom Liz at 214-616-6128, and she can tell you how much she adores me and thinks I am awesome \n\nHarry is heartworm tested, neutered, as well as up to date on vaccines and even microchipped! If you are interested in adopting him, fill out an application at https://shelter2rescue.org/DogAdoption.html",

            "description": "At first glance, it might appear that Monty is channeling his inner Eeyore. With those soulful puppy dog eyes and that prominent underbite, he has a way of pulling at our heartstrings. But don't be fooled! This fun-loving boy is all wiggles and tail wags when he's playing with toys or exploring the great outdoors. If you're looking for the perfect trail companion, Monty is your boy. He goes out on the trail on a regular basis, and can run for miles. Bikers, strollers, dogs, cranky swans and other distractions don't faze him in the slightest. If that face isn't enough to convince you to take him home immediately, we should also note that he has received rave reviews in his foster home and on sleepovers with volunteers. He's fully house-trained and has proven to be a respectful houseguest. He's also an excellent snoozer and is content to chill on the couch and keep you company for hours during Netflix marathons. In addition to being a top-notch lounger and trail companion, Monty is also in the Total Obedience Program (TOP), which is modeled after the AKC's Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. This smart pup recently became TOP Dog Ready, which means he has already learned all the skills in his training plan, including walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers, calmly walking past another dog, staying in a sit or down until told 'free,' and coming when called. And as a part of APA's Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Monty after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA's CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 If you're looking for an athletic, sweet-natured and handsome pup, why not go the full Monty?

            "description": "Please contact Linda for more information about this pet.We welcomed Chewy to rescue just shy of 2 weeks ago. You can never be sure what a dog will be like but watching his videos you could see a chubby happy people kind of dog who was not limping or showing anything more than a happy black dog. As predicted this is who Chewy is!! On his first day in rescue he came in to meet his foster family and immediately decided he was going to be happy while he was here. We are learning more about him and all is good so far!!! He is a bit fearful of large dogs but is fostered with smallish female terrier and they are GOOD buddies.\nChewy just needs his microchip and will be going home for his first Christmas in his new family home!!!\n\nCome see this pup on Saturdays during adoption event hours. Please email Linda at lbredfire@sbcglobal.net or call WT&F's Dog Team voicemail 707-812-9030 to get a jump on the process, ask questions, and/or to confirm they will be there. Dog adoptions are held outside Napa Petco every Saturday - 12:30pm to 4:00pm.\nThis dog comes spayed/neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, dewormed, heartworm tested negative, and more with an adoption fee/donation to Whiskers, Tails and Ferals in Napa, CA. See more information at http://whiskerstailsandferals.org/.\nVisit our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/whiskerstailsandferals/",

See our adoption proccess.\nBETTY is a big red-headed beauty that absolutely loves attention! As soon as you start petting her, she leans in and rolls down your legs to get on her back to ensure she gets that belly rubbed! She is well-mannered and walks well on leash, which is good since she weighs 100 pounds! She knows some commands including sit/stay, shake, and down and will happily do them until she is on a leash - then it is all about her exploring and walking. She will enjoy short regular walks to build up her stamina. She was uninterested in a couple other dogs introduced to her, even when they were sniffing and trying to engage. With that she may do well with another dog in the home, but would likely not mind being your one and only! Betty came into a local shelter as a stray so we don't know a lot about her but we do know she is gentle, sweet, happy, and is deserving of a home of her very own where she can be pampered!

A team of volunteers ended up trapping him and bringing him to safety at PAWS Tinley Park.  He is scared of leashes and slow to trust new people.  But, when he learns you're OK, he is so loving and loyal!  Finn likes to lean against his people to know he is safe.  Finn will make a wonderful companion for a patient and calm person.  He gets along with other dogs, but would do best without children or an active household.  We can't wait to watch this sweetie blossom!\n\n\n*We are closed to the public for viewing. Please email adoptions@pawstinleypark.org if you are interested in adopting.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet, please visit our website to check on their current availability: http://www.pawstinleypark.org.. Adoptions are limited to 50 miles from the shelter. We do not ship animals. Adoption fees for dogs are $125-$275 based on age. While we do our best, we cannot make guarantees on breed, exact age and house training of our dogs. Peoples Animal Welfare Society (P.A.W.S.) of Tinley Park, IL is a no-kill non-profit 501(c) (3) organization.\n\nPhone: 815-464-7298\n",

Please read our Frequently Asked Questions and Adoption Processed Explained documentation.\n_________ B I O ______________\n\nName:Tahiti\nSize: ~Medium range: 26-60 lbs\nAdoption Donation:$75 (applicable sales tax included).Adoption fees may be paid by cash or check.\nOther:Spayed Female, Vaccinations current, Microchip, No other pets, No children, and must have a fenced-in yard\n\nTahitiis a very sweet dog!\n\nFoster Home Feedback\n\n*\nTahitineeds a home with No other pets, No children, and must have a fenced-in yard\n\n1/9/21 Volunteer Feedback: Tahiti is a very special dog and we love spending time with her. Since Thanksgiving, Tahiti has been a regular visitor to our home several times a week. She is so loving and wiggles with emotion. Tahiti is a people-person dog, she immediately liked my wife and son. She also meets strangers well (such as neighbors and other family members that stop by). She does not react or bark when the doorbell rings - quite different from our previous dogs! She loves back rubs especially after she's been playing hard.\n\nTahiti is reactive toward other dogs but has shown a lot of improvement over the past months. If we are walking down a sidewalk and a dog is barking at her from inside a house - she shows no concern. If a dog is barking from a fenced area, she will look but redirects easily. If a dog is walking on the same path toward you she will throat growl. At that time, we turn around or turn down another street. She will redirect well. Yesterday we had two surprises on our walks: the first one coming to a blind corner and meeting up with another dog about 25 feet away. It surprised both Tahiti and me! I said come and we walked quickly across the street. Tahiti didn't bark or growl. She just moved alongside me. I was so proud of her! The second was a dog turning onto the street we were on about 40 feet away. We just turned around and walked in the opposite direction. Again, she did not react with growls or barks. She did look back occasionally but would look to me when she did! So proud again!!! This morning I let her out in our backyard. Our neighbor's reactive dog heard us and immediately began barking, Tahiti turned around and ran back in the house! I couldn't believe it! So proud of this girl!!!\n\nTahiti is a great dog, and once you learn her cues it's pretty easy to understand what she wants. She needs her nap time and will kennel and sleep easily. She needs low stimulation- one toy at a time, and a back rub when you're done playing is her cue that we're done. She likes to watch you vacuum or prepare dinner. Tahiti likes to lay on the couch while you watch tv - but doesn't sleep (so that doesn't count as nap time). When she's overtired, she will force herself to go-go-go, like a toddler. When she gets like that she's almost relieved to go into her kennel and sleep.\n\nShe is completely house trained and knows her basic commands. She loves the kennel and the quiet security it provides for her to rest. Tahiti loves balls and stuffed animals and Bully sticks.\n\nI believe Tahiti will be a great addition to your home, and she really deserves a place to call her forever home. She is a good girl who shows her love for human contact through kisses and plopping her body down on your lap. I think a home without children would be ideal and she needs to be the only dog (pet) in the house as well.\n\n1/2/21 Volunteer Feedback: The two most scientifically accurate words to describe Tahiti: Squishy Wigglebutt! I LOVE THIS GIRL! She is so loving and sweet and wow is she smart! She really catches on fast - maybe more than any foster I've had. She understands commands quickly and thrives in an environment with a schedule. Tahiti knows what time it is and what to expect. You say \"kennel\" or \"nap time\" and she runs to the kennel and waits for her treat before laying down for a nap or to go to bed. She sleeps in her kennel as we realized that she has trouble turning off her brain to really rest at night and during naps. Without the downtime she kind of turns into a \"cranky toddler\" - that's the best way to describe it as she's just overtired and doesn't know why. But really she's a 90% completely awesome dog and maybe 3% cranky toddler (with 7% somewhere in the \"I can tell it's time for a nap\" phase). Don't let that scare you off - I really think she'll outgrow it as she matures.\n\nAs mentioned she would do best with a schedule and continued training to reduce her pulling when walking (she just gets so excited). With some consistency, and as she just catches on so quickly to positive re-enforcement training, I think she'd do amazing if someone continued working with her.\nShe can get bored if she doesn't get a walk or two (or a couple of games of fetch in) during the day. She hasn't been destructive and has had no accidents, she goes to the door when she has to go outside. We are working on Tahiti learning to self-soothe and to go grab a bone or something to chew on when she's overstimulated, but she is still young and just needs some direction and patience.\n\nTahiti's a champion snuggler who is ALWAYS EXCITED to see people! She loves walks and playing fetch and listens pretty well, given she's still a youngster.\n\nWhoever gets Tahiti will be one VERY LUCKY FAMILY!\n\n11/24/2020 Volunteer Feedback: Hanging out with Tahiti (aka the dog of a million kisses) for the Thanksgiving break. Tahiti is probably the most affectionate dog I have ever met. She loves her people!\n\nWe've been on a couple of walks and she did great ignoring garbage trucks and people. She is house trained and will go potty outside on command. She loves to play fetch and did well giving back the ball by the end! And she absolutely loved her green squishy ball!\n\n11/23/2020 Volunteer Feedback: Each and every day, us volunteers get to learn a little bit more about Tahiti as she starts to come out of her shell. This little wild child loves to go, go, go! We enjoyed some time out and about this morning and chilled in a home setting. She was very excited to be there and wanted to make sure she was a part of everything.\n\nRiding in the car made her a little anxious, but with the help of some cheese (and a good doggy seatbelt) we made the ride a success. We ducked into Petco for a little bit too, and she enjoyed all the smells that they had to offer. She got a little grumbly when another dog was barking at her a lot, but she redirected easily and was much more interested in treats. She LOVES people, of all shapes and sizes. She wanted to make friends with every person, a little social butterfly!\n\n11/21/2020 Volunteer Feedback: Tahiti is absolutely the people's dog. She is sweet as pie and will give you enough love that having another pet won't even cross your mind. She wants to be your one and only, the princess in her very own castle! And oh, does she deserve it.\n\nWhile she may not like other animals, Tahiti makes up for it tenfold in all of her qualities. She has a zest for life that just can't be ignored! She loves every single person she meets and everything she does is done with a wagging tail and wiggling butt. She loves to give kisses and be close to her people. Tahiti adores toys and carries them around with her like they are the greatest prize she has ever received.\n\nWhile she may not want to live with other dogs, she isn't reactive on walks. She gives them quiet indifference when passing by and doesn't give them a care in the world. Tahiti does need a little work on her basic manners, but luckily she is very treat-motivated and a quick study! She doesn't ever make a mess in her kennel, but she does get a little sad to be left by herself.\n\nI think she would love a family who wants to be active as Tahiti has a lot of energy and wants to get as much out of the day as she can! She is just an absolute love and is sure to be the perfect 4-legged addition to your family.To view additional dogs available for adoption, please see our website: www.4luvofdog.org",

I love to take naps and am very happy to be on my bed in my crate or laying outside in a sunny spot on the deck. I also love to snuggle on the sofa and get my head scratched and petted. My foster mommy is amazed that I have never had an accident in the house. She says I have perfect potty manners and I know how to go to the back door and ask to go out when I need to.\n\nThere are other dogs here and to be honest I would prefer to have my person all to myself, even though I try to ignore them and we all get along. There is also a cat here and I hardly turn my head to look at her when she is eating my food while I sit right there.\n\nI was in bad shape when I came to live here, I was in pain and very scared because I didn\u2019t understand why I was taken to the shelter before being rescued by Tzu Zoo. I was overweight and that made my joints hurt a lot, on top of that my tail was amputated due to a tumor. One of my achilles tendons is ruptured so I walk funny, but I can still get to where I need to get. I have lost a couple of pounds (could probably lose a couple more) and my tail has healed and I feel so much better now. I have dry eye and will need drops in my eyes for the rest of my life, they feel so much better now that I have my medicine.\n\nI would be happiest with an experienced dog owner who just wants to love me and take care of me, and I will love them back. I\u2019m looking for an angel.\n\nPlease apply at tzuzoorescue.com if you are interested in adopting from Tzu Zoo Rescue.  More information available by contacting tzradopt@gmail.com.\n\n[NOTE: We are a rescue NOT a shelter, meaning WE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY THAT OPENS TO THE PUBLIC. Typically, an application and home visit (both of which are required for adoption) MUST be completed, BEFORE a potential adopter will be introduced to one of our pets, in order to first determine that our basic adoption requirements are met, prior to introductions being made. We also utilize personal reference and vet checks (to ensure that any pets already in the potential adoptive home are current on vaccines, heart worm prevention and sterilized) in our adoption process, all of which is intended to ensure that the best match, between pet and people, is made. The adoption fee is based on on the dog's age.",

He has been in rescue for over 3 years waiting for that perfect combination of adult owners with protection breed experience and someone who wants to love an older dog. + open space for him to roam. Vlad has some guarding behavior..\n\nNo kids for Vlad. He needs a quiet household to live his golden years.  He's good with smaller dogs and has previously lived with cats.  He does great on a leash and doesn't seem to pay attention to dogs his size on a leash.\n\nVlad loves to go on walks. He's pretty independent like most chows.  Like treats but gets bored standing around.  He likes to be resting or on the go!  He's got a great personality.\n\nVlad is a big dog and needs a detached home.  A yard would be great but not required.\n\nVlad is neutered, UTD on vaccinations, and micro-chipped.  His adoption fee is $100.",

Once she knows you she is sweet as a button and loves her people deeply.\n\nStella's favorite things are treats, a comfy bed and lots of pets. You can find her cuddled up on her bed and sunbathing on a nice day. She has a calm demeanor and walks well on a leash, though she can get distracted if she spots a critter!\n\nStella came to us from Texas where she was found as a stray.  She is roughly 45lbs and can not be with other pets. \n\nStella would do best in an adult only home or with kids over the age of 12. Not because she is aggressive towards people, she just prefers a quiet and calm home where she can be loved and spend her days relaxing :)\n\nShe is UTD on her vaccinations, spayed and micro-chipped.  Her adoption fee is $300.",

Biscuit is a friendly guy who has done well with other dogs he has met so far. He is potty trained and knows basic commands although he does need a bit of leash work, which we will be working on. Biscuit is a fast learner and willing to please, so we anticipate him being a good pupil. Due to his size only homes with older children will be considered. \n\nALL children should be at least AGE 5 to be approved for adoption!\n\nFill out an application at our website below to be considered for adoption.  This dog is available in the NJ Area.  We will contact you if we need further information.  We cannot directly reply to all applications.  \n\nPlease apply directly at WWW.BIGDOGRESCUEPROJECT.ORG/Adopt.\n\nOur adoption fee of $425 includes  age appropriate vaccinations, microchipping and transport expenses. Spay/Neuter at 6 months of age is provided at select vets to NJ residents for $20. Details provided upon adoption. \n\nApplication will be accepted and an adopter chosen based on the needs of the dog.  We will contact you if you are chosen to adopt.  \n\nApplications can be made at bigdogrescueproject.org/adopt.  Please use the NJ Application. Thank you for considering Big Dog Rescue Project.",

A young lady who rescues animals found them and contacted us to find them good homes. Kace's siblings have all been adopted. He is still waiting for his Furever home!\n\nLooking for a new best bud? Look no further, Kace is your guy. Kace is a very smart, sweet, loyal pup who will want to always be by your side, no matter if you are taking a nap or playing in the yard. He loves snuggles and pets and is happy to meet new people, large or small. Kace does great on a leash and loves going for long walks or runs on the trail. He is doing well with house training and will try to let you know by circling the door when he needs to go out. Kace enjoys being around other dogs and is playfully friendly with the cats in his foster home. He seems to understand he needs to be gentle with his Pyr Paw. He is a little nervous about walking on linoleum flooring, but can be coaxed into it. For a Great Pyrenees, he is on the quiet side and not a big barker. Kace will come to you neutered, up to date on vaccinations, up to date on flea/tick preventives, and microchipped. \n\nApplicants must have a secure and visible fence. In order for your application to be approved you must pass a home check and a vet check which includes having at least a two year vet history. Kace can be adopted in Missouri and surrounding states: Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and Arkansas. We are able to transport Kace to those states. If you would like to give Kace a furever home, please fill out an application on our website. \n\nBeing fostered in Columbia, MO",

I'm the sweetest girl who loves to get pets and will paw at you for more attention. I love to go for long walks and get so excited when you grab my leash. I also like to hang out and snuggle on the couch. I know to potty outside and am a good sleeper at night. I'm good with sleeping in my crate or in my own bed in your room. I seem to be a little unsure about new men, I will sometimes growl when meeting someone new, but I warm up quickly.\n\nMedical notes: I am heartworm and ehrlichia positive. I will start my 28 day antibiotics before my heartworm treatment. You can adopt me before my treatment, but if you do - the cost associated would be your responsibility. Please check with your vet on pricing. https://www.heartwormsociety.org/\n\nYou can still come adopt me or even join our foster program to help the humans learn all the awesome things about new dogs like me! Learn more on our website! \n\nHope to see you soon! \n\nWhat breed am I? Mixed mutt! ODHS does not breed label (unless there\u2019s official paperwork), as studies show it is nearly impossible to tell the exact breed of each dog based off of their appearance.\n\nEducational articles:\n3/3/3 Rule;\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturday from 12-2.  On Saturday's from 2-4pm, the events are open to the public. \nOur adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience.  Currently, the average timeframe for a response to your application is 1 week.\n\nLike us on Facebook \"Old Dominion Humane Society\"\nand be a part of promoting forever homes for dogs in need.\n#Adopt #Donate #Foster #Volunteer \n\nNote: ODHS only adopts to Virginia and surrounding states (including D.C.). A $50 out of state fee applies.",

He needs room to roam and play and is best suited for country life or in a rural area. He is not an apartment or city dog. He would love nothing more than to take long walks with his owner and then cuddle up inside on a warm bed.\u00a0\n\nBen LOVES treats and would enjoy lounging around the house with a nice bone. He would also thrive in obedience training as he is smart and has a desire to please his people.\n\nBen requires a large breed experienced home with a securely fenced yard, somewhere rural. No other pets in the home, preferably an adult only home but he could be okay with kids 12 and older with evaluation.\n\nBen's adoption fee is $200, he is up to date on shots, neutered and micro-chipped.",

Adoption fees in correlation with care & expenses required to make each animal healthy and ready for adoption. Some dogs require fenced in yards, please feel free to ask any of our volunteers if the animal you're interested in requires a fenced in yard.\n\nPlease call 850-968-3260 for information on any of the animals you see listed with the JHS (Jr. Humane Society)\n\n\nZeppelin is a 2 year old pitty mix. He is a very sweet boy! Zeppelin gets along with almost everything he meets: dogs, cats, kids! He is a laid back dog who just wants a family of his own. Zeppelin comes from a home where there were many other dogs, and he would get picked on by the other dogs. He doesn't let his past affect him though! Zeppelin is very sweet natured. This good boy would love to find his furever home!\n\n\n\nThe Junior Humane Society is a non-profit, all volunteer, animal rescue group. For over 30 years, we have helped animals in the Gulf Coast area. \nAll animals waiting for adoption are placed in foster homes. Before placing the animal in a furever home, JHS provides all necessary vet care, including but not limited to: shots, spaying, and neutering. \nWe hold adoptions event every Saturday at PetSmart in Pensacola, FL from 12-4",

EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

Deaf dogs make amazing pets and there are resources available to help the adopters of deaf dogs including deafdogsrock.com, an information hub for the care and training of deaf dogs.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIf you would like to meet, foster or adopt this pet, please fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser. EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

He keeps himself entertained with toys but LOVES being with his people around the house and on walks. JETHRO is good on a leash and is a bit shy around new people and fellow canines. He has been accident-free in the house, sleeps through the night in his crate, and knows \"sit\" and is working on \"come\" and \"no\" commands.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIf you would like to meet, foster or adopt this pet, please fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser. EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

            "description": "Meet Angel! Angel is a beautiful, 7-year-old, Treeing Walker Coonhound. She is great with people and kids. She does not look or act her age and is a rambunctious coonhound and full of energy. Shemost enjoys playing ball and has a hoard of tennis balls that she will happily bring to you. Angel has lived with a very loving family since she was 10 months old but since her family has grown in size, her owners are no longer able to spend the time with her that she needs to run and play. Angel benefits from lots of exercise. A large backyard or space with a secure fence where she can run to her hearts content would be ideal. She can be anxious at times, especially in new environments, but does very well with anxiety medication to keep her calm. Angel has good manners inside the home and doesn't jump on furniture. She enjoys napping and sleeping in her plush, soft dog bed. Angel loves to interact with people and children and is very gentle even with babies and little ones. She loves to be petted and scratched behind her big, floppy ears and always appreciates a nice belly rub. She also loves to give you her paw, sit, and lay down for a delicious treat. Angel has lived with another dog in her home since she was a puppy, and they happily sleep and play together but she can be reactive towards other dogs. She can be slowly introduced to other dogs with help from a professional trainer and while on medication but a single dog household with no cats would be best for Angel. All she needs is someone who wants to play with her and give her pets and she will be your most loyal companion! She would also be a great hiking buddy if you have alot of land.\nAge: 7years\nWeight: 75 lbs\nVetting: spayed, up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative\nTemperament: Good with kids and all people, best as only pet\nTraining: crate trained\n\nEmail for questions: aimiablepetcare@aol.com\n\nAdoption fee $150 in state\n\nTo ensure we're meeting both pet and adopters' needs, we ask potential adopters to complete an Adoption Application ( www.bit.ly/DH-Adoption ) for caretakers to review. Once approved, we will bring the adoptable pet to your home for a preliminary visit. We are 100% donation funded; unless otherwise noted above, please expect a minimal adoption fee of $250 to cover each pet's basic vetting.",

            "description": "Greetings!  My name is Beth (HWTH#20251A).  I am a Belgian Shepherd mix, born on 5/19/2019, and I weigh 59 lbs.  I came to Halfway to Home after I was found as a stray dragging my leash in Lake Los Angeles.  My people did not claim me so I am ready for a new forever home!  The nice people at Halfway to Home are just getting to know me.  I am a very friendly girl.   Belgian Shepherds are similar in personality and behavior to German Shepherds.  We require a combination of lots of physical activity, mental stimulation, and socialization to be happy.  I need a large tall-fenced yard (not chain-link because I am a climber) for play and at least 2 longs walks a day. Other outdoor activities such as jogging or hiking would be a bonus!   Obedience training is essential to channel my mental energy in a productive way and make sure I behave appropriately.   I have not had much training yet so my new owner needs to be patient and disciplined to help me become the loyal and trusting companion that you want me to be. I love to be around people so I need to be included as part of the family.  I do not know yet how well I would do with children, other dogs or cats.  I shed a lot, and regular brushing is important to keep my skin and coat healthy.   So what do you think, would you like to meet me?  If you would like more information about me, please call Sandy at 661-824-4495 (it is a landline phone).  I look forward to seeing you soon!!",

            "description": "To make a family perfect, on Showtime or beyond!\n\nHullo hullo! My name is Ian and I am the good-looker from the 'Shameless' crew rescued from Mexico! I am a lil pupper, all of 7 months old and a German Shepherd mix. I have been a good boi at my foster home and learning good bathroom habits. I am fully house and leash trained. Not to brag, I am a smartie and getting hang of some commands! I have been fixed!\n\nI recently was diagnosed with megaesophagus. It's not a biggie, but I need to eat in an upright/seated position because my esophagus doesn't work properly, and I need one medicine for life. I readily take my meds with a cheesy snack. I have been feeding from a raised platform by myself now and I have been doing good! From needing to be fed by hands, I have moved on to eat like a good boy from the platform. As long as I take my prescribed medicines regularly, I am all good!\n\nLike the broody teen on the show, I am figuring life out. but I pepper it with a bunch of curiosity. I was on the shy side when I come across new people, and kids, but I am growing up to be a friendly guy, with all the politeness of a perfect doggo. Also, I love to play and that definitely helps! I now know the magic of Kong toys and playing tug on rope toys. Like I said earlier, I have the smarts and I have the playful energy. Once I am all done, I will snooze off by myself in my bed or the crate. I do need naps so that I am well-rested and not cranky. I may steal your spot on the couch, but I am cute to get away with it! I definitely am evolving to be more social and if the dogs and people are looking friendly, I am a happy chappy! I am pretty good with older kiddos too!\n\nMy foster fam claims that I am a super handsome, smart and independent fella and any family would be lucky to have me! I would need Puppy 101 lessons to be the best grown-up boy! As long as I have love and attention, I will be good. An experienced dog owner will certainly be great! My adoption fee is $400 and that includes spaying/neutering, shots, and microchip.

In his former home, he reportedly did very well with a small Chihuahua friend and was housebroken. When meeting other dogs in PACC playgroup, he didn't pay much attention to the other pooches. Phoenix sits quietly in his kennel and doesn't complain, but is really struggling with life in the shelter. He enjoys going out for walks with his volunteer friends, but urgently needs to find a real home. He has a goofy personality and loves tasty snacks like chicken. Phoenix needs to meet any resident pets before going home to make sure it's a good fit, and may do best in a home without young children. Ask about Phoenix today- this big boy is not cut out for life in the shelter!",

Much like the lead character in the musical, Wicked is a bit misunderstood (in part because of his size- he's a big guy!) and has faced some obstacles in his life (most recently, coming to PACC) but he's not letting it get him down and he knows that the best is yet to come for him. Volunteers say he's been a very sweet and social boy since coming to PACC, he enjoys running and playing in the yards and will give you his BEST sit and a paw (and be ready for that force of that paw!). Wicked is one of the biggest pupperoni's we have seen here in a while and he is wicked strong. He will need a strong person to handle him on his walks and to teach him some leash manners. Wicked has mixed notes with other dogs here at PACC and in his last home so he might be best as your one and only or would need an intro to any other pets in the house. I mean, he is a LOT of doghow much more could you need? His previous owner says he is housebroken and enjoys snoozing on the couch. Wicked is a sweet fella who just wants to get out of the shelter and into a home. Do you have some room in your home and heart for a big lovebug?",

This tiny little lady came to us in early October when her mom went into palliative care.  Bella is very outgoing and loves to be on the move checking things out. She does not show her age.  She's in overall great health.  She takes two meds a day for a heart murmur which cost about $30 per month.  She is heartworm negative and her blood work is excellent.  Because of her small size she would be best suited for a home with no small children or large dogs.  She does well with other dogs. Bella is also learning about going potty outside. She will use pads but will still have accidents on occasion.  \n\nA fenced yard and home visit are REQUIRED to adopt. \n\nFor more information email swampypaws4@yahoo.com\n\nWe are looking for a home within a 50 mile radius of Denham Springs.",

This little lady came to us in early October when her mom went into palliative care.  She is a little shy at first but bonds quickly to people.  She does not show her age.  She's in overall great health.  She takes one pill a day for a very slightly enlarged heart and cough suppressant as needed.  She is heartworm negative and her blood work is excellent.  Because of her small size she would be best suited for a home with no small children or large dogs.  Her current foster homes has two small dogs and she is ok with them but sometimes can be a little bossy.  Gwen is also learning about going potty outside. She will use pads but will still have accidents on occasion.  \n\nA fenced yard and home visit are REQUIRED to adopt. \n\nFor more information email swampypaws4@yahoo.com\n\nWe are looking for a home within a 50 mile radius of Denham Springs",

Mostly he'd like to be with you to watch some Golden Girls or whatever you youngins are watching these days! Work from home? He'll be a great supervisor! \nHe's a 10yr old terrier mix that's earned some love & quiet time. (He doesn't care much for the half-pints. They make him nervous all up in his lawn. Much prefers older companions.) Will you be his comfy buddy?",

When Kali arrive, although initially frightened, she let me take her out of the crate, and in a few moments, she came and lay next to me and seemed to say Thank You for rescuing her.\n\nKali is very sensitive and intuitive. \"She reads the room\" and seems to pick up on people's emotions and intent.. Kali will need experienced, gentle, understanding adopters who will give her a little time to settle. Perhaps retired or work from home folks who will have time for her. Talking sweetly to Kali goes a long way and she can hear in your voice if you are a good person. I do not know if she is leash trained, but she is smart, and with wearing a leash and harness inside for a few days, taking her out in the yard to start and training her should be fairly easy.\n\nKali is on a Human grade and Raw food diet. she is approx 8 pounds overweight, so that's like 50 extra pounds on what should be a 100-pound person. She needs help to get her trimmed down for her health and longevity. Rompin Paws will educate her adopter(s) in canine and species-specific feeding.\n\nKali has a 595.00 adoption fee. All monies are recycled to save more dogs.\n\nTo fill out an application to adopt Please use this link, You will need a computer to complete as cell phones will drop the application\n\nhttp://rompinpawsrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms/\n\nThe site will ask you to create a password and will send you an email. For ease of use, just use the password they create for you and save that password. This will ensure you have access and can fill out the application.",

She is healthy, spayed, up to date on her shots, recently had her teeth cleaned and is ready for her Forever Home. Her current momma is 92 years old, has fallen ill and cannot care for her beloved Lola anymore. Lola is in Torrance. For mor info please contact Bruce (609) 635-9054.\n",

This 2 year old, brindle Cane Corso has had a rough road where she has been bounced around and not treated the best historically, but BDHP is here to make sure she finds the stability and right family who can give her her happily ever after that she deserves. While she does suffer from slight incontinence from being spayed too young, it is well managed with taking Proin 2 x day and she is completely house trained if she takes her meds. Maggie is also crate trained, leash trained and knows come, sit, shake, free, and get out. She is a typical teen who still likes to play and chew, is a big fan of tug toys and bones, but she is also game to chill and watch a good TV program to relax. True to her breed, she is leery of strangers and will require a strong leader who is familiar with the importance of rules, boundaries and management to set her up for success. She gives very clear body signals when she is uncomfortable with a situation and just needs someone who will pay attention and not push her beyond what she can handle. Once Maggie knows she can trust you she is as loving and loyal as they get! She will make a wonderful companion for a more quiet household and does fine with older kids and larger dogs overall. She does occasionally resource guard high value items, but it is easy to feed separately and save these items for when she is alone. Maggie is incredibly smart, loves walks and playtime with other dogs, and can't wait to find her forever home.\n\nGiant Breed Experienced Homes Only.\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

The one thing wonderful about getting adopted is you can change that....Please change my name!\nI love to run in the yard and I'm pretty fast. I like jumping up into your lap and cuddling or just sitting on the couch next to you. I'd let you pet me, too. I like going for walks but could use some training because I don't get to do that a lot. I am housetrained and let you know when I need to go out. I know what \"off\" means if you don't want me on your bed or other furniture. I like treats, too.\n\nI like dogs but sometimes go overboard so would be best as an only dog in your house. I have enough love to keep you happy! I start out shy with new people but if they give me time, treats, or loving pets, I come around. I'm not sure if I would be good with small children as I haven't been around them lately and don't remember if I did in the past. I do have a touch of arthritis in my front legs, but that is to be expected given my age. I may not be a running companion, but I'll happy zoom around our fenced in back yard!\n\nLittle Bit's adoption fee is $250 and includes his neuter, microchip, current vaccinations and preventatives PLUS a free basic obedience course at Cedar Run Pet Boarding & Daycare in Hiawatha. Last Hope requires that all animals be kept as indoor pets only, be altered and current on vaccinations and preventatives. Our adoption process includes reference and vet checks, a home visit and a background check. Please submit an adoption application at www.Adopthope.org if you would like to meet Little Bit!",

            "description": "Phantom came to THS after being transferred from another shelter! Here is what the previous shelter had to say about Phantom!\n\nPhantom does very well in playgroups, loose and wiggly, stays to himself until other dogs greet him. \n\nHere at THS, Phantom was always a friendly face when our staff walked into the dog kennels. He loves nothing more than spending time with people and with dog friends! He has met multiple dogs that matched his energy level, and he had nothing but a good time with them! This special boy even knows how to sit on command! You can tell he wants to learn more skills and commands, he is always waiting for instructions! Phantom is still learning his manners and does not realize his size. Due to this, he can not go home with children under the age of 10 years old. \n\nPhantom has been treated for heartworm disease. THS requires all adopters of heartworm positive dogs to purchase a 1 year supply of heartworm preventative at the time of adoption.\n\nPhantom is currently residing in foster care! So far, his foster mom has said that Phantom is learning everyday! Fetch recently became a reality and is a big help to getting some energy out! He is doing better with playing with their dogs but still plays rough, which seems to be his favorite thing. He is developing an attachment to his family and loves to snuggle. Crate training is a little difficult, but he is the best copilot when his foster mom has to run errands!\n\n Please email foster@toledohumane.org if interested in adopting Phantom!",

Scroll thru description for preferred contact info!!\nAdditionally for CATS you may email latkinson@eulesstx.gov and for DOGS, email trinitygapclub@gmail.com\n\nHi my name is Zeke. I am about 6 months old at Thanksgiving time. My foster mom thinks I am part Great Dane and hound which makes me a very sweet boy. Since I am part Dane I will be a very big dog when I grow up and will need to be in a house with a 6-8 foot fence. That also means I will be a puppy for almost 2 years. My foster mom says I am calm for a puppy but still need some training. I am not fully house broken but will do my business when you take me outside. You will also need to keep your shoes and important items off the floor, as I still like to chew on things. When we had our first walk on a leash when I got to her house I did ok. Pulled a little bit, but I was really excited to be on a walk. I know how to sit. Another thing you need to know about me, as with most big dogs, we think we are all lap dogs. I really love to be around people and play with other dogs. My foster mom has 2 older dogs that get grumpy when I try to play with them. I would love to have a sibling to play with. I am looking for a family that will keep me forever. My previous owner moved from a house to an apartment and could not take me with them. I also go into a crate when my foster family is out of the house. Please contact my foster mom atmssquared@hotmail.comif you would like to talk to her about adopting me for life.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.One of the best-known blockbuster franchises in the Universe - from comic books to the big screen to new forever homes in Western New York! Pixie Mamas welcomes the X-Men!\n\nMama Mystique was found abandoned in the street, nursing her 2-week-old puppies. Our rescue partners in Texas scooped up these undercover super heroes and handed them over to us for safe keeping. Now that her super hero children have all found their forever homes, it is Mystique's turn. Mama Mystique faced danger, hunger, pain and fear - and protected her tiny children in those unsafe streets till she was rescued. Do you have what it takes to adopt a super hero? Do you have what it takes to love one of the X-Men?\n\nMystique is one of the most popular - and most beautiful - of the X-Men. She has been portrayed by such gorgeous actresses as Jennifer Lawrence and Rebecca Romijn. Her power is one of transformation. She can appear as anyone, at any time to best suit her needs of the moment.\n\nThis power is shared by our Mystique. She was a valiant warrior protecting her puppies in the streets until they were all rescued. She then morphed into a loving mother, teaching them all they need in order to survive and thrive in their forever homes. Mystique is currently starring as \"amazing and loving foster dog\" and is looking forward to her most important role- the part of a lifetime - in her forever home.\n\nMystique is a 2-year-old chihuahua mix. Her fur is a thick ivory color, with rusted-rose colored angel kisses on her forehead - the exact place where you kiss your children goodnight. She has peach blush ears and one single copper raindrop at the base of her short & stubby, squared-off tail. She has very soulful eyes, you can see the tough choices she had to make and the strength it took to make them staring back at you. Mystique loves to cuddle. She will reach out with a paw and boop you on the arm if you haven't been paying enough attention to her. She does not, however, love to be picked up and carried around. She will let you lift her up & move her from one place to another - like when she takes over the entire pillow and there is no room for your head. Or when she has settled into the absolute center of the blanket, trapping you against the mattress with no wiggle room. She seems very anxious and will begin to struggle when she is tightly contained in someone's arms. She wants to be with her people, but she doesn't want to be restrained by her people.\n\nMystique will guard her home - and bark to warn you of anyone in the vicinity. She will make her point, then settle back. There is no random barking chorus with her, no constant yips just for attention. She will say her piece and expects her people to listen the first time. She is wary of new people - everyone has to prove themselves trustworthy with her. You earn your place in her heart. She seems to be extra cautious around meneven if you have been in the house visiting for hours, if you are a man who doesn't live there & you move to go to the bathroom or kitchen, she will bark all over again. Once she is familiar with you, it is no longer an issue and she will put her high-alert level street smarts back under cover.\n\nHer foster mama works, so she uses potty pads during the day. It is clear she would rather potty outside, but she uses them. She has a fenced yard at her foster mom's house, but is doing well with a leash & harness. Mystique is a climber, so her fence will have to be stockade or vinyl fencing. Homes with a chain-link fence cannot be considered, as she will put her dainty little toes into those holes and be up and out of the yard in a few minutes if the spirit moved her.\n\nShe plays well with the other dogs in her foster home, but she is always first in line for cuddles - pushing her brothers & sisters out the way to be noticed and recognized. This most likely comes from the hand-to-mouth street existence she had as a single mom with mouths to feed. She does have moments of melancholy since her children have all been adopted. Like every good mother out there, the needs of the kids come first. Now that her children are all provided for, her time of struggle should be over. It is now time for her wish to come true - the dream of her own forever home.\n\nMystique is spayed, up to date with vaccines, microchipped, flea/worm treated and tested neg. for heartworm. Her adoption fee is $400 1/31/21 1:27 PM",

He has been bounced around a few times in his short life and will need a stable FUREVER home.  This handsome boy is a little picky when it comes to his doggie friends so a meet and greet would be required.\nIf you are interested in meeting him please call the shelter (520) 458-4151 to schedule an appointment.\n",

            "description": "HEATON: 1 year old, 34lbs, Lab Mix, Neutered Male NEEDS HOME OUTSIDE OF THE CITY \n\nRaise your hand if you could use an uplifting transformation story. So... all of you. Weird. Heaton joined us in October. He grew up in a nasty hoarding situation in rural Tennessee and barely had any human contact until he arrived in New York. Horns, cement, leashes, hands it was almost too much for a terrified country baby to survive, but hes resilient. Right from the beginning, this gentle little (only 36 lbs) 1-year-old flat coated retriever mix wanted to trust. It took him a while and some hotdogs to even consider coming out of his shell, but hes nearly done a 180. He barely moved and didnt blink, now he plays and cuddles. He needs an experienced, patient, grownups only home in the burbs, and hed be happiest with a fenced yard and a doggy sibling. Intrested in adopting? Please go to www.socialteesnyc.org \n\nHis Foster Mom Says: Heaton has come such a long way since I first began fostering him. When I first picked him up, it took him a long time to decompress and start to get adjusted. He wasnt interested in food, human affection, or really anything for that matter, and he was super skittish at any and all noises. Fast forward 3 months and he is a completely different dog. He loves to run around in a backyard or on the beach, and loves chasing other dogs! He now takes treats from my hands and knows some simple commands. He is also starting to desire human affection and will always be where I am and sitting in a position where he can touch me. He loves playing right when he wakes up with his chew toys, and has such a funny personality, and is the best napper I know. Heaton is such a sweet, gentle soul, and a patient family in the suburbs will be the best fit for him! I believe having another dog will really help him come out of his shell and show him the way.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This animal is not at the Social Tees office all of our dogs and cats are in foster homes while they wait to find their forever families. :) If youd like to apply to adopt this pet, please complete an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org. Because we are a small team and receive hundreds of applications each week, we are unable to respond to every application and every inquiry email, but we do our best. Please have patience! If your application is approved, you will for sure hear from us. If you have questions, please take a look at the Adoption and Fostering FAQs etc. on our website as all common questions are answered there. Thank you for your understanding and flexibility as we work to save these innocent lives!! \n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT US: socialteesnyc.org; Instagram via @socialteesnyc; Facebook.com/socialteesanimalrescue",

            "description": "Dora is estimated to be around five years old but don't let her age fool you, she acts more like a two-year-old pup who is living her best life :)  Dora came to us from a breeding farm. From her very first heat cycle as a pup, she was forced to breed and deliver puppies for profit, litter after litter. We can only imagine what her life was like before but she is not looking back now. She craves human companionship and will follow you around to get pets and love. She is so excited to be with you that she jumps up to give kisses. We are helping her to learn to sit and take a treat nicely, she loves positive reinforcement and is learning quickly! She is a sweet girl and is ready to be in a home of her own. She does well seeing other dogs and may be able to live with a laid back male companion. Because of Dora's past neglect, she had to have her bottom two canine teeth removed but that doesn't slow her down one bit and she feels so much better now. If you are interested in learning more about Dora, contact us today!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering this dog, please contact CHAAMP at CHAAMPapplication@gmail.com for an application. You may also complete an application online thru our web site, www.CHAAMP.org\n\nCHAAMP accepts applications ONLY from Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington DC. The information on your application will help CHAAMP determine which of our dogs is a good match for you and your family, based upon your lifestyle, other pets, etc. A home visit is required prior to all adoptions. Many of our dogs are fostered in private homes and cannot be visited until you have been approved for adoption. \n\nADOPTION FEES\n~Adult dogs, the fee is $275.00  \n~Older dogs (eight years old or over) the adoption fee is $100.00 \n~Puppies between 6 months and 1 year are $350.00 \n~Puppies under 6 months old are $375.00 \n\nAll dogs are microchipped, spayed, and neutered and up to date on vaccines. These fees help us cover these costs.  The rates are higher for puppies because they require more visits to the vet and shots. \n\nCHAAMP IS NOT A SHELTER. We are volunteers over a 7-state area dedicated to helping Malamutes in our rescue area. You can read more about Malamutes and about CHAAMP by visiting www.CHAAMP.org",

I just finished my heartworm treatment and I am ready to play! I love other dogs and always want to make friends. Sometimes I'm a little too excited and vocal when I meet new friends, but I know they all secretly want to be my best friend. I'll need someone to make sure I don't play too hard because I miss dogs' cues often and have trouble listening when I'm excited. I really need to run around at the dog park every day if I don't live with other dogs who can tire me out. When I'm inside, you might find me staring out the window at all the action I think I'm missing, or munching on one of many toys because I LOVE to chew. Once I'm tired out, I am the biggest snugglebug (lapdog alert!), and I always want to make sure you know how much I love rubs. And my crocodile, but mostly rubs.\n\nEven though I seem ready for anything, I'm slower to warm up and developed a stronger bond with one of my foster parents than the other. I'll need someone patient to help me know that wearing a sweater and trimming my nails won't hurt me. Sometimes I get scared and snap when I feel afraid, or when I'm eating. I can also be unsure meeting new people when they want to come into my home. I would do best in a home without small children.\nI'm kennel trained, I'm getting better at 'drop,' and tugging on my leash. I also love to pounce on bushes and see what I scare up! I'm generally a goofy sweetheart who loves life. I'm highly treat motivated, and I would definitely benefit from obedience classes. With a patient, loving home, I will be an absolute joy full of love to give!\n\n*Elijah recently went through heartworm treatment*\n\nHere is a great article explaining what heartworm is and how it's treated: https://www.heartwormsociety.org/pet-owner-resources/heartworm-basics\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal.\n\nAll Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs).\n\nRuff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue. Animals are located in homes throughout Minnesota. We do not have a facility where animals are kept.\n\nRuff Start Rescue Adoption Policies: http://www.ruffstartrescue.org/info/display?PageID=11744",

            "description": "Name: Wyatt\nSex: Male\nBreed: Lab Mix\nDOB: August 2018\nWeight: 60lb\nAdoptable in MA, CT and NH\n\nWyatt is a social, playful two-year-old boy who comes to us originally from Tennessee! He was found in a barn with his mother, Whitney, and sister, Willow. Wyatt loves people and will be absolutely thrilled to see any of them! He loves to go to the state park for a quick jump in the pond. He is an excellent car rider and will let you fashion him to a seat belt so he can ride in style! Wyatt also loves the vet and will be a star whenever he goes due to his love for anyone he meets. He's a sweet, loving dog!\n\nWyatt has lived with older children and done well, but may jump on the little ones and any strangers he's excited to see. While Wyatt has resided with other animals, he is looking for a pet-free home at this time, as he holds his toys, home and food near and dear to his heart! Wyatt will thrive in a high-energy home with lots of mental stimulation and things to do. He'll love any chance you give him for exercise, so he's a great running buddy!\n\nWyatt has been crate-trained and quite enjoys spending time in his little den, and will likely benefit from being crated during times someone cannot be home, as he does tend to have wandering paws when he gets bored! He is completely housebroken. He knows his basic commands of come, sit, stay, paw, other paw, down, and up. He absolutely loves to learn, play, and just generally be a dog! If you're looking for a sweet, loving, high-energy dog, Wyatt would be a great addition to your pet-free home.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please fill out an application at survivortails.org or email adoptions@survivortails.org with any questions.",

I get so excited to go for a walk, sometimes I'll even run to the door to get my harness on, just not for long distances anymore. I'm more a stop and smell the roses kind of guy. Squirrels are the enemy and don't worry, I will always let you know if there is one near!! I like to stop and say hello to fellow K9 friends when out walking but my play style is more into taking naps together than rough housing! \n\n\nI do love to snuggle and I'm known in certain circles as a \"couch potato. If you like to take road trips... I'm your guy! I LOVE car rides. I'm a healthy senior guy with a touch of arthritis, so a home with minimal stairs would be a good fit for me. I do fine in elevators though! I'm a handsome, loving companion who would prefer to be the only animal in your home, unless they're as chill as me. I really hope I don't have to wait too long to find that special someone to share my golden years with. Are you in the market for a snuggly lazy-bones to love on? I'm waiting to meet you!\n\n\nNote from foster:\nCat compatibility is questionable- he loves to chase squirrels, which are in a similar category\nHe'd do best in a home without small children as I'm a little ornery at times \n\nEst. Birthdate: 12/11/2008\n\nIf it's love at first sight, head over to the ALIVE website and fill out an application today! https://www.aliverescue.org/adoption-application",

            "description": "Jack and Jill are a BONDED PAIR, meaning we are only adopting them out together.  They came to us together and appear to be life-mates.  They were found together after their previous owner dumped them in a park.  Passersby were feeding them hotdogs and they survived on that and garbage for about a month before someone notified us about them.  We agreed to rescue them, and when they were caught, it turned out that Jill was pregnant!  Shortly after rescuing the pair, Jill delivered 3 healthy puppies that look just like her, so we aren't sure if Jack was the father or not.  Since we could not adopt Jill out until after the pups were weaned, we got more time to see Jack and Jill together and realized they are indeed inseparable and love each other very much.\n\nJack is the white one, and we really have NO idea what breed mix he is, so we took a guess.  But we make no guarantees and could be very wrong!  What we do know is, he is believed to be under 2 years old, and weighs about 15 lbs. and is full grown.  Jack is described by his foster mom ans very sweet and cuddly, but a bit skittish. She is working on teaching him some commands (he knows none), but it scares him.   Jack is mostly housebroken, but will have accidents in the house.  He is a runner and will need a secure fenced yard.  Also, due to his size, he is at risk from birds of prey so he can NEVER be left alone outside unattended.  Jack walks okay on a leash, but not great and will need work on this.  Jack is very quiet and currently does not bark, not even when someone comes to the door.\n\nJack is fully vetted, heartworm negative, on heartworm and flea prevention, is neutered, and microchipped, and has received a clean bill of health.\n\nJill's foster mom says Jill is also very sweet, though not as cuddly as Jack. She is fully housebroken and does not have accidents in the house.  Jill is also a runner and will need to be secured outside with a leash or securely fenced yard. \n She also cannot be left alone outside as she also weighs under 20 lbs and is full grown.  She is estimated to be about the same age as Jack, under 2 years old.  Jill does not like being on a leash and needs to be walked with a harness. Jill is also quiet, but will bark at the foxes in the farm behind the foster's house.  She does not bark at the door.  Jill also lacks basic commands.\n\nJill's puppies are grown and were adopted, and she has been spayed, heartworm tested negative, on heartworm and flea/tick prevention, and fully vetted and microchipped.  She also received a clean bill of health.\n\nBoth Jack and Jill like to sleep under the covers.  A blanket over them is fine.  They are not chewers of furniture, etc., but will dig in the yard if you have moles. \n Foster mom says, \"OMG, will they dig for moles.\"  This is definitely a terrier trait and cannot really be trained out of them.  However, leaving them alone outside puts them at risk for being snatched by birds of prey, so that will be minimized if they are attended to at all times when outdoors.  Though bonded, when they are asleep, they don\u2019t like the other in their space and will growl.  They have not had any fights though.  They are a very sweet pair, but will need lots of love and some training and socialization.\n\nAdopters must understand that Jack and Jill are ONLY adoptable together, and the adoption fee shown is for BOTH dogs, not individually.  Interested adopters please email MJsAnimalSanctuary@gmail.com to request an adoption application and ask any questions you have.  Older versions of our adoption application you may find online somewhere WILL NOT be accepted, because you will miss important adoption information if you do not email requesting the application.  Phone calls about adoption inquiries WILL NOT be returned, we handled all inquiries via email only.  Prospective adopters are subject to reference check, vet reference, home visit(s), and meet and greet(s) with all human and furry family members living in the home.  Adoption fee is $700 for both Jack and Jill.",

            "description": "Jack and Jill are a BONDED PAIR, meaning we are only adopting them out together.  They came to us together and appear to be life-mates.  They were found together after their previous owner dumped them in a park.  Passersby were feeding them hotdogs and they survived on that and garbage for about a month before someone notified us about them.  We agreed to rescue them, and when they were caught, it turned out that Jill was pregnant!  Shortly after rescuing the pair, Jill delivered 3 healthy puppies that look just like her, so we aren't sure if Jack was the father or not.  Since we could not adopt Jill out until after the pups were weaned, we got more time to see Jack and Jill together and realized they are indeed inseparable and love each other very much.\n\nJack is the white one, and we really have NO idea what breed mix he is, so we took a guess.  But we make no guarantees and could be very wrong!  What we do know is, he is believed to be under 2 years old, and weighs about 15 lbs. and is full grown.  Jack is described by his foster mom ans very sweet and cuddly, but a bit skittish. She is working on teaching him some commands (he knows none), but it scares him.   Jack is mostly housebroken, but will have accidents in the house.  He is a runner and will need a secure fenced yard.  Also, due to his size, he is at risk from birds of prey so he can NEVER be left alone outside unattended.  Jack walks okay on a leash, but not great and will need work on this.  Jack is very quiet and currently does not bark, not even when someone comes to the door.\n\nJack is fully vetted, heartworm negative, on heartworm and flea prevention, is neutered, and microchipped, and has received a clean bill of health.\n\nSince Jack and Jill MUST be adopted together, we will now tell you a little about Jill!\n\n\nJill's foster mom says Jill is also very sweet, though not as cuddly as Jack. She is fully housebroken and does not have accidents in the house.  Jill is also a runner and will need to be secured outside with a leash or securely fenced yard. \n She also cannot be left alone outside as she also weighs under 20 lbs and is full grown.  She is estimated to be about the same age as Jack, under 2 years old.  Jill does not like being on a leash and needs to be walked with a harness. Jill is also quiet, but will bark at the foxes in the farm behind the foster's house.  She does not bark at the door.  Jill also lacks basic commands.\n\nJill's puppies are grown and were adopted, and she has been spayed, heartworm tested negative, on heartworm and flea/tick prevention, and fully vetted and microchipped.  She also received a clean bill of health.\n\nBoth Jack and Jill like to sleep under the covers.  A blanket over them is fine.  They are not chewers of furniture, etc., but will dig in the yard if you have moles. \n Foster mom says, \"OMG, will they dig for moles.\"  This is definitely a terrier trait and cannot really be trained out of them.  However, leaving them alone outside puts them at risk for being snatched by birds of prey, so that will be minimized if they are attended to at all times when outdoors.  Though bonded, when they are asleep, they don\u2019t like the other in their space and will growl.  They have not had any fights though.  They are a very sweet pair, but will need lots of love and some training and socialization.\n\nAdopters must understand that Jack and Jill are ONLY adoptable together, and the adoption fee shown is for BOTH dogs, not individually.  Interested adopters please email MJsAnimalSanctuary@gmail.com to request an adoption application and ask any questions you have.  Older versions of our adoption application you may find online somewhere WILL NOT be accepted, because you will miss important adoption information if you do not email requesting the application.  Phone calls about adoption inquiries WILL NOT be returned, we handled all inquiries via email only.  Prospective adopters are subject to reference check, vet reference, home visit(s), and meet and greet(s) with all human and furry family members living in the home.  Adoption fee is $700 for both Jack and Jill.",

He likes people and is excellent with all dogs. Gucci has lots of energy, still quite puppy-like, so he definitely needs a fenced yard where he can run and play. He would love to be part of your pack!\n\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\n\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\n\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\n\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\n\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\n\nPlease \"like\" our\nFacebook Page\nfor the most current events and new dogs.\n\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

She is now spayed and ready to lead a life of her own.\nMiskit LOVES: car trips, toys, people, and belly rubs. She enjoys walks and has good leash manners. She will be your co pilot on life's journeys.\nMiskit is full of love to share, She's sweet, loyal and rarely barks. And she is an excellent snuggler!\nShe's very strong. She should have a strong adult walk her, because a random squirrel can send her galloping down the road.\nMostly happy inside, Miskit doesn't seem to mind being kept in the laundry room when you're not home. She's gentle in the house, with no indication of being destructive. Her happy place is on the couch, close by your side.\nIt is reported that she is not good with cats so we are looking for a cat free home. She has shown no aggression toward dogs, but we are looking for a home where she would get a lot of one on one.\n\nFor the fastest response, please submit an Application so we can help you with a good dog match. Thanks for considering giving a rescue dog a second chance at happiness in a loving home. If a dog is still posted on our website - the dog is still available for adoption. Yolo SPCA is based in Davis, California (near Sacramento). All our dogs are in foster homes (an advantage to adopters because we know the dogs). We do not have a shelter to visit. Because of coronavirus health advisories, our adoption events on Saturdays at Petco are on hold. But, if you submit an application we will arrange for you to meet dogs you are interested in that would be a good match. Our goal is to make the best match possible for the dog and for the human/s. Having our dogs live in foster homes gives us the opportunity to learn about each dog's personality and behavior. We give you as much information as we have about each dog based on our observations or information we've received. We rarely know with certainty the breed or age of our rescue dogs. If you are interested in any of our dogs, please fill out an application at https://form.jotform.com/52017002013129/. Use just one application for any/all of our dogs you are interested in, or instead of the name of one dog, put multiple names or \"not sure\" on the application. Information on your application helps us know your situation so we can work with you to make a great dog-human match. Our dogs are not adopted on a first-come-first served basis. We are trying to make the best match possible. Yolo SPCA dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, heart worm tested, current on vaccinations, and are being treated with heartworm prevention and flea prevention. Our adoption fees are $175 for each adult dog, $200 for each puppy age 6 months to 1 year old, and $250 for each puppy under 6 months of age. If you have questions, please e-mail (dogs@yolospca.org), and we will do our best to answer your email within 24 to 48 business hours.

We aren't sure about cats but think she may be fine w them. Kids are ok as long as they are older. She is very unsure. She simply needs a home where she will feel loved and a part of.

Chevy is also a volunteer favorite and very hard not to spoil. \n\nChevy is anxious and fearful. He takes medication but what he really needs is a home where his person will let him take his time opening up. He will need a crate to relax in but once he warms up, he will be a couch sitting, Netflix binging champion. \n\nChevy is house broken if he has a fenced in yard. Kind of like those people who don't like to go to public bathrooms- they'd rather do their business at home. \n\nChevy would do best with a single person, with no children. This person would have to be open to the required training that would help him adjust to his new home. Chevy really responds well to training games with jerky treats. \n\nChevy is an amazing dog who hasn't been given the time to decompress and see what home life is all about. He deserves a home with a person who will make him feel safe and loved. In return, he will be the sweetest, goofiest, most grateful pup!",

He is the most skiddish of the three that came in, and takes the longest to warm up to us. Bubba just wasn't socialized up to this point so he doesn't realize that other humans, animals, new places, etc. are not going to hurt him. We are working to get him out of his shell, but it is taking some more time with him. Bubba is rather unsure about our treats and attention yet, but he is starting to come around to the fact that we're not so bad. Due to him being in quarantine for vaccinations, we have not had the chance to introduce him to other animals, but he does not seem to mind our clinic cats that we have. Once Bubba warms up to you, he's going to want to be with you all the time, you will become his comfort zone and will be able to show him that life isn't so bad. He needs someone who will be patient with him and let him do things at his own pace. Bubba is up to date on vaccines and will be neutered before leaving. If you would like to be Bubba's forever home please contact us at pcanimalshelter@live.com or 308-352-2630.",

            "description": "Stella: She is a great girl. She enjoys sleeping on her bed and blanket. She sometimes snores. Jen the dog groomer reported that Stella was a good girl for her bath and manicure. Stella did so well when given her heartworm and flea prevention as well. She is a bit of a queen when it comes to her food. I found using 2cups dry and a half a cup canned food will work. Also, the food and water need to be placed in close proximity where she will sleep. She loves female humans better than male. When there is much stimulus, she will shake a bit and become very observant and would like to be somewhere quieter. She has had zero accidence in the house and enjoys the outside. She is very loyal, protective and loving to the one who treats her the best and the longest. I believe she will do that with any female forever home. She can stay alone in the house for 8 hours and you will never need to worry about anything being destroyed. She doesn't do treats, toys or fetch however, she will play with you. She likes pets, belly rubs and butt scratches. She does not mind cats at all if the cat likes her. She will cower to a cat who is dominant. She did not do well at the shelter. Stella has been a blessing to watch bloom into a girl's best friend. Finding her forever home is essential.",

            "description": "$100 of adoption fee Sponsored$100 of Freckles adoption fee is Sponsored. Freckles should change her name to George Lopez because she is the definition of a \"low rider.\" All jokes aside, this girl is SUCH a cutie. She has the shortest legs and has quite a bit of junk in the trunk and we couldn't love her any more than we do. Freckles is a momma dog who came to us from Arkansas, where she was in an animal control facility who was running out of space to keep her. They reached out to us to see if we could welcome her and her litter of puppies, and of course we said yes! Freckles is a very sweet girl with all people and would likely be great with kids based off of her sweet and loving personality.\n\nFreckles did not test well with cats, so a home without them is a must! She tested well with a submissive male dog, but once sharing attention was on the table, she became very reactive, so a home where she is the only pet may be the best \"forever\" fit for this little butterball turkey.\n\nFreckles is 3 years old. Her adoption fee is $185, and she is spayed, microchipped and current on all vaccines. Apply online for Freckles today!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please go to our website at www.partnersforpetsil.org and fill out an online application.\n\nAdoptions are held at the O'Fallon, IL PetSmart every Saturday of the month from 11am-3:30pm and at the Glen Carbon, IL PetSmart every Sunday from 11am-3:30pm. We are also at Petco in Edwardsville Crossing on Sundays from 11:30-3:30 pm. The cats are only at Glen Carbon Petsmart. Please let us know if you are interested in a pet and we can arrange to have them meet you at one of the adoption events.",

Poor Hank was so terrified of everything that hIs first six months here were spent curled up under my desk.  Hank still does not like loud noises but he sleeps with the rest of the pack, runs around and wants to play and has the biggest smile ever when he sees his humans in the morning.  We are not sure how old Hank is but is too young to spend his days in our doggie nursing home.  It's time for Hank to find a family that will bring him the rest of the way out of his shell.  \n\n",

Owner had Autumn since she was a puppy but didn't socialize her (so important to do early on), so Autumn doesn't know how to act w/other dogs. She is not dog-friendly or cat-friendly. Training can help w/the dog-friendly part (possibly cats, too, but may be best to not be both a cat-lover and dog-lover).\n\nAutumn is beautiful with her mesmerizing green eyes and sleek fawn coat. She is housebroken and like many large dogs, she thinks she's a small one in that she'll love to sit on your lap! She loves being w/her person. She walks well on a leash but if other dogs are around, she may pull hard. Training is a must w/Autumn so she can get socialized and not be afraid of other dogs. She is crate trained and often sleeps in her crate w/the door open.\n\nShe is HW negative, spayed, microchipped, current on all vaccinations and ready for her new home with NO OTHER DOGS/CATS.\n\nAUTUMN\n\nMETRO ATLANTA ONLY\n\nPlease contact\n\npassionforanimals5017@gmail.com\n\nif interested",

I am 2 years old and 22 pounds.\nAs the story goes, I was left behind when my so called owners moved away. Which, when thinking about it, was probably a good thing as they never cared for my health. I am now with Houston Animal Rescue Team - HART and ready for a new start!\nLike mentioned, I wasn't cared for and I am heartworm positive. I am too young and too kind for that illness! I will go through fast kill treatment after I finish a month of antibiotics.\nIn the meantime I am looking for a foster or adopter who will see me through my treatment. I am very good with other dogs, very sweet with people, calm and well mannered.\nIf will be neutered on December 1st and ready to go to a home the day after. If you believe you can help me, please fill out an application on https://www.hartrescue.com/adoption-foster-application-form\nThank you,\nJoeyTo meet me, please fill out an adoption application on https://www.hartrescue.com/adoption-process",

Beauty is still young so she needs to work on her manners. Because of her size and strength, it can be hard to contain her energy. Due to this, she will need to be placed into a home that is willing to continue to work with her. Beauty also does NOT do well with other animals so she is not able to go to a home with another pet. She is spayed and UTD on all vaccines.If you are interested in learning more about this pet, call the Montgomery County, Virginia, Animal Care and Adoption Center at 540-382-5795.",

This means I have a parasite and need treatment. While my friends at HSNBA desperately want to help me, the shelter is too stressful an environment to undertake treatment and treatment itself is very expensive. The shelter has a few options to help with treatment, and if I steal your heart you should talk with them and your vet about what my treatment is like. For more information on heartworms, please visit the American Heartworm Society here https://www.heartwormsociety.org/pet-owner-resources/heartworm-basicsHSNBA lists all animals online from the moment of intake, and our listings are updated automatically every midnight. Some of these animals may not be available for adoption at this moment, but you can always call the shelter at 830-629-5287 for clarification on the adoption process or the animal's current status.",

            "description": "Cletus here, looking for my future FURever home, you see Cletus isn't perfect for everyone, but for someone, perfection he is! This 3 year old was surrendered for being naughty with his teenage human sisters boyfriends and pinching them on the butt, never broke skin nor was it aggressive, more behavioral. He would then run away down the hallway quite satisfied with himself. We will be needing a very specific home that can work on further training Cletus also needs someone who will be sure to keep him and their guests happily separated and safe until there is a comfort zone established. Cletus is a BIG BOY! According to the previous owner he has lived with other dogs and cats, but has been unsuccessful in doggie meet and greets while in our care. Cletus has been neutered, microchipped, 4DX tested and is up to date on vaccines. The Humane Society of Warren County is running by appointment only with approved applications. If you are interested in adopting, the first step is submitting an application which can be found on our shelter website.

I love to run so much that my adopter will require a fenced in yard. I know a lot of tricks that I will gladly show you in exchange for some treats. I LOVE treats, YUM! I can sit, shake, sit up, catch and roll over! I love all humans and I get along with other dogs too. I like to play with my toys and I really love getting my belly rubbed.

His owner simply couldn't care for him anymore. (Please no negative comments as this was very hard on the owner). With the help of many caring people, we were able to save him from the shelter. He is doing well with his foster (who is new to fostering). Bandit LOVES playing with toys. He also loves tug of war with ropes and fetching balls. His best home would be with an individual, couple, or family who has plenty of time for him. He definitely loves interaction with people. He wants to please and make his humans happy. \n\nHe had to learn to walk on a leash in addition to go up stairs. It only took him a few times as soon as he saw it pleased his foster.\n\nBandit is current on his vaccinations and is heartworm negative. He has an appt to be neutered and microchipped soon. \n\nBandit's best fit would be a home where he is the only pet. He doesn't do well with other dogs. And although we haven't had him around cats, we wouldn't recommend them either. \n\nIf you feel as though Bandit would be a good fit for you and your family, please complete the following Adoption agreement. He is a great dog who deserves a loving family.\n\nAdoption Application Link:  \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJcO2I9-K8FMjB9CNflX9xbOpIRjc0gyxzYtdkRn6zPluovw/viewform",

            "description": "Have you met Carlton?\n\n9-year-old Mikey and his brother Carlton were rescued from Barstow Humane Society in June by Holly's Garden Rescue and then transferred to us on November 19th for help in socializing them. While they were in the care of Holly's Garden Rescue, Mikey and Carlton were examined by a vet, and both had dental surgery. Both boys weighs 8 lbs.\n\nWhen Mikey (folded ears) and Carlton (pointy ears) first came to FFF, they were terrified with a capital T! We had them drag leashes in the play yard so we could catch them and double leashed them when bringing them out on walks just in case. We sent them out on a two-week Frosted Fling which turned into a foster, and wow, these boys have come a long way!\n\nMikey and Carlton lived with another small dog and a cat and got along well with everyone! They seem to be potty pad trained, but their Flingers are working on getting them to potty outside. It's clear that the boys haven't spent much time on leash, so the first step was getting them used to being leashed. Now that they are more comfortable, their Fling Fam is able to walk them out to the yard for potty breaks. Mikey and Carlton are big foodies and can easily be won over with food. Roasted chicken is a favorite of the boys and their Flingers use it to get the boys more comfortable to new things. Mikey is the more confident of the two. He settled in more quickly and will follow his Flingers and settle in next to them on the couch. Carlton follows his brother's lead, but is much more reserved. He has taken his time to get used to his Fling Fam, but is still timid and prefers to spend time in his safe crate when he gets overwhelmed.\n\nTheir Fling Fam told us, \"Mikey is definitely the more confident one and Carlton takes his lead. They now hang out on the couch more than their crate! Treats have played a big part in starting to get these guys more comfortable on a leash. For the most part I take them outside for potty breaks, but if they need to go they will use the wee wee pad by the door. They do the cutest little dances when it is time to eat!\n\nMikey and Carlton will need a very patient family. These guys have come a long way, but they still have a way to go in order to be their happiest selves. Apply to bring them home at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees, and we help with medical costs!\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated 1/5/21 KG",

            "description": "Pet Name:  Miles * PS \nBreed(s): Cane Corso \nColor(s):  Black\nGender: Male \nEst. Age: 4-5 yrs old \nEst Weight: over 100 pounds \nEnergy Level: Moderate \n\nApartment:  No \nHouse trained: Yes \nCrate trained: Yes\nMicrochipped: Yes \nSpay / Neutered: Yes \nCurrent Vaccinations: Yes \nTraining: Working on obedience, has good house manners \nDog-friendly: Yes \nCat-friendly: No \nKid-friendly: Yes\n\nMiles has a story. We do not know what this big guy has been through, but we know it was rough.  Miles showed up at our property at 4 am in 27 degrees. Very emaciated, cold, covered in cactus, scared, confused, and face swollen with infection.  He could not smell right because of his swollen face or see out of his left eye. Thankfully our dogs let us know he was sitting at the gate asking for help! \n\nWe immediately opened the gate, and then he slowly & cautiously came in. It took about an hour for him to trust us enough to come inside the house. Once he arrived in warmed up & had a bit of food, he allowed us to remove all the cactus he had in his body & legs. Given Sub Q fluids to get him through until we could get him to our vet the next morning. \n\nAfter seeing our vet, who loves this big adorable guy, he was prescribed antibiotics for 10 days & sub Q fluids for 4 days. He only weighed 96 pounds. Heartbreaking, this magnificent dog was beaten down and mistreated terribly. \nWhile we have no idea who dumped this big loving boy, we know he went through abusive treatment and starved. He had looked like he had been through a dogfight, because of the injuries & swelling to his face, but definitely starved.  \nEven though this big guy went through this horrible treatment, he is very loving & forgiving. \n\nMiles is doing better in just a little over 2 weeks. His energy is up. He is holding weight & still gaining what he needs to become a healthy dog. \n\nHe enjoys being with the other dogs daily & just lounging around the house. \n\nHe does very well with other nondominant, properly trained, and socialized dogs of all sizes. We did find out that, unfortunately for cats, they do seem to be on his menu. No cats with this big guy. \nBecause of his condition, Miles has been traveling with us everywhere we go. This is more than most new dogs we take in. His horrible condition is only because of neglect & abuse. He has been going with us to do donation pick-ups & our fundraisers. H LOVES car rides, and he is well behaved too. \n\nMiles is looking for a family that has experience owning mastiff breeds. \n\nCane Corso's are a very different & special breed. They are loyal protectors of their families. And like Miles, some love to cuddle & are very affectionate with humans. \n\nMiles is on the right path now. If you are looking for a big loving dog to join in on family adventure and fun, or cuddle with at night while watching a movie, Miles might be your guy! \n\nWe would love for someone whose lifestyle can work with Mile's needs and healing to bring him home while still getting healthy.  \nPerfect bonding time for Miles & the family.\nOnce the vet medically clears him, we will neuter him, he will be a foster to adopt agreement. \n\nAdoption donation fee and home inspection required. \nApplication for adopting and fostering -   https://form.jotform.com/201328449376157\n\nThank you, \nDharma DOG Movement\nAwareness | Advocacy | Saving Lives\n\nIf you have any questions about fostering or adopting, please contact Dharma Dog Movement directly at adopt@dharmadogmovement.org\n\n11/2020\n\n\n",

I was born in mid-August, so I'm still just a puppy with lots of energy and have lots of growing to do, so will need a fully privacy fenced yard in which to run and play (no apartment life for me). I get along great with other dogs and love children. I am still in puppy school, but am so close to earning my degrees in house training and kennel training. I have worked hard on my L\"Sits\", and have mastered that command with flying colors, and am also working on learning all sorts of other useful things. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I rest my case on why I am the perfect new addition for your family!\n\n\nI am currently enrolled in the Pups 4 Parole training program, learning all of the things I need to know to make me a great family member. I need someone willing to keep up my training so that I don't forget everything I am learning.\n\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

            "description": "Have you met Carlton?\n\n9-year-old Carlton and his brother Mikey were rescued from Barstow Humane Society in June by Holly's Garden Rescue and then transferred to us on November 19th for help in socializing them. While they were in the care of Holly's Garden Rescue, Mikey and Carlton were examined by a vet, and both had dental surgery. Both boys weighs 8 lbs\n\nWhen Mikey (folded ears) and Carlton (pointy ears) first came to FFF, they were terrified with a capital T! We had them drag leashes in the play yard so we could catch them and double leashed them when bringing them out on walks just in case. We sent them out on a two-week Frosted Fling which turned into a foster and wow, these boys have come a long way!\n\nMikey and Carlton lived with another small dog and a cat and got along well with everyone! They seem to be potty pad trained, but their Flingers are working on getting them to potty outside. It's clear that the boys haven't spent much time on leash, so the first step was getting them used to being leashed. Now that they are more comfortable, their Fling Fam is able to walk them out to the yard for potty breaks. Mikey and Carlton are big foodies and can easily be won over with food. Roasted chicken is a favorite of the boys and their Flingers use it to get the boys more comfortable to new things. Mikey is the more confident of the two. He settled in more quickly and will follow his Flingers and settle in next to them on the couch. Carlton follows his brother's lead, but is much more reserved. He has taken his time to get used to his Fling Fam, but is still timid and prefers to spend time in his safe crate when he gets overwhelmed.\n\nTheir Fling Fam told us, \"Mikey is definitely the more confident one and Carlton takes his lead. They now hang out on the couch more than their crate! Treats have played a big part in starting to get these guys more comfortable on a leash. For the most part I take them outside for potty breaks, but if they need to go they will use the wee wee pad by the door. They do the cutest little dances when it is time to eat!\n\nMikey and Carlton will need a very patient family. These guys have come a long way, but they still have a way to go in order to be their happiest selves. Apply to bring them home at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees, and we help with medical costs!\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated 1/5/21 KG",

It's not his fault that he's all alone. His owner has been separated from him due to personal circumstances and he's been left alone except for those visits when his owner comes to feed him. I'm not here to judge only to try to help his owner find him a new home. \n\nHis owner tells me that Taco is a loving boy and has never shown any type of aggression towards a human. He keeping him company for the time being, but he isn't fond of other dogs  in general. He's a dog that will bond to a human in a one pet household, he being the only pet. \n\nHe's not a very active fellow, quite laid back. He's 8 years of age and at his stage of life is quite happy as a couch potato, though he also might enjoy walks. This is a complimentary listing for this dog in hopes that he will have a chance to live out the remainder of his life in a loving home. If that might happen to be you, please email me with a few details about yourself and I will put you in touch with Taco's owners.",

He could benefit from some continued leash training. He knows how to sit for treats, takes them gently. He is VERY treat motivated and is easy to train new commands.\n\nRandall deserves a home of his own. A home where he is the only dog and doesn't have to compete for attention with any children. He just wants all the attention to himself. If you like to play fetch and tug-o-war, then Randall is the guy for you. After some play time, he would love nothing more than to curl up next to you for a nap. He is a little skittish of loud noises and can be startled easily. He barks when meeting someone new, but he quickly warms up to them especially if they play with him. And if you come bearing treats, he will gently take them from you and shower you with love.\n\nDo you want to run, walk, or hike with Randall? Then, he is the perfect pup for you!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Randall, please visit our website for our application www.underdogaz.com",

He would love to do daily runs or go on lots of hiking adventures! He is a Flashy Beautiful boy, but his coat comes with a lot of work. \n\nHe is a wooly coat, meaning it is thicker & longer than the average standard Siberian coat. \n\nNiko is a social butterfly that has been getting along with almost every dog he meets! And he adores cats. He gets a little excited & tries to mount, so he must be introduced appropriately & corrected to avoid this behavior. We are currently working on this daily as he hangs out with about 10 other dogs of all sizes here at our rescue. \n\nWe do not recommend dog parks. Although a social butterfly, Niko still has to work on boundaries & manners with other dogs. Niko prefers and needs colder weather. He insists on sleeping outside at night when it is the coldest.

Konan's  early demeanor with us communicates quiet reserve, caution, and surveillance \u2013 all attributes needed to assess his environment properly. Konan is seeking a calm and experienced adult home. He tends to keep to himself and observe, and needs time to get to know new people. With time and training and bonding, Konan will become more secure and reveal more of himself. He just needs his person to continue to help him build trust and cement  the connections he so richly deserves. Konan seems more uneasy with men (he can bark at men he doesn't know), so proper introductions are required, and will only solidify his faith in himself and his forever family. He is okay around other dogs at the rescue, mostly just observing and  keeping to himself. Konan is a classically handsome Shepherd just waiting for his forever person to unlock all his mightiness.\n No cats please!\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website!

I already know sit and shake and am ready to learn anything you want to teach me! I love to go for a walk, and am pretty good on a leash (getting better daily!). I am eager to please and am good with other dogs I have met. I am too interested in kitties, but a home with medium to large dogs sounds great! I am ready to find an active forever family who will love me for my beauty and brains!  I really am a very, very nice boy. \n\nADOPTION FEE: $200 (All MVPC dogs are heartworm-tested, completely vetted, spayed/neutered, microchipped, crate-trained and house-trained)\n\nA $100 hold fee is required for approved applications and will be applied to the full adoption fee at the time of the home visit. \nADOPTER: Dog experience\nBIRTHDAY: Estimated 1 year\nFENCE: Required (an electric fence is not an acceptable form of containment)\nDOGS: Yes\nCATS: No\nCHILDREN: Yes, 5 and over simply because I am big and strong.\n\nINQUIRIES: ALL inquiries begin with a submitted adoption application, which is found on our website, www.miamivalleypitcrew.com. We do not adopt to individuals under the age of 25. We prefer male/female dog pairings unless both already reside in the home. \n\nDO NOT: USE THE PETFINDER CONTACT/ADOPT BUTTONS--we are unable to monitor those and you will not receive a response. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: We are volunteer based and a home visit is required; we have a two-hour adoption radius from Kettering, OH for our adult dogs and 75 miles for our puppies. Exceptions for our ADULT dogs only, though rare, may be made on a case-by-case basis but we must be able to do a home visit. Thank you for your understanding!\n\nProfessional holiday and Valentine\u2019s Day pictures courtesy of the talented Gwen Estep Photography, LLC https://www.facebook.com/GwenEstepPhotography/\n\n",

            "description": "Animal Profile:\nConan is an estimated 3 year old 63 lb German Shepherd Dog who joined us from California on September 13th. We will post more information as we get to know him.\n\nSeattle Foster Update: Conan is settling in well. He's a young, energetic dog who loves to play but has also learned an off switch inside the home. Conan is non-reactive to other dogs on leash and has been in previous homes with other dogs but he really prefers to be the main center of attention and we would like to place him in a home without other dogs. Conan is house trained and crate trained and has made incredible improvements on leash and no longer pulls. It takes him a little to warm up so slow introductions will be beneficial but once he's used to you, he's a total love bug and is becoming more and more friendly with the neighbors and less wary of strangers.\n\nWe are looking at placing Conan in an active home familiar with his breed, some patience, and willingness to continue to work with him. We recommend a home without small children and a yard to run in. While he has been in a home with a cat, he did chase the cat so we are looking for a cat free home.\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $500, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, and heartworm test. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue. Apply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org",

            "description": "Gender: Male\nBreed/s: Pit Bull Mix\nApproximate Age: 3 yrs\nApproximate Weight/Size: Approx. 65lbs\nGood with: People,  Dogs but not cats\nNot tested with: Hobbits and Ninjas\nFully Vaccinated: Yes\nNeutered: Yes\nMicrochipped: Yes\nHouse Trained: Yes\nCrate/Kennel Trained: Yes\nImportant Notes: Stray Rescue\n\nChance came to WTWTA Rescue after we were notified about a stray pitbull dragging a 20 ft chain up and down the country side. Thank fully those good samaritans didn\u2019t just watch the dog suffer they jumped in and start working with this pup to get him to trust them by feeding him. Food is love right!?\n\nThey started calling him Chance after the name of the pitbull pup in homeward bound movie who had a very similar eye patch. Chance was at first a little untrusting of humans but these folks have turn things around for him. He does amazing with other dogs and small children. He lives with his foster family who has both. He likes car rides and knows several commands, sit, down, up and even hugs\u2026.\n\nChance had been running around loose for awhile, left to suffer on a chain by his neglectful past owner, he was once a visitor at the Augusta shelter. They released him back to the owner who then just tied him up again. The owner since disappeared leaving Chance on a chain to suffer and starve. But his spirit still had some fight left in him and he broke the chain free and ran to find a place where he could be loved. \n\nChance will need a patient and loving owner who will understand his rough past and go slow with him to ensure he knows he can trust them. But once that trust is built, this boy loves hard and he is faithful beyond words.\n\nAs big as he is, he is just a sweet lapdog who loves snuggling on top of his person and watching tv and talking about all the cool things he saw outside for the day. \n\n\nIf you are interested in Chance, please make a note in your adoption application\n\nwww.wherethewildthingsarerescue.com\nAdoption Fee is $300",

Shelter policy and 2018 Indiana state law decrees all animals must be spayed or neutered prior to leaving the shelter.\n\nOur shelter is open to the public on Monday- Saturday from 8:00 am -5:00 pm EST with the exception of Wednesdays on which we typically open by 1:00 pm. If you would like to make an appointment to meet one of our many adoptable animals, please send an email to us at pvchs@joink.com. To apply to adopt, you may download an adoption application from the Applications and Fees tab on our website. The web address is www.pvchs.org. Please email the completed application to pvchs@joink.com.\n",

He is very sweet once he gets to know his female person, but may be initially distant and fearful due to his lack of human contact in his former home.\n\nHe would do best in a calm home with no men and no children he is fearful of both.\n\nDamon does great with other dogs, and seems fine with cats. He would probably be okay as an only dog if his person is home with him, otherwise, another canine companion in the home would be best. He does very well with potty training, and if kept on a schedule, will continue to excel.",

He wanted his own home, his own yard, and to be snuggling on his couch at the end of the day with his people. He's a homebody and would love to find an active human senior as a roommate.

She is very friendly and loving, especially during bath time! She is pretty mellow, and can't walk super long distances, but she is the perfect companion dog. She is picky about her dog friends (and wouldn't do well with cats), but loves people, especially men. She loves car rides and snuggles. Can you find some room in your home and heart for this special lady? Alice would prefer to find a home with children over 10 years old as she likes her space and gets defensive when the tiny ones invade her space.\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

Cats over 1 year are $35.00, kittens under 1 year old are $60.00. Dog adoption fees include a microchip. Cats can be microchipped by request for an additional $5.00.\n\nThe adoption fee includes the animal's surgery, vaccinations, flea preventative, deworming medication, sample bag of food/treat samples and a free first exam with participating veterinarians. Shelter policy and 2018 Indiana state law decrees all animals must be spayed or neutered prior to leaving the shelter.\n\nOur shelter is open to the public on Monday- Saturday from 8:00 am -5:00 pm EST with the exception of Wednesdays on which we typically open by 1:00 pm. If you would like to make an appointment to meet one of our many adoptable animals, please send an email to us at pvchs@joink.com.

            "description": "Bunny\u2019s owners  neglected her and then refused to pick her up at the shelter where she was turned in as a stray.  While Bunny was shaking in fear at the shelter, she quickly acclimated to her foster home where she feels safe and is fostered with other dogs. We know her prior owner had children and while in foster, she has welcomed affection from visiting children.   Bunny\u2019s foster says she\u2019s super friendly and snuggly, and is very quiet and doesn\u2019t bark much and is doing great with the other dogs, but she gets along best with calm dogs.  Bunny does needs to be fed in a separate area from other dogs, as she has shown some food guarding behavior  (a little growling when the food is put).  She enjoys snatching house slippers and running around the house with them.  She likes to be right next to you or in the same room and loves tossing and playing with toys, and will always jump up to greet you. She loves to lick your ankles and calves when she's following you around,  and she loves to rest her head on your heart.\n\nWhile she can be mouthy when playing or hyper excited, she does not bite hard. She also gets excited licking her human and licks will escalate to big, toothy opened mouth kisses but she is gentle. Bunny can be territorial of her human's lap when other dogs come around, so she needs an adopter who will reinforce the boundaries her foster is setting. Bunny is mostly potty trained but does have a habit of pooping on shaggy bathroom rugs, but not on regular carpeting. Bunny was forced to live outside her whole life, so a little confusion is to be expected.   \n\nPoor Bunny has heartworms and we are treating her skin issue (not contagious).  Both of these conditions come from being neglected so we are grateful that she is now in our care so she can receive medical treatment.  Bunny\u2019s fur is already growing back and she can continue her Heartworm Treatment in her adopter\u2019s home, which is sponsored by New Hope Animal Rescue. \n\nBunny \nFemale \nChihuahua mix \nAge 2 \n10lbs\n\nDue to the high volume of emails we receive, if you are seriously interested in Bunny, the best first step is completing our adoption application.  You then will be offered an opportunity to speak to her foster to get to know her in more detail and if you think it's a good fit, we would arrange a meet and greet. \n \nhttps://nhanimalrescue.org/adoption-information/\n",

This little guy is around 2-3 years old, and was surrendered to a rural shelter to be euthanized as his owner did not want to deal with his Infrequent seizures.  Luckily, the shelter staff thought they could do better and immediately posted him and sent out emails, which is where we stepped in.  Heelers are a director favorite!\n\nFrancis is good with kids over eight (due to breed herding instincts) and other dogs.  He\u2019d prefer maybe just one or two playmates, not a houseful.  He\u2019s great on car rides, end enjoys walks and playing ball.\n\nWe are looking for someone comfortable with handling and medicating Francis should he have a seizure, ideally within easy driving range of Guardian Vet in Brewster, NY.  \n\nPlease use our fillable app to apply to foster or foster to adopt here:  https://forms.gle/eqEChRtYMPshWYuX8",

We ask all potential adopters to complete our application and approval process first so we can discuss the dogs that fit your home. We usually have 25 - 35 dogs available and the ages range from less than year old to ten plus years old. Once we receive your application you'll be contacted by an adoption representative to complete the application process. We look forward to speaking with you about our wonderful hounds waiting for forever homes!!!",

He was found extremely under weight with an imbedded collar around his neck and chain wrapped tightly around his torso. He had a ripped ear and was missing fur (growing back!), which comes with being neglected and forced to live outside. Yet amazingly, Fozzie is the sweetest dog! Fozzie loves affection and loves being near his human. He loves other dogs and is learning how to to be around cats. He enjoys good chew toys and his foster says he\u2019s very smart and trainable. An owner with an active lifestyle who is down to snuggle would be ideal for Fozzie. The foster describes his energy level as moderate to high.  Fozzie is a big, lovable puppy and will need someone who is willing to invest time to train him but his foster is working on some basic commands.  He is adjusting to sleeping in his crate at night.  While he\u2019s only 45lbs right now, he is under weight. \n\nFozzie \nMale \nShepherd Mix/Yellow Lab Mix \n1 1/2 years \n45 lbs\n\nDue to the high volume of emails we receive, if you are seriously interested in Fozzie, the best first step is completing our adoption application.  You then will be offered an opportunity to speak to his foster to get to know him in more detail and if you like what you hear, we would arrange a meet and greet.  \n\nhttps://nhanimalrescue.org/adoption-information/\n",

Gizmo, like most cattle dogs, learns fast with positive reinforcement training and is willing to work for both treats and toys (specifically tennis balls and squeaky toys, which he will go nuts for!). He's high energy, which means he could be great at herding, agility and obedience by himself, or as a hiking buddy. Gizmo needs an active owner with no children who has the time to research how to redirect his ankle nipping onto an appropriate object if you can't take him out to herd. Once Gizmo bonds with you, he will be your best friend. All adoptions are by appointment only most purebred pets have a waiting list so please call the shelter at 863-324-5227 to set up your appointment. The shelter is open Tuesday-Saturday 10:30-6 closed 1-2 for lunch.",

Since we got him we have learned that he is not good with children and has a lot of energy and enjoys being outside to play and exercise. Winston is learning basic manners like sit, walk on a leash and crate training. He also needs to be in a home with adults, no animals and no children. All dog adoptions are by appointment only, most purebred pets have a waiting list so please call the shelter at 863-324-5227 to set up your appointment. The shelter is open Tuesday Saturday 10:30-6 closed 1-2 for lunch.",

            "description": "$125 of adoption fee sponsoredIf Nixie were a fruit, why, she'd be a Georgia peach because this little girl is just as sweet as pie. She is roughly 4 years old, 55 pounds of pure, unconditional love. She just wants to be next to her person at all times. One quick look at her adorable pittie belly and you can tell Nixie has clearly mothered multiple litters of puppies. Her little triangle ears sit perched on top of her head in the cutest way imaginable. We don't know exactly what her life was like before finding her way to Partners for Pets, but we know for sure that her days of litter after litter are in the past and she can finally live her life as a loved family pet. Nixie would fit best in a home without cats. She is currently working on her socialization and how to be friends with other dogs, but for right now, she would fit best as an only dog. Her adoption fee is $195, which includes her spay, microchip and up-to-date vaccines! Wont you come meet her at the shelter? She's waiting for you!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please go to our website at www.partnersforpetsil.org and fill out an online application.\n\nAdoptions are held at the O'Fallon, IL PetSmart every Saturday of the month from 11am-3:30pm and at the Glen Carbon, IL PetSmart every Sunday from 11am-3:30pm. We are also at Petco in Edwardsville Crossing on Sundays from 11:30-3:30 pm. The cats are only at Glen Carbon Petsmart. Please let us know if you are interested in a pet and we can arrange to have them meet you at one of the adoption events.",

            "description": "I am Portia, I came from a puppy mill where my job for all 6 years of my life has been making babies. Unfortunately, that means all my calcium supply when not making the babies was making milk for the babies so there was not any left to keep my teeth healthy. I had my spay and dental when I came into rescue and ended up only getting to keep 1 tooth, all the rest were rotten or had already fallen out.\nI am learning from the other dogs in my foster home all about being a pet. I am learning to go outside to potty in the yard, that is some weird stuff that green stuff called grass. I am learning to get petted by humans and play with the other dogs.\nThe dog part is not so bad, but that human part is odd as well. I have never had much good interaction with humans. I will learn though and when I am ready to go to a home I for sure will need a buddy in the home of at least 1 other dog. I will also need a fenced in yard so I can run and play. After all I deserve that since I have been in a cage for 6 years.\nIf you think I might be a dog you are interested in when I am ready, let us know and we can figure out a way to meet up and check each other out.\n\n\nAll of our dogs are current on vaccinations which include Rabies and Distemper/Parvo, they are spayed and or neutered, have been fecal tested and heartworm tested, and had a dental cleaning if necessary. They are all on heartworm and flea/tick preventative as needed in rescue.\n\nThe adoption process is an application, a vet reference, a home inspection, and a lifetime contract. The requested adoption donation for all of our dogs is $300.\n\nWe do not REQUIRE a fenced in yard (some dogs do not require a fence, as long as they can walk well on harness and leash. This is decided by what is best for each dog individually.) \n\nWe are willing to adopt out-of-state applicants but you must travel to the Omaha area to meet and travel home with your dog. We do not transport or ship dogs. \n\nIf you are interested in adding this beautiful baby to your loving family, please visit our website and fill out an adoption application at http://www.nebraskadachshundrescue.org/adoptapp.htm \nThe Adoption fee is $300.\n\n",

            "description": "*Would not be a good fit for an apartment.\nWhiskey came to The Animal Care Society with a couple of other dogs after they were found abandoned on someone's property. We don't know much about Whiskey's past, but we do know his future is bright! He appears to get along with other dogs but we are unsure about cats. At the moment, Whiskey does have a tendency to mark his territory indoors, but we are hoping that after he is neutered, that behavior will stop. We do know that he can jump quite high, so a tall fence will be required for his future home unless his adopters are planning to leash walk him at all times. Whiskey is a very playful pup and would like to find a family that can provide him with an active lifestyle. If Whiskey sounds like the right fit for you, head over to our website at www.animalcaresociety.org to apply today! \\\\\\ WHISKEY IS SPONSORED BY OUR FRIENDS AT OLDFATHER LAW FIRM THRU MAY 2021! /// WHISKEY IS SPONSORED BY OUR FRIEND ANN HODAPP-MOREHOUSE IN HONOR OF JIM LEVAGGI THRU MARCH 2021!\n Primary Color: Blonde Age: 2yrs 2mths 3wks Animal has been Neutered I am available for adoption at the Animal Care Society.",

Being old is not a \u201cdisease\u201d and Victoria proves this with her spunky energy every day.  She\u2019s 15 years young and certainly does not act 15! She enjoys snuggling on the couch and can jump on and off the couch herself just fine. Victoria is a sweet girl that still has so much love to give. Please consider opening your heart and home to our sweet \u201cgolden girl\u201d.   \n\nVictoria \nFemale \nYorkie \n7 lbs \n\nDue to the high volume of emails we receive, if you are seriously interested in Victoria, the best first step is completing our adoption application.  You then will be offered an opportunity to speak to her foster to get to know her in more detail and if you think it's a good fit, we would arrange a meet and greet.  \nhttps://nhanimalrescue.org/adoption-information/",

            "description": "Hi! I'm Blue Bell. Thank you so much for stopping in to see me. I am a 5 year old pittie mix with my best years still ahead. They found me abandoned by some storage units over 2 years ago which was a very lucky day for me. I went into foster care where I was treated for heartworm, given lots of TLC. \nI am a bit of a chubby gal at 78 pounds but this is covid.... Who here hasn't gained a few? Am I right? My favorite thing is to play with the hose and catch the water in my mouth. I like kids but because I am so big it would be best if kids were 12 and over. I am house trained, crate trained, and leash trained. My foster dad will tell you that i am friendly, playful, and sweet. And, most of all, I love attention. I get along with other dogs but because of my size, my roughhousing can be a little too rough. It is probably best if I am the only dog. I also try to play with kitties but this is a David and Goliath situation and those kitties don't have stones so no kitties please.\nok. Time to get real with you. Nobody knows what happened to me before I was rescued. I am generally sweet and lovable with people but sometimes I get afraid around men. I try to act tough but really I'm just a scared little puppy. When I am frightened and acting out in fear, I need people to remember that i am a little dog at heart who doesn't know she's a big dog and that everyone should treat me gently. I'm a big girl but if you adopted me, I would be your baby. \nI have had my spay and I am up-to-date on vaccines. I am on heartworm preventative and flea& tick preventative. I am looking for a special family with love, and patience and that all important garden hose. If you have a hose and you need a dog to spray, consider me, Blue Bell! If you want to learn more about me and possibly adopt me, contact Alyson (include phone number) at alysonbrunelli@gmail.com and she will walk you through the adoption process. My adoption  fee is $325.\nLike us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/pawsclawsnewengland\n\nFollow/tag us on Instagram: @pawsclawsne or #pawsclawsne\n\n\n",

She had a single surprise baby, Elvis, who has now been adopted.  Momma Presley needs her FURever home now!  She can be nervous at first when meeting new people but she warms up quickly and LOVES to play with other dogs.  She is, however, an escape artist and can climb a 6' chain link or welded wire fence.  We are pretty sure a 6' privacy fence would be secure for her but she needs to be supervised!  She truly is a sweet hound dog that is longing for her FURever home that will let her sleep on the couch and have a furry playmate to keep her entertained.  Presley is fostered in the Huntsville, AL area.  If you are interested in adopting her please fill out a non-binding application at forrescue.net/dog-application",

            "description": "Precious Roxy has been in our Gwinnett Jail Dogs Program for several years, waiting patiently as other dogs get chosen every week and she is still left behind. We know her perfect family is out there. Please share this post and help us find them! \n\nEarlier this week, Roxy enjoyed a day away from the detention facility at our new SOHF Adoption Center. She loved being spoiled by our volunteers and clinic staff while she was there.  Roxy is a large Lab/Pit mix senior girl who is around 9 years old. She needs a home where she would be your one and only pet. She loves humans but she isn\u2019t a fan of other furry creatures. \n\nRoxy is such a sweet girl! She loves every person she comes into contact with and we don\u2019t want the jail to be her last place she calls home. Roxy does have some medical issues that are common to senior dogs that our vet staff keep a close eye on. We are happy to explain more to anyone seriously interested in providing Roxy a loving retirement home.\n\n*************************************************\n\nRoxy is a recruit in Operation Second Chance, also known as the Gwinnett Jaildog Program. This great program saves shelter dogs from euthanasia, placing them with inmates at the county jail who have been approved to train and nurture them so that they will be good pets in their permanent adoptive homes. The goal is for each dog to be leash trained, housebroken, and have knowledge of basic obedience commands. The dogs also receive some agility training.\n\nRoxy is fully vetted -- spayed/neutered, heartworm negative, and current on vaccinations and deworming.  The adoption fee is $250 (cash only, please).\n\nYou can apply to adopt by submitting an application at www.jaildogs.org. Someone will be in touch within 48 hours. You can check the status of your application by emailing jaildogs@gmail.com. \n\nGet more info about the Gwinnett Jaildog Program at www.jaildogs.org.",

M 57#- good with kids and all people- had issues getting along with other dog in the home so we will dog and cat test him at the shelter- he does have Addison disease and is well managed on medication daily medication and a shot given every 45 days. He's house and crate trained and does know some basic commands but will need brush up work with his new family. \nHe is currently in Fort Worth, TX but can make the trek to Olympia, WA scheduled to arrive on Saturday Dec 5th with a pre-adoption which is the only way to secure that he will for sure go home with you! Pre-Adoption means getting your app in, approved and paying the adoption fee to secure the ride.  His adoption fee is $395 which covers his neuter, vaccinations, HW testing, chipping, health certificate and transport fees. All our dogs come with a 30 day, money back, trial period to make sure they are the right fit in your environment. Tall Tails Rescue has a commitment to these dogs for their lifetime and we hope you do too!

The day we were both supposed to be dumped at the pound, a girl and her mother took us in for foster. Don\u2019t let my size intimidate you because I really am a big silly sweet guy who just wants someone to love. I will bark at strangers at first but get real friendly once I know they're okay. I love treats and food of all kinds, and hugs, tummy rubs and kisses make me so happy. I used to have a slight limp due to a ligament injury in my left hind leg but my foster mom gave me joint supplements and CBD, and I am so much better! I really do enjoy going on short walks. Most of the time, I just enjoy laying around or by your feet. I will sleep on a dog bed next to your bed, love you, protect you, and forever be loyal to you.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pooch, please download the Adoption Questionnaire (farescue.org/pdf_files/questionnaire_canine.pdf), fill it out and email it back to us at info@farescue.org or fax (310) 362-0321.

The vet said I had a spinal injury and my spine was badly bruised. They weren't sure I could walk again, but I started physical therapy and you should see me go! I still can't feel my legs but my spine remembers what to do. And I'm so happy about it! I love to play with friends, and can't wait to find my forever home.\n \n\n***\nPlease apply to foster or adopt online at www.corridorrescue.org\n\nDirect inquiries to: adopt@corridorrescue.org.\n\nThe adoption fee of $225 covers spay/neuter, microchip and current vaccines.\n\nTransport is available and can be discussed on an individual basis.\n\nThank you for considering a rescued former street dog for your next family member",

He came to SFAS as a transfer from a partner shelter. Now he is ready to find a loving family of his own. Here at the shelter, Joe has been happy to meet new people and enjoys receiving attention. He has done well with other dogs but if you currently have another dog at home feel free to let the scheduler know so that we can arrange for Joe to meet you dog. Joe's adoption fee is $130. He is neutered, microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. Interested in meeting Joe or being added to his waitlist, call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the DOG'S NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org. A scheduler will call you back within 48 hours to confirm your request. If you have other dogs at home, tell the scheduler you would like to bring them along for a Meet n' Greet. SFAS offers a variety of excellent training classes, seminars and Trainer Talks led by animal behavior professionals. These are half-price for animals adopted from any shelter or rescue group! Due to current COVID-19 restrictions, classes and talks are all presented virtually using Zoom. For course descriptions, schedules and registration, visit https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/group-training-classes/ for classes and https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/special-seminars-and-workshops/ for seminars and Trainer Talks.",

Was scrared when we just got her, but within a day got used to the new palce, loved EVERYTHING and was walking around wagging her tail.Good with dogs. Doesn't like to be grabbed by the collar, but relatively good on a leash, just concerned. She has to be always on a leash in unfenced area. She has a sad history - was dumped on the street when pregnant and saved by teenage boys who brought het to the shelter. Princess is a little too timid for an apartment setting or a family with small kids, and needs a fenced yard with 5-6' fence.\n\nAdoption fee $325 If interested please submit an adoption application at http://sannicoladogrescue.com/ContactUs.aspx.",

He has a crooked tail that must have been injured and never got medical care while he was a stray in Mexico. A trainer described him as having great \"street smarts but young and lacking real world experience.\"\n\nIf you are interested in adopting or finding more information about Bruno or our other dogs, please read about our adoption process and fill out the application at: www.westcoastboxerrescue.org/adopt\n\n** Please note: West Coast Boxer Rescue does not adopt female dogs to homes that already have a female dog.\n\nGet to know us:\n\nhttps://www.westcoastboxerrescue.org\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WestCoastBoxerRescue\n\nTwitter: @wcboxerrescue\n\nInstagram: wcbr.official\n\nPlease follow us on our Facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/WestCoastBoxerRescue.",

            "description": "I'm a 1 year old, 54 Lb, handsome red Husky. I'm a tall, lanky, goofy happy, affectionate guy who loves people and dogs alike. From my foster mom..\n\nHi my name is Banksy I am the bestess boy looking for my forever home. I have lots of love and cuddles and kisses to spare. I'm a young buck and love to learn new things. I'm told I pick up tricks & behaviors fast especially when hotdogs and cheese are involved!. I definitely love my walks and I'm good on leash. I'm medium energy in the house as long as I've had a couple good walks a day and some play time with my dogmates. I play well with the other dogs in the house,  I love my foster fur siblings. and would love to have a home with another young, playful dog to keep me company and show me the ropes. I'm a lap dog by the way, I'll just sit my fuzzy butt right down on you any chance I get but my favorite thing is to be with my people. I like to crawl into bed like a clumsy fawn to wake you up in the mornings cause I'm soooo excited by the new day ahead and all the things we are going to do together!. My tongue can barely fit in my mouth so it flops out the side often like the derp I am, it makes my foster mom giggle. I like to make her laugh. I have the cutest of extra toes on my back feetsies, for extra grip. I am fully housebroken, yay! Yeah I'm a smart boy.  those hotdogs are my favorite treats and I love all snacks especially frozen carrots and frozen yogurt kongs -nomnom. I guess I bring out the best in dogs. I was told the old lady pupper of the house who's 12 wouldn't play with me but I must have all the right moves because it's no problem getting her to play. I'm great in the car, would make a perfect running and hiking  buddy. I'm looking for an active home, someone who will put up with my big puppy ways and give me the love I'm craving. We are 100% volunteer run rescue and don't have the time to write everyone back so please take the time to fill out an application. We will get back if you seem like the right fit for Banksy. Thank you for understanding. https://www.welcomehomesanctuary.org/",

ORANGE\u2013 Dogs in the ORANGE category are commonly timid and will need some confidence building at first. Once dogs in the ORANGE category are comfortable, they will most likely be energetic and needing similar guidance to dogs that are in the YELLOW category. Dogs in the ORANGE category sometimes benefit from another confident canine in the home.\n\nDogs are assigned to color categories using any previous owner notes, general handling, as well as staff and volunteer observations. As we continue to get to know the dogs and gather further insights into their personalities, colors may be adjusted accordingly.\n\nRancho Coastal Humane Society remains temporarily closed to the general public, but we have companion animals in our care that are ready for adoption BY APPOINTMENT ONLY, and our staff is ready to make that happen! Please visit our website for updates and more information. Thank you for your interest. \n\nAdoption Hours: Monday-Sunday; 11 AM to 4:30 PM\n\nAddress: 389 Requeza Street, Encinitas, CA 92024",

She is just too obsessed with small animals. \n\nUpon returning to the Shelter, there is a possibility that Jessica Barker may have an Auto-Immune Disease called Evans Syndrome. She is only currently on medication that she may need for 6 months or for the rest of her life.\n\nWith her condition, sadly she will be overlooked time and time again because chronic issues can be pretty scary to some people. But she will repay your kindness with kiss, snuggles, and entertaining moments.\n\nSarah Jessica Barker is only a year old, filled with energy and ecstatic charm. She will get the zoomies if you run around the yard with her. Her only crutch personality wise will be she cannot be around small animals.\n\nThis holiday season, if you wish to give to someone, consider giving this sweetheart a forever home. It takes a community to make a difference. Let's start by changing her life forever.",

Please watch your spam folders as an application will be attached and this sometimes places it in there. \n\nHIS/HER adoption fee is $550 USD and that will pay for TRANSPORT, all his/her shots up to date, neutered/spayed, microchip and rabies.\n\nPlease e-mail MuttsAndMeows@Mail.com for an adoption application. \n\nThis dog is currently in the Houston Texas area.  Once the application is approved and adoption fee paid, transport will be arranged.\n\nBecause this adoption will be without meeting the dog first, we will need to try to be extra careful that everyone (including you) think this will be a good fit.  We will try to give you as much information about the dog as we can.  Unfortunately, many are fresh from the shelter and we don't know much about them yet. \n\nLike us on Facebook - search Mutts & Meows - and help even more pets find loving homes.",

            "description": "Welcome Tatum to CCPAL Rescue.  She is a 2.5-year-old American Bulldog mix is our best guess.  She may have some Pittie.  She wears a big smile on her face when she meets new people.  She looks to you for direction and loves being touched and cuddled.  She is a really sweet dog and could go to a family with children.  We think due to her enthusiasm they should be 10 or older.  She has bursts of energy and then is ready chill out and lay down.  She would be a great companion for a more active family.  A fenced yard would be nice.  She could do her exercising in the yard and then be ready to relax inside by your feet while you read.  She weighs about 50 pounds.  Looks like she has had some litters of puppies.  We will spay her and she will probably fill out in her body so her head matches with her body.  She is currently in Texas and can be adopted locally or we can work with one of the local transporters to get her to Washington, Portland, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Vermont or all along the East Coast.  Her adoption fee is 250 and transport is 185.   Rhode Island and Massachusetts are not states we adopt to because of the regulations imposed by these states. \n \nContact Marlene at 210-867-1769 or email to ccpalinquiries@gmail.com if you have questions.  Online applications at www.ccpal.info/  See her cute video!!",

Inquiries requesting additional information will not be returned, due to limited volunteers. Thank you for your understanding **** \n\nMeet Baloo.\n\nBaloo came to us from one of our local shelters, where he was on the euthanasia list. He is estimated to be about 2 years old and LOVES people. \n\nBaloo needs to be the only animal in the home but is 100% about people and loves with his whole heart.\n\nHe is not a dog park dog, but enjoys yard time with his human and walks/ runs as well! \n\nIf you are looking to add a dog to your family who is all about people, Baloo is the dog for you! \n\n****************************\n\nAll PETronus Rescue dogs receive basic vaccinations (distemper/parvo, bordetella, & rabies), spay/ neuter, and microchip prior to adoption. We also treat any know medical issues, including heartworms.\n\nOur dogs live in foster homes while they wait patiently for their forever families to find them. This is beneficial in that they learn house manners, crate training, housebreaking, etc while they wait and we are also able to get a very realistic picture of their energy level, temperament, etc so that we can place them in a home that is the best fit.\n\nOur adoption fees are $200 for dogs over 1 year of age and $250 for dogs under 1 year of age. Puppies receive 3 rounds of puppy vaccinations.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our amazing dogs, please fill out our adoption application here http://bit.do/PRAdoption and we will be in touch!",

Jacques also doesn\u2019t know know his size. He\u2019ll plow a small child over with love and kisses. He adores other dogs and absolutely needs another young playful dog and his forever home. We would also like to see him go to a home with a big yard to run around. Despite his stupid dopey face he\u2019s actually pretty active and would love a home that can take him on walks and hikes and all that good stuff.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website: www.phillybullyteam.com",

She has the reverse brindle coat and the light brown nose that is so pretty.  We think her breed is Plott Hound/Shepherd mix.  She loves everyone and all dogs.  Her best friend in the Rescue is Roxy.  She is very playful so another playful dog would be most fun for her or an active family.  She is outgoing and not shy.  She loves all people and is not suspicious of new people.  She considers everyone she meets a potential play and walk buddy.  Her best home would be with a fenced yard and an active family.  She can be only dog or with another playful dog.  She is healthy and up on her shots.  She was pulled off the euthanasia list by CCPAL.  She is now looking for her forever home.  She is in Texas and can be adopted locally or we can work with the transporters to deliver her to Washington, Portland, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Vermont or all along the East Coast.  Her adoption fee is 250 and transport is 185.  Rhode Island and Massachusetts are not states we adopt to because of the regulations imposed by these states.\n \nContact Marlene at 210-867-1769 or email to ccpalinquiries@gmail.com if you have questions.

Heidi is a very good family dog.  Loves people and children.  She is current on her vaccines, spayed, heartworm negative and weighs about 50 lbs. She is on no medications and she has no special needs.  She is grey and white in color with a long coat.  Once she is adopted, she will have to be started on heartworm medication.\nHeidi MUST have a high 6\u2019 fence because like all hardships, she can jump and run.  Is a house dog ONLY.  She gets along with her foster mom\u2019s cat.  But, if a cat is outside, she will chase it.  This is a very nice, loving dog.  Heidi would love to have a new home by Christmas so that she can bond with her new family and be a part of the Celebration.  For further information on Heidi, please call our office at 937-450-1227 and speak with Linda, our Vet Tech.\n",

His favorite thing is covering your face with sloppy kisses. At the Sanctuary, he lives alone, but he has spent time in a home with other dogs of all sizes and did very well. He even passed a small dog test at the Sanctuary. He cannot live with cats, however. Boyd was born in 2013. He can sometimes get overexcited, but he has made huge improvements since coming to the Sanctuary. If you're willing to take the time to get to know a great guy, Boyd would love to meet you.",

She is also crazy (but in the good kind of ways) crazy cute, crazy smart, crazy talented, crazy athletic and crazy amazing.\n\nDon't let her sweet face and shy smile fool you! This girl can jump 0-7 feet in nothing flat, she knows how to scale a chain link fence and her zoomies will make your head spin. She is amazingly athletic and if you are interested in harnessing a dog's physical prowess for sports or performance, she is your girl!\n\nOne of her favorite things is a drive-by belly rub, that is, if you are fast enough to reach down for it when she flips over at your feet for one split second. Have we used the word firecracker yet? Deep down Bella has an endless desire for fun and games, but because she is so agile and strong, this has led to her creating the game of I Escape-You Find Me! \n\nBella lived with a family in Oklahoma for the first year of her life but escaped from her yard so many times, the family agreed to hand her over to a rescue who contacted Search Dog. She has many of the qualities that we look for, especially her physical abilities, but her fun-loving nature overpowered her focus for work.\n\nBella really loves to run (and jump and play) so she will need someone that has the ability to offer her the time and space to get her ya ya's out. She would be a terrific athletic partner and a wonderful friend for running, hiking, and playing.\n\nThis girl loves everyone and everything, but would love to love you most of all!\n\nBella is just over one year old and weighs 50 pounds. She is spayed and up to date on her vaccinations.\n",

I was surrendered due to my family separating. I am pretty stressed here and would love to be back in a home ASAP! Despite my age, I am very high energy and I love to play. I love to play with toys and will jump high in the air to catch them. I would do best with kids over 8 years old since I tend to be a bit mouthy and unsure of some handling at times. I am a sweet girl and would love to snuggle up on a bed, chew a bone and hang with my new family. Is that with you? I hope so! I will need a home without cats. I was doing okay until the cat hissed at me. I thought it would be cool to bark back and get rowdy! But, it wasn\u2019t cause I am much bigger. I didn\u2019t mind the dog I met, sort of just paid him no mind. I am used to being the only dog as I was for the last 7 years, but might do well with a calm canine companion.",

He loves to cuddle and just hang out. Nero will be your bestest friend.  But this requires a very patient person who is willing to put in the time. If this is not you do not even contact us, don't waste our time, this great dog needs a great home with someone who will love him.\n\nNero loves butt scratches, will push it up against you even for just a little pat. Oh and when rubbing his chest or belly and you hit that perfect spot his leg moves a mile a minute. He likes to spend time on the couch and will snuggle up on your lap. Nero absolutely loves cat lasers and could chase them all day. He does play with toys mostly the ones with squeakers or balls.This guy loves quality soft treats, and knows the sound of the treat bag well. They are a best Friend maker with him for sure.\n\nNero is house broke, crate trained. He walks good on a leash but is collar sensitive. We are working on this. Nero is great with other dogs as long as they aren't pushy with him. No cats and no young kids. Teens are ok.\n\nNow that said Nero came to us scared to death and exhibiting fear aggression. After his arrival we soon discovered he likely suffered abuse at the hands of humans at some point. Needless to say life for Nero has not been great. It takes time for Nero to trust but once he does, once he opens up he is just marvelous.\n\nNero needs a calm, child and cat free home with a secure fence. He needs people who will let him come out of his shell on his own. A family who will love him and understand his needs. Nero needs another dog already in the home as this will help him open up and adjust. We consider Nero a project dog. He is the best kind of project as in the end you will find a best friend, a loving companion and the best addition to your family you could ask for.\n\nAdoption fee $300\n\nNero is neutered, UTD on da2lpp & rabies, de-wormed, heartworm tested, on flea/tick/heartworm prevention and microchipped.\n\nIf interested in Nero the first step is to submit an application at pinealoperescue.net/application",

The cats are trying really hard to show her they mean no harm as they go up and rub on her to her dismay! Sadie Mae is living with other overly confident Doberman to learn the ropes of living in a home. She is making great strides in her foster home. Sadie Mae will need a fenced yard as she could bolt for the hills if something scares her. She will also need a home with a patient master who is willing to help her overcome her fears, ad is able to socialize her safely to build her confidence. She may also benefit from having a confident canine pal and would love cats in her next home! Sadie Mae is fully vetted.",

            "description": "Is your dog needing a dog friend? If so, Ferlin is perfect. He is a 5 yr old Lab/hound mix. Ferlin feels at home with other dogs, he does not seek out affection from people. It has taken months for his foster mom to get Ferlin to feel safe with her touching him.\n\nFerlin finds safety in his crate so he easily will go in his crate. He is also potty trained if you keep on a schedule... accidents might happen if too far off schedule. Not sure about cats...if you have kids that will want to snuggle him, Ferlin is not the dog for your home. A fenced in yard is required for this boy.\n\nFerlin is a dogs dog. He loves to play and overall a very good boy...he just does not need love from his person. He follows his foster mom all over the yard when outside, he likes to be by her, just no petting please... \n\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm tested negative (age 7 months and older) and microchipped. We do not ship or transport. A dog's adoption donation is $200. There is a $5 fee for credit/debit cards.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please fill out an online application here: www.heartlandsmallanimalrescue.org/canine-application.html",

            "description": "Hi there,  my name is Tripp, I only have 3 legs so you know how I got my name. A while back,  I ended up at the animal shelter because my owners could no longer care for me. It was a scary place but now I realize it was the best thing as some really nice rescue people bailed me out. I am a young guy and even though I am missing a leg, I am active and would love to have a nice big fenced yard to run in. I get along well with other dogs but I am sometimes a little bossy so a fur sibling who is not dominant would be best. I am also ok to be an only dog and get all the attention.. I am housebroken and I don't mind spending time in the crate when no humans are home. Cats, they are ok as long as they don't run from me, that makes them fun to chase. I am also content to snuggle on the couch and hope to find a furever home that will let me do that. I don't remember how I lost my leg but it doesn't really matter, I am on to bigger and better things. I really love treats and will do almost anything for them so I am looking forward to getting lots of them and learning new things. I love going for car rides. I really want to be part of a family. I prefer a nice quiet home so one with no young kids would be best. \n\nA very generous donor has offered to pay for a cart for me to use when going on long walks and for when I am not as young and rambunctious as I am now so my cart will come with me. I can run and jump just like any normal dog and my foster mom treats me just like the dogs who have all their legs.\nMy foster mom says that everyone who meets me falls in love, you could be next......\n\nAll dogs are adopted out up-to-date on age appropriate vaccines. All dogs over 6 months of age are spayed and neutered prior to adoption. Puppies under 6 months of age are adopted out on spay/neuter contracts and must be fixed before 6 months of age.\nIf you are interested in meeting and possibly adopting this great dog, please email adopt.nolalabrescue@gmail.com to request an adoption application, complete (save it for your reference) and send to adopt.nolalabescue@gmail.com.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: We do not have a shelter where you can view our available dogs. All of our dogs live with foster families in private homes. You must complete an application and references will be checked by a volunteer before you can meet the dog. \n\nPlease visit our website: www.nolalabrescue.org to learn more about our adoption procedures.",

He loves to take walks and sniff around to his heart's content. He even walks like a true gentleman with his gentle leader! Plush squeaky toys are also some of his favorite things! Charleston is also a super smartie, and is eager to learn lots of tricks to help him be the best boy he can be in the home. He loves treats and already knows 'sit, 'down, 'shake, and is fully potty trained! He is making great progress on his crate training already should his future person choose to use one. While he would prefer to be the center of your world, he would be willing to discuss a well-matched doggie sibling and maybe even older human siblings. Charleston would thrive in a low traffic home that can help him adjust to home life with semi-active humans so he could stretch his long legs on walks. Come meet Charleston today to fall in love with this gentle giant and also follow his antics on Instagram @chocolate_factory_charleston.",

He spent a great deal of time on antibiotics and in the care of our vet, Irvine Pet Complex, and now is a happy and healthy little boy. He will continue to favor the paw and hold it up but he gets along fine. With everything he has been through he has trust issues and someone with patience and love will be best. He can nip if startled but once he trusts you he is a forever friend. He would not be good with children and will do best in a quiet home. If you would like more information please contact Erin at Muellenbergerin@gmail.com\n\n---\n\nCome meet our dogs Saturdays and Sundays at Petsmart in Costa Mesa from 11:30-2:30. All A Home 4 Ever Rescue dogs receive a wellness exam by our veterinarian and are up to date with vaccinations. They are spayed or neutered and microchipped before they go to their adoptive families.

They could be transported to Colorado for the right home!!!\n\nZayla and Tuxedo were found on a property where they were fending for themselves due to an unfortunate situation that had been going on for quite a while. A wonderful group of people made it their mission to save these 2 senior dogs along with several other animals that were left on the property, and they are now at a shelter waiting for a new home and family and happier days. \n\nTuxedo is the handsome 11 year old Chow-Shepherd mix with a wonderful personality. He is starving for attention and love, and will nudge at you to keep petting him if you stop. He will even try to get all of his 60 pounds up into your lap if you let him. He has some arthritis and could stand to lose a few pounds, but he couldn\u2019t be any sweeter!\n\nZayla is 14 years old and we think she is a Lab-Shepherd mix. She is the shyer of the 2, and looks to Tuxedo for reassurance and comfort. Zayla will warmup to people given time, patience and a gentle touch. If you crouch down and talk to her, her little tail will start going and you\u2019ll know you are winning her over. Her arthritis is pretty advanced so we are looking for a home where she doesn\u2019t have to navigate too many stairs. \n\nThis sweet old pair has been through thick and thin together, so we are trying to find them a loving home together where they can be spoiled and live out their retirement as cherished furry family members. We think they would do fine with other respectful dogs. We are partnering with Stray Hearts Animal Shelter - Taos, NM to find Zayla and Tuxedo the retirement home of their dreams. Finding a home for a senior bonded pair can be hard, so please help us spread the word so that we can help make it happen. And if you are interested potentially adopting this amazing duo please fill out our online adoption survey: https://www.olddogsnewdigs.com/adoption-survey/\nThanks!!!\n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior pets have a history of being kept up to date on vaccines, annual exams and recommended bloodwork. We also do home checks to make sure that your home environment meets the needs of the particular dog you are interested in.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adoption, please fill out our online adoption survey at https://www.olddogsnewdigs.com/adoption-survey/\n\n",

Before that, I wasn't treated very well and I was used as a breeding dog. Then when I couldn't have anymore puppies, they threw me away like a piece of trash. That hurt my feelings. Now MAR has me in a wonderful foster home where I can be calm and feel safe. Though my foster Dad loves me so much, he would be happy for me if I found my very own home. I might prefer to be the queen of my castle, or I might do okay with a well balanced larger male. Little dogs scare me, and I tend to bark at them. I like treats very much, and I will try just about anything for them when offered as a reward. I am crate trained, but do I wouldn\u2019t mind being a cuddle partner if you were so inclined. I'm house trained and will wait to be taken outside to go potty.  I'm a very sweet girl with medium energy and I LOVE tummy rubs!  I LIVE for tummy rubs! I can't decide what i love more, treats or tummy rubs! I do have a little separation anxiety,  but my foster Dad is working with me on that. My back, left leg bothers me a bit, so I need a soft place to sleep. I would be a very loving, affectionate, happy, goofy, obedient companion for anyone.

See the bottom of this bio for more FAQs regarding our adoption process before emailing.****\n\nName: Chance\n\nAge: 6 months\n\nCurrent Weight: 18 lbs\n\nHealth: up to date on required vaccinations, neutered, hind-end paralyzed and is urine incontinent due to his injury (wears a belly band indoors). Physical therapy recommended (his foster mom can provide more information about that!)\n\nChance is a fun loving little spit fire. He loves to play rough and tumble with the big dogs! That\u2019s his absolute favorite thing. He loves every person and dog he meets. He wants to be everyone\u2019s friend. Despite his disability he gets around awesome in or out of his cart. When he\u2019s not wildly playing he is either being  mischievous or resting his head on your lap. He is a curious funny guy who would fit into almost any home.  Chance needs a playmate. A home with a very playful larger dog (he\u2019s small but loves the bigger dogs) would be amazing. Chance is not urine continent. He does wear a belly band which is an easy solution for a dog like Chance. It is possible some day he could walk again. Physical therapy is suggested.   \n\nAdoption fee: $300\n\nTo apply to adopt Chance, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

            "description": "\"Zoey\" is an Australian Kelpie who originally went into a shelter in Sheridan, WY as a stray whose age at that time was estimated to be 2-3 years.  She was adopted and for the past year has lived in a very loving home.  She was great with two autistic boys and tries to get the two cats to play.  Due to a divorce situation, this single mom can no longer give \"Zoey\" the attention or exercise she needs as she has a very small yard and limited time with her family.  \n\n\"Zoey\" has a severely damaged rear leg that was never repaired when she was young.  It has grown back with the ball of her hip removed from the socket and is now deformed, but most of all she lives with pain which will only get worse with age.  Because she is such a sweet and active girl, we raised $1,500 for her surgery.  She will be at the vet clinic for a week and then 3 weeks in recovery in a foster home.  Because she is young and healthy and a very durable working breed, we feel this expense will totally change her life. You can follow her progress on our Facebook page.\n\n\"Zoe\" is very nicely house trained, spayed, microchipped and will be brought current on all her vaccinations.  She is good with people of all ages and can be protective of her family.  This breed is exceptionally smart and eager to please.\n\nFor an appointment to meet \"Zoey,\" please email kathy@3dogrescue.com for an application that can be filled out online.  Her adoption fee is $200 and she will come with complete vet records, microchip registration and various supplies.  We do not adopt to families with children under the age of 5 and we prefer to find homes within a 200 more radius of the Cody/Powell area.",

Georgia shelter and a broken home. Her previous owner went to jail and prior to doing so had also killed two other dogs. Upon intake in mid Nov 2020, Brownie weighed 41 pounds and had already been spayed. You can imagine what her life had been previously. Brownie doesnt appear on intake to be well socialized to a leash, but our veterinary partner will work with her a little prior to coming north. She will get scared and refuse to walk. Her perfect home would be one with a fenced yard, quiet, and with a patient family. She needs someone who understands that she may need some space during decompression time just to get used to the idea of being safe and for her to explore her new home. Brownie is a good girl and she really just needs to know nothing but kindness every day for the rest of her life. If you have a compassionate heart, a quiet home, a kind touch and soft words of love to whisper and would like to do so and adopt Brownie, please put your application in here: http://www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org",

I am happy just laying around all day and snuggle up with my human. That being said, I also love going on my walks, playing tug with my toys, and going everywhere with you!!\n\n- I am a love bug and great with everyone!! I am a very easy going pup, and I'd love for you to take me everywhere you go!\n\n- I love to play with dogs my size, and hang out with them!\n\n- I have some GI issues which simply means I will need to be on a specific GI food for the rest of my life, but that doesn't affect me more than the type of food my adopter will need to buy. \n\n- I had an overall unfortunate life, with a lot of abandonment and abuse throughout, but I still have a lot of trust in humans and can't wait to find my forever snuggle family!!\n\n- In April, I was rescued by the HIT LIVING team the afternoon I was supposed to be euthanized. Shortly after I was rescued, I was adopted by my foster! Sadly, and to no fault of my own, I was returned to the foundation 6 months later, after I wasn\u2019t being set up for success with my adopter. I am now ready to go to my actual forever home, who will truly care and love me forever!\n\n- I will be very happy with any sort of situations, apt or house, men or women! I will be better in a home without small children who could scare me, cats or small dogs. \n\nIf you see me online I am still available for adoption! If you are interested in adopting me please fill out an application here: www.hitlivingfoundation.org/adoption-application, and email a video walkthrough of your home and yard to BOTH Nicole@hitlivingfoundation.org AND Marta@hitlivingfoundation.org. Your application will not be counted as valid without your video. You will hear back from us within a few days.",

            "description": "Hi I'm Nana! I'm a 1 year old, 55lb Belgian Shepherd/Malinois. I am young and energetic, and will need an adopter who can truly provide the right amount of exercise and adventures in my life! \n\n- I unfortunately came from an abusive and traumatic past, so I am still quite shy at first and I can get frightened easily.\n\n- Despite my past I am an energetic, loving, cuddly and loyal girl! I am VERY active and will need an adopter who can provide the correct amount of outdoor activity for me throughout the day.\n\n- I love other dogs, am learning to coexist with cats, AND even chilling with the pigs who live in my current foster home. I will actually need to be adopted out to a family who has another playful doggo, so I can learn from them and play all day!\n\n- I still need some time to start trusting men again as I am still very fearful of them. However, I have been working on that with my foster family by receiving meals, going on walks, and even getting gentle cuddles from my foster dad.\n\n- Once I feel safe, I am an absolute joy and a total goofball!\n\nMy ideal home would have:\n- Another dog to learn from, play with, and build up my confidence\n- A yard to run around in\n- A very active owner with time dedicated to me\n- No young children who could possibly frighten me\n\nIf you see me online I am still available for adoption! If you are interested in adopting me please fill out an application here: www.hitlivingfoundation.org/adoption-application, and email a video walkthrough of your home and yard to BOTH Nicole@hitlivingfoundation.org AND Marta@hitlivingfoundation.org. Your application will not be counted as valid without your video. You will hear back from us within a few days.",

            "description": "If submitting an adoption application for Misty you must note on your application that you ahve read her entire posting and understand her needs.\n\nMisty is almost 14 yrs old and is right around 13 lbs. Adopted out from a CA shelter in 2016 she was picked up as a stray in October and ended up back in the shelter in an unbelievable state. Her hair was so matted it was cutting into the skin on her legs and choking her. She had an oozing cyst on her neck, and her eyes, ears, and teeth all infected. The matting was so bad it partially detached her right back paw (strangulation by mats), and caused a deep wound on her right front leg.\n\nThis little lady can't see or hear any more, but her heart and will are strong. In spite of having one of her back paws almost completely severed off by matt strangulations she still manages, and is quite determined, to hobble around limited areas on her own. Full senior blood work and kidney functions tested good. She's also had a dental.\n\nMisty's match is going to be an adopter looking for a goldfish companion in a dog's body. She not one for being held or coddled, in fact if you try to hold her she'll do her best to wiggle out of your hold. She's cute to keep watch over in her little penned in areas though. A grown man's snore coming out of her little body is also quite amusing. Her eyes and ears may have failed her, but her nose is good. She really enjoys sniffing excursions in the yard and seems to enjoy being taken out for walks in a dog stroller or the dog pouch her foster uses for on walks.\n\nMisty needs an adopter who is willing to watch over and care for her without expecting her to be a warm cuddly companion in return. If you can find a soft spot in your heart for a strong willed quirky little Goldfish dog, we'd love to see this girl placed with an adopter who will give her the space and care she more than deserves in her sunset years.\n\nBecause of her limited sight and visions she has to have set x-pen space in the home (her own little oversized goldfish bowl) to be and feel safe. She is good being taken outside to potty, but also makes use of pee pads in her penned in area. She requires regular grooming, which is no easy task. She is a lot stronger and more wiggly than seems possible for a dog her age when she gets scared and grooming is scary to her. She's had to be sedated by a vet for her last couple of grooms and will likely need to continue to be sedated for groomings going forward.\n\nAll Underdogs are in foster homes. You must have an adoption application on file to request a meet. An online adoption application can be accessed online at https://underdogsrock.org/adopt-a-dog\n\nMisty is part of a special Underdog Elder adoption program. Her adoption fee is $75. A starter bag of food, collar and leash are provided with her adoption. She is spayed, up to date on vaccinations, and microchipped.\n\nFor updates on all the Underdogs be sure to follow us Underdogs Rock Rescue on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/UnderdogsRockRescue\n\nCOVID PRECAUTIONS:\n\nMeets are part of the Underdog adoption process and will take place outside, masks required. Home checks are also part of the process and will be conducted virtually. Additionally all paperwork, including adoption contract signatures, will be through email.\n\n1/29/21 6:16 PM",

She is an active gal, loves attention, loves to play, great for an active family, about 45 lbs right now.\n\nADOPTION FEES Dogs & Puppies.....$100.00 . This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more.\nThe first step to do an adoption is to do our Adoption Application here: https://www.elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html\nIMPORTANT - we respond to your emailed applications and queries via email back to you. Please make sure you have either added our email (hselco@bellsouth.net) to your contact list or that you routinely check your SPAM folder for our response just to be safe. If we do not receive a timely response we simply move on to another applicant.\nYes, there are sometimes exceptions to our normal fee for older dogs or special cases. Some of our pets have also been lovingly sponsored by caring people and we will let the approved adopter know about that at the point of adoption. Visit our Website at: http://www.elmorehumane.org The staff would also like to remind you that for faster response to inquiries about adoptable animals to have the animals ID#, name & description. This way your questions will be answered in a timely manner.\nAll pet adoption websites & our shelter management software require that we choose a primary and/or secondary breed for our dogs. While our staff is quite breed knowledgeable, in many cases we are truly making our best guesses as to their breed(s) based on many factors but cannot promise that what we have said is accurate. So taking into account your own parameters for things such as size, coat care, activity level, etc please come and get to know our dog(s) as individuals to see if their personalities and yours are a forever match.\nPhone: (334) 567-3377 Fax: (334) 567-8774 E-mail: hselco@bellsouth.net",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Nadia and I\u2019m a 2-year-old, female mini German Shepard mix.\n\n**I have fear bite history in my past and have been working and living with my trainer, Aubrey of Beezy's Pack. She has created structure for me which I never had before as I was pregnant and living on the streets of Mexico. She has allowed me to be the pup that I never got to be so that I feel confident. I need someone who can continue my training and has the potential financial recourses and time to commit to keeping me active with structure and routine. I need a yard and will need to be in a home with no children, small pets or other dogs at this time**\n\n- It takes me a short while to warm up to new people but once I do I am so full of life, a cuddle bug and a total joy to be around!\n\n- I just had 7 babies and was the best mama to them but now I'm looking to love and be loved by a new family!\n\n- I want all the belly rubs I can get. Once I'm warmed up to you I will happily and consistently show you my belly for some good belly rubs.\n\n- Walkies please! I have a good amount of energy so I need a few walks a day, one of which is preferably a bit longer than just around the block so I can get my energy out! \n\n- I still have a bit of over-protective mother tendencies so I am working on not getting overly protective of things like toys and my humans, which is why I would prefer a home without another dog to share my things with. Although I am being fostered with several other dogs, I do like all the attention to be on me and prefer to be an only child at home :)\n\nMy perfect home would have:\n- No other pets or young children who could scare me with their brusk movements\n- A devoted and experienced dog-loving individual or family\n- A backyard or outdoor area to run around\n\nIf you see me online I am still available for adoption! If you are interested in adopting me please fill out an application here: www.hitlivingfoundation.org/adoption-application, and email a video walkthrough of your home and yard to BOTH Nicole@hitlivingfoundation.org AND Marta@hitlivingfoundation.org. Your application will not be counted as valid without your video. You will hear back from us within a few days.",

So I'm on my search again for my true furever family. I originally came to the rescue just a day away from a bad fate - I'd ended up at a rural county shelter...no longer wanted by my previous owner...a bully breed, pregnant and an owner surrender - that is not a recipe for success in getting out of a shelter. But, Pawfect Match heard about me and had a foster home available for a knocked up girl like myself and the rest is history. I gave birth to 9 gorgeous puppies (they get it from me) and I was a great mom. All of my puppies have been adopted except Roseland - she was adopted and returned - what a run of bad luck for us both. I'm a gorgeous girl but I am energetic and need training and consistency. I have poor leash manners - I get reactive when I see another dog so I need training and a strong handler who can manage me. A fenced yard would be great - of course dogs need to burn off energy going on walks but while getting my training situated, a fenced yard would be great for me to run and play. Don't get me wrong...I do like to snuggle too. I'm a great medium sized gal. I like some dogs so we'll have to see how things go if you have a resident dog. With patience, true commitment to me, and a consistent schedule, I'm going to be a great addiiton to a family. Is it yours?",

Our new intake is such a stunning tawny boy who turns 2 years old on 11/25 will be having entropion surgery and a full work up with Dr. Joel on Monday. He has lumps on top of hygromas on his knees, is missing hair along with dried out skin and his paws are sore. Being 20 pounds overweight x-rays show loose hips but are uncertain as to what point until a full exam with updated x-rays are completed.\n\nMario will be fostered in Illinois until his perfect home is found and he has time to recuperate from his eye surgery. This entropion is one of the worst we have seen, clearly the picture shows he is unable to open his eyes which is extremely painful. Just a couple more days and his healing process begins. We are praying that he does not have any permanent sight issues from the eyelashes scratching on his corneas, we are however expecting to see ulcers which will heal with medicated drops.\n\nAlthough, he is neutered he will be needing much attention, obviously bi-lateral entropion surgery in both eyes, vaccines, fecal, heartworm testing, skin scraping, x-rays and whatever else is needed to get him healthy. At this time we can say he has been sweet during transport but it is unfair at this point to evaluate him due to his physical state.\n\nThe perfect home for Mario would be a nice quiet home in the country. His people must be breed specific and willing to help him with his diet, take him on short walks and be patient with decompression time. No children in the home under the age of 18, must own your home, have a 6 foot privacy fence, be the only pet at this time and be able to give him all the love he is deserving of. If you fit the criteria please go to our website at www.mastinorescue.org and complete a Family Profile and a volunteer from our adoption team will contact you.\n\nUPDATE: Mario is recuperating nicely from his entropion surgery and has been started on his diet. He has received several medicated baths and his skin is looking/feeling better already. We see a huge difference in not only his physical appearance but he is much happier. He is now up to date on vaccines, worm and heartworm negative. Could you be his forever home?\n\nMore pictures and updates coming. We have you boy so no more worries, your loving home awaits you.",

            "description": "\"A diamond in the rough.\" Hazel is a beautiful playful Great Pyrenees who has exceptional potential. She loves to be around people and can be very affectionate once she gets to know you. Hazel loves to give kisses and enjoys being petted. She will follow you as she likes to stay near her family.\n\nHazel, born December 2018, weighing about 107 lbs, was an owner surrender to the Great Pyrenees Rescue Society after she started chasing the family's farm animals. She was left outdoors to live and sleep in an open shelter. Her family brought her indoors whenever she got anxious hearing fireworks, and she would stay very close to them for comfort. Her family loved her.\n\nHazel needs more experience living indoors. Hazel is learning to walk nicely on a leash. She likes people after she gets to know them and likes other dogs although she is very picky who she plays with.\n\nShe would do best in a home as an \"only dog\" with an all adult family, kids 15 years old and older are ok and a cat free home. A large secure fenced yard for play and a daily walk would be a good start for expanding her socialization skills. She will need a family with confident leaders that are familiar with Pyr's traits and behaviors. Are you the family Hazel needs to help her become the best-devoted family companion? If you are, please complete an adoption application for Hazel.\n\nAdoption Fee $325 (Adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm test, rabies, distemper, parvo and health certificate for travel). Northwest adopters pay the cost of transport to independent transport service ($225). Adoption applications can be found on our website at https://www.greatpyreneesrescuesociety.org\n\nADOPTION, FOSTERING, AND DONATIONS are just some of the ways you can help a rescued dog. We have worked hard to cultivate a large network of volunteers to save this majestic breed. While monetary donations are always much appreciated, you can also help by donating your time as a GPRS foster or volunteer!",

Wilson is a work in progress!\n\nWe recommend a home with a secure privacy fence so that Wilson can run and play without being distracted or tempted to chase things that pass by.\n\nWilson will likely get along with most dogs who can match his size and energy level.

            "description": "Marshall is a young fellow who didn't get off to the best start in life. He was kept outdoors and from there it went downhill. He contracted heartworm disease and his owner fell ill and could no longer care for him. Marshall loved the other pet at his original home... a yorkipoo whom Marshall protected and adored. Once Marshall was turned into the shelter, his fortunes started to take a turn for the better. He is now in a loving foster home, sleeping inside and having his heartworm treated.\n\nMarshall has shown curiosity regarding the family cat, but has made no effort to chase or harass her. At less than 2 years old, he's just a goofy, playful, toy loving, chewing puppy. (There's nothing like a chewing puppy to encourage you to pick up your shoes and put them away.) When excited, he will \"mouth,\" which could be mistaken for biting by someone not familiar with puppy behavior, but his fosters are working on curbing that. Because of his size and energy level, we would prefer to place him with older children. Those under the age of 7 or 8 may be bowled over by his non-aggressive exuberance. Marshall would think he hit the lottery if his forever home came with another playful dog, preferably a young one who would love to wrestle and play chase.\n\nMarshall sleeps like a log at night. He currently sleeps in a crate to protect both himself and property while everyone sleeps. He willingly goes into the crate at about 10:00 p.m. if a treat awaits him inside, and he sleeps until about 7:00. He cat naps anywhere he wants during the day, but if his foster mom leaves the room, he wakes and follows her. He finds her daily activities fascinating. Marshall is still learning the art of indoor living, but we think he's done fantastically well in learning household manners. He's had a few minor accidents inside (The one where it was pouring outside doesn't count.), but he's since learned to paw at the back door when he needs to go outside. Because of his curiosity, energy, and general newness at indoor living, Marshall should be crated when left alone.\n\nIf you would like to welcome this joyful sweetheart into your home, please complete an Adopter Profile and e-mail it to icanhelp@beaglemaryland.org. .\n\nMarshall's Webpage - http://beaglemaryland.org/brsm_ms/vIndividualCurrentDog.aspx?dogid=69882\nAdoptable Dog Webpage - http://beaglemaryland.org/brsm_ms/vCurrentDogs.aspx\n\nIf you'd like to adopt one of our beagles:\n*Go to our Website - href=\"http://beaglemaryland.org\n*Review our  Standards for Adoption - http://beaglemaryland.org/Home.aspx?pg=standardsforadoption.htm\n*Fill out an Adopter Profile - \nhttp://brsmbeagles.org/new_site/documents/BRSM_profile_secure.pdf\n and email it to us (or print it off, fill it in and send it via regular mail, if you prefer)\n*A BRSM volunteer will contact you to guide you through the rest of the process!\n\nWe hope to hear from you, and so do the beagles!",

            "description": "Sam #2 is a very happy and smart boy. Sam #2 loves, loves, loves to play fetch. This handsome, big boy would love an active family to go on walks/hikes or a home with a large fenced in yard. Sam needs a strong leader willing to take the time to be consistent with manners.  He is a quick learner and learns best after a rigorous playtime.  His reward for responding appropriately to a command is only a ball!  He gets along with other dogs. He is very interested in cats but may just be playful rather than predatory.  For the right owner, Sam would make a magnificent companion.  Sam #2 is about 3 years old and 78 pounds.\n\n**We currently have two dogs with similar names. Please make sure to write \"SAM #2\" on your application to avoid any delays in processing your application.\n\nWe do NOT ship our animals. All adoptive families must travel to us to meet their adoptive dog/cat. Applicants must live within a 2 hour radius from Sparta/Andover (07871/07821).\n\nPlease understand that we are an animal shelter and thus unable to say whether the dogs are housebroken as they are not in homes.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, we encourage you to please submit an application on our website today so that we can try and process and pre-approve any potential adopters prior to our next adoption event.\n\nPLEASE USE THIS LINK TO SUBMIT AN ADOPTION APPLICATION. WE ONLY ACCEPT ADOPTION APPLICATIONS THROUGH OUR WEBSITE. ANY OTHERS WILL NOT BE PROCESSED.\nApplication link here: http://www.oscaranimalrescue.org/oscar-1-application.html\n\nAdoption Process:\n1.Fill out an application\n2.Meet & Greet\n3.Adoption contract & adoption fee\nSam #2 's adoption fee is $350. This covers all age-appropriate shots, vetting & microchipping.\n\n**If you are coming to an adoption event to see a certain dog/cat, please email ahead of time to make sure that dog/cat will be there that day. Please email 1-2 days before the event, as some animals are placed during the week and our list is constantly changing.\nFor a list of upcoming pet adoption events go to: www.OscarAnimalRescue.org\n\nOne Step Closer Animal Rescue is a 501c3 non-profit organization. Donations are TAX DEDUCTIBLE to the extent allowed by law. If you would like to make a donation to help us rescue more animals please send donations to PO Box 248, Sparta, NJ 07871.

            "description": "Adoption Pending! Rusty is a large red male Doberman looking for his furever home. Rusty came to us from a court seizure case where many dogs were living predominantly outdoors. Since he was not well socialized, he is initially aloof with new people, but really takes direction watching the other dogs in his foster home. At their cue, he will quickly warm up to people and wants to both give and get lots of love. We would love to see Rusty go to a home with a female canine companion to continue to boost his confidence. Although Rusty\u2019s age is estimated at 5 years old, he certainly acts like a younger boy with his play and goofy antics. Rusty LOVES playing with toys and will regularly empty the entire toy bin to play with ALL of them. Rusty plays well with his Doberman foster sisters and doesn\u2019t bother the kitty in the foster home. Rusty is navigating his way around in-home living and working on his manners and crate-training. He is super food motivated, smart, and eager to please, so he will be a quick study with some patience and training. After playtime and chewing on his bones, he is happy to curl up on the couch with you for snuggle-time.  Rusty is neutered, current on vaccines and microchipped.

He is a strong and happy boy who loves to play, go for walks, and explore the world in general. He is also a big fan of toys and gets really excited when he sees balls. Baxter loves getting attention from people. He is good with other dogs and with kids but has not been tested with cats. We would love for Baxter to find his forever home for Thanksgiving with a family who is looking to engage him in some training. Baxter is a good passenger in the car and is especially fond of seat warmers. Baxter is currently 60lbs. If you are interested in adopting Baxter, we ask that you submit an application at digsk9.org. His adoption fee is $375. \n\nThis dog is up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, and spayed/neutered. Please note that we are unable to hold dogs for any reason including moves and vacations. Once approved for adoption we require the adopter to complete the adoption and take ownership of their new companion. \n\n**We do our best to accurately represent the breeds of each pet. However, the breeds listed have not been verified via a DNA test. They are chosen based on the appearance and characteristics of the pet at the time of listing.",

Remus is a sweet boy who can be a little shy at first but warms up well with treats and some butt scratches. He loves long walks, being around his people and playing tug. Remus does well with some large dogs after a proper introduction but does not do well with small dogs. We do not know how he would do with children or kitties. Remus is housebroken and crate trained. He will need a 6ft fence.\n\nRemus is neutered, up to date on vaccinations and on heartworm and flea preventative. Stop by and meet him, 9 to 1, Mon thru Sat!\n",

            "description": "Meet Buster, possibly part Norwich Terrier. He weighs around 12# and is 2 years old. Buster has been with PPAWS since September 2020.\nWhen he came he was very fearful. We have had him evaluated by a trainer who tells us he has several feral traits. The major trait that you would have to accept is that he is very shy to most people. He sometimes barks and growls at new people so to get you to go away. Making new friends is very difficult for him. It would be several weeks before he could show that he trusts you and wag his happy tail. He would hide in his kennel if you kept an eye on him. While not being watched, he will explore.\nWhat Buster needs is a daily structure. Doing the same thing day after day. Over the last few months we have discovered that he loves to go for a walk. His leash manners are superb. He struts himself like he owns the world.\nTo help with his fearfulness Busters forever home would be best to have a partner dog, to help guide him how a dog fits into your home, he would love a fenced yard to do his exploring and squirrel chasing. His wire crate is his safe place when he is scared, and because he can be ornery, it is best to kennel him when you need to be gone. He will go to his kennel upon command. Small or young children can be somewhat unpredictable, so probably best he not live with small children.\nAs you can see, this boy is special and will take a very special home. He is not a lap dog at this time, but if you get down to his level he loves belly rubs and scratches, it makes him smile. If you think you are interested in finding out more about Buster. Please fill out an application.\nhttps://www.purple-paws.\n \n",

            "description": "Regardless of her rough start to life, Lucha has never once given up hope. She has more than lived up to her full name; Luchadora which translates to fighter. She is a precious 5-month-old terrier mix who weighs around 30 pounds. This tough girl now rocks a cute wheelchair to get around easier yet she is still faster than the speed of lightning. Diapers nor wheelchairs can bring Lucha down! She is unstoppable and a true inspiration to all. With a heart of gold, she gets along great with other dogs, cats, and older children. She loves spending her days chasing lizards, greeting the neighbors on walks, and playing with her favorite toys. She is an expert cuddler and prefers a warm lap over anything. Life improves drastically with Lucha in it and we just know that there is a special family out there for this one of a kind girl! \n\nSpecial Needs: Lucha was found abandoned next to a dumpster with severe injuries and in dire need of medical attention. Thanks to the quick thinking and kind hearts of the local firemen who found her, her life was saved from certain death. After further diagnostics, X-rays concluded that Lucha has a congenital defect that was likely present at birth. Some of the vertebrae are pushed together very tightly resulting in partial paralysis. Lucha still has some movement of her tail but does not have full control over her urine or stools.\n\nLucha is seeking a family that is home most of the day as she does require more attention than a typical dog. She will gladly reward her family with plenty of kisses in return! If you live in the central Florida area, own your home, and think Lucha may be the right pup for you, please fill out a screening form found here: https://mettarescuefamily.org/adoptable-dogs",

But luckily, the doctors saw potential in him and suggested to have him surrendered instead. One of the wonderful doctors took Romeo home to foster, and after a few weeks of physical therapy, Romeo began walking again! When he was cleared to be pulled by a rescue, we welcomed this handsome boy into the AMA family. He still sways a bit when he lifts his leg for peeing and may fall here and there from jumping attempts, but overall he's steady on his feet. He is housebroken and good with other pets. Romeo is great with people and super affectionate. If you'd like to have Romeo join your family, please fill out the adoption application at https://amaanimalrescue.org/pet/romeo/",

His dents and dings have made him the shy sort, so he's going to need a patient person that he bonds with, and he's looking for someone to be his BFF. Bruiser is quiet, rarely barks, housebroken, knows some commands, and walks like an angel on a leash - he doesn't pull at all!\n\nBruiser loves chew toys. Sometimes, when you get him out for a walk, he gets so excited he'll just pick up his chew bone and carry it with him. Might put it down to sniff, but then he'll pick it up again and keep on walking. It's the most endearing thing He's a mellow fellow and loves just chilling in the sunshine or hanging out on a comfy blanket. He deserves someone who's willing to work with him and give him the life he deserves. #BruiserNeedsABuddy\n\nMy adoption comes with a leash, collar, durable dog toy & up to $100 of training. \n\nVideo of him: https://fb.watch/1VrcKF5Ya-/\n\nTo learn more: https://ws.petango.com/webservices/adoptablesearch/wsAdoptableAnimalDetails2.aspx?id=45413927&css=&PopUp=true\n",

He needs to find an adopter who is affectionate, patient, and willing to deal with changing his diapers (yes, our baby likes to mark). He is unable to go under anesthesia for neutering so unfortunately his problems can\u2019t be alleviated (pun intended). With all that being said, Dutch is absolutely adorable and a one of a kind dog. He has such an incredible personality and is so warm and affectionate. He just needs the right owner who is willing to stand by his side and be loyal to him. We know Dutch will return that loyalty with nothing but pure love and affection. Dutch doesn't mind other dogs but would try to mount other unaltered dogs. If you are interested in adopting Dutch then please fill out the adoption application form at https://amaanimalrescue.org/pet/dutch/",

            "description": "\u201cPearls were accidents, and the finding of one was luck, a little pat on the back by God or the gods or both.\u201d - John Steinbeck, The Pearl\n\nWelcome Pearl! This precious girl is 11-months old and about 30 pounds at the moment, but we think she may gain another 10 or so before she\u2019s fully grown! \n\nPearl is pretty new to housebreaking and crate-training, but is she getting better every day. She is able to sleep all night long, and she doesn\u2019t need to be let out for a midnight bathroom break. She knows that she is supposed to go outside to potty, but she\u2019s still learning how to tell her foster mom when it\u2019s time. Pearl is getting used to her crate, but she won\u2019t go in on command yet. She doesn\u2019t love that she\u2019s been sequestered from everyone else in the house, but after a few minutes she\u2019s able to settle down and relax.\n\nPearl LOVES spending time with other dogs, and she particularly loves to cuddle with her big brother Mango; she would love to be in a home with some dog friends. Based on what we can tell so far in the time we\u2019ve had Pearl, she seems like the kind of girl everyone loves to be around!\n\nWhen Pearl meets a new face, she can be on the bashful side, but if the person has a treat, she is very quick to overcome that shyness and will be their new best friend. Pearl prefers to be around people, but she can be slow to give affection. If she\u2019s giving away a kiss or lays her head down on your lap, you know you\u2019ve made it! \n\nPearl is getting more adjusted to the world every day! Foster mom says she\u2019s even started venturing into the fenced yard to run, jump, and play. Like a lot of puppies her age, Pearl definitely benefits from getting outside and getting some of those puppy wiggles out. Running around outside, chasing a ball, or daily walks would be great exercise for her, and once she gains some more confidence, she might like a trip to go play with some friends at the dog park. Once she\u2019s had her exercise for the day, this girl loves to settle in on the couch for some cuddles and a nap.\n\nThis pearl of a girl may not have had the best beginnings in life, but she is sure to shine in the right setting. Could it be with you? Contact us today! \n\nIf you\u2019d like to be considered to adopt, the first step in the process is to submit an application through our website: http://athenscaninerescue.com/adoption-procedures/. Our adoption fee is $250 per dog over the age of 6 months and $300 per dog 6 months or younger. We accept payment by Venmo, PayPal, or card.\n\nThis includes: basic vet care (i.e. basic vaccinations, including boosters completed after adoption, spay/neuter, heartworm/flea preventatives, and treatment for any health needs while in our care), a microchip, a week\u2019s worth of food for the trial-period, and a harness lead.\n\nWe typically adopt to homes within 30 minutes of Athens, GA, as we require a basic home check to ensure all dogs are placed in a safe environment. If you are further away than that and are interested in one of our pups, please still fill out an application and we can discuss your options. WE ARE CURRENTLY NOT ACCEPTING OUT OF STATE APPLICATIONS. \n\nWe do not have a facility and operate through a network of foster homes. Thus, we do not have a phone number. If you\u2019d like to discuss potential adoptions, please email at adopt@athenscaninerescue.com.",

I love playing fetch, going on walks, taking naps by the pool or at home. Riding in the car is very relaxing for me. Im very loyal and smart, I learn quickly what you want me to do. I enjoy meeting new people and Im great with kids, but due to some bad experiences in my past I dont get along with other dogs too well. I was in a pretty bad shape when I was rescued, so Im slowly gaining weight and catching up on the missed playtime I didnt have while I was on the streets. If youre interested in meeting me, email acsrescue-foster@sanantonio.gov with my number A589225.",

            "description": "Meet Dillon! He's about a year and a half old and about 50 pounds. Dillon came to us as an owner surrender so we have some background information provided to us by his previous owners. \n\nDillon is very smart and quick to pick up things. According to his previous owners he is house trained and crate trained. His owners even said that they were able to teach him to use a specific part of the yard to go potty in within a couple of days! Dillon is fine spending time in his crate and will sleep through the night fine in it.\n\nDillon is still learning what toys he likes best. He needs someone patient enough to train him how to walk well on a leash. Dillon is also dog aggressive so long walks in very \"\"dog popular\"\" neighborhoods won't be ideal for Dillon. He is just fine kicking back in his backyard when he needs to go potty to avoid the stress of seeing other dogs. Dillon has been voted by staff as Best Belly-Rub Receiver and cutest trotter.\n\nIf your home is in need of exactly one dog, Dillon is an ideal guy for you! He is so well mannered and friendly to humans. He hasn't been tested around cats but has been known to chase birds and squirrels so his ideal home wouldn't have any cats.\n\nDillon is up to date on his shots and monthly flea/tick, neutered, microchipped, and heart worm negative!\nIf you're interested in meeting this animal, please contact us at (972)-450-2845 or addisonanimalcontrol@addisontx.gov! We don't have a shelter so we will arrange a time for you to meet this cutie. Our adoption fee is $10.\n\nCurrently, masks are required at adoption appointments and we request that you limit the number of people at the appointment to 2 people maximum. If you'd like to schedule a video chat appointment before coming to meet an animal in person, please let us know and we can arrange that!",

            "description": "Drake is a happy boy who loves interacting at the fence lines with the other dogs in the runs next to him and seeing who he can beat to the other end. He's also an avid squirrel stalker and keeps frogs to a minimum in our big dog runs; pesky things frogs....they keep jumping away from you or up into your face!\n\nDrake was adopted from us in 2016 and lived in that home until 2020 when his mom got sick and could no longer care for him. He was morbidly obese, very timid and shy and sad for a long time after coming back. But he's been on weight management dog food, has lots of exercise and he's like a new dog! Drake doesn't mind other dogs but enjoys being the single focus in a home, like he was used to. He'd probably do fine with another dog whose energy level is equal to his and would not demand too much engagement from him. Drake has a lot of good years left; he just needs the right family to spend it with.",

            "description": "Hello! My name is Turbo and I just had a photoshoot. Don't I look so glamorous? My new photos truly show off my personality. Here's a bit about me:\n\nI am a 1.5 year old and 45lb. I am up to date on shots and neutered so I'm ready to go!\n\nMy favorite thing to do is run around in the yard. My foster mom says I have a lot of energy and like to stay active. Sometimes she says I can be a lot and need a moment to calm down. I love to learn and foster mom has been teaching me Sit, Down, Stay, Wait, Go to Bed, Outside, and Leave It. I also learned how to use a little bell to go outside. Foster mom says it helps her know when I need a potty break.\n\nI'm still getting used to leash walking but I like to explore. Exploring is the bestest! Chasing small critters (SQUIRREL!) is super fun too but foster mom has been working on teaching me that not all animals need to be chased when I'm walking with her.\n\nOne of my favorite places is my crate. I make myself at home in there and sleep there at night. Sometimes, you may even hear me snoring. I promise it's cute!\n\nDid I mention I LOVE to snuggle. Foster mom says I'm a \"love bug\" and I give lots of hugs and kisses. I absolutely love to show my hoomans I think they're great.\n\nI'd love to have a playmate at my new home. One of my favorite things to do is play chase. I can do that FOREVER... and ever... and ever! I also like to wrestle but foster mom says I'm still learning how to not play too hard. She says it's important for me to have a dog playmate that can keep up with me and even teach me new things. She also says I'd be okay as an only dog but I'd need an outlet for all my energy. Maybe we could try agility or fly ball!!!??? It would be great to end each day tired.\n\nBecause I love to jump and run, I may knock over little kiddos. Foster mom says I should watch where I'm going but I cannot help it! I have energy. I'm going to be better off in a home with teens or adults.\n\nReady to adopt me? I promise to look super cute in bandanas and be your best friend!\n\nBCRRT is a Texas based rescue with fosters in TX and OK. Our adoption areas are TX, OK and surrounding states. We do not allow shipping/transport of dogs to other states. If you are interested and would like to apply please visit: https://bcrrt.com/adoption/ and fill out an application form.",

            "description": "Bonnie!\n\nIf you are looking for a sweet & snuggly little lady that rarely stops wagging her tail, look no further! Beautiful Bonnie is currently being spoiled & loved in Foster Care, but is now ready for her forever family to see her & fall in love! She has really come out of her shell since leaving the Shelter, learning to trust & showing off her bubbly but gentle personality! Getting her into her forever home as soon as possible would be ideal for this loving little lady so she can start to settle in!\n\nBonnie originally came into Maricopa County Animal Care & Control's West Shelter emotionally shut down & carrying a massive mammary tumor (approximately 1/4 of her total weight). After only being at the Shelter a short time, Bonnie needed to leave immediately for much needed veterinary care the Shelter was not going to provide. 2nd Chance Dog Rescue stepped in quickly to save her precious life! Bonnie had her extremely large tumor removed & has healed wonderfully! While her mass was confirmed to be malignant, clean margins were obtained, & further diagnostics could not find any evidence it had spread! Bonnie has had full blood work, x-rays, is up-to-date on shots, & has her next appointment already set up to be spayed & have a doggie dental!\n\nBonnie is approximately 8 years old & although only a DNA test could confirm, everyone's best guess is that she is the combination of a Chihuahua & Beagle! She is a petite 12lbs, walks well on a leash, & is housebroken. She is timid with strangers, but once she knows you are a friend she attaches quickly & craves human attention! Belly rubs are her most favorite 'activity' & her non-stop tail wags will have you smiling all day long! Did I mention those EYES!? Her beautiful brown Beagle eyes will melt your heart!\n\nShe enjoys attention from her Foster siblings (of all sizes), & often seeks them out to spend time with & to snuggle with of course! She is a bit shy with play so far & toys are a bit scary, but she keeps everyone entertained with her zoomies & play bows! Of course, introductions with current doggie family members are required! Due to her timid demeanor, she would not likely do well with kids, and it takes her a little time to warm up to new people, especially men.\n\nTo learn more about this SWEET soul please fill out an application for Bonnie!\nhttps://2ndchance.rescuegroups.org/animals/detail?AnimalID=16270573",

            "description": "We\u2019d like to introduce you to Miley! Miley is a young Mastiff/Labrador mix who is only about 1 year old. Miley came to Green Hills Animal Shelter as a rescue, and even though she has only been at the shelter since November 14th, she has already stolen the hearts of the staff, volunteers and everyone who has met her.\n\nMiley, who sports a beautiful black and cream brindled coat, came to the shelter as a rescue. Sadly, she came from a situation where she was not treated very kindly, and it appears that at some point she may have even been shot with a pellet gun.  Despite her tough past, however, Miley is the sweetest girl you could ever hope to meet, and is full of love, joy and lots of happiness to share.\n\nMiley is a very energetic dog who loves to play and who keeps us laughing with her silliness and goof-ball antics. If you were to ask her what her favorite 3 things in the world are, we have no doubt that Miley would answer, \u201cattention, kids and cats!\u201d\n\nIf Miley could describe her perfect forever home, she would ask for an active home where she could receive lots of attention and be a loved and treasured member of her family.  She would love to be able to romp and play in a securely fenced yard and to go on long, leashed walks. She would enjoy a home with children and perhaps a kitty friend or two, but she would prefer to be the only dog in the household.\n\nMiley will go to her Forever Home spayed, de-wormed, heartworm tested, and up to date on all her vaccinations, including rabies.  This sweet girl had a rough start, but she is more than ready to put it all behind her and share her joy for life with a family of her very own; could that family be yours?\n\nFor more information on Miley or any of the other pets waiting for their Forever Homes at Green Hills Animal Shelter, please phone the shelter at 660-359-2700 or stop by during our normal business hours.  We\u2019ll be honored to introduce you and perhaps help you find a new four-legged friend.",

These bonded Great Pyrenees/ mixes are about 5 and one half months old.\nThey were found running loose covered with ticks and fleas by a good Samaritan who thought it best for them to go into a rescue. They are now flea free ( say that fast) and scheduled to begin Vaccinations.\nThese two are some what timid while on leash but off leash they are much bolder.. \nThey are friendly duo. ...they are also crazy and 100% untrained. But in their favor they like cats and other dogs..and PEOPLE!\nSo we begun the slow process of training them while we search for an adoptive family to continue that training. For the last few nights they have had no accidents in their kennel. Sally will sit on command for about 2 seconds before she launches herself at you in unbridled excitement . Charlie....will think about sitting. He starts to sit. ... but will have second thoughts and launch with his sister.\nWe may be crazy ourselves trying to place these two as a pair. They do seem bonded so we will try.\nA securely fenced yard is required",

That person indicated that they \u201chad him on heartworm preventative \u201c, but his heartworm test done on 11/24/20 indicated he was heartworm positive.   He\u2019s such a very sweet boy!!!

This behavior means that he is looking for a home without other pets or kids. His family will need to use positive reinforcement, watch Hank's body launguage, and be willing to work to make sure he is happy and comfortable at all times. Hank likes to curl up under the desk in the office and help staff with their work. He carries his toys to his bed, loves to go for walks, and is housebroken. Hank is approximately 90 pounds big. \n\nAdoption fee: $160 includes his neuter, initial vaccines and deworming, and testing for heartworm. \n\nIf interested, please submit an adoption application online via our website, www.petswithoutparents.net. We are happy to help you meet \"the one\" all 7 days of the week!\n\nVisit www.petswithoutparents.net for more information about the rescue helping this little one!",

He ended up hit by a car, and was facing death. Mayberry 4 Paws stepped in and got him the medical care and surgery he needed to continue living his life. \n\nFrom there, he went to the most amazing foster home where he is loved dearly.  But now, Chavo needs a forever home. He looking for a warm place with land to explore with his family.  He loves being at the creek, walking through the fields, and lounging on the porch, while you enjoy your coffee. . He's a bit bossy and set in his ways,  but so was your ex and that didn't stop you. \n\nHe's an old guy,  but doesn't let his 17 years slow him down much. He loves walks in the great outdoors,  his toys, and his person.  He isn't much on kids or competition.  He prefers to it to be just him and his peeps, taking on the world. Therefore, Chavo would be happiest in a home with adults only. \n\nDue to his injuries, he does walk a little wonky and appears a little \"broken\" but he is perfectly imperfect and is in amazing health for his age.  \n\nDoes Chavo sound like the dude for you? He won't screw you over your ex did. So,  you can't go wrong. If you're interested, jump on over to our website (www.mayberry4paws.com), click on the FORMS tab and grab an adoption application.

            "description": "Estrella (Star) is a Poodle Mix, rescued from the streets in the Dominican Republic. She is initially very shy as she has experienced abandonment, abuse, and neglect. It takes some time for her to warm up to new situations but once she knows you are her friend she is very sweet, loyal, and engaging. She is current on shots, spayed, and microchipped. Estrella will require a household where there are no children, and adopters understand that her adoption is a labor of patience and above all love. This little girl is a jewel in the rough, one that you can awake and will become your most devoted companion. Estrella appears to be afraid of male figures. She barks at men from a distance. This behavior is being addressed. \n\nViewers interested in adopting Estrella should complete the pre-adoption application available in this post. https://form.123formbuilder.com/5081187// A fenced-in-yard and a home visit are requirements for her adoption. Given the current pandemic, home visits are completed following CDC recommendations. Use of face masks and gloves as well as interaction in open spaces, i.e. your backyard. For residents residing beyond or travel time (1.5 hours from our location) or residents out of state, we complete the home visit \"virtually\" using Google Duo a free application available for all smartphones. This allows for a face-to-face interview, as well as viewing your yard and you getting to see the dog of your choice in \"person\". We advise interested residents to call us if there are further questions, 850.270.8793 7 am-7 pm",

That said, I do like talking short walks and I do get the zoomies and sprint around the back yard. I\u2019ve also got a great tail wag that moves my whole butt back and forth when I get excited.\n\nI\u2019m a really friendly pup and I enjoy meeting new people and saying hi to everyone when I\u2019m out on walks! I am friendly to other dogs overall when seeing them out of the house but I seem to prefer the ladies more than other male dogs. But I think I\u2019d just prefer being the only dog in the house overall as I\u2019ve had a few issues with sharing my space/resource guarding when dogs visit my foster home.  I haven\u2019t met any cats so I can\u2019t confirm how I\u2019d do with cat friends and I think I\u2019d do best in a home without young kids just since I haven\u2019t had any experience with kiddos yet in my life. \n\nOne thing to note is that I likely have small tears in my cruciate ligaments. The vet doesn\u2019t recommend surgery at this time since it is a partial tear and they can possibly heal with some inflammatory medication and time. However, I\u2019m looking for a family who would be 1000% ready to take on the cost and recovery support of surgery down the road if my ligaments don\u2019t heal or do completely tear at the recommendation of a vet (cost of a future surgery would be about $1,000 and then I\u2019d be all healthy from there!) and again, there\u2019s a good chance I won\u2019t need it! \n\nAre you looking for a new BFF?

            "description": "This is Mama Tilly Marie who was rescued after being abandoned by her family after she had 11 puppies. Luckily, a Good Samaritan found her, and AAU stepped in to keep her and her babies safe. I was lucky enough to foster Tilly Marie and her babies starting in mid-November. So, we've had some time to get to know her.\n\nIt's clear that Tilly Marie had a rough start to life even before she bore, nursed, and took care of her 11 puppies. She is afraid of everything outside of her day-to-day routine. She does not yet walk confidently on a leash although we are working on it. She is afraid of new people, places, sounds, etc. She is in no way aggressive. Her fear manifests itself as just shrinking back into herself and hiding.\n\nShe is as sweet as can be in our home and backyard. All she wants is a solid routine and love love love. If we are sitting, she wants to sit with us. If we are taking a walk through the backyard, then she will walk with us. If I'm sleeping, she wants to be next to me. She adores my children, but was very hesitant with my husband for weeks. Eventually, she has warmed up to him and even sleeps right next to him now. Well, sort of in between the two of us.\n\nThe honest truth is that I don't know when or if Tilly Marie will be a 'normal' dog who goes on walks and lives without fear. She will need a family that is patient with her as she continues on her journey. She really doesn't demand much, is completely non-destructive when we leave the house, and is just a quiet, calm friend to have around. She really would do well in a home with a steady routine where she can be with her owners as much as possible.\n\nIf you are still reading this, then I haven't scared you yet. So, let's get to the Heartworms. Oh, did I forget to mention that this poor thing is also heartworm positive?\n\nTilly Marie will need heartworm shots to recover. She is eligible to start injections the week of February 8th, but can wait to start til 3/5 at the latest. Until then, s\nhe can be somewhat normal with playing and walks. She currently gets some exercise by wrestling with her sister and sometimes taking one little run around the backyard.\n\nOnce injections begin, she will have r\n\nestricted activity - short leash walks only - out to potty and back inside to rest. No playing, jumping, running, up & down flights of stairs, etc. NO stress or excitement and definitely no boarding or change of environment. The r\n\nestricted activity will last 60 days minimum, preferably 75 days. A\n\nt least 30 days and no more 45 days later she will get 2nd & 3rd injections (back to back 24 hrs apart) continued restricted activity another 30-45 days.\n\nAAU works with adopters taking a dog through heartworm treatment to find a vet nearest to them. In order for AAU to cover costs it must be done at an AAU vet.\n\nI realize that this is all a lot to ask of a new adopter, but I promise you Tilly Marie is worth it. She just needs the right home with a loving, caring, patient family. She is going to make someone a wonderful, life-long friend. Please no cats.\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online. http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.",

            "description": "Bosco is a 1 1/2 year old (DOB 3/15/19) male Catahoula Leopard Dog with a handsome tan and charcoal coat.  Catahoulas are known for being intelligent, independent, loving, and gentle.  Bosco is very energetic and can easily scale a 6 foot fence.  He will need a lot of room to exercise, would be a great running or hiking partner, and will need to be contained at home with an invisible fence.  He still has some room to grow, so he should top out at about 65 lbs.  Due to his energy level, he will need an experienced owner.\n\nIf you would like an application go to our website (https://humanesocietypc.com/) and download one and email it back as a Word or PDF document. Please no Google documents.\n\nThis dog's adoption fee is $190. That fee includes spaying/ neutering, microchipping, deworming and vaccinations.",

            "description": "In honor of Cassie KramerI'm thrilled to sponsor the 'Cassie Kramer Transport'! This life-saving transport of these beautiful fur babies is dedicated to my sweet little Cassie Bear. We adopted Cassie (Meridith Hess) from Joyful Rescues in January 2019 after losing our sweet fur daughter Mandy at the age of 13 1/2. We were broken and Cassie has been healing our broken hearts. We love her so much and are so grateful to Joyful Rescues and the Hoss Transport for saving her life! Cassie wants to save more pups like she was saved from a high kill shelter in VA. The names of some of the pups are named after Cassie, our course, Mandy, and Frosty Bear (another of my beloved pups who have passed). Al was my Dad's who was always bringing stray dogs home when I was a little. He loved dogs and so began my love for them. Welcome the 'Cassie Kramer Transport'! JR Volunteer since 2012 - Cheryl Kramer\n\nBear and his siblings were born around July 12, 2020, and may top out in the 60-65 pound-range when done growing. These pups are happy, healthy, social babies that are ready to move in and liven up your lives! Have you ever snuggled with a hound puppy and their floppy ears? It is absolute heaven! The pup's mother, our Marlene, was also surrendered with the babies and she is a kind hearted, old soul, type of dog that is doing amazing in her new home. If you are interested in one of these adorable, sweet, kids keep in mind they are indeed hounds and you may want to do some reading about them if you are unfamiliar with the breed otherwise get your application in quick! Bear is an adorable red and white pup and we want to be sure you know that his tail had been broken at some point and has a pretty good kink in it making him unique! We have found that Bear adores most veggies and particularly delicata squash.\nThe Adoption Fee for this dog is $500.00\n\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.\n\nJoyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility. YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES\n\nWe keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list. If a pet is still showing, it is still available for adoption.\n\nCan't Adopt Me? SPONSOR ME\nLook for the Link 'Special Instructions to Seller' if you want to note a particular pet\nBefore you seek to adopt a pet from Joyful Rescues, please read our Pet Adoption page http://www.joyfulrescues.org/pet_adoption.html.\n\nOnline Application",

            "description": "Meet Rocket! Rocket is a shepherd mix. He is a very special guy!! Rocket presented symptoms of vomiting with every meal. The vet did a full work up and diagnosed him with Persistent Right Aortic Arch, which is causing a condition called Megaesophagus. He cannot eat properly without extensive assistance. He will require surgery to correct the arch. The goal is once the arch is gone, the esophagus has the opportunity to go back to normal so he can live a somewhat normal lifestyle. We have raised the money to get him surgery!!! He will be having it soon, and is ready for a forever home!! If you want a SUPER SPECIAL, spunky guy who loves life, ADOPT ROCKET!!!!The first step in our adoption process is an application. Once that is received, we will contact you to make an appointment to meet the animal. \n\nAdoption Applications can be completed at www.WFAHS.org",

            "description": "Beignet is a 4.5 yr old, 43 lb female Yellow Lab, spayed, microchipped, up-to-date on vaccines and currently being treated for heartworms by slow-kill. The slow kill method consists of a 28 day round of antibiotics (Doxycycline) and 3 consecutive months of monthly heartworm prevention (specifically Advantage Multi) after which she is eligible for immiticide treatment (injections) as recommended by her vet. More information on heartworm treatment available upon request. Beignet is a sweet, sweet girl and is definitely a companion dog. At this time, she seems more focused on the people in her foster home than the other dogs. Loves to be where you are. May be best suited as an only dog.  We do require good vet history and a fenced yard for approval. Fee: $200. Please submit an application online to be considered: http://secondchancedogrescuela.org/adopt-a-dog-2/adoption-application/, Thank you for sharing!",

I am very loving and human oriented! \nI am crate trained and housetrained, I am good with other dogs but at first encounters I let them know I want to call the shots. I am very loyal and once I bond with a human you are my best friend for ever and I will follow all your instructions and lead.  I am one of those dogs that look for instruction and leadership from my pet parent. How did I ended in rescue? My foster mom drives the same route to work every day, she used to see my friend Otto in the pics with me and me outside a mechanic shop. We were neglected and dirty. She asked him if he needed help with us and he surrendered us immediately! My foster mom wasn\u2019t even ready to take us but she was so afraid he would change his mind she immediately put is in her car and drove away!\nOtto and I are still best buddies but my foster mom thinks we will do well going to separate forever homes. Otto is very submissive to me and lets me get away with anything. \nWe love inquiries and questions through Petfinder but we receive so many is impossible for us to answer, the best way to contact us is visiting our website. There you can find an explanation of the adoption process/ fees /requirements and you can follow a link to fill an adoption application. Thanks!  Www.RociosRescues.org\nThanks for wanting to make a rescue dog a part of your family!!",

He has not found the right place for him because he requires a job or a friend and probably both. Jermaine would thrive in an active family setting with another pooch companion. He has undergone an intensive four week training program to help him make the best choices he can make. He\u2019ll be best with a family with children over 12 because he has a bite history. We understand the circumstances of the bite and would be happy to talk with you about it. Jermaine, in a nutshell, has been let down by humans. We think that Jermaine is ready for his family now that he has been in our care and we better understand his needs.  It is important that this little spark plug is set up to succeed, is in a environment that has a tight routine and his people are both compassionate and active.  There is no doubt that this little man will make a wonderful companion. He is crate friendly, but not cat friendly. If you are interested in meeting Jermaine, an application is a must.  Please take moment to fill out an application: https://www.povertyspets.org/adoption-form, once received, you will be contacted within 72 hours.  Jermaine has an adoption donation of $200.",

I have already mastered my crate training with flying colors! Im super clean and will go in right away when my foster mom asks me to. I am very food oriented too so teaching me tricks is an easy task. Im a great listener. Did I mention I am an awesome car rider? Well I am, car rides lead to Puppacinos! My favorite! I don't bark at people, cars or bikes during the ride, I just enjoy the view! \nI am super quiet and never leave the back seat unless you get off the car, then I want to follow you. I am dog friendly and love to play! \nCats might not be a good idea for me, my foster mom says I think they are toys and I could hurt one as I dont know the difference yet.  I am ready for my forever home! \nI We love inquiries and questions through Petfinder but we receive so many is impossible for us to answer, the best way to contact us is visiting our website. There you can find an explanation of the adoption process/ fees /requirements and you can follow a link to fill an adoption application. Thanks!  Www.RociosRescues.org\nThanks for wanting to make a rescue dog a part of your family!!",

            "description": "Meet Beau\nThis handsome boy needs you! Sweet, handsome, loyal Beau has been done wrong. Beau was originally surrendered after his owner\u2019s house burned down three years ago. Beau and his dad were living in a car. Knowing there was more for Beau in life, Beau was surrendered to us in the hopes of finding a loving home. For months Beau was despondent. \nThen after more than a year, an older couple came for Beau. Before they adopted, we said Beau\u2019s only issue is that he doesn\u2019t like other dogs. He\u2019s happy to just go out in the backyard and be with his people. We told them OVER AND OVER again and received assurance it wouldn\u2019t be an issue. They had a big back yard, which Beau LOVED. He was happy\u2026 until his owners tried to mingle him with other dogs and walk him through the neighborhood where dogs roamed off leash. Unfortunately, for Beau he was considered too hard to handle when aggressively approached by an unleashed dog, not once, but twice.  Beau gave his whole heart to his new family just to be brought back to the shelter for defending himself.  They didn\u2019t protect him and they didn\u2019t love him enough to keep him safe at home. So now this handsome and near perfect dog is back at the shelter, confused and sad all over again. \nBeau is a 5.7 year old retriever/hound mix. Since being back he\u2019s been incredibly sweet. He LOVES people, of all ages. He loves it when you sit in the yard with him. He loves sitting in the sun. Beau is house-trained and has wonderful house manners. He loves riding in a car and travels well. Beau is calm, sweet and affectionate. He\u2019s absolutely the best companion anyone could ask for. All Beau wants is to be with his people. He doesn\u2019t want dogs or cats, he doesn\u2019t ask for a lot. He truly just wants to belong to people who love him.\nIf you are looking for an incredible companion to welcome to your heart and home, Beau is ready. He\u2019s a love and he\u2019s just about perfect. He will make your every day that much better. \nCall 706-865-4135 for information on additional health services provided as part of the adoption fee.  If interested in one of our puppies or dogs, please submit an application online or at the shelter. Applications can be submitted online at: https://www.charlessmithgallhumanesociety.org/page/dog-adoption-application \nOnce an application is submitted online, you will receive an email saying your application has been successfully submitted.  If you don\u2019t receive this email within 24 hours, please check to make sure all application fields were completed or please call our shelter at 706-865-4135. All adopters must complete an approval process which involves a reference check with current/recent vet and a brief home visit if located in the immediate area. We do permit out of state adoptions. Adopters MUST come to the shelter to transport their new family member home. We do not ship nor do we transport them to their new homes. Adoption policies and application procedures are detailed at the shelter website: http://smithgallhumanesociety.org/ under tab All Adoptable Animals.\nCharles Smithgall Humane Society (CSHS) is a No kill shelter. Animals in our care remain safe with us until adopted. Resident animals are primarily owner relinquished and also accepted from local Animal Control. The facility usually is operating at capacity with a list of animals waiting for space to open.\nAdoptions and meet and greets are being scheduled by appointment only. Please call our office, email us or complete an application and someone will be in touch just as soon as they can. \nLocation: 4823 Helen Hwy., Sautee, GA 30571, Phone: 706-865-4135\nEmail: smithgallhumanesociety@windstream.net\nOur shelter in Sautee GA is located about 3 miles south of the alpine town of Helen in northeast GA.  \n\n",

He lives with 2 female Eskimos, likes toys, snuggling, cuddling, and lounging. \n\nHe has very firm boundaries - \u201cDon\u2019t touch my neck or booty!\u201d, and needs a bit of warm-up time when meeting new people. Blizzard definitely needs an Eskimo-savvy, adult home\u2026 NOT recommended for homes with young children or a lot of social traffic. \n\nThe adoption donation is $350 and includes a general vet exam, neuter surgery, heartworm testing and/or treatment (as necessary), shots, microchip, and worming. Experienced dog ownership and credible vet references are required in order to adopt from HER.\n\nInterested in Blizzard?

Maple loves riding in a car and seeing the world go by. \n\nMaple is 7 years old and 11 pounds.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Maple please fill out an adoption application on our website, wimberleywagrescue.org, and someone will contact you.\n\n\nThank you!",

Mambo is crate trained, house trained and has nice manners.  He walks well on a leash and enjoys outings.  Mambo has some skin allergies that are quite manageable with high quality food.

They fed her but when they realized no one was providing primary care for her, they reached out to find her a better life. When we got Jayne, she was skinny, full of fleas and parasites, and, not surprisingly, heartworm positive.\n\nJayne has been spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, and  is in treatment to kill the heartworms. She will be available for adoption in mid-January. Her adoption donation is $350 which includes 6 months heartworm preventative meds, free microchip registration, and a safety harness.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Jayne Doe, please review the adoption process and fill out the application on our website: www.wsrh.com\n\nAll dogs are available until \u201cAdoption Pending\u201d is noted next to their names. WSRH DOES NOT HAVE A PUBLIC SHELTER. ALL OF OUR DOGS ARE FOSTERED IN PRIVATE HOMES. Approved adopters only will be invited to meet the dogs.",

She was rescued in April and up until now she has been in a rehabilitation training to become a dog she was meant to be. \n\nWithin weeks, this beautiful girl named Princess George, went from being frozen and pancaked from fear, to going on leashed walks with the pack and opting to join the others inside the house, thanks to her newly found appreciation of having a roof over her head. She is still so timid, scares easily and will continue to need so much supportive care and patience. But, we do feel at this time we can begin the search for her Forever home. A few mandatory essentials for our applicants include:\n* prior large breed / Cane Corso experience.\n* another dog in the home who is well balanced with medium and respectful energy.\n* no children under the age of fifteen\n* a calm household.\n* a backyard that has fences and gates at least 6\u2019 high.\n* someone who is committed to ongoing training for an unforeseen amount of time. Our trainer will continue to be available as a resource.\nAnd last but certainly not least:\n* a kind, compassionate, intuitive heart who will have this girl\u2019s back and will promise to love and protect her every day for the rest of her days.\n\nPrincess George is a pure, gentle creature who loves other dogs as well as her crate. She will lean her whole body against your leg and make you feel like you are the luckiest human alive. She\u2019s around one-year-old and eighty pounds. She is a work in progress as are we all. Fully committed humans please apply.\n\nPlease submit adoption application through our website www.istandwithmypack.org/adopt\n",

            "description": "Wisconsin is a total sweetheart! Just a young girl herself at around 1 year old, she came to Labs and More with 10 puppies. She's now ready to get back to the business of being a young dog and is looking for a forever family to call her own. We think Wisconsin is a mix of Shepherd and a sight hound like Pharaoh Hound- just look at those big beautiful ears! True to her Hound breed, her hearing, sight and smell are all on point. Wisconsin is housetrained and crate trained in her current foster home. She gets along with other dogs and adores her people. She can be wary of new people and dogs but once she has a moment to warm up, she lets her guard down and her curious, affectionate, silly personality comes out. She will bark at strangers and alert you when someone unknown comes up to the house. She loves to play with toys and lounge on the couch at night with you and watch TV. Wisconsin is wonderful on leash, letting you set the pace, and is very smart and treat motivated. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting Wisconsin, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! If you are already approved with a coach or have adopted from us before, please reach out to your coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported, solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application. If you have any questions email us at doginfo@labsandmore.org or call us at 858-273-5386. Thank you for looking to a rescue group to fulfill your dream of adding a new dog to your life!

Once she feels safe and knows she can trust you, she really comes out of her shell. She only barks to alert you of strange things, and she loves to yawn in the morning. Were pretty sure she speaks fluent English, since she seems to understand EVERYTHING. You only have to tell this girl once. Shes entirely house broken and crate trained. However, shes not a fan of being left alone. Who is?! Even though shes fostering as an only child, she seems to tolerate cats and some other dogs. Shes great on a leash, and like a true Southern belle hates the cold and the rain. Always polite, she puts her paw on you to get your attention sometimes. She is a true gem.",

            "description": "PLEASE READ BIO BEFORE APPLYING\n\nBrooklyn was rescued from a shelter in San Bernardino. \n\nBrooklyn (Brookie) is approximately 4 years old and weighs about 35 lbs. Brookie is a semi feral dog. We have had her a while and never posted her because she is amazing with other dogs and she is who we use to temp test dogs and we have just let her be. We have worked with her off and on but just recently we started working with her more because we have had the time to focus on her and she is making great progress. We can corner her in an area and can leash her. She is doing great on the leash. We can get her on the couch with a leash and she will relax and we can pet her. She takes treats from our hand and follows us around. She will jump up on the back of our legs for attention. She is not a barker. She wants the attention and love so bad but doesnt know how to receive it. She jumps up on the bed and she will nudge my hand and roll over for me to pet her belly. We are looking for an adopter for her that will take the time to work with her. Brooklyn is a very special girl to us. She would do best in a home with at least one other dog and a yard. He best furfriend is Molly who is also available for adoption. \n\nBrooklyn is ready to make some family very happy. She is available for adoption now so if you would like to be making memories with Brookie, complete an application: http://petstablished.com/adoption_form/4362/generic",

Molly is a semi feral dog. We have had her a while and never posted her because she is amazing with other dogs and is very easy going. Recently we have started working with her more because we have had the time to focus on her and she is making great progress. We can corner her in an area and can leash her. She is doing great on walks. We can get her on the couch with a leash and she will relax and we can pet her. She takes treats from our hand and follows us around. She is not a barker. Molly jumps up on the bed and she will come up to me for pets and starts to play. We are looking for an adopter for her that will take the time to work with her. She would do best in a home with at least one other dog and a yard. Her best furfriend is Brooklyn who is also available for adoption. \n\nMolly is ready to have a family she can call hers. She is available for adoption now so if you would like to be making memories with Molly, complete an application: http://petstablished.com/adoption_form/4362/generic",

I am a very smart and sweet girl with LOTS of energy. My favorite thing to do is to play with squeaky toys (and explore my foster mom's trash can - we are still working on this one). I am leash reactive so I would appreciate more leash training and socializing. But I am house-trained and can show you some other tricks, such as sitting or going into my crate. I will even let you know when I need to go potty outside! I love to snuggle and prefer to spend time by your side. I am not sure about other dogs and cats yet so I will do best as your only pet. If you are looking for a dog who will fully appreciate your kindness and patience, please complete the adoption application on hsnb.org/adoptions. My fee is $200. Thank you!

While she was under a year she lived in the house with the family and they tell me she was potty trained at that point. The past year and a half to two years they have kept her in the backyard. She deserves so much more than that. She loves people and she lived with children seven years and up. She also lived with a small dog, she is not fond of medium to big dogs. She's a big girl, at least 65 - 70 pounds. She would make a great companion for running, hiking, camping or any adventure you can come up with.",

I\u2019m potty trained, do well on a leash, except when I see another dog or person - then I bark at them and pull a little.  I love car rides and do great in a car! I don\u2019t really care much for playing with other dogs and would do best in a calm home, with a calm dog or no other dogs.  I don\u2019t like to share my food, so feeding me separately is a must. Overall I\u2019m just a sweet heart that wants to love you and snuggle with you. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out our application here: http://www.rchsks.org/our-animals/adopt-a-pet/adopting-a-dog.  By filling out the application you are not committing yourself to adopting; it's a screening process that must be completed before you meet the dog. Please do this BEFORE calling.

Sadly, we are no longer able to respond to every application, but will contact the one that is a good match within 3 days.\nKokonut is a female chilhuahua mix, 7-8 yrs old and 7-8 lbs.  She is very sweet, low key and so precious.    She comes up to strangers alwauys wagging her tail. Kokonut appears to be housetrained and does well with submissive dogs.  She did have a dental cleaning with some extractions and a mass removal and is doing amazingly well recovering and getting ready for her forever home.    She also has an eye condition (luxated lens) so she is on eye meds, at this point it is too soon to say if she will need surgery in the future, but for now her eye is stable.   She also has a MPL (loose knee) but that does not bother her at all.\nMost of our dogs are not available to an out of the area adoption because of difficulty to follow up.  If you do not live within a 2 hr drive of Orange County, please email us before applying to see if the dog you are interested is may be a candidate for long distance adoption.    We only make consider long distance adoptions for dogs who have been in our rescue for 6 plus months with no local candidates.\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our rescues, please visit our main website for adoption procedures at www.pupsandpals.net and then fill out our application.  Please note that we are all volunteers so it may take up to 3 days to process your application, but you will hear back from us if your application is a good match for the pet. \nWe do not have a shelter so individual appointments must be made to meet the pet you are interested in.  Our pets are fostered/boarded all over LA and Orange County.  \nThis pet is altered, vaccinated, microchipped, and has had a brief temperament evaluation to help us determine what type of  a home he/she would thrive in.  Please note that we put lots of time and effort to make sure our pets are ready to be someone's perfect pet before they go home.... and to make sure that we will have the best possible match for this pet we do require an : application, interview, adoption fee and in some case a home check.  \nListed for adoption: 11/20/2020\nAdoption fee: $250\nPLEASE DO NOT call or email to see if a pet is available.  We update our pages daily so if he/she is pictured here in the available dogs section, we are accepting applications at this time.",

They could be transported to Colorado for the right home!!!\n\nZayla and Tuxedo were found on a property where they were fending for themselves due to an unfortunate situation that had been going on for quite a while. A wonderful group of people made it their mission to save these 2 senior dogs along with several other animals that were left on the property, and they are now at a shelter waiting for a new home and family and happier days. \n\nTuxedo is the handsome 11 year old Chow-Shepherd mix with a wonderful personality. He is starving for attention and love, and will nudge at you to keep petting him if you stop. He will even try to get all of his 60 pounds up into your lap if you let him. He has some arthritis and could stand to lose a few pounds, but he couldn\u2019t be any sweeter!\n\nZayla is 14 years old and we think she is a Lab-Shepherd mix. She is the shyer of the 2, and looks to Tuxedo for reassurance and comfort. Zayla will warmup to people given time, patience and a gentle touch. If you crouch down and talk to her, her little tail will start going and you\u2019ll know you are winning her over. Her arthritis is pretty advanced so we are looking for a home where she doesn\u2019t have to navigate too many stairs. \n\nThis sweet old pair has been through thick and thin together, so we are trying to find them a loving home together where they can be spoiled and live out their retirement as cherished furry family members. We think they would do fine with other respectful dogs. We are partnering with Stray Hearts Animal Shelter - Taos, NM to find Zayla and Tuxedo the retirement home of their dreams. Finding a home for a senior bonded pair can be hard, so please help us spread the word so that we can help make it happen. And if you are interested potentially adopting this amazing duo please fill out our online adoption survey: https://www.olddogsnewdigs.com/adoption-survey/\nThanks!!!\n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior pets have a history of being kept up to date on vaccines, annual exams and recommended bloodwork. We also do home checks to make sure that your home environment meets the needs of the particular dog you are interested in.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adoption, please fill out our online adoption survey at https://www.olddogsnewdigs.com/adoption-survey/\n\n",

            "description": "Caprese\nSuch a beautiful name for a beautiful girl.  We are guessing Caprese is 5 years old. She is a stunning gray brindled catahoula mix.  Her coat is so unique.   She and her brother Gravy were found on a busy highway laying beside their friend who had been hit by a car.  The lady that found them was sweet but a dog hoarder of sorts.  Her daughter finally got her to release them to rescue.  Gravy is living his dream life in New England.  Caprese stayed behind to be treated for a light case of heart worms but is now clear and in foster care in Bristol, RI.  She loves to walk and sniff and enjoy life.  She rides beautifully in a car.  She will need basic potty training but should catch on quickly.  Her brother was extremely shy and he is doing great with potty training.  I stay in contact with his sweet mom. She is an amazing girl and we are looking for an amazing family who realizes what a prize she is.  If you would like more info about Caprese please reach out.  Nobody gives better butterfly kisses than she does. However, she would need to be the only dog in the home.  She is fine with cats but if other dogs come at her quickly she will bare her teeth and growl as a defense.  She lived in my house beautifully with my 3 dogs and my kitten. She just is not the type of dog for a play date or a dog that rushes up to her and is all in her face.  She did well with children but think she would be better in a less active household without kids.  A calm household would be great for her.  I think this is due to the hard life she led before we rescued her.  She lived with many dogs in my barnyard kennels in free life style.  There was never an issue but she was the boss.  Don't let this dissuade you from asking about her.  She is amazing and deserves that forever home.  She would do best in a fenced yard for her potty training.  Before she left for Rhode Island, she moved inside with her Louisiana foster mom for almost 3 weeks before she left for New England and came to work with me for 7 days.  She met many customers and loved them all.  She is a beautiful girl with a stunning unique coat (almost Tiger like) that will make a great loving pet for that special home.\n\nAdoption fees details:\u00a0\nPuppies - Adults $ 550, Seniors $375.

I was surrendered to the shelter by my former family because I was unable to keep food down and was losing a lot of weight. Luckily, I was rescued by Herding Haven and was given the medical care I needed.  It turns out that I have a rare neuro-muscular disease called Myasthenia Gravis.  It causes a complication called Megaesophagus which makes it hard for me to keep food down.  Fortunately, there is a medication that can treat this disease and since I have been on it I am doing so much better!  I still have to eat my meals (3 x day) in a special chair called a Bailey Chair (see picture).  But enough of the medical stuff.  Let me tell you about ME!  I am small in stature but big in personality.  I love car-rides, snuggle time walks and hikes.  I am never far-from your side (and would prefer that you are not far from mine!).  I crate-trained and will even sleep in the crate at night (although I would much rather share your pillow!). I enjoy playing with other dogs but would rather have my person all to myself in my new home.  I am spayed and up-to-date on my vaccinations.  If you would like to meet me (and why wouldn't you?), please contact kathie@herdinghaven.org",

He is about eight years old (middle aged), likes moderate (not long) walks, is good on a leash, and glues himself to one person.  He is already neutered and just needs his vaccines and heartworm updated.  If you can work with a slightly quirky but affection dog, send us an email at catsnortheast@outlook.com and tell us a little about yourself.  Vet references are required.",

Carlo is a 2 year old German Shepherd who weighs 80 lbs. This fun packed pooch doesn't have a care in the world and gallops along making new friends along the way. Carlo is great with other dogs and new people he meets. He came to us with no training under his belt, so he has a lot to learn. But the good news is, he's very food motivated and catches on very quickly! Carlo will do best in a home experienced with large breed dogs and someone who would like to take him through obedience training so he can get a few more skills under his belt. Carlo would love to go on daily outings such as long walks or hikes. He's truly magnificent with his long thick black tail and lanky build. No small kids due to his size and a home with some space and a yard would be ideal.\n\nCarlo's adoption fee is $350 and that includes his neuter, registered microchip, vaccines current, deworming and flea treatment. Apply to meet him at www.lovebugsrescue.org",

They are gentle souls who will give gentle kisses and are already spayed/neutered and microchipped; they just need their vaccines and heartworm test updated.  They need a fenced yard as they have no leash skills.  Zena is more independent and is crazy about chasing balls; Mishi is more of a clinger and gets anxious when left alone.

While she may have only one eye and 3 legs (one of the 3 is deformed), she's a very sweet girl looking for a quiet place to spend her golden years.\n\nDaisy is a happy girl who loves car rides & going for a swim! She's housetrained and very easy going, even a little goofy! She knows a few commands like Sit and Lay Down, too.\n\nDaisy is great with cats! But she is a grumpy with other dogs so we would like her to be the only dog in her new home.\n\nIf you'd like to meet sweet Daisy Lou, please fill out an adoption application at www.ehrdogs.org and be sure to ask for DAISY LOU!",

Please read before emailing with questions.\nDue to the health risks with Covid 19, we are unable to hold our monthly meet and greet group gatherings. \n\nTo continue to place our rescue pups with Families in the immediate Austin area we are asking interested adapters to fill out our online application. We have dogs coming in and being adopted on a regular basis. \n\nFilling out our application in advance allows us to have your application approved\nAnd ready to go when a dog comes in that meets the applicants requirements. Then we are able to provide the adopter with all the information we have and immediately set up an individual meeting.  If that meeting goes well and everyone is in agreement we start our normal one week trial adoption. \n\nAdoption applications should be filled out to expedite the process:\nhttp://www.lilpaws-malteserescue.org/joomla/adoption/adoption-application.html\n\nAdoption fee $450\n** The Texas Comptroller now requires sales tax on adoption fees.\n\n*** Suspended due to COVID ***\nMonthly Meet & Greets  (12:00 - 2:00)\nPetco (in Leander) every 1st Saturday of the month\nPet Supplies Plus (Parmer & Mopac) every third Saturday of the month\n\n\n** Please note: Due to their size, our dogs are not suitable for homes with children under 5..\n\nWe do not have a facility, all dogs are fostered in the homes of our volunteers. If you are interested in adopting a dog from Lil' Paws Maltese Rescue and other Petite Paws, please visit our website at www.lilpaws-malteserescue.org and fill out an adoption application. This is the first step in our adoption process. Our goal is to place our dogs in safe, stable and loving homes in the Austin Metropolitan area. Thanks for looking!\n\nLil' Paws Maltese Rescue and other Petite Paws depends on donations to keep the dogs in our program healthy. Many health issues are taken care of before a dog leaves a rescue: spaying, neutering, immunizations, dental care, and in some cases major surgery. Because of the cost of this care, donations are essential to enable us to continue our work. If you would like to show appreciation for what we do and help us continue to do it please go to our website homepage and click the donate button. We thank you in advance for your support.",
