Unfortunately I find myself her because I didn't get along with my fur siblings. It's ok, don't be sad for me. That just means that I can find a family that I can have all their love to myself and not have to share. I am so excited about that. I do get a little nervous when I am by myself because I want to be with everyone so we can have some fun times. I am fully housebroken. I do know my manners but when I am happy and excited, I just need to be reminded. Can you blame me, I love people!!! And guess what, I even like chickens and ducks. So if you want to cuddle with me and let me love on you, please don't take to long to let NJBR know. I just can't wait to be part of your family.\n\nIf you want to know more about me that contact Barbara at BarbaraABoxer@gmail.com\n\nHolly\nFemale\nAge: 7\nDogs: No\nCats: Yes - Chickens & Ducks\nKids: 10+",

I just joined the Almost Home Foundation family and am now in a foster home waiting for my forever family. Puppies are a bit like babies...we are cute and adorable, but we require a lot of work and attention. We need help with socialization and housebreaking and should not be left alone for too long, as this could cause social and dysfunctional problems later on. Do you think you are the right person to take on the job? Then come meet me at the next adoption show or email AHF.\nThe adoption fee is $475 which includes deworming, microchipping, 3 sets of puppy shots, rabies and neuter when old enough. After his/her neuter, you will get a $55 refund.\nEmail: puppies@almosthomefoundation.org\n\nAlmost Home Foundation's adoption requirements:\n(1) Be at least 21 years of age;\n(2) Have the consent of all adults living in the household;\n(3) Have approval from the residence owner;\n(4) Have valid ID with current address;\n(5) Be approved by Almost Home Foundation as a suitable adoptive home; and\n(6) Live in the suburbs surrounding Schaumburg (Illinois Residents only)\n*** Please note that Almost Home Foundation accepts only cash or checks for adoption fees; we do not accept debit or credit cards. ***",

I just joined the Almost Home Foundation family and am now in a foster home waiting for my forever family. Puppies are a bit like babies...we are cute and adorable, but we require a lot of work and attention. We need help with socialization and housebreaking and should not be left alone for too long, as this could cause social and dysfunctional problems later on. Do you think you are the right person to take on the job? Then come meet me at the next adoption show or email AHF.\nThe adoption fee is $475 which includes deworming, microchipping, 3 sets of puppy shots, rabies and neuter when old enough. After his/her neuter, you will get a $55 refund.\nEmail: puppies@almosthomefoundation.org\n\nAlmost Home Foundation's adoption requirements:\n(1) Be at least 21 years of age;\n(2) Have the consent of all adults living in the household;\n(3) Have approval from the residence owner;\n(4) Have valid ID with current address;\n(5) Be approved by Almost Home Foundation as a suitable adoptive home; and\n(6) Live in the suburbs surrounding Schaumburg (Illinois Residents only)\n*** Please note that Almost Home Foundation accepts only cash or checks for adoption fees; we do not accept debit or credit cards. ***",

If you would like to meet him please visit him there!\n\nGrant is one handsome guy! This high-energy pup loves to tear apart toys, check out the new smells in an area, and use his brain for engaging activities. He would love room to run and chase toys off leash and the opportunity to learn some more behaviors with positive reinforcement training!\n\nWe are open to the public on a first come, first serve basis and are limiting our capacity to 50% in order to keep both our staff and community safe during this pandemic. HSP continues to provide an essential service to the community by intaking pets in need and finding adoptive homes. In order to continue operations, we must reduce the potential spread of the virus by taking extra precautions. We ask that all visitors entering HSP facilities wear appropriate face or mask coverings while maintaining at least a 6 foot social distance.\n\nFor more information on any of our Adoptable Pets, please visit our live website www.humanepinellas.org.  If you have questions on specific animals, please call 727-797-7722.  Our website is live so if an animal appears on the website, it is currently at the shelter.  However, the website does not reflect  adoptions in process or holds which have been placed for meet and greets on animals.  We suggest if you are coming to meet just one animal, please call first.",

If you would like to meet him please visit him there!\n\nBuster is a big boy with a lot of energy! This handsome pup is currently undergoing treatment for his heartworms and can't wait until he is done and is able to run around and play with dogs again. In the meantime, exercising his brain with games, training, and interactive toys will help him feel more satisfied!\n\nWe are open to the public on a first come, first serve basis and are limiting our capacity to 50% in order to keep both our staff and community safe during this pandemic. HSP continues to provide an essential service to the community by intaking pets in need and finding adoptive homes. In order to continue operations, we must reduce the potential spread of the virus by taking extra precautions. We ask that all visitors entering HSP facilities wear appropriate face or mask coverings while maintaining at least a 6 foot social distance.\n\nFor more information on any of our Adoptable Pets, please visit our live website www.humanepinellas.org.  If you have questions on specific animals, please call 727-797-7722.  Our website is live so if an animal appears on the website, it is currently at the shelter.  However, the website does not reflect  adoptions in process or holds which have been placed for meet and greets on animals.  We suggest if you are coming to meet just one animal, please call first.",

She loved me so so much though! Now I am looking for a new forever home where I will be loved just as much as I was in my first home.\n\nI\u2019m a firecracker, frisky, zealous, lively, and high spirited! I really enjoy playing, and would love to entertain you with my antics! Exercise keeps me happy and content, without it I can get a little worked up. I do best when I have had a chance to get my energy out so that I can be calm later. Going for walks, engaging in play and doing outdoor activities with my new family daily would make me very happy!\n\nI would make a great playmate but would also love to join you on the couch, I\u2019m happy either way! I can\u2019t think of anything better than getting love and attention from my family! Affection is my middle name! When its chill time, forget the couch or the bed, lying in your cozy lap would make me happiest! Nothing would make me happier than to find a family to devote myself to! You won\u2019t find a more dedicated, loving companion!\n\nWhile I do get along with people I know, due to my size / age / personality I would do best in a home without young children. I also need to be an only pet. Though I can tolerate being around a select few, I don\u2019t play well with other dogs or cats. I really just need to be the center of your world!\n\nI adore snuggling! But I don\u2019t share my cuddles with just anyone, I prefer to get to know you a bit first! It takes me a little bit of time to become comfortable with new people so please allow me a bit of time to warm up to you, trust me, you won't regret it. Once I know I am home I will do my famous 'wiggle butt jumps' for you to show you how happy I am!\n\nIf you think we may be a good match, or you would like to get to know me better, please click the Adoption Application button below my profile on the rescue website and you will be contacted by an adoption counselor!  Here is the link > https://www.smallbreedrescue.org/Animal/AnimalDetails/162\n\nDue to home introductions that are part of the adoption process, we can only accept applications for interested parties who are in or near San Diego County, California at this time.",

Lincoln completed a four-week stay & train and is now settling in at his foster home. While he was in training, he worked on socialization and obedience.\nAlthough he has shown improvement and can behave appropriately with other dogs, we are looking for a home that does NOT have any other pets. Lincoln has some prey drive and resource guarding and will do best being the only animal in his new home. He will require a home with structure, consistency, and large breed dog experience.\nPotential adopters must be local to Cleveland, Ohio (within 1 hour or less) to utilize continued training support. We are also requiring a fully fenced in yard and no children visiting often or living in the home (children 14 years and older are okay depending on their energy level).\nLincoln is crate trained and house broken.  He is a really fun and playful guy who has a lot of love and kisses to spare. He enjoys taking walks and is great on a leash.  He loves toys and treats too! If you meet the requirements above, please complete an adoption application for approval to determine if Lincoln would be a great fit for your home.\n\nbirthday: 10/15/2017\n\nage: 3 years\n\nadoption fee: $400\n\nTo contact Multiple Breed Rescue for further information or to have an adoption application sent to you by email, click the green ASK ABOUT button above.

No out of state applications at this time please.\nFred has beautiful big brown eyes and cute little floppy ears! He is around 40 lbs. We believe Fred used to spend quite a bit of time outside so he is unsure of what it is like being inside a home. He does fine on car rides and was excited to check out his new indoor digs. He is in one of our foster homes where he is learning to potty only outside and doing good. He is great when being crated and will sleep through the night.\nFred is friendly with dogs of all sizes and is good with meeting new people.  He is energetic and enjoys being outdoors and going on neighborhood walks.  He could use some work on leash training because he will pull when he gets excited.  Overall Fred is a great dog, happy with an easy going temperament.\n\nage: 6 years\n\nadoption fee:  $350\n\nTo contact Multiple Breed Rescue for further information or to have an adoption application sent to you by email, click the green ASK ABOUT button above.

He loves his toys especially his tennis balls and stuffed animals.\n\nHe is very sweet and gentle around kids. \nGood with other dogs that The foster family has had him around but they are sure about cats as they don\u2019t have any. \n\n* We do not have the availability to cat test him *\n\nWhiskey LOVES to cuddle and go for long walks. He does well on leash and great in his crate when he can see you. He does not however do well in the crate when he\u2019s left alone or out of sight from you.  Whiskey does have some separation anxiety which he has recently been to the vet to have evaluated and the fosters have been trying to work him through it but he will still need some work. \n\nWe highly recommend a dog savy home where Whiskey will not be left alone for long hours of the day. We also recommend that the new home have some experience handling separation anxiety or are willing to put the work in to discuss curbing it with their vet or a trainer. \n\nWe also recommend that he not be the only dog in the home or if he is that the new adopted owner or family would be willing to put in the extra work as far as socialization and both mental and physical exercise.\n\nAdoption fee: $350\n\nPresently in foster near Brick, NJ\n\nIf interested please apply at CompassRoseRescue.org",

Sadie Belle is almost fifteen years old Maltese.  She tips the scale at 2.6 lbs.  \nSadie Belle is healthy with no medical issues.  On cold days she is a little slower jumping out of bed but what senior lady doesn\u2019t?\n\nSadie Belle will sit on your lap or beside you as long as you can give ear rubs.  She can also be \u201clittle miss independent\u201d and spend time alone in her bed.  Sadie Belle exercises by exploring the house.  On sunny days, she likes to spend a short, supervised time in the yard.  She is house trained to pee pads.\n\nSadie Belle has no teeth but it does not keep her from eating her kibble.  She also likes tiny puppy cookies.\n\nSadie Belle is spayed.  She is heart worm negative and on a preventative.  She is current on all her vaccinations and is microchipped.\n\nSadie gets along well with other dogs.  She is not appropriate for a home with young children.  Sadie would be perfect for a senior. \n\nAdoption fee $350\n** The Texas Comptroller now requires sales tax on adoption fees.\n\n** Temporarily Suspended due to COVID **\nMonthly Meet & Greets  (12:00 - 2:00)\nPetco (in Leander) every 1st Saturday of the month\nPet Supplies Plus (Parmer & Mopac) every third Saturday of the month\n\n\n** Please note: Due to their size, our dogs are not suitable for homes with children under 5..\n\nWe do not have a facility, all dogs are fostered in the homes of our volunteers. If you are interested in adopting a dog from Lil' Paws Maltese Rescue and other Petite Paws, please visit our website at www.lilpaws-malteserescue.org and fill out an adoption application. This is the first step in our adoption process. Our goal is to place our dogs in safe, stable and loving homes in the Austin Metropolitan area. Thanks for looking!\n\nLil' Paws Maltese Rescue and other Petite Paws depends on donations to keep the dogs in our program healthy. Many health issues are taken care of before a dog leaves a rescue: spaying, neutering, immunizations, dental care, and in some cases major surgery. Because of the cost of this care, donations are essential to enable us to continue our work. If you would like to show appreciation for what we do and help us continue to do it please go to our website homepage and click the donate button. We thank you in advance for your support.",

CALLING, EMAILING, AND USING THE \"CONTACT US\" LINK ON PETFINDER ARE NOT USEFUL. WE MAY BE TOO BUSY TO ANSWER ANY INQUIRES.\n\nRose and siblings were found in Texas, dumped in a field in freezing weather, found by a good samaritan, and rescued to Maryland.  Sweet and playful, currently about 10 weeks old, about 8 pounds (expected to be about 35-40 pound dogs).  They are probably part terrier/part pit bull, part something else but 100 percent adorable.\n\n\nAPPLY AT ALMOSTHOMEDOGS.ORG\n\nThe adoption fee for puppies less than 6 months old is $350, which includes the cost of routine vetting, including age appropriate vaccinations, worming, flea/tick preventative and spay/neuter. Puppies under 4 months of age may go to adoptive homes before they are spayed/neutered. Adopters who choose to adopt a puppy that has not yet been spayed/neutered are subject to an additional deposit of $100 (refundable upon proof of spay/neuter.) Included in the adoption fee, the rescue will arrange spay/neuter by a partner vet at a predetermined appointment when the puppy is between 4-6 months of age. It is the responsibility of the adopter to bring the adopted puppy back to the rescue vet for spaying/neutering or to send verification from their own vet that the puppy had been spayed/neutered.\u00a0 All of our dogs will be microchipped.\n\nBecause our dogs are in foster homes, applications are required prior to setting up any appointments. Calling or emailing may delay your consideration. Find our application on our website, almosthomedogs.org, then click on \"Adopt\" tab at top\n\nWe are a non profit no kill 501 (c)3 rescue. Please understand that we do our best to describe our dogs but often we rescue them with virtually no information about them and often our best educated guess can be challenging.

No out of state applications at this time please.\nHave you ever heard the expression \u201cGentle Giant?\u201d  Well this is him in canine form. Bubs is a little over 90 pounds of snuggles and love. He is house trained, about 6 years old and really enjoys his naps! But when he is awake, he is sweet and loves to go outside. Walks would be great for Bubs as he could stand to lose a few pounds. He pulls on the leash and needs some leash training. Please note that we have learned that Bubs can get over a 4-foot fence. We would prefer his new home has a 6-foot fenced in yard or that we know that his new parent(s) will always be attentive when he is outside.  He is cat friendly and has not shown any aggression.\nBubs loves laying on the couch and sleeping in bed with his humans, but he also is very happy having alone time on the floor. If you are considering welcoming a larger sized dog into your home like Bubs, you will need plenty of space for him to lounge. He is very gentle, but his current foster has not had an opportunity yet to \u201ckid test\u201d him.\n\nage:  6 years\n\nadoption fee:  $300\n\nTo contact Multiple Breed Rescue for further information or to have an adoption application sent to you by email, click the green ASK ABOUT button above.

At this time we are not taking any more applications for him as we have over 60 at the moment.\nWe will remove this notice if we open applications again.  Thank you for your understanding****\n\n\n\n\n\nHi my name is Chewy! Well, this is the name that I like and respond to best :)\n\nI was surrendered to the rescue by my previous owner and I am now looking for my true forever home.\n\nI\u2019m happy go lucky, carefree, engaging, adaptive, and cheerful. I like to take my time approaching new situations. While I am a bit shy with new faces and places, I warm up as I become more familiar with my environment. While I do get along with others, due to my size / age / personality I would do best in a home with no children.\n\nMy foster parents have been helping me to learn manners or what we call 'Petiquette'. Sometimes I have trouble controlling my excitement and impulses. I have a tendency to be a bit pushy and can play a little rough with other small dogs but I'm finally figuring it out.\n\nBeing a young dog, exercise keeps me happy and content, without it I can get a little worked up. I do best when I have had a chance to get my energy out so that I can be calm later. Going for walks, engaging in play and doing outdoor activities with my new family daily would make me very happy! And when it's time to chillax, forget the couch or the bed, lying in your cozy lap is where I want to be!\n\nI would do well with some additional positive reinforcement training especially socializing with new people. I will require regular grooming and annual vet checks so the more comfortable I am around people, the better these experiences will be for everyone!\n\nIf you think we may be a good match, or you would like to get to know me better, please click the Adoption Application button below my profile on the rescue website and you will be contacted by an adoption counselor!  Here is the link > https://www.smallbreedrescue.org/Home/AnimalDetails/176\n\nDue to home introductions that are part of the adoption process, we can only accept applications for interested parties who are in or near San Diego County, California at this time.",

I love to cuddle at night, in the morning, after breakfast, before my walk, after dinner, in the car, and anytime in between. I've learned lots of new tricks, but walking on a leash is still a bit of a challenge, because everything is so interesting! I've made a ton of improvements though and I'm getting better every day. The best is when I get to run free at the dog park and the little dogs let me play with them and chase them around. For some reason, cats and other little furry animals don't like it as much when I chase them. My foster mom says I jump so high that I must be part gazelle, whatever that is. So I need a tall fence to keep me from exploring where I shouldn't. Despite my size, I'm still a puppy and have lots of puppy wiggles to get out, but after that, can we cuddle? My adoption fee is $350. I am up to date on all my shots, spayed and microchipped. I am currently undergoing heartworm treatment, so local adoptions only please. Don't worry about my heart, it's still full of love to give. Fill out an app at www.soca-fbc.org under the adoptable tab.",

Due to the current regulations set forth by Governor Pritzker on group gatherings we will not be having adoption events until further notice. As an all foster based rescue this means that all meets will be by appointment only. Your whole family must be available to attend the meet as there will be no second meets scheduled to help limit contact between our team and the public. To help streamline the process please make sure your current pets are up to date, you have landlord/HOA approval, and that you are prepared to take the dog home with you immediately before submitting an application. Thank you & Please stay safe!***\n\nTool Box just arrived from a rescue partner in KY. Her foster says: She's a very happy, mellow dog. She loves to sleep at our feet during the day and to sleep her in bed in our room at night. She will whimper to be let outside, but has yet to bark. She's very sweet, great around cats, and kids. We do not have a dog, but probably also very good around calm/trained dogs. Enjoys short walks and walks well on a leash.\n\nSadly, Tool Box\narrived Heartworm positive so Magnificent Mutts will be treating her. After treatment she will go on to lead a normal happy life. Her only restriction is her adopters will need to keep her activity to\n\na minimum as he goes through the 30 days rest after Heartworm treatment.\n\nCheck back for more information and possible restrictions once she fully settles into foster care.\n\nIf you are interested in adoption, please complete the Application to Adopt which you can find on our website (\nwww.magnificentmutts.org\n) No phone calls please. Emails only.\n\nAdoption Donation $300 (cash only)\n\nPlease visit www.magnificentmutts.org for the online dog or cat application.\n\nAdoption Fees*\n\nAdult cats starting at $125, Kittens starting at $165.\nDogs/Puppies starting at $225 minimum\nPrices subject to change, please contact for specific adoption donations.",

He was picked up as a stray and brought to a local animal control facility, where he ended up on the dreadful \"urgent list\" through no fault of his own. He quickly became one of the staff favorites. Those who know Kodac say he is a very sweet and friendly boy, who likes all people and gets along well with dogs he meets. We don't know how he is with cats. Because we don't know much about Kodac's past, if he goes to a home with kids, they should be older, dog savvy kids (10+ years and older). Kodac would make an excellent addition to any home. Check out the video on his webpage to see just how handsome he really is.

            "description": "Fia / Female / 8 Years / 59 lbs / Street Mix / North York\n\nMeet Fia! Fia comes to us all the way from Puebla City, Mexico! Fia was found living in shelter that did not have the resources to support its residents. The conditions were very poor and as a senior, Fia was not able to live her golden years like every dog should. Lucky for her she was rescued and flown to Canada in search of a very special family of her own!\n\nFia is always happy to start a new day and will greet her humans in the morning with a wagging tail. She loves to explore with her nose when she is outside or out for walks. She doesn\u2019t have an interest in toys but she will find any warm blanket to curl up for a nap. She may never be a running or hiking partner, but she makes a loyal companion for slow walks and relaxing at home.\n\nEven though Fia is 8 years young, she has not had the best experience with humans prior to her loving foster home. She can be very timid when new people enter her space and she will avoid eye contact or interacting with them. On walks if strangers pass her closely, she will do what she can to avoid them. After multiple meetings she may chose to come over for a sniff, but petting will be on her terms. Adopters will need to have realistic expectations when meeting her as it will take time earn her trust. She is never aggressive so she may do well with older, dog savvy children that will respect her space as needed.\n\nFia loves her crate and will settle right away when left alone. She is naturally well mannered in the home and never has accidents. She is currently going for 3-4 walks a day about 20 minutes in duration, but could go longer if it were warmer outside. She is low energy so is overall a low maintenance dog. She walks beautifully on leash and is not reactive to anything.\n\nFia is an adaptable dog and can thrive in any living environment. She needs patient family that accepts her for her insecurities and can slowly help her through them at her pace. She may never be a dog that loves a high activity household, so a quiet, predictable environment is preferred. She gets along with all dogs as long as they are respectful and don't get in her face. She has not been tested with cats but has no desire to chase small animals.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Fia please apply at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/adoption-info#adoption-form\n\nFia\u2019s adoption fee is $420.

            "description": "SAMPSON ~6 years old. Good with kids and dogs. Cats TBD.\n\nGSRA adopts to residents of VA, NC, and SC\n\nHandsome Sampson came to GSRA after living a vagabond life in western NC-he had a home of sorts, but was left on his own to come and go as he pleased, and he received no regular vet care. This means that when he finally landed in the shelter for good (after being a frequent flier for years), he had a few health issues that needed to be addressed-he was absolutely miserable from a long-standing ear infection, and was also heartworm positive. The shelter did a wonderful job of starting to address both problems, but when it became clear that Sampson would need specialty care to really clear his ear infections, they reached out to GSRA to help.\n\nWe were happy to offer it! Sampson has been HAPPY to trade his free-wheeling former lifestyle for life as an inside dog with an established routine, regular meals, and soft beds. He's a medium energy guy who enjoys walks (on-leash these days!), car rides, meeting new people and dog friends, and chasing anything you'll throw. But when it's time to just hang out in the house, he's also happy to be your Netflix binge-buddy. He would do fine in a multi-dog household but would also be fine as an only dog, as long as his people were around much of the time. He's also trustworthy left loose in the house while you're away. If its not clear he's pretty much perfect, it should be!!!\n\nChronic ear infections can take a few months to clear during the best of time, and the covid pandemic is causing most vet clinics (including specialty clinics) to operate with reduced staff. These things combined mean that Sampson won't be truly ready for adoption until March or later. But even if he can't join your family just yet, we thought you'd want to meet him. :-)\n\nFor more information on our adoptable pet list please visit: Adoptable Pet List\n\nPlease join us at our next Event(s):\n\nCurrent Scheduled Events:",

She was born deaf, but knows many\nhand signals and is very smart. She is pure affection with her people,\nvery loyal and attached. She will do best as the only dog in a home, as\nshe needs a lot of belly rubs all to herself. When given a proper\nintroduction with other dogs, she does very well going on walks and hikes\nwith them. At least once a week volunteers take her hiking with various\nother shelter pups and she does great. However, she did not do well with\nthe other female blue healer in her previous home, who was a bit of an\naggressor and would often startle Tank, and if she slipped out of the\nhouse unattended, we are told that she can get overexcited when\nencountering other dogs and that can lead to problems. But if kept on a\nleash and given a calm and secure environment, she has only done well in\nour care. She is very strong, but well mostly well mannered on a leash.\n\nClaire Hanson\nBlue Mountain Humane Association\nOffice: 541-963-0807\n\nTHIS IS A COURTESY LISTING. HUNAH IS NOT PLACING THIS DOG.

Male Mix\nneeds children to be 12 years or older\nneeds a fenced in yard\nneeds a local adoptor (Dayton, Cincinnati, Columbus areas)\n\n\nMore On This Pup:\n\nHi there! My name is Max, short for Maximus Minimus as I have maximum personality in a minimum body. I am a very sweet and cuddly boy who is about 6 years old and weighs about 10lbs. I do have a heart murmur, but the vet says it just needs to be watched to make sure I don\u2019t start having trouble with it. I love to cuddle on laps, and in blankies. I am about 80% house broken and will potty outside as long as my people pay attention to when I get restless and want to go to the door.\n\nI love snuggling down in my foster mom\u2019s or dad\u2019s laps and love attention. I get along well with other dogs and cats, but would prefer a home without children under the age of 12. About the only bad habits I have are wanting to be left alone when eating or when I am sound asleep buried in my blankie.\n\nIf you are looking for a little buddy who will be your lap snuggler and companion\u2026 I am your boy. Won\u2019t you consider making me your furever friend? I will give you all the love and snuggles you could want if you do.\n\nSincerely, Max\n\nMax is being fostered in Miamisburg by Tracy.\n\nContact this foster home at polarbear@woh.rr.com\n\nTo Adopt This Pup:\n\nGo to PPR's Applications Page at www.puppypalsrescue.com and apply!\n\nPlease email the foster home to let them know you have applied, as sometimes forms seem to get lost in cyberspace.",

My babies and I were brought to a shelter where we remained until Take Paws Rescue broke us out. My five little ones and I went into a foster home where we were showered with love. My babies have all been adopted, so now it\u2019s my turn! \n\nMy foster mom says that although I look like a German Shepherd, my personality is, to a t, that of a husky (I can only assume that means huskies have fantastic personalities). I\u2019m full grown at 45 lbs. While there\u2019s no way to know my age for sure, they believe I\u2019m about 3 years old. I\u2019m house broken, kennel trained and even know a couple commands (sit and paw). I love kids and dogs my size, but I would do best in a home with no small animals, including small breed dogs and cats. \n\nI\u2019m up to date on vaccines and scheduled to be heartworm tested and spayed on 1/25 and 1/27, respectively. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

He has gotten along with all the dogs, cats unknown does great with adults and older children young babies unknown. Chief needs basic training has a wonderful playful temperament. Recently neutered in Jan 2021 , up to date on vaccines, and chipped.\n\nALL adoptions are done FACE TO FACE, we DO NOT ship dogs out, adopters are responsible to travel if they live outside the Fairbanks area, everyone in the family including pets need to come and stay at least one 24 hour visit with the dog in Fairbanks. \n\nPlease DO NOT email the rescue asking if this or any dog is available, all our dogs are available for adoption unless their ad states pending next to their name. Inquiries just asking if a dog/puppy is available will be deleted! If you cannot spend 2 mins reading an ad you have NO business getting a puppy/dog! \n\nAll adoption fees are $400\n\nPlease review our adoption process before filling out an application. MUST be at least 21 to adopt, do not contact asking to bend the rules. Adoption Information can be found on our website at www.agsrescue.com Potential adopters must have an approved application on file before coming out to the rescue. To see more photos and videos of the rescues visit the our facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/ArcticGermanShepherdRescue\n\nPlease note that Petfinder's application is not AGSR application and cannot be a substitute as one. To contact the rescue directly email agsrescue@gmail.com with any questions that are not found on the website",

            "description": "Kassie is a 45lb, 6- month old pitty mix. Kassie is a very sweet girl who just loves people and pets. She\u2019s a little shy with other dogs and will stand behind her handler for protection.  We are working on her socialization and building confidence with other dogs. As most pups do, she enjoys playing fetch and tug, going for walks, and spending time with her person. She is crate and kennel trained and knows her sit and place commands, AND is eager to learn more. Right now she has a bad habit of nibbling on you and your clothes when she\u2019s excited so probably be best to not have super small children until we can get this habit broken. Kassie is just a lovely, friendly, spirited little girl who needs to find her FOREVER home. To get more information on a Pups On Parole dog, please contact a representative of the Lassen Humane Society at 530 251-7247 or e-mail ilovepopdogs@yahoo.com.  The Pups On Parole Program started in June of 2007 to help give homeless dogs a second chance at finding an adoptive family.  All dogs in the program spent time in our local county shelter, surrendered by their owners or picked up as strays and waiting for their owners to redeem them or to be adopted by new families.   The selected dogs are brought current on vaccinations, spayed/neutered if necessary, micro chipped, and heart worm tested.  They then are taken to the California Correctional Center Firehouse where they are assigned to a trainer/ inmate fire fighter.  These trainers groom and work with each dog and give them the extra time and attention they need to become wonderful family companions.   Most graduates are house trained and know basic obedience commands.  As of December 2018, 535 dogs have been adopted through this program.  To meet any of the Pups On Parole dogs, arrangements must be made in advance.",

            "description": "I'm Bella, a 10 yr old Siberian Husky. So I'm passed the puppy stage although I still have a lot of energy. I am looking for a retirement home that can spoil me rotten and an owner that can spend lots of time with me. I have lived with kids in the past, but want to be an empty nester now that I am older. I just don't have the patience to handle the youngsters anymore. My foster mom says I'm still pretty energetic for an older woman. I love snuggles, being around my human and running free at the dog park. But don't let me off the leash outside a fenced area because I get so excited about all the smells and forget who you are. I will tell you when I need to go potty (and sometimes I'll just do this because I want outside). I still love to play but can also sleep the day away on your couch. I don't like being left alone for a long time and I don't like the crate (but I can do it). You can trust me to not chew up your furniture if you leave me alone, but I do like to watch the dog channel on TV when I'm home alone. I'd love to find a family who would love me, give me the exercise I need, and cuddle with me at night.\n\nBella was surrendered at 10 yo due the families financial situation. Bella is dog and cat friendly. She weighs approx. 45lbs. Can you provide her retirement forever?\n\nIf you would like to meet Bella, please complete an online application that can be found at: http://hopeanimalrescueofiowa.org/forms/196/dog-application\n\nAdoption fee is $150 which includes spay/neuter, age-appropriate vaccines/tests, and microchip.",

If you are interested in adopting please put in an application at www.hhfrescue.org. Our puppies are only available for adoption in the Houston, Texas area and their adoption fee is $275. All questions should be emailed to hhfrescue.org\nThe adoption fee includes vaccinations, bordetella, deworming, rabies, spay/neuter, microchip, a lifetime registration of the microchip, and sales tax. If adopting a puppy, the rabies and spay/neuter will be done at the same time by our vet once they are 4 months old and billed to us. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.",

For more information on the rescue, what the fee includes, surgery program, etc please see the home page.\n\nAdoption fee: $450 cash or card only (There is a $10 fee to use a card) NO CHECKS\n\nAge: 6 months\nDOB Approx. 7-23-20?\nGender: Male\nAltered: Yes\nBreed: Mixed breed\nApprox Weight Now: 35 pounds\nApprox Weight Grown: 55-70 pounds complete guess as we do not know parents \nDog-friendly: Yes\nCat-friendly: Yes\nKid-friendly: Yes\nHouse Trained: Yes- as far as we can see but will need a refresher in a new home\nCrate-Trained: Yes\nBenefit From Formal Training: Will benefit\nEnergy level: Moderate\nHistory: Adopted as a young puppy and returned\n\nAvailable for possible foster to adopt\n\nNote From the Foster: \nHudson is a sweet boy. He loves to snuggle on the couch with you or play ball. He loves playing with our dogs and has been introduced to other dogs that he did well with.  He would benefit from continued training and another dog to play with and socialize with. He does listen fairly well to basic commands. He has done well with our dogs, kids, and cats. Cats he is pretty curious about. He can be jumpy on our 3-year-old child but not the older kids. He accepts social cues from our older dogs fairly well. He walks fairly well on a leash and enjoys being outside. \n\nHe was adopted as a young puppy and returned to us as his family could no longer keep him. We have noticed he is a little apprehensive of new people at our home. Men more than women but after a little time he warms up. We do not push him to greet anyone and request new people in our home to just ignore him until he is ready. This has been working well and the more people he meets the better it gets.\n\nIf you would like to foster him to see if he is a good fit before adoption please request a foster application.",

She great with other dogs but we are unsure about how she will do around cats. Ellie prefers to sleep with her master and will bark and howl in the crate to let you know she would be much happier cuddling with someone. As with any young dog Ellie will require patience and training to master potty training and other positive behaviors. Ellie will also require a fenced in yard to keep her safe. \n\nIf interested in meeting Ellie, please complete an adoption application.\n\nApplicants must live within 1 hour of Toledo, Ohio. \n If interested in meeting Ellie, please complete an adoption application at www.toledospetbullproject.com/adoption-info/",

When I realized they weren't coming back for me I sang \"why do you build me up (build me up), Buttercup baby, just to let me down\", because they kind of let me down. Well, now I'm just so happy to find a family who will be with me through thick and thin. That's right, \"I need YOU (I need you), more than anyone darlin', you know that I have from the start\"! Okay, enough singing, let's get real here now. I'm just the sweetest thing you'll ever meet! I love to run around my yard and chase my human friends to play with me. I'm such a little doll. Most of my day I love to hang out with my foster mama, bulldozing around in the room as she gets me so excited! Once I'm excited I just spin around in cute circles and chase things around. I do have a lot of energy and I would absolutely love it if I had a yard to play in or could go on walks with my new people. I do like to go in my kennel to eat my breakfast and dinner, that's my favorite time of the day! I am very food motivated! I also will take treats gently from your hand. I get along with older kids who aren't so easy to knock over if I get the zoomies, so no littles under 5. I also get along with cats, but I don't realize how much bigger I am than they are. I love to snuggle up in bed at the end of the day after I got most of my energy out! I'd really love it if I was the only dog, but I do get along with others as long as they aren't too submissive and not super hyper. Sometimes I get so excited I can't control what I do! I just start running and jumping. When I first meet you, I might take a minute to get comfortable. My foster mom thinks I didn't have the best past because I flinch and duck at any sudden movements and loud noises. That's okay though because no matter my past, I'm the most loving dog you will ever meet! I just really hope I can find someone to love my energy and my sweet cuddles at the end of every day. The best of both worlds! Could you be my forever home? I promise, I'll always make you smile.\n\n*Potential adopters with breed experience will take precedence.*\n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $275.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

They were emaciated and a mess found in a dumping ground in Texas but a loving rescue partner volunteered generously took them in, vetted and continued to look for momma. They are all super friendly, will be medium size breeds and play well with all others.  Please know that as cute as they are, all puppies are work and need love, training and supervision. They are up to date with shots and will need to be fixed in early March in Aspen so need to stay close in proximity. Who wants to add some puppy love to their family? ?",

His favorite past time... playing with his foster pup siblings. \n\nLucky will need an active family, with a fenced yard or avid runner to take him on long runs/walks. He would LOVE that! \n\nLucky is 3-4 years old and currently undergoing fast kill heartworm treatment. \n\nHe is neutered, up to date on all vaccines and parasite free! \n\nPlease submit an adoption application on our website! \n\nwww.FriendsofFaye.com",

She came to us as a stray, super sweet, sits nicely, loves people, great with other dogs, actually quite scared of cats.\nADOPTION FEES Dogs & Puppies.....$100.00. This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more.\nThe first step to do an adoption is to do our Adoption Application here: https://www.elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html\nIMPORTANT - we respond to your emailed applications and queries via email back to you. Please make sure you have either added our email (hselco@bellsouth.net) to your contact list or that you routinely check your SPAM folder for our response just to be safe. If we do not receive a timely response we simply move on to another applicant.\nYes, there are sometimes exceptions to our normal fee for older dogs or special cases. Some of our pets have also been lovingly sponsored by caring people and we will let the approved adopter know about that at the point of adoption. Visit our Website at: http://www.elmorehumane.org The staff would also like to remind you that for faster response to inquiries about adoptable animals to have the animals ID#, name & description. This way your questions will be answered in a timely manner.\nAll pet adoption websites & our shelter management software require that we choose a primary and/or secondary breed for our dogs. While our staff is quite breed knowledgeable, in many cases we are truly making our best guesses as to their breed(s) based on many factors but cannot promise that what we have said is accurate. So taking into account your own parameters for things such as size, coat care, activity level, etc please come and get to know our dog(s) as individuals to see if their personalities and yours are a forever match.\nPhone: (334) 567-3377 Fax: (334) 567-8774 E-mail: hselco@bellsouth.net",

            "description": "Emlyn is super sweet and lovable.  She came in as a stray on 1/14/21. Emlyn is estimated to be about 4 years old.  She dances and prances and turns herself into a pretzel for attention. Emlyn most likely belonged to a hunter because she has the letter \"B\" spray painted on her side. Some of the hunters who have numerous Beagles and Hounds that look much alike spray paint letters or numbers on them in order to identify them later from other hunter's dogs. She must have gotten lost and not retrieved.  Beagles and Hounds that were former hunting dogs still make wonderful pets. They are sweet, loving, goofy and happy for any scrap of food, attention or cozy place to rest. They are usually very tolerant of living conditions, kids and other pets, having been used to so few comforts. Beagles in particular are incredibly sweet. Call (434) 374-8076, or email lakecountryspca@yahoo.com for adoption info. Visit LCSPCA at 11764 Hwy. 15, Clarksville, VA 23927 Mon-Sat. from 12-4 pm.",

I was pulled by my rescue from Rockingham County Animal Shelter in NC and in a foster home until my rescue approves an adopter for me. I am a a medium size girl and weigh 43 pounds. I have an appt on 2/10/21 to be spayed and microchipped but I am up to date on my shots and on monthly preventives. I love to run and play and such a happy girl now that I am out of the shelter. I always have a smile on my face and ready for attention. I am house trained now and haven\u2019t had an accident in my foster home since my first day there. I am dog friendly and kid friendly and just an all around good girl. I walk great on a leash and also do not pull. Please share me so someone will see my story and give me my new home where I will be loved forever. \nLove LuLu",

Im guessed to be a Shepherd mix with hound. My shelter records say Im guessed to be 4 years old, but my foster mom says my energy shows Im not older then 2. She says I play with other dogs and walk on a leash like a puppy. Im working on my basic commands. Im a sweet boy who loves to be scratched and loved on. My favorite time of day is when my foster mom played toys with me in the morning and when Im allowed to run around the back yard with my foster pup siblings! \nOh!, and of course feeding time! \nI weigh about 65 lbs. I play great with my foster fur friends Male and female. There is a cat here and I understand shes not interested in me. \n The kids here 12 and 7 think Im adorable and I love on them. I need big time leash training ! I am strong with lots of energy and love to give! Im crate trained and potty .Do you have kids? I love kids! My favorite toys are the ones that squeak! And tennis balls.I cant wait wait to get to my forever home! Is that with you? If so apply today! I wont be available for long!\n\nTo adopt this dog, or any OPH dog, fill out the simple online application at https://ophrescue.org \nOperation Paws for Homes, Inc. (OPH) rescues dogs of all breeds and ages from high-kill shelters in NC, VA, MD, and SC, reducing the numbers being euthanized. With limited resources, the shelters are forced to put down 50-90% of the animals that come in the front door. OPH provides pet adoption services to families located in VA, DC, MD, PA and neighboring states. OPH is a 501(c)(3) organization and is 100% donor funded. OPH does not operate a shelter or have a physical location. We rely on foster families who open their homes to give love and attention to each dog before finding a forever home.",

She was adopted by her current family at 5 years old and she is now 12 years.  The family has a special needs toddler  that is necessitating a new home for their pet.  Pretty would be an excellent companionship dog as she is not interested in playing or needing too much exercise. Pretty does well with older children. She is non-reactive to small dogs, but she is not interested in rough housing. Which means if placed with another dog, they would have to be LAID BACK & not care about playing. Just someone who can co-exist. She is great on leash which makes for such an enjoyable walk! Pretty is spayed and UTD on all vet work.  She is a really easy dog, and doesn\u2019t need much to make her happy. We want someone to love Pretty exactly who she is\u2026sweet, ADORABLE, and low maintenance, what more could ya want?\n\nThis is a courtesy post.

            "description": "BUZBY IS IN A FOSTER HOME\n\nDate of birth: 6/11/2018\n\n1/21/2021:  Buzby is a super cute Beagle/Lab mix!  He\u2019s 2 years old and weighs 60 lbs.  Buzby is a bit shy with new people and new surroundings. Once he knows you, he\u2019s a real sweetheart! His foster family has been working with him to socialize him more and he\u2019s doing better, and with more work and patience in his new home he\u2019ll continue to gain confidence. \n\n\u2022 Buzby lives with big and small dogs and is good with both.  We would like to place him in a home with another dog and with a fenced yard.  He\u2019d really enjoy having a doggie friend in his new home.  We\u2019d ask you to bring your dog in to meet Buzby to see if they could be good buddies.\n\n\u2022 Buzby also lives with cats and is good with them.\n\n\u2022 He needs a home without young kids, but older kids (teens) would be fine.\n\n\u2022 Buzby is easy-going.  He loves to greet his foster family when they come home and he loves to cuddle. He loves car rides and playing in the snow.  He\u2019s not a big barker.\n\n\u2022 He is house trained (but may have some accidents initially.)\n\n\u2022 Buzby has been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for heartworms.  \n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE:  PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU.  Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info.\u00a0\n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.521.2339\nhsgkc.org",

My dad, who took very good care of me my whole life, passed away and there were no family members who could take care of me, so now I'm looking for my brand new forever home. I'm not exactly perfectly housetrained, but that's really an easy fix. If you leave the doog open, I will go potty outside, otherwise I just need tou to take me out on a regular basis. If you are going to be gone, or aren't into waking up in the middle of the night to take me out, I do perfectly fine with a belly band on so I don't have an accident on the floor. I do good with other mellow dogs who like just laying around the house in a nice soft dog bed. I'm not much of a player anymore though, so a more hyper dog who is an in your face type of dog wouldn't be a good fit for me. Much like the dogs I get along with, I also like older, calm, respectful children. I'm not too keen on the idea of having my ears or hair pulled, so little ones who don't understand that are out of the question. \n\nFoster mom says I'll be a wise friend for my new family. I quickly adjust to new surroundings and learn the ins and outs of my new environment despite not being able to see. My nose works just fine, so I let that do the work of my eyes too! I'm okay laying in a dog bed, and I don't need to always be next to you, but I'm okay with laying on the couch next to you if you help me up. All in all, I'm a pretty low maintenance guy, just looking for a quiet, low key home to make my own! \n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog.

            "description": "Have you met Miley?\n\nMiley was brought into San Diego Humane Society by her owner who said she no longer had time to care for her properly. Miley is 12 years old, blind, and weighs 17 lbs.\n\nWhen Miley arrived on January 19th, it was clear that her family hadn't taken the time to get her groomed in a while. After just half a day here, what was even more apparent is that Miley's mentation seemed changed. She walked aimlessly in circles where we constantly had to fish her our from corners, had limited to no awareness of her surroundings, and she was inconsolable- thrashing and crying when held.\n\nThe first thing we did was got her cleaned up at the groomer. They had to give her a tight haircut to eliminate the mats. From there, we had the vets evaluate the bloodwork and x-rays that San Diego Humane Society had done, which were overall unremarkable. Miley seemed like she would really benefit from a foster situation, and thankfully, we had volunteers apply to specifically take Miley on a Frosted Fling because they noticed she needed extra love.\n\nFor the next couple of weeks we are going to help Miley get comfortable in a home environment and let her decompress. We want to give her every opportunity to thrive while keeping in mind her quality of life.\n\nIf you have a knack for providing dignified hospice care, please apply to be Miley's mom or dad: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply/\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees, and we help with medical costs!\n\nBecome a family: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 1/31/21 KG",

He is currently in a foster home in Seattle, WA and he has come all the way from a shelter in Texas to work with trainers to give him the obedience skills he needs to become the best boy he can be! He is eager to please and is very food motivated, which will help continue his training with you! This will also help him learn any cool tricks you\u2019d like to teach him quickly!\n\nMogwai would make the perfect hiking partner, or a great buddy for any outdoor activities you might be interested in! He is also happy keeping it low key and chilling in the house or enjoying a movie marathon! He is an independent boy, so he prefers to sit NEXT to his people rather then ON his people.\n\nMogwai is potty trained, kennel trained, is working on leash training, and enjoys car rides. He is in the process of E-collar training and his E-collar will be included in his adoption fee. \n\nIf we had to characterize Mogwai in a sentence with 15 words or less: A VERY smart, chill, appropriately affectionate, good boy with the softest, most luxurious fur.\n\n*Mogwai\u2019s adoption fee will go towards training with our trainer to ensure he and his new family are off to the best possible start. *\n\nIf interested in adopting Mogwai, please fill our our application here: bit.ly/GCSTARSadopt",

They had been on their own for quite some time. Her three siblings were adopted and she was left alone. Poppy is six months old and weighs about 17 pounds she is Chihuahua and Something unknown.\n\nPoppy is very shy. She is learning to trust and gaining confidence. She needs a home with another dog and someone to be kind and gentle with her. She has a long way to go in building her confidence and learning that life is fun. She is learning to play with toys very slowly. We are working on her leash skills. Because she lacks confidence and is so timid she will need lots of help. Ideally she will go to a home with another smaller dog, must have a fenced in yard and someone who will love to spend time with her. She is completely crate trained and we are working on housebreaking. If you feel that you may be the family that she is seeking please will visit our web page and fill out an application. Poppy is fully vetted including micro chipped. She is current on vaccinations and heartworm prevention. Did I mention she gets along well with cats to? She\u2019s very cat curious but tends to be a little afraid of them.\n\nWe require a fenced in yard.\u00a0 NO EXCEPTIONS.\n\n\nIf interested, please submit an application via our website at www.anassafehavenrescue.org.\n\nDisclaimer: All information we know of Poppy has been provided. If you are able to see this profile, then the puppy is still available. Emails asking if this dog is still available will not be answered. We apologize for this but we receive too many emails when we post our dogs. Please refer to our website for additional information regarding our adoption process.",

So please do apply.\n\n\nQuizzy, Quizzy, Quizzy!!! \n\nWe love this beautiful poodle mix so much. We can't believe it but she was brought in as a stray, but she made it to Muttville and is ready to be spoiled rotten. She has the cutest little wiggly waggly nubbin tail that wags away when you call her name! She adores pets and gets so excited to get attention and pets. She is a super charmer for sure!\n\nShe takes life one step at a time, a little bit slower than others due to vision impairment, but that doesn't stop her from exploring. Quizzy is beyond sweet and so ready to bring more love to your home.\n\n* HERE'S WHAT QUIZZY'S FOSTER MOM HAS TO SAY! *\n\nQuizzy lives up to her name as a very inquisitive little pup! Quizzy has a very calm and gentle demeanor which makes her really well suited for houses with young children or other animals. \nSo far she hasn't reacted or responded to other dogs but her absolute favorite activity is snuggling in bed and being close to the humans around her. \n\nWhile Quizzy isn't fully blind, her cataracts have impaired her vision. Because of this, she will do best in a single story home though she has done well navigating the 3 steps up to our front door. She was initially resistant to walking on a leash but is really getting the hang of it and enjoys exploring open spaces like parks! Quizzy is house trained and is doing really well with a regular schedule of being taken outside. She isn't super food motivated but really loves positive attention and praise. Quizzy's ready to come sniff and snuggle her way into your heart!",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Copper is 10 months old at the time of intake in January 2021. Copper is good with people and he is very nice with other dogs. But no cats, please, for Copper! Our hearts were crushed when we rescued Copper and saw the unmistakable signs of the cruel and neglectful life Copper has lived. Copper is emaciated and has what our veterinary partner believes is a cigarette burn on his head. Thankfully, Copper was removed from his cruel living situation and he will never, ever suffer cruelty or neglect again. Copper's life is just beginning. Copper is a super friendly, very playful boy who doesn't want to miss one minute of the rest of his happy life. He is a quiet boy and doesn't bark much. If you would like Copper to spend the rest of his life with you, please apply online to adopt Copper (SC) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

Copy and paste the link to access the sign-up genius for an appointment: https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet for dogs and https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet1 for cats.\n\nFor animals in FOSTER homes, please submit an online application and an adoption team will reply with next steps. We thank you for your patience as we work to keep saving lives during this difficult time. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out our dog adoption questionnaire and e-mail it to elenahtar@gmail.com\n\nPLEASE VISIT THIS WEBSITE TO FIND THE ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE:\nhttp://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-forms/\n\nBuster is quite possibly the cutest 3-year-old mixed Boxer. His white shoes, brindle coat, short legs, and puppy looks will turn heads. On walks, he'll want to say hi to passing dogs and strike out to find the latest scent but is well-trained not to yank you along despite his strength and with reinforcement, will heed you \"leave it. He's a ball of love with his human companions and hasn't met anyone, young or old, who he doesn't wanted to say hi to. At home he'll want join you on the couch and either stretch out like the whole 6 feet is his or crawl up in a ball next to you. After a day of exercise, for which he'll both need and thank you for, he'll find either his crate, dog bed, or your bed--if allowed--to curl up and sleep through the night. Buster's favorite activity is wrestling with his friends, including an 8-month-old English Bulldog, but he can be picky about his friends. He enjoys urban hikes and even winter climbing, along with a bit of water fun before it got too cold! Although he's still figuring out why he should run after a toy, once all the new smells are taken in, he's close to enjoying fetch. To be happy in his furever home, he'll do best with a larger yard to explore and release energy but hasn't shown any signs of being the next Houdini. Buster comes housetrained, crate-trained, and great on car rides so he's ready for your own next adventure or just daily life. And he's a fast student having learned lie down in only a day and doing fairly well with all basic commands. He's basically all you could ask for in a dog with a little love and training!\n\nBuster came to us from a rural shelter in WV. He's shown no signs of guarding or aggression towards any humans, regardless of food, toys, or personal space. He has done well with other dogs that match his style of play. \n\nAdoption Coordinator: Elena\nLocation: Foster Home\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $475. This fee INCLUDES spay/neuter and microchip. \n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\nWe also provide free online workshop with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria/Falls Church/DC area. Start your new dog out on the right foot with this valuable, expert guidance FREE!\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Bruno a cuddle loveable 57 lb, 7 yr old Staffordshire Terrier. You have no idea how thrilled I am to have been rescued from the noisy BCAC shelter by GKPR. Now, I'm living with my amazing Foster mom and human sister. I absolutely love the comfortable bed my Momma got me. Sadly all the toys had a very short lifespan...I can't wait to get some more (hopefully). I like car rides, walking up and down the stairs from and to my new home, playing fetch, showering my humans with kisses and all the wonderful walks. I'm also house-trained. The ducks and cats didn't bother me. Why would they? I need to be a good boy so I get lots of applications. Come on, apply!\nAdoption fee includes DHPP vaccine, Rabies vaccine (if age appropriate) heartworm testing, spay/neuter surgery, deworming, wellness vet visit, one month of pet insurance and microchip. All animals are examined by a veterinarian. Please fill out our application at https://gkarma.wufoo.com/forms/good-karma-pet-rescue-dog-adoption-screening/ if you would like to adopt or meet this dog, and we will be in touch right away!",

It is like he doesn't know how to be a dog and is taking cues from the 7-9 small to large breed dogs with whom he is living.  Murphy has come a very long way in his progress but has quite a ways to go yet.  He loves Doritos and thus will now take them from a person's hand.  He will follow people and some times even touch a person with his nose but is scared to have a person touch him.  Although once he is in a person's arms or next to a person, he loves being stroked.  So Murphy is learning and it would be good to find him his forever home who can continue his rehabilitaion and he won't have to move again.  Could you be that loving, patient person or family to help Murphy lern that life with people can be fun?\n\nMurphy is around 4-5 years old, up to date on his vaccines and preventatives, neutered, heart worm negative, house trained and a delightful fellow.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Murphy, please fill out the Dog Adoption Application on the MARC website www.marc4change.org\n\nMurphy's adoption fee is $200.00.\n\n",

I was sad to leave, but my owner knew the shelter would do their best to help me find a new home.  So here I am! Ready to try again!  First a little about me! I am a big fluffy terrier mix  that has excellent manners! I already know commands like \u201csit\u201d and \u201cshake!\u201d I am super dog friendly! In fact I have yet to meet another dog that I didn\u2019t like! I am a wonderful leash walker and great car rider! I am a big girl that weighs about 70 pounds! The shelter made sure I had all of my vaccinations, that I was heartworm negative, that I had a microchip, and that I was spayed. Now here is the thing that worries me the most\u2026..I am about eight years old. Will someone take a chance on me at my age? Oh I sure hope so!

            "description": "Meet Maui!\n\nMaui is a big handsome 6 month old puppy! He is already 56 pounds and will probably top 70 at adulthood. Maui is happy, friendly and gets along well with dogs, kids and adults. Not good with cats. He is looking for a new home due to a divorce and not because of anything he did! This is a sweet boy that will make a great companion dog. He is highly trainable and a great age.  He is super cute with a wrinkled brow, doesn't seem worried though! He is healthy, up to date on shots and neutered. He is ready to travel ASAP!\n\nMaui  is currently in TN but will be transported north to New England for adoption. The adoption donation is $500 which includes a health certificate and costs for his transport north.\n\n*Unless stated otherwise, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, on flea/tick product and heart worm prevention medicine (if older than 5 months) and micro chipped prior to adoption.\n\n*Please note that while we do our best to accurately state the breed or breed mix of a dog, we often have very limited information to draw from. Identifying the breed without pedigrees and information on heritage can be very challenging! \n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our animals, please go to www.angelsamongusanimalrescue.org and fill out an online adoption application. Thank you!\n\nMassachusett's Residents: Effective September 28, 2017 a Quarantine Fee of $120 will be required  (in addition to the adoption fee) to adopt a dog that has been Quarantined. Massachusetts mandates that all dogs entering MA shall be quarantined for 48 hours in a state approved facility.",

I would love my forever home to include a fenced yard and another dog to play with! I am easily trainable and I listen once I pick things up. I am smart as a whip and I am super food motivated! I have lots of potential! \n\nThe adoption donation fee is $350 which is tax-deductible and goes towards the care of homeless pets with Pals for Paws. \n\nTo expedite the adoption process you can fill out an application online at www.palsforpawsinc.com/adopt. Please note the adoption application doesn\u2019t bind you to anything. Pals for Paws reserves the right to refuse any adoption application for any reason and at any point in the adoption process. \n\nTo view our other wonderful Homeless Pets visit www.palsforpawsinc.com/pet-list ALSO be sure to LIKE Pals for Paws on Facebook at www.facebook.com/palsforpaws.inc \n\nAll Pals for Paws Rescue animals are fully vetted:\n*Spayed/Neutered\n*Groomed\n*Shots updated plus Leptospirosis \n*Micro-chipped\n*Dewormed \n*On Heart-worm prevention\n*On Flea and Tick Prevention\n* Dentals are done if needed \n\nYou only need to see your vet for a \u201cmeet n greet\u201d of your new family member and to turn in their medical records.\n\nPals for Paws is a 501(c)3 animal rescue. Every penny donated and every penny received through adoption fees goes right back into the organization. There are times when the volunteers have to dip into their pockets to help the animals. We do not euthanize because a pet is sick, heart-worm positive, or has a broken leg; we fix it all, big and small. We strive to go above and beyond when caring for and socializing our animals. We understand the importance of getting to know each and every animal available for adoption in an effort to place them in the most perfect home possible. \nIf you are looking for a particular type of dog or have special needs, We can help!

Asian Shepherd's are self-assured, balanced, quiet, proud and independent. They are a working dog so she'd love a yard and someone willing to walk/play with her. She is a goofy girl, all legs. Maggie is ok with other dogs but she needs to learn how to play with them. She'll do fine as an only dog or with another large gentle dog. Cats she wants to play with, correctable but may be best without them. Dogs live in the moment. Unfortunately, Maggie will have fewer moments than many, but will you be the person to make those moments awesome for her? She is deserving of a home that can give her all the attention possible.Maggie has a condition called Subaortic Stenosis which makes her life expectancy only 3 to 5 years. She will need to be on a medication called Atenolol, which is fairly cheap, daily for the rest of her life. She has been spayed, micro chipped, vaccinated, and is on HW/Flea preventatives. If you feel you can give Maggie her forever home please email helpsedaliacats@gmail.com or message Cat Assistance Team Sedalia on Facebook.",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Axel!\n\n \n\nI am almost 5 months old, I'm about 25 lbs right now, and I'm a bulldog, pointer, pit mix. I was surrendered to the rescue as a baby along with my littermates, and it was quickly realized that things were not quite right with me. You see, I have something called a myelomeningocele, also known as spina bifida. I have a large defect in my lower spine, and my spinal cord isn't complete. Surprisingly, my mobility is very normal, but this defect has left me urinary and fecal incontinent. I love my diapers and have been wearing them since I was teeny tiny. I'm a great boy and I always stand still for my diaper changes. At just 12 weeks old, I underwent emergency surgery to reroute my urinary tract due to some major problems I was having going potty. I'm healed from this but I may be prone to urinary tract infection in the future. Sometimes I need help going potty or poop, and my foster mom can teach you how to do this. Because I'm in diapers, I do need butt baths and barrier creams every day, and I am very good for those too. I have a couple of other minor problems that my foster mom can tell you more about if you're interested in adopting me.\n\n \n\nBut, that's enough about my special needs... How about my personality! I am an energetic boy who loves other dogs and people. I would do best in a home with another high energy and tolerant dog. I've grown up with a large breed doggy in my foster home, and he loves me and puts up with my crazy puppy antics. I love cats too, but any cats in my future home need to also be tolerant of me. I tend to chase when I get excited, but I do this out of play and love to tackle and wrestle the cats. I'm slowly learning that this is not ok, but I will need this to be reinforced in my future home if there are cats. While I have my wild moments, my foster mom says I am THE BEST snuggler around and I will sleep in her lap for 10 hours straight if she lets me. The minute the TV goes on, I'm in her lap sprawled out and snoring. She also recently took me on a 20 hour road trip and I slept literally the entire way.\n\n \n\nI'm looking for a very special family that will love me just the way I am. I'm fully vaccinated, neutered, and am ready for adoption any time!\n\n \n\nPlease apply at www.rejoycefulrescue.com/adopt/adoption-application and my foster mom will reach out to you!",

He stayed close to his handler and did not seem interested in meeting other dogs. He was non-reactive around other dogs, but preferred being with his handler. Treats are his best friend, and if you give him treats, he will warm up to you. Wed love to see Biggie fostered or adopted so that we can learn more about his personality!\n\nBiggie is currently a resident at Vermilion Parish Animal Control.

She is wonderful in the house but is being given up by her owner because she has gone after nearby chickens on multiple occasions. Apart from that, it is hard to find a knock to this dog. She meets other dogs well, does not jump finces, and has lived with 3 other dogs for the past year.\n\nCall the Salmon Animal Shelter to ask about Figi today!",

I love to chase things and fetch is my absolutely favorite! I am very smart and I learn things really quickly. I learned my foster homes routine in just 5 day! Pretty good for a puppy, huh? I am a little timid with new things, but I learn quickly. I am very eager to please and have already learned to sit on command. I love to nap in my kennel, buried by blankets, or snuggled with a human or with my doggy foster sibling. I am currently sleeping through the night and keeping my kennel dry all night long. I play great with my foster doggy sibling and am pretty interested in my kitty sibling. I don\u2019t mind to share my toys and food with my animal siblings, and human if they want! If you\u2019re looking for a smart puppy, that\u2019s definitely me! \n\n*Currently in a foster home with another dog and cat and doing great!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting me, please visit www.chainofhopekc.org and fill out an adoption application. Once received someone from our team will be right with you.\n\n**Local Adoption Only - Kansas City Area**\n**Currently in Foster home with another dog and cat**\n\n$250 Adoption fee includes deworming, vaccinations, rabies tag, micro-chip, spay/neuter, flea & tick prevention, and heart worm prevention.",

I'm so excited to see you and play, that I tend to get in others personal space. My education has been a little lacking, but if you're ready to teach and have yummy treats, I'm ready to learn. With time and patience, I can show you just how smart I could be! I really like to talk when alone, sometimes even when I have company. I'm not sure apartment neighbors will appreciate me being a chatty Cathy. I need a home where any children are at least school-aged. I would like to meet all children and other dogs in the home to make sure its a perfect match! Jasper is currently in foster care and will be shown by appointment only. If you are interested in learning more about this animal, please fill out an application by clicking here . Be sure to include Jasper A1057327 when filling out the survey. After reviewing your application, we will only be reaching out to you if the animal is a good fit for your home.",

He will run and play then come back to check in. As he gets to know you, he shows more affection. He would do best with someone who has an active lifestyle and is a good listener to what he needs (if you have Shepherd experience, even better). He is just a young pup that is confused as to what happened to the life he knew. If you are looking for a good dog with lots of potential, Bumper is your guy! No dogs Unknown cats Maybe Kids, 15+",

            "description": "A woman who volunteers for a local shelter saw Shiva alone in a parking lot. Her eyes were sad but her belly was full of life - literally! She was about to pop at any moment! The woman couldn't imagine the thought of this sad girl giving birth on the streets of Houston so she jumped to action. She sweet talked to her and Shiva slowly waddled her way up to her. The woman was able to pick her up and bring her to the shelter right away. Luckily for Shiva, not only was she saved off the streets but her finder had room in her home to take care of her for when she gave birth! Once this sad girl found the dog bed in her foster home, she laid down on it and didn't even move. The dog bed was so comfortable her foster mom had to bring her food and water to her, she wouldn't leave the cozy bed! After awhile, her sad eyes turned into sleepy eyes and she finally felt relaxed enough to fall asleep. Not even a day later she gave birth to 4 beautiful pups in the safety of this temporary home! Shiva is an absolute superstar and is great with cats, dogs AND kids! But despite all of this, her foster is unable to keep her much longer; she needs the space to help other homeless dogs. Although Shiva is thankful to be rescued off the streets, she is looking to be rescued one last time.\n\nWe have no back story or update for this dog at this time.

            "description": "Once upon a time, okay like a month ago, three beautiful dogs were found wandering in rural Missouri who seemed to be siblings. Valentina and Jean Simmoms were two of those dogs. These pups turned out to be super playful and goofy, very affectionate and wonderful with other dogs who like to play. If you are adverse to kisses on the nose, they may not be a fit ;) They are not bonded and can be adopted separately. The girls are whip smart and enjoy giving sweet kisses to people and dogs of all ages. As they are working dogs, a home with room to play is a must. The vet says that they are most likely Aussie mixes around a year old and a touch over 40lbs.. We just know that they are joyful, funny, nice dogs who will be wonderful lifelong friends to whomever is lucky enough to adopt one of them.\n\nApply for adopiton at www.diamonddogsrescue.com\n\nAdoption Fee $350",

I think I was always meant to be a Colorado-dog and just made the long journey from Texas. My life in Texas was kind of rough - I didn't eat very well and as such, I was losing patches of fur! Thankfully though, some nice people got me connected to 2 Blondes All Breed Rescue so I could get a fresh start.\n\nIn my foster home, I've learned what love and affection are from tiny humans and big humans. My foster mom says I'm amazing and patient and kind. I only know those things because of what they have shown me! I'm really grateful for my foster home but it's time for me to find my forever home! I'm good with dogs and kids, so I would make an excellent family pet. I would love a yard and/or an active family to take me on adventures with them. I've been working on my leash manners and basic commands but I know I can continue learning these new things in my forever home. \n\nIf I sound like a good pet for your family, please submit an adoption application! I already can't wait to meet you! \n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

My last owner wasn't very nice to me, so I would prefer a gentle hand in the future. I'm a sweet girl and the staff here can't see why anyone would EVER mistreat me!

We do not have a shelter. We focus on local adoptions in DC and the metro area of Maryland and Virginia. CDR&CK has a thorough adoption process in order to find the best possible fit for each of our dogs and cats (we do not operate under a first-come, first served model).\n\nUpon accepting a new cat or dog into the organization, we provide a basic vet visit that includes necessary vaccinations, disease screenings, deworming, microchips, and spay/neuter (unless specified). We do not provide a comprehensive medical exam prior to adoption. As a result, sickness, injury, and disability may exist unbeknownst to CDR&CK. City Dogs Rescue & City Kitties is not responsible for payment of any vet care, including known and unknown medical conditions once a cat or dog is adopted from us. \nDog specific: Rabies, DHPP, Bordatella vaccines. They are tested for HW, Lyme, Ehrlichia, Anaplasmosis.\n\nMost cats and dogs will have a house training accident in the initial days in their new home and we cannot guarantee any pet is housebroken or crate trained.\n\nWe also update our Facebook page daily with new cats and dogs.",

Come see Teresa today at our Costa Mesa location.\n\nThis pet is positive for Ehrlichia and Anaplasma, which are common flea/tick-borne illnesses that are treatable and not contagious to other pets as long as they are current on their flea/tick prevention. She will need to be on an antibiotic called doxycycline for 30 days and then receive a recheck blood test 30 days after finishing the medication. This recheck blood test will cost $150 at the Priceless Pets Clinic in Chino Hills. \n\n---\nWe know there are some 3rd party websites giving mis-information on the location of the pet you may be interested in. For correct information, please visit the location of the animal's name listed directly after their name, and visit the bio for more information. Thank you!! (Ex: \"Sparky - Chino Hills Location will mean you go to Chino Hills; \"Fluffy - Claremont Location will mean you go to Claremont; and \"Fido - Costa Mesa Location will mean you go to Costa Mesa) There may also be mis-information about the status of an available pet. If the animal is no longer listed on our main website, it is no longer available for adoption. For accurate information please visit pricelesspetrescue.org",

He's very unique-looking with his light blue eyes and beagle markings. Check out the videos of him from a recent walk! You can meet Simon today at our Costa Mesa location.\n\nThis pet is positive for Ehrlichia and Anaplasma, which are common flea/tick-borne illnesses that are treatable and not contagious to other pets as long as they are current on their flea/tick prevention. He will need to be on an antibiotic called doxycycline for 30 days and then receive a recheck blood test 30 days after finishing the medication. This recheck blood test will cost $150 at the Priceless Pets Clinic in Chino Hills. \n\n---\nWe know there are some 3rd party websites giving mis-information on the location of the pet you may be interested in. For correct information, please visit the location of the animal's name listed directly after their name, and visit the bio for more information. Thank you!! (Ex: \"Sparky - Chino Hills Location will mean you go to Chino Hills; \"Fluffy - Claremont Location will mean you go to Claremont; and \"Fido - Costa Mesa Location will mean you go to Costa Mesa) There may also be mis-information about the status of an available pet. If the animal is no longer listed on our main website, it is no longer available for adoption. For accurate information please visit pricelesspetrescue.org",

I hopped right up in there and rode in with the funny deputies! They got me all settled in with my very own dog run, a big bowl of food, and a nice comfy bed!  Wow! I was excited about that!  Anywho I was never claimed by my family and now I am up for adoption! In case you might be interested in this adorable boy, I have all of my vaccinations, I am heartworm negative, I have a microchip, and I have been neutered.  I love to go outside with the volunteers! We play with toys and just run around for fun!  I have fun here, but I know when I find my forever home I will be over the moon happy!\n\n",

I know I shouldn\u2019t leave the yard, but temptation is just too great when I look past my fence and see the neighborhood to explore!  He was afraid I might get hurt on one of my expeditions outside the fence. So I am starting over with a new home and family!  I have all of my vaccinations, I am heartworm negative, I have a microchip, and I have been neutered.  I know I would be a great companion pet for just about anyone. Oh, one thing I think I might need in my new home\u2026..a tall privacy fence so I will be safe!!",

He was sent to a shelter, but being a black puppy no one wanted, appeared on the euthanasia list, so he was rescued again. \n\nThis handsome boy gets along well with both people and other dogs. He enjoys receiving pets from his humans, and like a typical puppy likes to play with other dogs. He is social and friendly\nHis ideal home is with a family who is home for the majority of the day and able to spend the with him, as he is still a puppy at 10 months old.\n\nCurrently, he is in a foster home in Scarborough.\u00a0\n----------\nFor more details about the dog, please check her/his profile (please follw the link).\nhttps://www.freekoreandogs.org/adopt/hoodi/",

W we\n\nSunshine is house trained and does not require a crate when left alone. Sunshine LOVES people and kids. She can get nippy when excited but is easily corrected. Due to this and her rambunctious play style, older kids would be best. She is dog friendly but is also dominant. Males dogs or submissive female dogs are best. \n\nSunshine is usually gentle when taking treats and knows her basic commands. She is absolutely loyal to a fault and deserves humans that will return that love and loyalty. \n\nSunshine was abandoned by her previous owner after she had a c section and lost her puppies. After about a month of confusion and pain, sunshine is doing much better. Lucci\u2019s House made her a promise that she will never know that kind of abandonment ever again!",

The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog.

            "description": "Adoption Coordinator: Carol\nAdoption Fee: $400\n\nRosco is a great Lab mix weighing 40 lbs at 1 .5 years in age.  He was picked up as a stray in AR.  He is an active guy with med/high energy who just loves to run and play.  He will do best in a home with another dog to exert his energy, and pet parents who will spend time teaching him how to be the best boy ever!  Rosco has been good with other dogs, but has not been cat tested.  He gets so excited when he meets people that he jumps for joy and could be a bit overwhelming to smaller children.  He can also climb a chain link fence to be with his people, so needs a stockade or high picket fence instead.  This pup is a sweetheart and will thrive in a home where he receives the attention he so deserves!\n\nPlease Note: Rosco is currently being fostered in AR and is not here to meet.  It is very likely he will receive a deposit for his adoption before arriving in MA.  Please read more about our rescue and process on our website www.foreverhomerescue.org.  If interested, the first step in our process is to complete an application.  We find our pup's do best in a home with children ages 5 and older.\n\nPlease complete an online APPLICATION if you wish to adopt.  Forever Home Rescue New England is a 501(c)3  non-profit organization. We are a network of foster homes in the South and the New England area. THERE IS NO SPECIFIC SHELTER LOCATION. If you wish to meet our dogs, you must first be approved by going through our application and screening process. Forever Home Rescue suggests obedience training for all puppies and dogs. All dogs are up to date on their shots, dewormed and spayed or neutered. Vet fees, transport fee and New England quarantine fees ARE INCLUDED in each dog's adoption fee. Also, any dogs older than pups--even if they are not marked housetrained in their posting---usually housetrain within a day or two, because most are used to living outside in the south and will prefer to do their business outdoors. Our dogs and pups are best suited for families with children 5 yrs old and up. If you are approved to adopt, please submit the $100 deposit by clicking on our rescue's name in this posting (Forever Home Rescue New England--in purple) which will bring you to a new page with the deposit link at the bottom.  STOP! If you have not been notified of your approval status do not make a deposit.",

I was abadon on the property that my owners used to live when they moved. They took all the other dogs but me and my daughter from another litter and I was heavily pregnante. I had my puppies three days after getting to Tanyas. Now all my puppies have found homes and it is my turn.The first step in adopting an animal is to fill out the application. For an application please see our website www.tanyasinc.org and download an application and e-mail it to us. All dogs are spayed/neutered, current on vaccinations, dewormed, and are treated with advantix for fleas and ticks. They are also micro chipped(transfer of registration to your name is $20.00). With every adoption you will also receive coupons from PETCO.The best way to get ahold of us is to e-mail Tanya at tanyasinc@msn.com",

We rescued her from the Aeriwon shelter and now she\u2019s in NYC for adoption! Once she\u2019s comfortable, Yangsoon\u2019s best described as sweet, calm, gentle, affectionate, and sensitive. She loves chewing on bully sticks, cuddling with her foster, and lounging indoors.  She would do best with a patient adopter that can help her build more confidence with her new surroundings and around strangers. Yangsoon\u2019s come so far already and we know she\u2019s ready to shine soon!  Apply to adopt Yangsoon!\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014------------------\n\nOur adoption radius is now within 30 miles of the following locations:  NYC, Philadelphia, Lehigh Valley, DC, Baltimore, MD, and Western & Eastern CT. You must be able to pick up the dog at our office in Astoria, Queens (no exceptions). You must wear a mask and practice safe social distancing when traveling and picking up the dog.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014------------------\n\nINTERESTED IN ADOPTING?\n\nPlease check our Adopt page (www.koreank9rescue.org/adopt) and our Adoption FAQ (www.koreank9rescue.org/adoption-faq) to learn more! These pages include our requirements, adoption fees, adoption procedures, currently adoptable dogs, answers to frequently asked questions, and the link to our online adoption application!\n\n\nNOT READY TO ADOPT BUT LOVE OUR DOGS?\n\n\nAs a 501(c)(3) dog rescue, we rely on donations to continue saving these precious dogs. Check our Donate page (www.koreank9rescue.org/donate) and our Patreon (www.patreon.com/koreank9rescue) to help support our rescue. Let's keep making a difference together!",

After she was rescued, she lived in a boarding house with other dogs until she left Korea and flew to Canada.\n\nShe is your classic \"modern day lady\", in doggy form! Sua is loving, friendly, and sweet, but also bold, independent, strong willed, and sometimes stubborn. She loves to be around people and gets along well with other dogs, although she is better matched with more submissive and laid back personalities. She is currently fostered with another dog who is timid and more submissive.\n\nSua would be best in a home with people who have experience with dogs and can provide her with structure, leadership, and consistency in letting her know \"whatever Sua wants, Sua is not always entitled to.\" If she is in a home with another dog, strong leadership would be required to ensure she does not overstep her boundaries.\n\nShe would also benefit from a house with a yard, or with an active family who could provide her ample exercise and would include her in their outdoor adventures. She loves to run, sniff, and explore but is still working on her leash manners. Sua is a girl who likes to keep mentally and physically stimulated.\n\n2yr old Jindo mix, female, 15kg\nVaccinated up to date, spayed, and microchiped. \n\nFor more details about Sua, please check her profile (please follw the link).\nhttps://www.freekoreandogs.org/adopt/sua-2/ \n",

            "description": "Adoption fee on this dog is $300.\n\nLuLu Bell is a 1 1/2 year old bi-colored female. She has a little something besides Shepherd in her, which gives her an extra-sweet personality. She came to us when when she injured her eye and her owners couldn't afford the surgery to remove it. She is all healed now and doesn't seem to notice the loss. \n\nShe does not like cats, but gets along great with other dogs. She walks well on leash and loves walks and car rides. She is well behaved indoors and out. She tolerates sleeping in a crate, but prefers to sleep on a dog bed.\n\nThis dog is a Level 2. Please be sure you understand what a dog of this Level requires. Go to our home page for an explanation of the Dog Rating Levels.\n\nFor more information and to see when this dog will be attending an Adoption Day, please see our Dogs page on our main website at www.gcgsr.org. \n\nWe operate within a reasonable driving distance from the Greater Sacramento area, the \tCentral Valley down to Merced, and Lake Tahoe. A reasonable driving distance is determined by where one of our volunteers is willing to drive within our areas of service. That means we don't adopt out of our area, to Southern California, or Out of State. \n\n\nThank you for visiting!",

As with all dogs, proper introductions are necessary.\nWrangel really likes human company and prefers not to be left alone. He thrives with human attention. \nNot destructive inside or outside, but if left unsupervised, he will help himself to the trash can, so those need to be secured. \nKnows some basic commands and would love to learn more.\nVery treat motivated and easily redirects with a quick verbal command.\nDue to his exuberant energy, we are recommending a home with children over 15.\nCats are unknown, so we will not be adopting him to a home with cats.   \nOnly homes with a fully fenced yard where he will not be left home alone for long hours will be considered.\nWrangell is 70 lbs, neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccines including rabies, has been treated for heartworms and is current on prevention.\n\nThe adoption fee is $300 which covers initial vetting and other needs plus a transport fee of $175, total adoption cost is $475.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Wrangle, please complete an adoption application on https://www.westernaustralianshepherdrescue.com/.\n",

She has a a gorgeous Brindle coat and gentle brown eyes. She is ready for her forever home!! With some time and TLC she becomes the best cuddler. She's housebroken, and has no food aggression with people and is great with cats. She is great with children that respect her boundaries. She is cautious around men. Minnie will require a fence. Minnie has been around puppies and plays with them, but can be intimidated by larger dogs and will growl and bear her teeth if she feels threatened. This is probably something she would overcome if given a chance to get to know the dog is her friend. She is spayed, microchipped, and up to date on all shots, worming and flea treatments.\n\nEstimated DOB: 3/11/2020\n\nAdoption fee: $ 200(6% KY sales tax included)\n\nWe would love to hear from you!

Though I don't think you'll find me as tall as those hirsute bipeds on Star Wars, I do however have hair all over my body like them. I think I am more interesting too.\n\nI am a great family dog and like to protect (my food too), despite being the very definition of a senior dog at 16 years old. I'm doing pretty good, although I think I am going a bit deaf because I don't hear commands very well now. Maybe no one is trying to boss me around though anymore - hahaha. Right now I live with a small poodle who is even older than me (17 years old!) and a three year old golden doodle. How's that for a pack?\n\nI love my walks, but barely get out anymore because of the pandemic \u2013  my human doesn't want to go much. I only go in the yard now. I would really love to see more real estate besides that yard. That's probably why I pee in the house a lot because I'm not getting walks. My human thinks I'm getting old and incontinent and puts me in a belly band. If you don't know what that is it's a doggy diaper that is designed for boys and fits around their private parts. It's rather embarrassing to talk about this with strangers - but there you have it. So you'll have to be patient with me and work on the potty-training or the \"diaper\" changing part. I will do my best - promise!\n\nI cannot wait to find my forever home, but am sad to be leaving this one where I have been all my life. Call soon please!\n\n\n \nINTERESTED in WOOKIE? The first step is to fill out our online Adoption Application (address link below)\n\nNOTE: All of our dogs live in foster homes so it is not possible to setup a meet and greet prior to submitting an adoption application. Filling out an application doesn't obligate you to adopt, but it does save your place in line if there are multiple people interested.\n \nADOPTION APPLICATION (Type or cut & paste the below website address into your browser): http://www.sdroregon.com/adoption-application.htm\n \nIf our Adoption Coordinator determines you are a good match they will contact you. This is a great opportunity for you to find out more about WOOKIE and decide if you would like to setup a meet and greet.  \n \nADOPTION FEE is $150, and there\u2019s a 10% Discount for Senior Citizens and Veterans.\n \nLearn more about the ADOPTION PROCESS here (Type or cut & paste the below website address into your browser): http://www.sdroregon.com/adoption-process.htm\n \nWe apologize, but we are not able to answer individual questions about our dogs. We are a small, all-volunteer organization and we receive hundreds of inquiries. If you want to learn more about a particular dog, then please submit an Adoption Application. If your application is chosen, you will have the opportunity to meet the dog and to get answers to all of your questions. Thank you for your understanding.",

            "description": "The sweetest guy you'll ever meet!! Caboodle is around 2 years old and loves to get his fill of puppy attention!! Despite being very timid and fearful at first, Caboodle is so affectionate once he is comfortable. He is a MAJOR cuddle monster and loves attention. He will give you puppy eyes and throw himself on his back and stick his legs in the air to show you that he needs his belly rubbed!! He will also put his paw on your arm and stare at you until you pet him. He loves going for walks and could run forever if I could keep up with him. He gets the zoomies if you ask if he wants to go outside and also loves sticking his head out the window during car rides. Although he doesn't seem to have a real interest in toys, he likes to play chase and likes people-watching out the window. \n\nIn addition, his huge ears make him a GREAT listener and is very easy and cooperative on the leash. He is potty/house trained (except he has occasional accidents when he is really scared). He won't eat things off the table or chew on household items. He is also very good at telling you if he needs something and will whine if he needs to go outside or is hungry. Caboodle is quite curious about his surroundings and other people, just a bit scared. \n\nCaboodle is basically a chill dog who will cuddle all day but loves to be very active as well. He needs a calm environment without children. He needs a patient home for him to build trust and become comfortable. Overall, Caboodle is so sweet, so funny, and so loving.\n\nI'm in a foster home! Please email: foster@kcpetproject.org to meet me!",

He still has his puppy energy so needs a good workout every day with a lot of training. A highly active household without children would be best, as he needs someone who has just as much energy as he does. So far he knows Sit, Shake and Down! With dedication he could learn so much more! Despite his size he loves to be cuddled up in your lap and will be up and ready to play at a moment's notice! Toys are a must as they give him something to keep his attention on. With hard work and the right home, Coby could be your loving and loyal companion.",

His foster parents report that he is adorable, mellow and the sweetest dog ever. He spends most of the day chilling on his bed and sleeps through the night. Wonton's foster says that Wonton has not had any accidents so far. Despite Wonton's age, he is still an energetic guy and strong on walks. His foster parents are helping Wonton on his life skills and manners - working on sit, leave it, etc. Adopters are recommended to continue working on his life skills and manners through positive reinforcement based training. His Freedom harness helps to improve his leash walking skills. Wonton enjoys playing with toys and gets along with other dogs. We do not have any history on him with cats. A home with kids may be okay. JNG",

JMo gets along with dogs, and lives to be your shadow. He is a snuggler \u2013 he loves people. \nJMo was saved from a high-kill shelter in California.  Due to his small size and tiny stature, he will need to be adopted into a home without children and we are seeking a loving family that is familiar with this breed to provide him with unconditional love throughout his lifetime. \n\nJMo is a rescue dog, and rescue dogs require routine and stability. Please be prepared for a lifelong commitment before applying.  Ideally, they should be pottied every 4 to 5 hours. Dogs cannot be left alone for 8 hours per day. Home check and plan must be carefully thought out and presented at time of interview. Adopter agrees to purchasing Pet insurance at time of adoption no exceptions.\n\nJmo is fostered north of Seattle, and if interested please submit an online adoption application at www.6dogrees.com. An adoption application must be filled out for all inquiries and prior to a meet and greet. We will review and respond to applications, not all applications will necessarily be approved for a meet and greet. Home check prior to adoption approval. \n\nThe tax deductible adoption fee of $650.00 is not negotiable. The fee is needed in order for us to \"save it forward\" for the next dog.

Labrador/Terrier mix young fellow who loves kids.\n\nJackson was given to his first owner as a puppy, a gift she had not asked for and didn\u2019t particularly want. She kept him outside in small pen that wasn\u2019t kept clean.  Her family give him little to no attention even though he was a sweet little guy.\n\nA rescue agency approached the family and asked them to surrender Jackson so that we could find him the loving home he deserves.  \n\nNow is foster care Jackson loves to play with his human companions and with the other dogs in the home.  Finally getting some attention gets him very excited and he does tend to jump, but his foster family is working with him to help him overcome this behavior and trust that there\u2019s plenty of love to go around. \n\nIt's just sometimes he cannot contain how happy he is to be where people actually care about him.  He\u2019s ready and waiting to show you he\u2019s the very dog you\u2019ve been waiting for.\n\nAll dogs are up to date on vaccinations and spayed/neutered at the time of adoption.  All dogs require professional training to become the best family member they can be.\n\nTo adopt or learn more about Jackson, you must fill out an adoption application. To find the application, copy and paste this URL into your browser: WWW.GDRNE.COM/ADOPTION-APPLICATION [Adoption Fee: $495]  **  PLEASE READ: If a dog is listed, then s/he is currently available for adoption. Their information is correct to the best of our abilities and the information we have been given as of the day of posting. Please note, GDRNE does not guarantee the breed of any dog or puppy unless stated that we have run DNA. All breeds listed are educated estimates. Our dogs are rescued from various situations. It is most likely that both their parents were strays and even if not, mixes of some sort and that their grandparents were mixes as well. The dog may have some genetic material of an American Staffordshire Terrier (pit bull). The dogs are usually mixes of many breeds, making them a breed all their own - a True and adorable American MUTT. If you are interested in this dog, you must submit an application. Great Dog is not a shelter so there is no building you can visit. Our dogs live in private foster homes until adopted. To learn more about our *shelterless* rescue, adoption fees, and procedures, review the list of Frequently Asked Questions on our website at WWW.GDRNE.COM.",

Fuzzy Pawz knows that special someone is out there!  \n\nThis handsome girl is a great dog; she is calm, gentle and well trained.  She knows sit, down, stay and will even hold a treat on her nose and wait for the command to eat it.  Bella loves her adult people and wants to please but NO kids under 15 please.  Bella does not tolerate kids\u2019 noise and chaos; she wants a nice quiet retirement home.\n\nBella might be a bit older but she still has lots of energy for long walks; doing well on leash.  She does not dig, chew on things she shouldn\u2019t and she\u2019s house trained.  While she likes to go outside her favorite thing is to take a long nap on the couch under a cozy blanket \u2013 the perfect reading and tv watching companion!\n\nEasy going is a good description of Bella; she allows her ears to be checked (and they have to be looked at often), sits to get her teeth brushed and will lie down for you to use a Dremel on her nails!!! \n\nAll of that being said Bella does not do well with other animals.  She is fine with some dogs but it is touch and go on who she wants to be friends with.  Honestly Bella would do best in a home with no other pets; she would really prefer not to share her people.\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "Layla is so good to her caregiver.  She is 5 yrs old and about 50 lbs in size. She has a typical heeler nature which includes being a good protector and worker. Heelers like having a job and Layla is loyal to her family to not only love but, guard them against strange things or people.\n\nWe know a bit about her background and she has lived both inside and out. She is housebroken and lived in different family situations in her past. We are looking for a home where she can get daily exercise off leash. Being totally an inside dog tends to make her over protective of her family and she doesn't take well to strangers or strange dogs approaching.  She can show aggression. She is  generally not good with other dogs although she and her sister get along.  No cats for her. \n\nWe feel she is ideally suited to a home outside a city where traffic and unfamilar folks are not a common occurrence. As you can see by her photos she has a kind heart. We are very fond of her and her sister, Laci!  They were raised together and Laci has the same personality and tendancies.\n\nHer fee is $100.\n\nShe is fully vetted and recently treated for heartworms. This will require heartguard protection monthly which is not expensive. \n\nWe are a rural shelter with high intakes.  As a result, the shelter dogs are not guaranteed safety. We do our best but, we need help.\nADOPTION FEES APPLY-  Dogs $85-$125.  Cats $60-$80.  (We are not set up for credit or debit payments.)\n\nPlease visit or make an inquiry by calling this number 606-663-4998.  Leave a message on voicemail if you miss the staff.  Your calls are VERY IMPORTANT to us!\nThe shelter is open Monday thru Friday from 9 - 3 p.m. except Thursdays (closed).  Saturday hours are by appt.  \n\nAfter hours appts can be arranged with advance notice and an approved application.  We want to accommodate! \n\nFor an alternate phone, call 859-948-0371.  We are glad to answer any questions.   Adoption rates are low and include a spay or neuter and rabies. Surgeries are mandatory!\n\nShelter is located at 121 Echo Hollow Rd - Clay City, Ky  40312",

Rescued from shelter.\n\n\"Hi everyone, my name is Shadow! \n\nDue to unforeseen circumstances, I was removed by Animal Services from my previous home as they were unable to care for me properly. Once the shelter evaluated me and I received all the necessary shots, a nice lady from IMPS came in and rescued me.  That was a great day! I was so glad to be out of that shelter.\n\nI am told I am a little on the fluffy side and my new foster mom is helping me trim down.  I have two brothers and a sister in my new foster home, and I am learning how to play with them. I love playing tug of war with my foster sister. At night my foster parents take turns throwing the ball for me and it\u2019s a race to see which one of us can get to it first.  It\u2019s pretty entertaining, my foster mom had to put down additional area rugs in the living room so I would stop sliding across the hardwood floors like I was Tom Cruise in the movie Risky Business. \n\nAt night I currently sleep in a crate like my foster siblings. When my foster parents go to bed, I like to give a few howls telling them good night and then I settle in. If my new forever family wanted or let me share a bed with them, oh my that would be wonderful.  \n\nI am a mellow, easy going, sweet, friendly, and upbeat boy who loves meeting new people. I also like to chase birds and pretty much anything I think I can catch, therefore I would do best in a home without cats. My foster mom has a doggy door, and I can just run out and do my business whenever I need to, which is pretty convenient. I really like sitting next to my foster mom and cuddling on the couch.  I love getting and giving affection and would be a great companion to my forever family. \n\nI am hoping that IMPS and my foster mom can find me my forever family who will commit to always taking good care of me and provide me with a proper diet and daily walks.  I see other dogs going and getting homes like that and I really, really want one too. Are you the home for me? I am patiently waiting for you to complete an Adoption Application and meet me.  That way I can meet you sooner. I can hardly wait! I\u2019m excited just thinking about it! \n\nHere is the Application Link: http://www.minpinrescue.org/home.html\n\nLicks and tail wags,\nShadow\"\n\nNote: Shadow is located in Contra Costa County, California  and we will not fly this boy.\n\nIf you wish to adopt, please fill out our IMPS Min Pin Adoption Application\nIf you have previously submitted an Application form, there is no need to re-apply.\n\nFor more details about Shadow, please contact Kim: Kimdollensimps@gmail.com\n\nIMPS is a non-profit rescue organization that does not have a viewing facility to which you can come and meet the dogs available for adoption. All of our Min Pins are in loving homes in foster care. Arrangements can be made with the foster parent; however, it is a requirement that the Adoption Application be completed and approved first.\n\nIf you wish to adopt, please fill out the IMPS MinPin Adoption Application go to:  http://www.minpinrescue.org/home.html \n\nAlso, please visit our website by going to: http://www.minpinrescue.org\n\n",

            "description": "Aria ... if only we knew why you feel so threatened by everything and everyone around you.  \n\nThis little munchkin is just over 1 year old [13 august 2019] and naughty as can be.  She is determined and stubborn and wants everything to happen on her terms.  \n\nShe is a must for an experienced dog owner only.  Hard no on kids under 15 in or visiting the home.  No other pets in the home.  \n\nShe also needs a quiet home, without a lot of coming and going of people.\n\nOnce Aria knows you are her person, she becomes a really loving and sweet dog, but she still will not tolerate anything she deems not acceptable, and uses her teeth to let you know.  \n\nAgain, a dog that you must be willing to work with a professional trainer to overcome her bad behaviour.\n\nShe is young and we know with the proper guidance she really can become a great dog, but she does need quite a bit of assistance getting there.\n\nWe have not seen any guarding issues while in foster care, but that's not to say they won't creep back up in a new home.  \n\nHer shelter medial record also notes she has a luxating patella, but we're not seeing signs of lameness with her, so if it or they do exist, they aren't bothering her in the least, which isn't unheard of.\n\nShe has had urine testing completed, and it is noted that her urine is slightly concentrated, so she does need to drink more water, so will likely be a dog that needs to be on wet food for life.\n\nReady to take on this fiesta sweetie? She's still such a young dog, that she can be a better version of her current self with dedication to her training.\n\n\nFROM HER FOSTER PARENTS:\n\nAria is a bundle of love. Aria loves her people more than anything. She wants to be with them at all times and always wants to be a part of whatever is going on. She is an expert cuddler and her favourite activity is cuddling in bed. However, Aria is also very protective of her people so she barks at and bites people and dogs that come into the home or that she walks by on her walks.  \n\nAria also doesn't like physical manipulations. She will bite if picked up or when her harness is being put on or if there is a sudden movement in front of her. \n\nAria loves walking and playing. She is almost fully house trained but she still needs to be taken out every few hours to ensure she doesn't go inside by accident. \n\nAria does not have separation anxiety. \n\nAria has some trouble remembering to eat and drink. Therefore, she needs reminders sometimes to eat her food and she likes it when her people sit with her while she eats. \n\nAria does well in the car but will bark at people outside when the car is parked.\n\n\nFROM THE SENDING SHELTER:\n\nOwner surrender: behavior issues, bite, pees on bed (owner wasn't going outside with her or just sometimes for 15 min max)\nNever seen a vet with owner\nBarks in her kennel, seems to be protective\nwasn't comfortable with the pound employee at first, tries to snap. Tested with a woman (stranger), Aria sniffs and ignores her but once the woman tries to follow her, she started to bark and snap. Owner said she was doing that for attention\nSniffs and cries in new environment, very anxious\nOK with physical manipulations if she comes to you. Otherwise she could snap\nPossession of her food\nNo interest in treats, takes slowly but drop them after\nNot good with cats\nNot good with dogs\nDoesn't play at the moment\nCould snap with sudden movement\nSnaps if you grab her\nDoesn't know any command\nPulls a little bit on leash\nNot recommended with kids\nHigh energy level\nPossession of toys and bones as per owner\nDoing her business outside at the pound\n\n____________________________________________\n\nAs of today, though our protocols could change tomorrow, we are still moving forward with adoptions. Our process has changed from some of the previous elements: We are a registered animal welfare organization, so we are deemed an essential service.\n\nAll paperwork completed online, video home visits, meet and greets outside respecting social distancing, leashes/collars/supplies wiped down and disinfected (GermiCide 3 wipes), disinfectant on the dog prior to handoff (Aqueos wipes for dogs)\n\n-----------------------\n\nTo note: the above description is relevant to this dog in his current setting. Home changes & adopter personalities can bring out different behaviours not previously seen.\n\nWe do not specifically kid/cat test our dogs when they arrive at Mattie's Place. That just wouldn't be fair to the dog or child/cat.\n\nWe also do not claim, endorse, suggest or hint at, that any of our dogs are hypoallergenic, low shed or no-shed.\n\nAdoption fee includes: spay/neuter, deworming, defleaing, vaccinations, nose to tail health exam, leash|collar, 6 months of preventative based on season/need, DNA test for entertainment purposes, dishes, poop bags, food and any extras she has accumulated in foster care.\n\n",

            "description": "Update 01/29/2021. Goliath had a dental cleaning today. He did not have any teeth pulled as both teeth and gums are in good shape.\n\nHi everybody my name is Goliath. But I am not a giant like my names indicates, I am a tiny little 5-6 pound Chihuahua. The dog docs think I am about 5-6 years old but my foster mom says I play like a 2-year-old. I was a stray dog, wandering the streets when I was rescued. The streets are no place for a little dog like me. I am happy to be in a nice foster home with other small dogs. I love playing with the other foster dogs. I am a timid little guy who needs a bit of time to warm up to new people. But once I know you I am a very sweet dog who loves attention.\n\nI am house-trained and puppy pad trained. I sleep in a dog bed at night and I have indoor manners. I love to play outside in the yard. I run around and explore. I must always be supervised when outdoors as I am small and easy prey for other animals. No dog doors for me!.\n\nI am looking for my new forever home. Ideally my forever home will have another little dog to be my buddy. I really need folks to be patient with me as I am scared of new people and need time to warm up. It would be best for me to be in an adult only home or one with older children. I am an easy going guy who is obedient and loyal. If you have room in your home (I really take up no space at all!) and heart please consider adopting me.\n\nGoliath's adoption fee of $350 includes the dental cleaning, vaccinations, microchip and neuter.\nIf interested in learning more about Goliath, please complete our online application at\nhttps://www.helpadogsmile.org/adopt/application/\n. As the rescue does home visits and stays in close contact with the adopter during the adoption transition, only Phoenix area homes will be considered for Goliath.",

At SDHS:Blu has been microchipped, neutered, and is up to date on vaccinations. Now he's ready for his new home! Why this pet is the one for you:Meet Blu! He is a high-energy, active guy looking for a loving home to call his own! He gets really excited when meeting new people and doesn't always greet them the polite way. His new home should be prepared to continue his positive reinforcement training. Because of this, his trainers think he would do best in an adult-only home or one with older teens (16+). With having so much energy, he will make a great running or hiking buddy! Blu has a history of finding things to get into when he isn't appropriately mental and physically tired. We think he would be awesome at an escape room, but might decide to practice this behavior in the home. In addition to lots of exercise, Blu should have regular mental enrichment, like Kongs or puzzle feeders to keep him busy. Our Behavior and Training team is looking forward to speaking with you prior to adoption to go over tips for behavior management in the home. And because cats are fun for him to chase, he will need a feline-free home. He would also do best as the one-and-only canine with lots of focused attention. Are you looking for someone to bring some excitement into your life? Blu might just be the one! Click on \"Adopt Me\" to get started!

I'm not quite a puppy anymore, but I'm not a mature dog, either. I have some energy, so I need a family who can help me put that energy to good use. I would love a daily walk, plenty of chew toys, and some obedience training. I have the potential to be a great dog, and I need a family who can see that potential and is willing to work with me to achieve it! If you're looking for a long-term companion, I have many happy years ahead of me, and I would love to share them with you.\n\nFrom: Owner Surrender\nWeight: 51 lbs\nExercise: Moderate to High Energy\nLarge/Small dogs: I have been around bigger dogs and I have done fine. You can always bring in your dog(s) to visit with me.\nChildren: I am a sweet girl who likes to meet new people. It's always best to bring the whole family in to visit.\nCats/other small animals: I previously lived with a cat and my previous owners said I did fine. You can always ask an adoption counselor about doing a cat test with me.\n Primary Color: White W/ Brown Weight: 51.2lbs Age: 1yrs 1mths 0wks Animal has been Spayed",

Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nThis handsome 2 year-old guy is Benji. He came to us from an overcrowded rural county dog shelter but we don't know if he was an owner surrender or a stray. All we know that is he came into the shelter with another male dog. Benji, or Big Ben as we like to call him, looks like a mix of Cattle Dog and perhaps Great Pyrenees although that's just our best guess. He made the trip to Canine Lifeline so he could take his time finding the perfect new home. Ben can be a little shy when meeting new people but once he makes friends with someone, he is all puppy--super-silly and very affectionate. Ben seems to love other dogs so we do want to place him in a home where he'll have a confident canine buddy to show him the ropes and boost his confidence. Given his shyness, Ben will also need a home in a quiet neighborhood with a yard that has a secure aboveground fence to keep him safe. For a big guy, Ben walks quite nicely on a leash and is sure to get even better with daily walks in his new neighborhood. We look forward to seeing this boy really relax and start living his best life in his new home. Benji weighs about 61 pounds and his adoption fee is $325. He's neutered, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Benji. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Benji and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

Bud is 1.5 years old, weighs about 45 pounds and is a friendly pup. Bud is very new to Mutts so we are getting to know him.\n\n**BECAUSE OF OUR REQUIREMENT FOR A HOME VISIT, WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO ADOPT TO HOMES IN THE NORTHERN VA / MARYLAND / DC METRO AREA**\n\nWe have adoption events EVERY SATURDAY from 12-3 p.m. Please note that not all dogs can attend every event, so if you are interested in meeting a particular dog, please complete a no-obligation application on our website at http://www.muttloverescue.org/application.html OR write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nUpcoming adoption events:\n\nMutt Love Rescue is doing everything we can to ensure the health and safety of our volunteers and adopters while continuing our mission to find homes for as many dogs as possible.\n\nEffective immediately, we will not be holding our weekly adoption events. Dogs available for adoption can be met by appointment only. Potential adopters should submit an online application at http://muttloverescue.org/application.html. Once we receive your application, we will contact you to let you know the next steps.\n\nWe are always desperate for foster homes, now more than ever. If you are interested in fostering during this difficult time, please complete an application... unless you are a previous adopter/foster, then you can just contact us via phone (703-988-2608) or email (adopt@muttloverescue.org) to tell us which dog you want to foster!\n\nFor information on sponsoring this dog, please write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nWE NEED FOSTER HOMES!

He realized he wasn't able to properly cared for her, and signed her over to rescue.  Her foster mom says, \"Tripper has lived in our home since August.  I really can not believe that she has fit in so well.  We have a small Zoo at my house because we have our own dogs (2) but I also foster cats/kittens for a local Humane Society.  I currently have 7 foster cats and we have 5 cats of our own.  A lot of cats to learn to tolerate!  But she does it with ease.  Since Tripper was owned by a homeless person I really did not know what to expect as far as temperament, daily routine, etc., but Tripper jumped right in and just became a part of our family.  She loves our dogs.  She is extremely playful with our younger dog.  She will chase a ball , and can run like the wind.  I would occasionally take them to the river and let them get in the water.  She was afraid at first but eventually would swim around with the other dogs.  Tripper will bark at new people who come to our house but once she is introduced she appears to become more comfortable with them.  I am not sure if it was her job while homeless to let her owner know  someone was approaching.  She is a great security alarm.  She has let me know of deliveries to our house way before I realized someone was at the door.  Tripper has never had an accident in the house.  There are a couple of times when I heard her whine and she was at the door wanting outside.  We are semi retired and my husband makes his rounds to an old warehouse we have,  back and forth to home and a small business we own.  The dogs are with him everyday making his rounds or at the house in the backyard with me.  So they get a lot of exercise running and playing inside the warehouse, and in the backyard of our home.  Tripper knows her name and most of the time if I am taking her with me, I do not leash her from the house to my car because she knows the drill and goes straight to the car.  I have leashed at the collar and she likes to pull, when I have taken her on a walk by herself, I have used a harness and she does well with that.  We do have 2 Grandchildren that stay with us occasionally and once Tripper was introduced she was comfortable with them.  I do not crate her at all.  She is very good about sleeping in her bed all night and actually seems to like her own space.  Our dogs sleep in the kitchen area, and she seems to be comfortable doing the same.  I never tried letting her sleep in the bed, because she always seemed to like her own bed from the beginning.  I would imagine Tripper would make a great family pet, but I also think she would make a great companion for a single person/couple.  She seems to be very loyal and super super smart.  When she first came to our house, she would sit, lay and stay on command.   She is a very active dog and loves to go, go, go and did I tell you she can run like the wind (she is fast).  She does very well in the car and I can see her going on camping trips, taking long walks, or hikes and loving it. One thing I have noticed is that while Tripper and I have a great relationship, she does get very excited when she gets to go with my husband in the mornings.  I am not sure if it is because her previous owner was a male but going with my husband makes her very happy.  I am truly going to miss this girl and her golden ember eyes, when she finds her forever home and transports.  She is so deserving of a happy life and happy ending!\"  Please email us at TheChiSociety@gmail.com to apply for this shiny beauty!\n\n\nTripper's photo album:  https://photos.app.goo.gl/FaAz1fF9UY1B4zmj6\n\nTripper videos: \nhttps://youtu.be/OjobRivbeDI\nhttps://youtu.be/s9DMdfZpKeM\nhttps://youtu.be/m_8125Uzz8M\n\nTripper is spayed, microchipped, current on vaccinations, and current on monthly heartworm/flea/tick prevention.  Upon rescue, she did test positive for heartworm, but has completed treatment and is now heartworm free.  Yay!",

I'm basically a big puppy who's very strong, so I would love an active and experienced dog owner to take me on. I would do best in a home without kids, but older kids (over 10) may be considered. I will need lots of training, but I'm well worth it :) Fill out an adoption survey if you'd like to meet me.",

He is a Lab mix who is estimated to be around 11 years old and weighs 58lbs.  Charlie was found living near a dumpster in rural Northeast Louisiana. He was skin and bones and had heartworm disease. While in his foster home, Charlie flourished! He loves to eat and cuddle. He gained 20 lbs and is looking great. He loves going for walks and rides in the car. He gets along well with other dogs and cats.  He sleeps in a kennel at night but gets run of the house during the day. He has only had a few accidents but that was when he first came to foster and they hadn't learned each other's routines yet. He has early stages of glaucoma so will need to be on eye meds the rest of his life. He doesn't mind the drops especially if he gets a treat afterwards. He is precious and will make the BEST friend for anyone.  He may be an older fella, but he has so much life to live and love to give!  Senior dogs are AWESOME! Please email us at TheChiSociety@gmail.com to apply and let us know about your ability to provide daily eye meds for Charlie when you contact us.\n\nCharlie photos:  https://photos.app.goo.gl/kkVA8FMLMJderCp26\n\nCharlie videos:\nhttps://youtu.be/N8zjp6IRXLU \nhttps://youtu.be/ddjyA6rju6w \n\nCharlie is neutered, microchipped, current on vaccinations, and heartworm/flea/tick prevention.  Upon rescue, Charlie tested positive for heartworm, but has completed treatment and is now heartworm free!  He does have glaucoma and will need daily eye drops for the rest of his life.",

I came to WCHS as a stray and I am cheerfully looking forward to the dawn of a new day when I find my new forever home. I will thrive as the one and only pet in your home; I simply do not appreciate other dogs or felines and they make me uncomfortable. That also means I would not have any fun at a dog park. Plus, as your singular four-legged family member I will be the happy recipient of all your love and attention; I LOVE people. Speaking of people, my family could include gentle and respectful children of all ages. I do excellent with all sorts of handling and adore cuddles, pats, snuggles and scratches. I am a friendly and energetic girl who will need an active family that can provide sufficient exercise. My ancestors were built for chasing down stray cattle and helping with farm work so I prefer to stay busy. I am also smart and am confident that with your positive and patient training I can learn all sorts of things. Apparently, I have not had the opportunity to learn any cues from people but have heard about things like \"sit\", \"down\" or \"shake\" and that sounds intriguing. Since I have been at the shelter, I have been practicing accepting treats more gently when I am reminded to be \"easy\". I am a strong and sturdy gal, about 75 pounds, but I am also agile so I would like to try my paw at canine sports, dog parkour or maybe even agility. I am also hoping to challenge my mind so I would love to play nose-work or focus games and enjoy mentally stimulating toys; perhaps I could take my meals in a forging mat. I am excellent with all types of handling and think it would be magnificent for you to shower me with your time and attention. If you are looking for an energetic best buddy, I may be the gal for you; I love to run, jump, tackle and cavort. Stop by to meet me in person and check out my dynamic and sizzling personality for yourself.",

He turned 11 yrs old last July 4th!??\nThese boys were greatly loved, however needed to be rehomed due to medical issues in the family and inability to give them the attention they deserve. \nThey are very happy, apparently healthy, spunky & social dogs, however we are not looking for a home with younger children. They did well with other dogs at a foster home, however they have been the only pets in the home for 11 years, so it would be best if it stayed that way to avoid any potential jealousy issues. Cats will not work with these boys.\nThese are lap dogs! They will want to be up on the couch, bed, chairs, whatever. An entertaining little duo!! They were \"reported\" as potty trained, however they can be expected to mark initially at new places due to excitement and nervousness. Be prepared to reinforce potty training behaviors as they have still occasionally had an accident after some time in foster care. After 2 weeks, this has gotten much better. Charlie is no longer having accidents and Baxter has had very few recently.\nAll of their vet work is done, including dentals. Baxter had to have 21 teeth extracted. Charlie had no extractions.\nThey would love a home where they get lots of quality time with their family. They do well on leash. Cannot be trusted at all off leash! A fenced yard would be best. \nIf you feel that you can meet the needs of these adorable senior boys, please submit an application at www.heartrescueteam.com\nThey are required to stay together forever as a very bonded pair. Their total adoption fee is $250. (Senior rate of $125 each)",

He's about 35lbs, about 4yrs old, tricolor body, short coat and cute face. He's great with all people, other dogs and would be fine with children. He'd love to have a fenced yard to run around in and play with a bunch of kids. He is good on a leash and would enjoy going for walks with his people. He should not be in a home with cats. He will start heartworm treatment next week, then be ready for adoption by the end of February.\n\n**BECAUSE OF OUR REQUIREMENT FOR A HOME VISIT, WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO ADOPT TO HOMES IN THE NORTHERN VA / MARYLAND / DC METRO AREA**\n\nWe have adoption events EVERY SATURDAY from 12-3 p.m. Please note that not all dogs can attend every event, so if you are interested in meeting a particular dog, please complete a no-obligation application on our website at http://www.muttloverescue.org/application.html OR write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nUpcoming adoption events:\n\nMutt Love Rescue is doing everything we can to ensure the health and safety of our volunteers and adopters while continuing our mission to find homes for as many dogs as possible.\n\nEffective immediately, we will not be holding our weekly adoption events. Dogs available for adoption can be met by appointment only. Potential adopters should submit an online application at http://muttloverescue.org/application.html. Once we receive your application, we will contact you to let you know the next steps.\n\nWe are always desperate for foster homes, now more than ever. If you are interested in fostering during this difficult time, please complete an application... unless you are a previous adopter/foster, then you can just contact us via phone (703-988-2608) or email (adopt@muttloverescue.org) to tell us which dog you want to foster!\n\nFor information on sponsoring this dog, please write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nWE NEED FOSTER HOMES!

Once we receive your application, we will contact you to let you know the next steps.\n\nWe are always desperate for foster homes, now more than ever. If you are interested in fostering during this difficult time, please complete an application... unless you are a previous adopter/foster, then you can just contact us via phone (703-988-2608) or email (adopt@muttloverescue.org) to tell us which dog you want to foster!\n\nFor information on sponsoring this dog, please write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nWE NEED FOSTER HOMES!

I have some Husky in me, so I am a very active and energetic dog. I would do best with a family that can take me on long adventures and burn all my extra energy. I get along with children and other dogs, not sure yet on kitties. I tend to get protective of people I love as well. If you are interested in meeting me, please call the Elko Animal Shelter at 775-777-7333!",

            "description": "Well hello there! My name is Stella, and I'm at the Santa Maria Campus. I'm a 5-year-old, female, American Pit Bull Terrier/Terrier mix who would do best in a home with no other large dogs.\n\nI'm one chill, relaxed girl who loves to be around people! I love slow strolls on the beach, movie nights cuddled on the couch together, or even keeping you company while you read a book in the park! Are you working from home right now? I'd be a great new co-worker who is quiet and will love to just lay by your side when your on a Zoom call with your team. \n\nReady to adopt or want to hear more about me? The shelter is open by appointment seven days a week! Just email adopt@sbhumanesociety.org to make an appointment today!\n\nWhen you take your new pet home, he or she will have been spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations, provided with a permanent microchip identification and a certificate for a free veterinary exam. Our partners at Purina brand dog and cat food also provide food to get you home. \n\nTransfer of animals may be available between our Santa Maria and Santa Barbara Campuses. If an animal you would like to meet is at the campus further away from you, just let us know when you email, and we will be in touch with you if a transfer is available. Our adoption fees help support our community programs and the next animal who needs our help!",

Two hands spread as far apart as they can go won\u2019t go around Chevy\u2019s neck \u2013 maybe he\u2019s training to be a linebacker.  His head is as big as a platter.  \n\nAnd that huge personality \u2013 he trots across the play yard likes he owns the world, and then gently sits next to you and gives a kiss.  Give him a rope toy and he\u2019ll shake, shake, shake, then drop it and come over for a pet.  Super eager to please, he sits in seconds flat for a treat and then takes it so gently!  \n\nChevy is even well-mannered on a leash.  If he wanted, he could drag you across a field without any effort, but instead he trots along and takes care to wait for you to catch up.   Chevy is a big, strong boy who enjoys attention from his human companions.   \n\nApproximate Age:  1  1/2 years\nWeight:  90 pounds",

Princess is a cuddle bug and would love nothing more than a nice hike followed by a snuggle. She is very patient with kids and enjoys their presence, but keep in mind she is a big girl with a lot of energy. A definite crowd pleaser! \n\nOkay with dogs? No. \nOkay with cats? No. \nOkay with kids? Yes, but she is STRONG! Must be supervised. \n\n- To learn if this pet is still available for adoption, please check their adoption profile on our Adopets site, by visiting www.ucspca.org. - \nIf they are not listed on that site, or the Adopt Me button has been deactivated, we have received multiple applications for that pet and are not accepting any more at this time.\n\n\n\n Primary Color: White Weight: 62lbs Age: 5yrs 3mths 1wks Animal has been Spayed",

            "description": "Hi Ya, my name is Cactus Rose and I am a southern belle from the Lone Star State. I am a high-octane girl with a heart as big as Texas. I could share my home with a dog buddy as long as we are compatible; to ensure we can live in tranquility we will need to meet before I make any commitments. My dog friends need to be medium-large size pups who have a similar play style to mine. I am very tolerant and know how to play bow to indicate I am just having fun but I do play rough and can be a little pushy. I should never go to a dog park to play because I do not like small dogs at all and could be too much for some dogs. Speaking of small furry creatures, I absolutely cannot share a home with any cats; they are way too much fun to chase and torment. My ancestors often had the job of mustering and droving livestock so my breed has unlimited energy, a tendency to nip at heels and an independent spirit. Any children in my family should be 12 years or older so they can help with my training; I am a strong 75-pound gal who needs lots of exercise and structure. I am still working on my manners and get a tad wild with handling because I think it is all a game and can get jumpy and mouthy. I am hoping we can do training exercises together to practice my obedience skills; I could excel at agility or other canine sports. To be happy, healthy and well behaved I need plenty of physical and mental stimulation. I accept treats gently and would love to demonstrate that skill if you ask me to \u2018sit' or \u2018leave it/drop'. I am alert, friendly and eager to please; I promise to be loyal to you forever. I would make an awesome personal trainer to keep you fit and active. Come on by to meet me in person, and experience my dynamic personality for yourself.",

She was taken to a high kill Louisiana shelter, before being pulled by a local foster based rescue.  While getting routine veterinary care it was discovered she has diabetes. It took some time, but Sissy is now used to eating a diabetic diet and taking insulin injections. She is a grazer so her foster mom had to learn how to set feeding times to get Sissy to eat all of her food so she could get her shots. Sissy's foster mom says, \"Sissy is a sassy old lady who is set in her ways and does get snappy especially with other dogs when they get too wild. She would do best in a home with other calm animals (or even as an only dog) and no children. Her new family must also be comfortable administering injections twice a day and taking Sissy in for routine check ups to be sure her insulin dose is correct. Sissy sleeps in a kennel at night. This was a spot of contention at first. She would whine, cry, and howl for hours. This was resolved when she realized she wasn't alone. Her foster mom made sure Sissy could see her foster brother in a kennel close by. I think she would be fine out of a kennel, but because I have so many critters and I know she isn't a fan of them, I figured giving her a safe space at night was best. She stays out during the day and does fine. She likes walks and being outside, but does not care for care rides. Sissy is a lap dog at heart once you get to know her!\"  This darling girl was uprooted from the only home she has ever known and deserves to find a new family to care for her for the rest of her day.  Senior dogs are awesome!  Especially special needs seniors!  Please email us at TheChiSociety@gmail.com to apply for this adorable girl and please mention whether you have experience with diabetes maintenance in dogs.",

Event locations do vary so please check the homepage to find out where we will be this week. Please do not ask us to reduce adoption fees since all fees help us to cover medical expenses for all of our animals, some of which can be very expensive.

All the ladies just swoon over me. All I want is a nice family to take me home; I don't have to be a trophy dog! I'm smart as a whip too. So, how can you beat a deal like that? You know how we Pit Bulls are behind the eight ball in adoptions which isn't fair. So, I'm on a rocky course till someone can come and get me so we can be the perfect match.\nHere is what the crew has to say about me:\nRambo is such a fun dog. He is about 1 year old and 60 pounds. He would love for someone to take him home as the one to steal your heart. Rambo is a lover that likes other dogs and kids. He has a handsome coat to boot. So come on down to see this little strutter today.\nPlease call Faustina at 806-664-1615 since she can give you details about the animals! If you call the Pampa animal shelter please refer to the animals by their number listed after the names. Thank you for you cooperation!",

Stark was picked up as a stray in San Antonio TX. Couldn't resist not to save this sweet guy from being euthanized in a kill shelter. \n\nHe is up to date on shots, microchipped and fixed.\n\nCats should be ok\nKids - older due to his age \nother dogs- ok if they are quite and calm",

He does want to chase cats and chickens though, so NOT CATS OR CHICKENS.. He is doing wonderful with his house manners and is crate trained and housebroken. He is 1.5 years old.He can be shy with strangers ( especially men ) as we are sure he came from an abusive situation and his previous male owner dumped him down a side road. He just needs the chance to warm up and then he will be your 65lb lap dog best buddy. He is doing well with his basic obedience, food motivated. His biggest accomplishment has been learning to walk nice on a leash and not drag a human. He is very strong thus we found a no-pull easy walk harness is the perfect solution. He does wonderful in a fully fenced yard, he doesn't try to climb over or dig under. Bear loves children but may do better in a home that doesn't have toddlers because he doesn't realize he is a big dog. He is wonderful at the Vet clinic, to bathe and trim nails . Since Bear is the happiest in the colder weather, snow days are a blast, we feel that TN is not where he needs to reside forever. He does take a bit of extra bribery to get him back inside when the weather is cool. He loves to just lounge in the yard contently and is such a great outdoorsy dog. Colder weather states will be his new BEST FRIEND plae to live! Bear is a big fluffy ball of fun and entertainment and is looking for his forever home. He is currently in Tennessee and can transport up as soon as 1/23. If you are interested please email us at ccrnewengland@gmail.com\n\nADOPTION FEE REQUIRED. Contact ccrtennessee@gmail.com.",

I wad adopted the summer of 2019 but I got returned to the rescue because a strange dog came into my yard without permission and I let him know he was not welcome. I have been working through some confidence issues as my owner never did any training with me, but the rescue sent me to their amazing trainer and he helped me a lot. He says I am a good boy and I love to snuggle, I just need some patience and structure. I can be good with dogs with slow, proper introductions. Strange dogs make me nervous and my trainer says I can be the \"fun police\"...I don't like it when dogs get rowdy when they are playing.\n\nWhile I can definitely live in a home with the right dog, I wouldn't mind being an only child. I am so grateful to be given a second chance at finding my happily ever after, could my storybook end with you?!\n\nCompatibility:\nDogs: Yes and No\nCats: Unknown\nKids: 10+ years old\n\nThe Basics:\nHouse broken: Yes\nCrate trained: Yes",

She is visioned impaired and rickety, but so gentle and sweet. She does well with other dogs and is tolerant. This precious girl needs a loving home and someone to bundle her up and show her lots of love. Her mobility is currently limited but she will find her way around the inside of a home and if given access will find herself outside in a warm spot. Otherwise, she shadows her person. She is not ready for long walks and is unable to traverse a set of stairs but can manage a couple. She is curious though and will smell about and explore until settling close to her person. She rides well in the car and settles quickly if she has a comfortable place. \n\nMargarita is ready to bond with a person. She is relaxed being picked up and is a little head shy but that is because she wants to see a hand before it pets her. A slow presentation reassures her and she quickly relaxes and accepts love. Her ears are so cute and her tiny body could use some added fat. Thankfully, she is a fan of treats. \n\nMargarita was picked up as a stray and came to us from Hitchcock Road Animal Services.",

We saw her little face and was told she was deaf so how could we resist? Nola is a one year old American Bully mix. She is deaf so would require a fenced in yard, not electric. She doesn't care for the crate right now so someone who is home more often would be good for her. She is potty trained though. She's a very lovable girl who just wants someone to give her a chance. She is good with other dogs, but they should be her size or larger. NO cats or other small animals. She's also great with kids but we suggest over the age of 10 since she is deaf and can startle easily. She is spayed, chipped, up to date on shots and started on heartworm and flea prevention. Her adoption fee is $250.00 and that includes one private session with our professional dog trainer for whoever adopts her. We hope someone gives her a chance, she's a great pup. If you would like to meet her, please fill out the adoption application on our website at www.wagsandwigglesfw.com under available pets.",

She likes to play with toys and with the other resident dogs in her foster home and doesn't bother the cat. Spot seems to have the tendency to guard resources and also has some separation anxiety. Her foster family continues to work on these behaviors with her. Spot always lets us know when something is new or a new person is around as she is very alert and can be protective. She can also be a loud barker when she is alerted or very nervous. She has adjusted to life in her foster home and we rarely hear her barking unless someone new is here that she does not know well. Introductions usually go well with Spot but also need to be done slowly.\n\nSpot is crate trained and views that as her safe space so it would be something she needs to start in her forever home. She needs alot more practice walking on a leash and is likely to do much better adjusting to her new home if there is a fenced in yard for her to run and play in.\n\nSpot likes to be scratched alot and is very food motivated. She sometimes makes a purring, rumbly noise when she is being scratched since she likes it so much.\n\nShe will need weeks to adjust to her forever home and will need her new family to be very patient with her during that process. She is a sweet and loving dog but it takes time to build up that trust with her. Spot will need a family that is patient as she learns to trust them when she goes to her forever home.\n\nSpot has undergone heartworm treatment and will need a specific heartworm prevention for the next nine months.",

Their owner became homeless and turned them into a shelter.\n\nWe are still getting to know the two brothers and, for now, they are being offered for adoption as a pair.  They are very bonded.  As you would expect, they are a bit out of the element right now as they have been through a lot lately when they lost their home.\n\nThus far, they have both been friendly and cooperative.  They are housebroken and walk on leash.  We do not know how they are with cats and they have no experience with livestock.\n\nThey are very nice dogs who had the misfortune of having their owner losing his home.  We are hoping to place them with an owner who has experience with Anatolians or another flock guardian breed.\n\nAt this time we prefer to not send them on a long distance transport, however, if you live out of the area and are able to drive to pick them up, that will be considered.\n",

            "description": "Alana, affectionately known as \"Nubs\" to her foster family, is looking for a perfect forever home! Alana is a very beautiful 45 pound hound mix with a short cropped nubbin tail (hence the nickname!) who came to CCR from a shelter in Arkansas. Alana arrived at CCR extremely scared, so we sent her to foster care where she could gain some confidence and learn to trust her new friends. After a week or two of adjustment, Alana is doing great! Her foster dad says, \" Alana is a very sweet and affectionate dog. She likes to be in the same room with her people whether they are working in an office, watching TV, or playing with her. She loves playing and chewing toys, and any toys she has should be very, very sturdy. When she is comfortable, Alana is a good learner. She can sit, and she learns routines pretty well. When she gets in trouble (chewing shoes), she understands that she is in trouble and usually settles down. She does well with a routine and having access to her safe spaces and toys and occasional rubs. She has enjoyed encountering the neighbor's dog through the chain link fence.\" Right now, Alana isn't comfortable going for walks outside of the yard, as the noise of traffic and unknown spaces is still overwhelming to her. She is getting more and more relaxed as the days go by, so we expect that with the patience and support of a forever family, Alana will continue to gain confidence and explore new things! For now, though, Alana needs a home with an attached fenced yard where she can play, go to the bathroom, and get comfortable before graduating to leash walking and other things. Alana would do best in a home that is calm and routine-oriented, as she thrives in consistent, stable spaces. She's looking for an adult household that has lots of love and patience to give her as she continues to expand her horizons. Alana is good with other dogs, and may enjoy the company of a mellow, confident pup to show her the ropes in her new home. Alana is house trained.\n\nIf you have the loving, stable house that Alana needs, please submit an application at chicagocaninerescue.org!",

Very quiet, does not bark at the doorbell and was fine around my dog (in her kennel). Sandy needs someone who can put in the time with her daily to show her that she is safe and loved. Maybe even having another dog in the house that does well with scared dogs, a dog that is gentle and can show this beautiful girl how to be a dog by building her confidence. She will make someone an amazing companion with patience and love.",

            "description": "Ladies & Gentlemen, were excited to introduce our gorgeous baby girl Andi. She's a 7 year old, Border Terrier/Sealyham Terrier Mix that is 35lbs. Andi lives to be loved and to give love to everyone she meets. If you don't like puppy kisses, then Andi isn't the girl for you- we promise she has no boundaries. She's great with kids, loves other dogs & good with cats. Regardless of her age, Andi is just like a big puppy who loves to have fun in the sun. Her hobbies include movie night cuddles, enjoying her long daily walks, playing with 1 of the 6 kids in her foster home, watching the bunnies, car rides & brand new adventures. Andi is 100% potty trained, 100% crate trained and getting better on a leash (she does tend to pull a little bit. Andi also knows all of her basic commands and is just a lover at the end of the day.\n\nAdoption #Requirements: NO EXCEPTIONS\n- Fenced in Yard Required\n- No kids under the age of 10 (Andi thinks that she's a lapdog)\n- We are making it a requirement that Andi has either children or another dog (MUST BE a LARGE BREED) to bond with in her forever home\n\nAndi is currently up for adoption through Lending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue. Her adoption fee is $350 & will include her distemper, rabies, bordetella, parvo, & lepto vaccines; deworming; microchip; heartworm test; fecal test & being fixed. Andi is currently on both flea & tick, as well as heartworm prevention. We kindly ask that you please wait until then to ask any questions.\n\n***PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE POST & FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS****\n \nWith the Covid-19 Pandemic going on we are still doing adoptions, but please remember that we are all volunteers and safety comes first. With our rescue being based in the Metro Detroit area, all prospective adopters must live within the state of Michigan (which means No out of state adoptions). Please remember we are not a shelter and are 100% foster based. Once you submit your application, it may take up to 2 weeks for us to get back to you. So please be patient with us.\n\nAgain, we kindly ask that you please read the entire post to answer your questions. If you cannot follow the instructions properly, we will skip your application and move onto the next one. We kindly ask that you save any questions, comments or concerns for the phone interview. We kindly ask the following: No phone calls, No pm's, & No multiple emails- We are all volunteers and promise to get back to you within a timely fashion! \n \nLending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue; previously known as the PRO-PET-OTIC Foundation, is a 100% Foster-Based Rescue that is ran by all Volunteers. Which means that we are not a shelter & each animal is in an actual home with a foster family. We kindly ask that you put any questions within the email & our team of Volunteers will get back to you. With the overwhelming amount of emails please be patient with our 100% volunteer family and we will get back to you. The application MUST BE filled out, a Vet Check MUST BE completed by our team, as well as a phone interview before we do a 'Meet N Greet.'\n \nVet Checks:\nWhen adopting through our rescue, we 'ALWAYS' do a vet check on each applicant's pets that they have owned over the past 10 years. Please make sure to call your vet to grant them permission to release this information to our rescue. That being said, all of the animals in each applicant's home must be UTD on all of their vaccines (DHLPP & Rabies), an UTD Heartworm Test, & currently on both Flea & Tick, as well as Heartworm Prevention. So please make sure that when you are applying that all of your current animals go to the vet that is listed.\n \nHow To Apply:\nIf you're interested in adopting one of our available dogs:\n1. Email LendingaHelpingPaw313@gmail.com with the dogs name as the subject when you ask for the adoption application.\n2. Once you have completed the application, please print it out, fill it out, scan it, & then email it back to LendingAHelpingPaw313@gmail.com. If you do not have a scanner, please take a picture with your phone and we kindly ask that you sent all attachments into one email.\n3. Please make sure to call your vet to grant our organization permission to do a vet check on your current pet.\n4. If you are interested in more than one dog, please list your top 3 choices on the completed application.\n5. Please be honest & truthful on your application. We always do a vet Check. We always do a home visit. And we always have both the prospective families & dogs best interest at heart!\n\nThank you in advance for all of your love & support,\nThe Lending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue Family",

            "description": "Grace was dumped at a wildlife management center, but that wasn't the worse thing to have happened to Grace. She had a gunshot wound and all of the bones in her front right paw were shattered. She was picked up by Animal Control and then transported to Furkids so that she could get proper Veterinary care. She is now up and running with no lasting physical trauma. She is a loving girl and understandably with her past has some anxiety. Grace has some issues with other dogs in high energy environments where she has reacted poorly, so we suggest she either be the only animal in the home, or with an owner experienced with dealing with reactive dogs. Grace's estimated birth date is 1/21/2019, she weighs 26 pounds, and her adoption fee is $275. Also, she is not eligible for adoption outside of the Atlanta area. If you live in the Atlanta area and want to know more about Grace, please complete a survey at https://furkids.org/dog-adoptions/application. Puppies require a lot of time and commitment. Please make sure your schedule can accommodate a puppy as it will be a member of your family for the next 10 to 15 years. At this time, meeting our dogs is by appointment only. After submitting a survey, an adoption counselor will contact you to give you more information about the dog you are interested in adopting and to arrange for you to meet the dog.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Please go directly to BFPA.ORG if you are reading about this dog on another website. The BFPA website will provide more information. All dogs on our website ARE available.\n\nMicky is a very friendly and outgoing 70 lbs, Shepherd/Husky mix. He is a senior estimated to be about 11 years old. If you are looking for a laid back and quiet dog who wants to cuddle, Micky could be a good match. He gets along with other dogs and enjoys socializing at the park. He is possessive with food and toys. Humans can give and take food without issue, but he will try to take food/treats from other dogs so he would probably do best as the only dog in his new home. He has not been around cats but he does love to chase other small animals so I don't think he would get along well with cats. When we go to the dog park he has been petted by some young (7-8 years old) children and he was fine. He stops and allows them to pet him before moving on to something else.\n\nMicky is a quiet dog unless he gets excited and wants another dog to play with him. He is totally housebroken. He can go overnight or 6-8 hours at most during the day between potty breaks.\n\nMicky has a moderate energy level. He can play or go for a walk for about 30 minutes, then he will rest, but is ready to go again two hours later. Micky has good leash manners and enjoys going for walks. He would do best in a family with a fenced yard.\n\nMicky is well behaved in the house so we don't use a crate with him. We leave the crate open for him with a dog pillow inside and he occasionally chooses to sleep there on his own. At night he sleeps on his dog pillow in the living room or he goes into his crate voluntarily. Micky's favorite things to do are playing with his toys and socializing with other dogs at the park. He is very smart and has learned the commands, sit and come.\n\nMicky is very sweet, well behaved and extremely cuddly. He likes when humans play with him and his toys, and especially enjoys playing fetch with tennis balls. He also enjoys sitting on your lap and being pet/cuddled as long as possible. Micky is deserving of a home that will love him for the rest of his years. Is your family that home?\n\nEVERY DOG HAS A STORY: Micky is a handsome senior dog who was rescued from a local shelter. Seniors make a wonderful pet and sadly are often overlooked. Could you consider opening up your home for Micky??\n\nSome of the information contained in this biography includes approximations based on our expertise and is not guaranteed.\n\nApplicants must live no further than one hour from Cary NC as our dogs must be seen by a BFPA veterinarian for all medical care prior to adoptions being finalized. Our foster guardians deliver dogs to their new homes for adoption trials and we do home visits to finalize all adoptions. We therefore require applicants to live within an hours drive of Cary NC.\n\nINTERESTED IN ADOPTING MICKY?

Are you an energetic human looking for a very good companion and/or a companion for your other dogs? Meet Mac, a cute and friendly young dog who loves to go on walks/hikes and play games.\n\nMac will be timid when he first meets you but super friendly once he get use to his people. Mac has been an instant buddy with our two dogs and with a friends' dog, and has politely greeted other dogs during our walks. He has not been around cats or children yet.\n\nMac is very smart and is house trained and crate trained. He will go in the crate on command. At night he sleeps in his crate and can go 10 hours without having to go out to the bathroom. Mac has alot of puppy energy. He needs a fenced backyard to run and play. He needs an active human to exercise him and play ball with him, he would prefer a furry buddy to chase and be chased in that fenced backyard. He loves very long walks/hikes with his people and greeting other dogs along the way. A five mile walk daily would make him happy!\n\nIf you are looking for a loyal companion who will cuddle with you after an active day and wants nothing more than lots of pets and your love, Mac is your dog.\n\nEVERY DOG HAS A STORY: Mac was found as a stray and taken in by a kind rescuer. She took care of Mac, tried to find his owner and even took him to the vet for proper care. She knew she could not take adopt him so BFPA admitted him and is now looking for his forever home.

She's looking for a quiet home to spoil her and give her all the love, care, and TLC she deserves. She would do best in a quiet, adult only home, or with children over the age of 15. This sweet senior gal is looking to live out her golden years in her fur-ever home with lots of love. We think she is previously spayed. She does have some fatty tumors that are typical in senior pups. Her adoption fee is $195 and includes she is spayed, microchipped, up to date on all vaccines, flea/tick treatments, and heartworm preventative.

            "description": "WATSON - 7 years old, 74 pounds, house trained, no cats or small/young children, plays rough with other dogs, may need supervision with other dogs, loves to run, loves chasing and retrieving tennis balls, jumps on you in excitement, very vocal when outside, treat motivated, sits for treats.\n\nWATSON ran and ran outside like he was racing the wind! He is a middle aged boy at 7 years old and what a hoot! He immediately took off when we dropped the leash, found a toy and took full advantage of being outside in that yard at that time. He loves being outdoors and he loves playing. Sound like your kind of dog? Keep reading...Watson was surrendered after starting to show some guarding behaviors when it came to his food and toys. He will give clear warnings, however, so the behavior is manageable if you are willing and able to keep one step ahead of him when it comes to food and toys. He is a fun boy who will keep you on your toes and moving. Watson was pretty vocal I will say when it came to me throwing the ball! He would sit on command and wait about half a New York minute before the barking would start. I'm pretty sure he was yelling, THROW THE BALL!THROW THE BALL! Ha Ha! Watson is a friendly boy who will enjoy and need daily exercise and playtime, and training and attention with the possible guarding behavior. He might be ok with some dogs but we think he will play very rough and with the guarding behavior, well, supervision will be very important. He should be in a home without cats and small children. Call the Virginia Beach Animal Care and Adoption Center at 385-4444 or go to our Facebook page to make an appointment to meet him!",

            "description": "This beautiful girl is Judy! She is a 57 lb, 3 year old, Heeler mix. Judy is the perfect house dog. She is leash, crate and house trained. She doesn't mind cats and can co-exist with dogs but much prefers people. Judy loves snuggling on the couch and belly rubs. She ended up at a shelter in Texas as a stray. Judy was microchipped and had been adopted as a puppy. When her owner was contacted, they said she had been gone for about 3 weeks and they didn't want her back because she kept wandering off. Judy is a sweet girl who is looking for her furever home.\n\nIf you are interested in any of our dogs, please complete our online adoption application:\n\nhttp://www.lifesaverssp.dreamhosters.com/adoption-applicat\n/\n\nWe will conduct a phone interview, check references and then a home check. This helps us to match a dog with their potential adopter. The adoption fee is $350.00 for adults and $450.00 for puppies under one year which includes spay/neutering, up-to-date age appropriate vaccinations, flea/tick & heartworm preventative and a health certificate. We foster our dogs in homes, not in shelters. This allows us to get to know the dogs temperaments in order to match them to a home. This also allows us to get the dogs ready to live in their forever homes! All dogs coming from the south have been quarantined for two weeks and fully vetted before traveling to New England!\n\nFor more info please email Lifesaversapps@outlook.com OR visit our website:\n\nhttp://www.lifesaverssp.org/",

My ID number is 336510\n\nI am available for adoption; however due to my breed my adoption will have to be facilitated through a rescue organization. Please see the front desk staff or contact the Shelter at (248) 858-1070 for more information.\n\nMeet Hattie! Adorable Hattie is looking for a home to call her own! This sweet, sweet girl was found fending for herself, and a very nice family cared for her until they could bring her to the Shelter. While she was in their home, she did very well with their small children and their resident dog. Hattie is a happy girl, who is friends with everyone she meets. She enjoys greeting people, at her kennel, when they come to see her. Hattie deserves to be in a home where her new family will properly care for her and love her for her lifetime!\n\nThe following descriptions describe behaviors that were observed during testing and/or veterinary examination: Evaluated for temperament with 336261 and 336498 (males) and 336753 (female). Did well with all, gets wiggly and vocal. 1/19/21\n\nAmerican Pit Bulls are a misunderstood breed; for this reason, we implore adopters to these beautiful dogs to be very vigilant in training and socialization. This breed is very energetic and will need daily exercise. Because of their strength and energy, apartment living may not be the best fit. This breed can be loving, loyal and very smart. \n\nThe above behaviors and personality traits have been observed while at the Shelter. If this animal was relinquished, information is gathered from the owner regarding behavior. Our wonderful volunteers spend time with these animals and give input on behaviors and traits. However, this description may not be all inclusive to how this animal will act in a loving forever home. Introduction to established family pets should be slow and monitored always. The same goes for children and other family members. Adopting a pet is a big decision and should be thoughtful. We suggest researching different breeds to match traits and personalities to your lifestyle. When adopting a pet, please know that this pet will be with you for their lifetime; patience and consistency will make for a successful adoption.\n\n**Age is estimated** Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: White Weight: 56lbs Age: 2yrs 0mths 1wks Animal has been Spayed",

Buddy was originally found as a stray and although the finder had good intentions, and tried to care for him, he was unable to provide what was needed. \n\nWhen Buddy came to us just before Christmas, he was in rough shape. He had a lot of skin issues, ear infections and was suffering from seizures. With all that going against him, he was still \u201cMr. Personality\u201d plus!  With the help of medication, his seizures are now under control ?? His ears have cleared up and his skin is about 90% healed. Through all of his medical treatments, Buddy remains a kind soul who loves attention.\n\nSweet Buddy is a Cur mix, 2 1/2 years old and 70 lbs. He gets along well with other dogs, cats are unknown and because of his size, he needs a 6 ft fenced yard. Buddy has a perfect name because he just wants to be somebody's Buddy.  Give him that opportunity! \n\nIf you want to meet Buddy, please contact us at Adoptions@SuncoastAnimalLeague.Org.",

If there is a good fit, adoption is completed with a contract and fees (payable via check or cash).\n\nThe adoption fee is listed here: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n\nDogs from Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Age appropriate vaccinations\n- Heartworm test (for dogs over 6mo) and treatment if positive\n- Microchip\n- Deworming\n- Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\n- Any other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\n*Please note that the identified breed(s) are best guesses.

SHE WAS ADOPTED LONG AGO BUT MADDEN WAS HEART WORM POSITIVE & HAS HAD TO WAIT TILL HE COULD BE TREATED. HE WAS TREATED THE END OF OCTOBER 2020. HE HAS NOT BEEN RETESTED AND CAN REMAIN POSITIVE FOR MONTHS AFTER SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT. HE IS NEUTERED AND UP-TO-DATE ON VACCINES. \nMADDEN'S PREVIOUS OWNERS REPORTED THAT HE WAS GOOD WITH OTHER DOGS/CATS AND KIDS. HE HAS NOT BEEN TESTED WITH CHILDREN SINCE COMING INTO RESCUE AND HAS SHOWED SOME FENCE AGGRESSION WITH OTHER DOGS AT HIS FOSTER HOME. FOR THIS REASON HE IS NOT WITH OTHER DOGS AT THIS TIME BUT IT MAY JUST BE THE FENCE ITSELF MAKING HIM BARK AND GROWL AT DOGS THAT GET TO CLOSE TO HIS KENNEL. WE THINK HE MIGHT JUST BE OK WITH A LARGE FEMALE DOG BUT WE SUGGEST A MEET AND GREET BEOFRE ADOPTING. HE HAS SHOWN NO AGGRESSION WITH HUMANS AND IS VERY SWEET. HE LIKE TOYS, ESPECIALLY BALLS. WE'D LIKE TO SEE MADDEN LEARN TO BE AN INSIDE DOG AND WE JUST KNOW HE WILL THRIVE! HE IS ALL ABOUT HIS HUMANS (AS PYRENEES ARE) AND BEING A PART OF THE FAMILY WOULD BE HIS DREAM COME TRUE. HE SPENDS TIME IN AN OUTDOOR KENNEL DURING THE DAYAT HIS FOSTERS HOME BUT HE IS BORED. IN THE EVENING HE IS BROUGHT INSIDE BUT IS PLACED INTO HIS OWN LARGE KENNEL. THIS BIG LOVERBOY NEEDS A HERO THAT LOVES A BIG FLUFFY DOG!LOCATED IN CROSSVILLE, CUMBERLAND COUNTY, TN. WE CAN TRANSPORT OUT OF STATE",

            "description": "Coming Soon for local adoption in Birmingham, \n\nCalling all sports fans! This handsome black tri is Garth.  Garth is a high energy, high drive, athletic working type that is always on the move.  It is clear that in his former life he did not receive a lick of training, so while in foster care he has been working on appropriate behaviors (he's a jumper), basic obedience commands, and leash training.   He is food and toy motivated, and should do well with an Aussie savvy adopter well versed in positive reinforcement training or with the help of a trainer.  \n\nGarth has loads of potential and his foster mom thinks he would do very well with someone who needs a new agility or flyball partner.\nDog sports not your thing?  That's ok if you are an active human looking for an adventure dog.  Garth will play fetch until your arm falls off, run until his partner collapses, or hike until you run out of daylight.  He is very active and his new adoptive family must be as well.  Garth is no couch potato and will require a lot of exercise and stimulation in order to thrive in his new home.  \n\nGarth would not do well in an apartment situation and needs a physically fenced yard to frolic and play fetch with his new family in order to help burn off some of his endless amounts of energy (I'm serious here, the fetching never ends) He also gets along with cats (although he thinks they all should want to play with him).  He plays well with his foster pack, although he was dog-selective coming out of the shelter, so any canine family members should attend Garth's required meet and greet in Birmingham, Alabama where he is fostered.  \n\nGarth is also a bit unsure meeting new people, until they give him snacks....and then he will be your best friend for life, so his new family should be willing to continue socializing him and building his confidence.  Apologies, but applications with children in the household under the age of 13 will not be considered due to Garth's energy requirements.\nGarth is a super fun dog and will do well with an adopter who loves to be active with their dog, or who may want to dabble in dog sports in the future.  He would not be best suited to a first time Aussie owner due to his high drive.\n \nGarth is approximately 1.5 years old, 40 pounds, housebroken/crate trained, UTD on vaccines and neutered. He is fostered in Birmingham, Alabama and a meet and greet will be required.\n\nIf you think Garth is the guy for you, please fill out our application:\n\nhttps://www.australianshepherdsfurever.org/adoption-application\n\nAll adoption fees are used for future rescue efforts.\n",

            "description": "Meet Benji! \n\nBenji is a bonded pair and will only be adopted along with Rosie.\n\nRosie (9, chi) and Benji (7, pom X) offer you the best of both worlds. Rosie is an outgoing goofball, Benji is the most handsome, more gentle, reserved one. They both get along well with other dogs and cats. They both like short walkies, and Benji loves spending the day at daycare! \nRosie is well potty trained once you have her timing down. Benji is a little more unsure out in the big world and we are still working on potty training. I think he would do best with a fenced in yard. They can both make it through the full night.\nThey both love people. Rosie is quick to lay down for all the belly rubs, and Benji will politely pat you to request more scruffs when you stop. They both tend to be pretty quiet (except for Rosie snorting and purring). Benji's previous owner would have him sedated for grooms and kept him in a close body clip.  That's why he has his majestic lion's mane!\nThese two have been well loved and vetted but medical issues caused their mom to release them to us to find the best new home for them together.\n\nInterested in meeting Benji? \n\nAll Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue dogs are in homes with foster families; we do not have a shelter where dogs are available for daily viewing.\n\nOur process is as follows:\n1.  Review our policies and adoption radius  on our website: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n2.  Submit an application for review and approval;\n3.  MPM Rescue reviews application and checks vet records and references;\n4.  MPM foster contacts approved applicant(s) to arrange a home check and meeting with available dog(s);\n5.   If there is a good fit, adoption is completed with a contract and fees (payable via check or cash).\n\nThe adoption fee is listed here: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n\nDogs from Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Age appropriate vaccinations\n- Heartworm test (for dogs over 6mo) and treatment if positive\n- Microchip\n- Deworming\n- Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\n- Any other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\n*Please note that the identified breed(s) are best guesses. We very rarely have information on our dogs' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays.*",

            "description": "Meet Rosie! \n\nRosie is a bonded pair and will only be adopted with Benji.\n\nRosie (9, chi) and Benji (7, pom X) offer you the best of both worlds. Rosie is an outgoing goofball, Benji is the most handsome, more gentle, reserved one. They both get along well with other dogs and cats. They both like short walkies, and Benji loves spending the day at daycare! \nRosie is well potty trained once you have her timing down. Benji is a little more unsure out in the big world and we are still working on potty training. I think he would do best with a fenced in yard. They can both make it through the full night.\nThey both love people. Rosie is quick to lay down for all the belly rubs, and Benji will politely pat you to request more scruffs when you stop. They both tend to be pretty quiet (except for Rosie snorting and purring). Benji's previous owner would have him sedated for grooms and kept him in a close body clip.  That's why he has his majestic lion's mane!\nThese two have been well loved and vetted but medical issues caused their mom to release them to us to find the best new home for them together.\n\nInterested in meeting Rosie? \n\nAll Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue dogs are in homes with foster families; we do not have a shelter where dogs are available for daily viewing.\n\nOur process is as follows:\n1.  Review our policies and adoption radius  on our website: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n2.  Submit an application for review and approval;\n3.  MPM Rescue reviews application and checks vet records and references;\n4.  MPM foster contacts approved applicant(s) to arrange a home check and meeting with available dog(s);\n5.   If there is a good fit, adoption is completed with a contract and fees (payable via check or cash).\n\nThe adoption fee is listed here: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n\nDogs from Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Age appropriate vaccinations\n- Heartworm test (for dogs over 6mo) and treatment if positive\n- Microchip\n- Deworming\n- Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\n- Any other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\n*Please note that the identified breed(s) are best guesses. We very rarely have information on our dogs' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays.*",

Apply to adopt me today at mapawsmepetrescue.com\n\nInterested in meeting Bug? \n\nAll Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue dogs are in homes with foster families; we do not have a shelter where dogs are available for daily viewing.\n\nOur process is as follows:\n1.

            "description": "The temperature is dropping in Chicago, and it's time you meet the perfect snugglebug to keep you warm aka Taz! Taz is a beautiful boy with a sweet soul to match and the happiest tail wag. He is estimated to be around 4-6 years old, which means he's grown out of the demanding puppy stage and into adulthood (but still loves a good squeaky toy)! Taz will provide a great balance for his future family - he is quite content to lounge around on the couch curled up by your side, but he also enjoys a brisk walk outdoors to explore the sights and sounds around him. Taz should be the only pet in the home as he has a high prey drive\n\nand also, he likes to sprawl out on the couch leaving just enough room for him and his human(s). He has not been tested with children, but I think he would prefer older kids who can understand and respect boundaries. On walks, Taz is very intrigued by other dogs and sometimes reacts or pulls towards them, but it's easy to manage by just crossing the street when you see one coming and redirecting his attention with a \"sit\" command and treats. He is a smart dog who will flourish with a loving and confident owner to lead him. We're currently working on crate training to help with barking when his human leaves the house. All in all, Taz is a gem who is potty trained and loves to get 9+ hours of sleep a night!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Taz, please fill out an application at: https://www.dogsaredeservingrescue.com/adoptable-dogs/adoption-application/",

In laying my eyes on her as another volunteer walked her, I had to scurry over to learn more about her. \"It's Dixie. She's a sweetheart.\" In no time, I too had my special time with Dixie. Dixie does not disappoint and nicely greets all with a soft tail wag and grin on her face. Very attracted to the squeaky toys in our play yard, she happily trotted around with a variety of toys in her mouth and engaged in a moderate game of \"play fetch\" which quickly segued into \"let's go visit the humans\" and show them some TLC. Dixie is a smart, affectionate girl who impressed us with her \"sit\" and then her tongue sticking out as sadly, I had no treat to offer to her but she sat hoping I might have one! This mild mannered lady with the bunny soft fur is a real crowd pleaser and would nicely fit into almost any home environment. Ask for Dixie today and let her bring some winter warmth into your home today!\n\nOur adoption fee includes neutering, microchip, appropriate shots, and a post adoption veterinarian wellness check.",

            "description": "This handsome guy is Ernie. He came all the way from a shelter in Kentucky to find his forever home! He was adopted and in a home for about 5 months but was returned due to the owner having allergies. Ernie does not like being in the kennels and he is a little stressed and nervous in that environment. Once he's out he really opens up and he is a happy, silly guy full of personality! We aren't sure what his past was like but based on some of his behavior and condition, he may not have had the best life. He has a large scar on his back that we aren't sure how he got and can be a little nervous and shy when first meeting new people or being in a new situation. Once you gain his trust though, he will be a silly, happy, playful dog. He likes being outside, being goofy, and running around exploring. He loves playing with toys and flipping them around. He loves getting back and butt scratches and being playful. We don't know much about his past so we do recommend he meet any potential \"dog siblings\" before going home with them. He is an active and strong guy so may be a little too much excited energy for small children. Ernie may also need some basic training skills once in a new home. He has a lot of love to give and just needs someone willing to show him that he is safe and loved and he will be a happy and loyal friend to them. If you think Ernie would be the perfect addition to your family, please call for special adoption considerations, fill out and send in an application so our staff can review it, and if approved, we will contact you about setting up a time to meet him!",

I am a very sweet guy who loves to be around people and cuddle up next to them, I do my best to make it directly on peoples' laps but I have some arthritis so that makes it a bit more difficult. When I first came here they noticed that my hips were stiff so they did some x-rays and it shows that at one point I had some fractures from previous trauma, I can't remember what happened but they tell me that arthritis and pain medications should help me. None of this seems to bother me though, I am a very happy guy who loves to go for walks- I even do a little happy dance when I get to go outside- and I would love to find a quiet home of my own! I have been around other dogs and I seem to enjoy them, but I would prefer a calmer dog that wouldn't play too rough with my arthritis. If you are interested in meeting me please call the shelter to set up an appointment, I hope to meet you soon!- Love, Chief",

I really love my people almost as much as the couch.  I\u2019m pretty laid back just looking for a family that likes personalities as big as my head! mapawsmepetrescue.com\n\nInterested in meeting Sully? \n\nAll Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue dogs are in homes with foster families; we do not have a shelter where dogs are available for daily viewing.\n\nOur process is as follows:\n1.  Review our policies and adoption radius  on our website: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n2.  Submit an application for review and approval;\n3.  MPM Rescue reviews application and checks vet records and references;\n4.  MPM foster contacts approved applicant(s) to arrange a home check and meeting with available dog(s);\n5.   If there is a good fit, adoption is completed with a contract and fees (payable via check or cash).\n\nThe adoption fee is listed here: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n\nDogs from Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Age appropriate vaccinations\n- Heartworm test (for dogs over 6mo) and treatment if positive\n- Microchip\n- Deworming\n- Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\n- Any other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\n*Please note that the identified breed(s) are best guesses. We very rarely have information on our dogs' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays.*",

I am a 1 year old Rottweiler/Irish Wolfhound who loves to play and jump up to greet you.  For this reason, we ask that no small children be in the house cause I am pretty clumsy! \n\nI am still currently working on leash training but doing pretty well so far.  I am house trained, REQUIRE A FENCED IN YARD but still need daily walks.  I am also crated trained, neutered, UTD on shots and micro-chipped.\n\nDale is ok with cats but we prefer him to be an only dog as he doesn't do well with other dogs showing any dominance over him.\n\nAdoption fee: $375\nLocation: Dorchester, WI\n\nIf you have room in your heart for me; please complete an app at: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/BPWI/Dog\n\nDATCP #494550",

I\u2019m 11 years old and 33 lbs! \nMiami is super sweet and loving!  Even though she\u2019s 11, she\u2019s still got some pep in her step...ruffle a chip bag or any food bag and you will see what I mean.  When she\u2019s excited she even has a little bounce.  Her potty manners are pretty good.  If she\u2019s been sleeping for a while and she comes up to you, it means she probably needs to go out.  She does great with my kids (5&8) and her foster brothers.  One is much bigger than her and the other is about the same size.  She loves some good belly rubs, treats, and a soft comfy dog bed.  She is very food motivated and loves her some treats! She knows sit and walks well on a leash. I\u2019ve not crated her, but she sleeps on a dog bed in my room with no issues.  She snores and grunts a little when she gets really active.\n\n\nYou can still come adopt me or even join our foster program to help the humans learn all the awesome things about new dogs like me! Learn more on our website! \n\nHope to see you soon! \n\nWhat breed am I? Mixed mutt! ODHS does not breed label (unless there\u2019s official paperwork), as studies show it is nearly impossible to tell the exact breed of each dog based off of their appearance.\n\nEducational article:\n3/3/3 Rule:\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturdays. \nOur adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience.  Currently, the average timeframe for a response to your application is 1 week.\n\nLike us on Facebook \"Old Dominion Humane Society\"\nand be a part of promoting forever homes for dogs in need.\n#Adopt #Donate #Foster #Volunteer \n\nNote: ODHS only adopts to Virginia and surrounding states (including D.C.). A $50 out of state fee applies.",

He came to Pet Rescue after his owner died and is adjusting to life after losing the only home he's ever known. He is a very sweet, affectionate and sensitive boy who is friendly and playful with the two dogs in his foster home\u2014in fact, his new home must have another friendly dog to help him feel comfortable and lead the way. Bo is also fine with cats. He is very smart and knows basic commands, is housebroken, very respectful in the home, wants to please and thinks he's a lap dog. He gets nervous around loud noises and would not do well in a city environment. He recently discovered the joy of going to the dog park... he enjoys meeting other dogs and romping around with them, and loves fetching balls. But his most favorite thing in the whole world is to be with his humans. He sleeps contently on a dog bed next to his foster mom at night and would love to find a calm home that will love him and give him time to adjust to all the new sights and surroundings.\n\n \nIf you are interested in this dog, please submit an application directly to our website at www.ny-petrescue.org.  Only applications submitted directly to Pet Rescue will be considered.\n",

Each puppy will be spayed/neutered, have all puppy boosters completed, deworming completed and will be microchipped prior to adoption. The puppies will be available to go into Foster to Adopt approved homes at age 12 weeks old. Each approved home will be required to purchase a crate for their puppy and crate train their puppy, provide puppy food, puppy pads and chew toys. Each approved home should be ready to \"puppy proof\" the home, work on potty training, be prepared for puppies chewing on things and the occasional whining or crying that comes with owning a puppy.  Once the foster completes a 30 day trial period and everyone feels the puppy is a good fit with the home we will have you complete adoption paperwork. Each puppy is microchipped to our rescue and we will remain the Primary contact on the microchip. Once the adoption is completed, we will add the adopter as a secondary contact to the microchip. Each puppy will grow to be a Large Breed Dog, mom is a pit bull mix and dad was a black shepherd mix. \n\nIf you are ready for a gorgeous puppy now is your chance! \n\nTO APPLY GO TO: www.realtimerescue.org\nClick on: Get Involved then click on FOSTER APPLICATION (We only do foster to adopt). \n\nOnce we receive your completed application, we will be in touch for next steps.",

I've made several doggie friends, and I've even made kitty friends (my foster sibling is a cat). I also like car rides, though I'm not a fan of getting IN the car. Once I'm in, I'll just relax and watch the clouds roll by. Every now and again I might find a tasty pillow or something else to chew on, so you just need to keep that in mind if I'm going to be left by myself. Overall, I am a playful, loving pup, and I would love to go home with you!",

We have her dad ROMEO too.  \n\nWe felt these 2 needed us most. Fallon shook with fear in her kennel we were not sure we would earn her trust.  \nWell the magic of having other dogs in your foster home is all it took.  She is warming up to those she knows and follows cues from others.  Fallon bonded quickly to her foster mom and will do the same wherever she lands.  She will pick her person to help her transition.  \n\nFallon is part deer, she leaps over effortlessly, only to go visit the neighbors dogs.  Then she returns on the front porch.  So she would need a safe home with containment and supervision.  \n\nA very smart girl, not to mention her beauty.  Fallon is ready and waiting for her new beginning and are so proud of all progress she has made.\n\nwww.fourleggedranch.com for an application",

He requires a foster-to-adopt and must be kept on a strict exercise restriction until further notice. The foster-to-adopt must be able to medicate Miller twice a day for at least a month. It is also imperative that they can bring him to the shelter on very specific dates for treatment. Illness can't stop this gorgeous dog from living a full life. Is he the right one for you!\n\nWe ensure all of the animals adopted through our shelter are vaccinated, microchipped, and spayed or neutered.\n\nIf you love animals but cannot adopt, sponsoring an animal in our care is a meaningful way to help support the good work we do. For as little as $20 per month, you can sponsor a shelter pet and help pay for the cost of their care while they stay at the shelter. Secure your sponsorship online at njshelter.org.\n",

He requires a foster-to-adopt and must be kept on a strict exercise restriction until further notice. The foster-to-adopt must be able to medicate Miller twice a day for at least a month. It is also imperative that they can bring him to the shelter on very specific dates for treatment. Illness can't stop this gorgeous dog from living a full life. Is he the right one for you?",

Our Adoption Center public hours are suspended until further notice. Cats dwelling at Crumbs & Whiskers can be met by approved adopters only by appointment. Please submit an online application and an adoption coordinator will reply with next steps. We thank you for your patience and we hope to keep saving lives during this difficult time. \n\nPLEASE VISIT THIS WEBSITE TO FIND THE ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE: http://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-forms/\n\nBobby-Lee is a lovely, laid back 2 y.o. hound from Rockbridge, VA and was rescued from a felony cruelty case. Most recently he lived with a family with two kids and another dog for the last 9 months. He is currently with a foster family. He is good with other dogs and loves people. He warms up quickly and likes to snuggle. He has done well on his walks and with people and other dogs. He does have a strong prey drive but does pretty well on a leash. He is mostly house trained just need frequent trips outside. Bobby would love a house with a fenced yard as he loves the outdoors most of all and likes the exercise. He is not very fond of crates and he has some separation axiety so would do best with people who are home a lot and/or willing to work on this with him.\n\nAdoption Coordinator: Elena Kleifges\nLocation: Foster Home\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $475. This fee INCLUDES spay/neuter and microchip. \n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\nWe also provide a 45 minute online workshop with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria/DC area. \n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program/",

            "description": "Gail is about 4 or 5 yrs of age. She came to us through our rescue partners in Mississippi. She has been treated for heartworms and parasites and we recently did a dental and mass removal. Turns out the masses were benign so nothing bad there. She is on some medications for her heart but other than that is in good shape. She loves to cuddle and lay with other dogs. She does REQUIRE another dog and a yard and she also REQUIRES a dog door, if you do not have them, please do not apply for her. She likes car rides and dog parks. She has some puppy behavior and will chew some items. We just found out her cough is from heart damage from the heart worms. we have scheduled an echocardiogram to determine the extent of damage\n\nadoption fee is $375 Adoption fees go back to and cover all of the medical for all of the dogs. All dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated and micro chipped upon adoption and many have received further treatment for such things as lump removal, severe ear infections, leg injuries, etc..\nFor more information or to submit an adoption application, please visit our website at http://www.southernnevadabeaglerescue.com . We are also on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/SouthernNevadaBeagleRescueFoundation . Come meet and play with our available dogs at Las Vegas area dog parks. Times and locations can be found at http://www.meetup.com/beagles-207/ . Contact us or check our Facebook updates ahead of time if you are interested in meeting a particular dog. All our dogs are in foster homes so not all are available to attend all our park meetups.\nOur meetup group playdates allow you to socialize your beagle with his/her own breed at dog parks with large fenced areas where the beagles can run and play off-leash. Beagle enthusiasts, come bay with us..... AROOOOOOOOOOOO!",

            "description": "Female, Senior (age unknown), Mixed breed (possibly Miniature Pinscher and Border Collie) weighing ~27 lbs.\n\n-She is up to date with vaccines including rabies, and copies of proof can be provided. She was also spayed.\n\n-Her prior medical conditions have been resolved.\n\n-She wears cute dresses to help hide her hair loss.\n\n-A little more about her personality and behavior, she's fearful of sudden movements and loud noises but relaxes with soft stroking on her head. She's either mostly calm and can sleep all day OR she gets very curious and likes to follow you around like a shadow. She doesn't enjoy play-time with toys, however. (We think because she doesn't know how to play with toys- instead gets scared of them).\n\n-She has bonded with current owners' puppy so we know she does well with other dogs, but it's not known how she does with kids. It's unlikely with very young or active kids for reasons listed above.\n\n-Marina is highly intelligent and is still surprisingly trainable for her age. She responds to her newly given name and learned commands like \"sit\" (with treats in hand) as well as \"stay\" before exiting the door on a leash. She also gives you her paws to wipe on the rug.\n\n-She loves long walks and stopping every 2 feet to pick up scents.\n\n-She's proven to be quite the roadrunner and can keep up with other pups at the park!\n\n-She also loves car rides and waits to be safely strapped in.\n\n-She goes H.A.M. for ham and enjoys peanut butter and dog treats like \"Pupperoni\". She ignores fruits, lol.\n\n-Having kibble with a little bit of olive oil makes her go potty easier.\n\n-Speaking of food, she's so formal! Marina practices proper dinner etiquette by waiting to eat until owners sit down with their meal.\n\n-She absolutely hates getting her teeth brushed, and accepts showers and hair trims because pretty-looking divas have no other choice.\n\n-She doesn't like to be left completely alone. Either the presence of the owner or another dog seems to give her sense of security.\n\nMarina needs experienced and patient dog owners with a calm environment. Owners are trying very hard to avoid surrender at shelter. Thank you!\n\nIf interested, please contact Veronica at 305-310-3779\n\nTo adopt, fill out an application at\n\nwww.paws4you.org/application\n\nTo get our newsletter, text\nPAWS4YOU\nto\n22828\n\nConnect with us:\n\nwww.instagram.com/paws4you\n\nwww.twitter.com/paws4you\n\nwww.facebook.com/paws4you",

            "description": "This pretty girl is Siskey! Siskey is a 6 year old SPAYED blue female pit who was released to the shelter because they no longer wanted her. Siskey has done great with everyone she has met here at the shelter. Although she does great with people she does not like other dogs or cats. Siskey will need a home where she is the only pet but would make a great companion for the right family! Siskey should do well with kids and we do not know for sure if she is house broken but she keeps her kennel pretty clean. She weighs about 43 pounds and is HEARTWORM NEGATIVE as of 1-16-21.\n\nHer adoption fee is $33 and she is ALREADY MICROCHIPPED!! Due to the outbreak of Covid-19 our adoption policies have changed. All adoptions are by appointment only. Call to set up an appointment to meet the animal. Dogs are $61.50 and puppies are $59 unless otherwise noted. All cats and kittens are $44 unless otherwise noted. Our system automatically updates petfinders every two hours. Feel free to email us with any questions you may have.",

Theo came to us as a stray who was running loose for quite some time.\n\nWe have come to love Theo and have learned a lot about his personality. Theo prefers to play with squeaky toys over any other toy. He enjoys throwing them into the air and catching them. He loves affection but can be weary of strangers at first.\n\nTheo is about 4 years old and is a German Shepherd. Theo's ideal home would consist of a home with no small animals, older children, and possibly a fur brother or sister.\n\nTheo would benefit to be in a home with someone who understands the German Shepherd breed. If interested in adopting Theo, please fill out an application here: https://www.jotform.com/form/82616898672171",

You would never know this boy is 13 years old! On the lead he does pull and does not want to go back inside his kennel. Can you blame him? Louie has been at the shelter a year. He is patiently waiting for his forever family. Louie is protective of his food so he needs a home with no children, no other animals and an experienced owner who understands he needs a safe place to eat where no one will touch his food bowl. He would do best in a home with a fenced in yard since he loves hanging in the yard and loves playing fetch. His adoption fee has been prepaid by Save-A-Senior, a program of the Friends of the Burlington County Animal Shelter. If you are interested in Louie, fill out the online application and give the Burlington County Animal Shelter a call at 609-265-5073 to schedule a meet!",

My foster family says I walk really funny when I play too much, so I have to try and not get too amped up and take medication twice a day. Luckily, I have developed a good routine and am managing well. I LOVE water and playing with my broccoli toy. I am a great snuggler and I am potty trained! I know some basic commands and am eager to learn more. I'm currently ~35 lbs. and may reach 50 to 60 lbs. when full grown. *I have an extensive medical history and will need continuous veterinary care. Please speak with the adoption team for more details.* Cats? Unknown. Dogs? Yes, but for my health it may be best to not live with another dog. Children? Yes. Training needs? I already know the basics! Energy level? Medium. House trained? Yes. How did I get here? Transferred from Wake County Animal Shelter due my medical needs. ~My adoption fee is $250.00.~",

He has been abused by men in the past so although sometimes he is very affectionate with some men, he does have trust issues so an easy going, gentle and affectionate , yet assertive home is required   He\u2019s not fond of young children so an adult only home is also required.  He also does not like other animals so he must be the only animal in the home.  He does fine on a leash when he sees other animals, as long as they keep their distance.  Instead of long walks, Harley would prefer to go for a short walk and then run around the yard and play with his people.  He must have a securely fenced yard.  AN EXPERIENCED HOME WITH STRONG TEMPERED, DOMINANT  BREEDS IS REQUIRED.  If you are interest in meeting Harley please email info@k9rr.org and include your phone number.",

Tanner is amazing and deserves and equally amazing home!

We have a slow feeder bowl. \n\nIs Sully the ONE??  He sure hopes so.  \nplease fill out an application on our website.  \nwww.fourleggedranch.com",

His foster family says he's been doing excellent with potty training and doing his business outside. He is still like a little skiddish on a leash but has been opening up and making great progress. He's learning commands like come and sit, and has been working on his puppy mouthiness with a \"no bite\" command. Royal sleeps a lot and LOVES to snuggle. He is mostly interested in chewing on a buly stick or nylabones, he loves rubber toys and prefers them to squeaky and plush toys. He likes meeting other dogs but is slow and timid, but is always receptive to their attention and looks for humans at approval. His foster family hasn't heard him bark much and has mostly seen him be timid and gente. Royal has been going to the park and making friends with small and medium pups, but the big guys intimidate him a bit. He is getting more confident and blossoming in his foster home every day. Royal is up to date on vaccines and neutered.",

            "description": "January Update: Caldwell is still nervous but has started to adjust to his new environment. He relaxes a lot around his friend Clive, and we can see glimpses of his gentle personality. He knows at least the sit command and is very gentle when taking treats from volunteers.\nCaldwell was one of 3 dogs picked up in the same area. All three are petrified of shelter life. Lovely trembles in fear; Clive we could not even get out of the kennel he was so scared. Caldwell was less scared than the other two, but you can see the fear in his eyes. He stayed in a hunched position until he noticed Lovely in the kennel across the yard. He cautiously made his way to her and stood there, almost a protective nature. We put him in the kennel next to Lovely to see if that helped her relax, but she did not. He feels the need to protect Lovely and reacted when Opal growled at her. We would love a foster home for Caldwell and Lovely so we can see their true personalities out of the shelter environment.\n\nCaldwell is currently a resident at Vermilion Parish Animal Control. He will be vaccinated, neutered, and microchipped upon placement in an adoptive or foster home. To adopt, complete the adoption application at AAVArescue.com.",

She is approximately 2 years old and weighs 49 pounds. She walks beautifully on a leash. She is active and energetic with a pleasant personality. Francine is friendly, loves attention, is affectionate and is a lap dog wannabe. She takes treats gently. Francine is dog friendly, but seems to prefer male dogs to female dogs so a meet and greet is always recommended. This charming girl would make a wonderful family pet though she would do best in a family without young children.",

Now...she has come out of her shell and is a love bug. She loves to say hi to to anyone who wants to say hello, but she is not aggressive about it.  She would probably do well with medium sized dogs with medium energy.  Smaller dogs seem to be intimated by her.  She loves to go on long walks and play fetch with a tennis ball!\n\n----From her Foster---\n\nIsabelle l is a beautiful brown friendly PITBULL, about 3 years old and weighs 60lbs of pure muscle.  She has white \u201cballet slippers\u201d marking on all four paws, and has the cutest waddle when she walks.  She is very good on a leash, but also follows her nose and can pull quite handily sometimes.  She is very interested in squirrels and possibly chasing squirrels, and she actually caught one once, and dropped the squirrel when I commanded her to do so.  The squirrel ran away somewhat embarrassed, and Isabel had a big smile.  She is single and loves to mingle:  She loves to meet other dogs and other humans, but she can look intimidating to those not familiar with pit bulls, and hence not all dogs want to meet her.  She is very social and hardly ever barks.  She does snore, but it is very cute and well worth sleeping next to her.  She has a lot of love to give.  When I first received her after being transported from the shelter she was very afraid and would not come out of her crate.  However, sleeping next to her crate, in the middle of the night she came out, enjoyed getting pets, and went on a short walk and she instantly showed her love and appreciation for being in a foster home.  And we\u2019ve had a terrific foster relationship ever since.  I\u2019m not able to keep her, as we have 3 rescue cats and my wife thinks that Isabel is just too strong for her to handle when I\u2019m away.  But she is a fantastic dog and could be the perfect companion!",

He likes to play with other dogs, is not reactive to cats, and needs understanding children. He will tense up still with any human touch but is working on it. He loves treats, zoomies with friends, and snuggling under the covers. He enjoys the outdoors. \n\n \n\nWe are a foster based rescue based out of Muskegon, MI. We have an application process for adopting our pets. We have an application on our website www.caninesrescue.com. PLEASE DO NOT EMAIL US WITH YOUR APPLICATION INFORMATION. WE REQUIRE YOU FILL OUT THE FORM. We check vet references, backgrounds for abuse or neglect and home ownership or speak to the landlord to verify you are allowed to have a pet. Once the application is received and approved then we will set up a time for you to come and meet our pups that are available. All our dogs are up to date on shots, microchipped, been dewormed at least once, and sterilized. All meet and greets are APPOINTMENT ONLY.

She is male dog friendly and wants nothing more than to play /or ball andtug of war all day with anyone who stops by her kennel. She is housebroken, doesn't tear up her toys or beds, and loves car rides! Pebbles is a very well rounded girl and would be an awesome addition to a wide variety of home types. She does have a good bit of energy and will need a backyard with someone who can commit to playtime, but other than that she is such an easy-going, loveable girl. She does not do well with small dogs. Pebbles has been at ARF waiting for her special person longer than anyone else and really wants to go HOME!\n\nFill out an application at the link below. Find the dog/cat you are interested in and click the adopt button. That will take you to an application. Once approved you will be called for an appointment to meet your possible new family member, or at that time you can meet the other animals as well. https://petstablished.com/public/search/shelter/301551\n\nAdoption fee is $150 which includes, spay/neuter, vaccines, etc, and a free 1 year membership to our 5 acre ARF Park. For other dog questions please email ARFdogs74006@gmail.com\n\nWe do adopt out of state, but the adopter must travel to ARF to meet the dog they are looking to adopt. They must have an approved application before traveling to meet the dog. We do allow small dogs that are eligible to fly in the cabin of a plane. We DO NOT allow dogs to travel in the cargo area of the plane under any circumstances. Any dog that is adopted can of course go by personal vehicle. We do not allow dogs to be transported \"pony express style\" where they are passed from driver to driver.",

She is a beautiful Labrador Retriever mix, with smooth tan fur.\n\nThis girl has a forward style of dog-play, so if her adopter has another dog it would need to be a submissive one who could manage her style. She is an absolute sweetheart! So easy to walk & loves to give kisses. Blondie also so takes treats very nicely. She will bring such joy to her lucky adopter.\n\nPlease visit www.mostlymuttz.org/adoption-application/ to complete an application for BLONDIE if she's your girl.\n\nNOTE: This dog has undergone heartworm treatment.",

We require that someone be in the home/work from home half of the work day throughout the work week. It is not healthy for a puppy to be crated and left alone for 5 or more hours a day. Lunch breaks are not considered home half the work day and asking a neighbor to stop in is not considered home half the day. \n\nHer Story: \n\nLHAR rescued this sweet girl with the help of an organization in rural WV. Pearl appears to have been born deaf. She does very well with scent and is learning some sign language. As a young pup she appears to have sustained an impact injury to her front left leg. Despite several surgical attempts to save the leg, it was not possible, and amputation was the best option for Pearl's recovery. She is a happy and affectionate girl. She loves other dogs and doesnt seem to mind cats. She will do best in a home with other dogs and a fenced in yard. Experience with deaf dogs is prefered. \n\nMedium  when full grown. \n  \nShe is being fostered in a private home \n\nWeight: approx  40 lbs bs as of January 21st        \n \nPhotos were taken on January 21st         \n\nQuestions?

            "description": "These are the best and quiet dogs. They love toys and share well with each other. They are very good at sleeping through the night or when not being interacted with. They will whine for a tiny bit if they think they have been \"ignored\" long enough. They travel well in the car and usually just lay down and then start popping up looking out the window if it takes too long. Cooper is the biggest and a male. He is a little timid in new situations but once he gets to know you he is all up in your space. He sometimes will take treats away from a sibling if they are willing. He is very calm and chill. He likes to snooze when not playing or eating. Cleo is the smallest and a female. She is feisty but small. The bigger sister will sometimes try to keep her from the food bowl but she just waits and goes in and eats. She will wrestle with the best of them. She is super sweet. She has grown so confident with me. At first, she was not trusting of humans but now she wants to give kisses. Chloe is the middle sister. She has the \"Jan\" syndrome. If someone else is getting attention she is all up in it. She will leave everyone alone when they have treats. She will start to chew one but loves human affection better. She will flip on her back for a belly rub every time she sees you. She likes to wrestle with anyone but especially her younger sister. Sometimes she takes it too far so I just say be nice or no if she doesn't stop the first time. She is probably the alpha of the group. Please let me know if you need anything else. They are doing great!\n\nUpdate: Chloe is still a lover of attention and great at giving kisses. She will take and enjoy her treat just like her siblings. She has gotten so big and now has a black stripe on her tail. She enjoys playing with toys. She will still wrestle with the best of them. She has started to run from getting her medicine but will take it.\n\nWe have no back story or update for this dog at this time. When we do, it will be updated here. This is all the information we have currently.\n\n\n\tApproved Applicants may make the adoption fee payment by clicking donate above. Partial adoption fees will not hold a dog.\n\tDogs adopted with our rescue come with FREE training from #GoodPup to help you build strong bonds from the start!\n\tIf upon meeting the dog of your choosing at an adoption event you find that you aren't a good match, your deposit will be refunded minus a 10% administration fee.\n\tAdoption fees include vaccines up until time of adoption, microchip, spay/neuter and 1st 30 days of free Pet insurance. We are not affiliated with Pet First pet insurance. (you have to sign up for the insurance or it will not go into effect). \n\tAdopters can go to our vet for medical issues that may arise in 1st 3 days of adoption. \n\tThe dogs in our care are fostered in Colorado, Texas, and New Mexico. While all dogs are picked up during our scheduled times, sometimes transport dates change due to unforeseen circumstances.",

He is excellent with other dogs and is a great cuddlier to humans and animals alike. Mu Shu exudes so much love in his eyes and smile; he loves to give kisses. His heart is big and he's such a goofball when he plays with you or other dogs. He can be stubborn refusing to go certain places on a walk and then happily trotting home, so smart! We feel that he would make a wonderful addition to anyone\u2019s home. \n\nWe will begin taking applications today and will continue until he finds that special home!\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/201147330778151\n\n??Mushu is fully vetted so he IS eligible to be adopted outside the normal areas!!!!",

            "description": "Hello world! My name is Libke and I am a scruffy terrier mix of some sort. I am thought to be about 8 years old, but right now I act a lot older. You see, I just survived a month living in a scary animal shelter. I'm sure the staff did the best they could caring for me, but my foster mom says I was a \"hot mess\" when she first met me. It will take some time to recover, but I'm already feeling and looking much better. I have weak back legs, so I'm pretty slow getting around - a home without a lot of stairs would be best. Of course, I only weigh about 20 pounds, so you could just pick me up and carry me up and down your stairs. That could save you money on gym memberships - BONUS! I am fully house-trained and so quiet that I won't bother anyone. If you are looking for a low-maintenance, low-energy, low-rider, then please keep me in mind!\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online. http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\nNote: Some apartments and neighborhoods have breed restrictions. Please ensure you understand those restrictions prior to choosing a dog. We verify rental policies and adhere to any restrictions.",

It took a long time to get healthy, but I am ready to go now and I am just waiting for the right home. I am up to date on my vaccines and I have been neutered. I also have a micro chip. I am a puppy so I will need regular puppy training. I will also need a home with a fence, stay on heart worm prevention and live inside your home. If you would like to meet me please go to www.mobilespca.org and complete an online adoption application and someone will give you a call to set an up appointment for you to come meet me. \n\nADOPTION FEE: $250\nHeart Worm Negative\n19 Pounds\n7 Months\n\nABOUT OUR PETS: All of our pets available for adoption have been spayed/neutered, tested for heartworms, given age-appropriate vaccinations, microchipped and are on flea and heartworm preventative medication.\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS: To give each dog the best possible home we require a completed Adoption Application.  Screening and approval by our Adoption Coordinators and a home visit  may be required to make sure  this pet fits into your home and the home fits our pet.\n\nCONTACT US:If you would like  to give this dog a good home please call the Mobile SPCA office at 251-633-3531 or drop by our Adoption Center located at 620 Zeigler Circle W, Mobile, AL 36608 - Tuesday through Friday from 9 a.m.  to 5:30 p.m. and Thursday and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.\n\nCAN'T ADOPT?  SPONSOR OR DONATE!</strong> </strong>This wonderful animal is just one of many in our care right now. Your sponsorship helps us provide shelter, food, and tender loving care for the animals until they find new loving homes. Adoption fees do not cover our expenses, so your sponsorship will make a positive impact on our organization and especially on our animals\u2019 well being. Please note: we are not a chapter or affiliate of any national animal organization. We are, moreover, very grateful for your generosity.\n\nThank you!",

            "description": "Two year old Axel sure is eye candy. This boy's nub never stops! Axel has a lovely temperament and was a shelter favorite. His dog test was on leash and while eager to meet the other dog, he showed no aggression and responded to his handler's direction to sit.. Axel LOVES to play fetch and independently brings the ball back to place at your feet, \n\nAs far as adding him to a home that already has a dog, Axel is very strong and in your face with other dogs, not in a dominant way, but in a sheer excited way. He is so exuberant that he can overwhelm them with his boisterous, rough, in-your-personal-space-clueless excitement. We have been thinking about changing his post to \u2018only dog\u2019 not due to aggression, but due to his unsocialized play style. We could see another dog escalating and Axel not realizing he was the cause of it. If you already have a dog, Axel will need one who recognizes his intent and enjoys hard core play. \n\n**If you are serious about adopting , you must head to our website at www.kodisclub.org and submit a completed application . We will not do anything without an app. Due to the small size of our volunteer-run rescue, only the approved adopter may be contacted. It is not first come first served, but the best match. Yes, if you are reading this, the dog is available so no need to check **\n\n",

Thankfully, a kind person came along at the right time & saved her life.\n\nFudge is probably around 18 weeks old (1/21/2021) & has been fully vaccinated. She will soon be spayed & microchipped. She is full of energy & would love an active family!\n\nFor more information about Fudge, contact Susan at daiseymaggie@yahoo.com\n\nTo make the best possible match for you and the pet, please click below to complete the Adoption Application. \n\nOnce your application has been processed, we'll be in contact. \n\nWe cannot schedule a meet and greet without a completed application. \n\nIf you are viewing this page through PetFinder, Adopt-a-Pet, etc., please go to http://ootwrescue.org/adoption.html to fill out an application or review our Adoption Process.",

They are local dogs, and their owner passed away a year ago. The landlord had been caring for them, and finally reached out for help. That\u2019s how they got to us. \n\nDamien is a senior dog and is 110+ pounds of pure love, just looking for someone to spoil him in his old age. After being examined by our vet, we are now treating him for disc disease, which is being managed with steroids. He sometimes needs help getting up off the ground, and will need to be kept on the first floor of a home with stairs. We are looking for a home that he will not have to do any stairs, inside or outside. The steroids have helped him tremendously- he will trot around by himself no problem. He loves toys, particularly ones that give him a little mental stimulation, and he will stay outside and lay in the grass all day if you let him, so a fenced in outdoor area is a bonus! He is house trained, but because of his injury he has some problems with incontinence that can be easily managed with a diaper or by keeping him in an area that can be easily sanitized. He is good with cats and other dogs, and loves getting attention and belly rubs from anyone who comes by! \n\n\n\n\n",

He is strong, confident and can be a bit overwhelming when playing with certain other dogs but he is VERY smart and loves to learn and play. He would do best in a shepherd experienced home that knows his temperament type with children over 12. King is a great dog that just needs to find the right place to lay his head...could that be you?\n\nKing is up to date on vaccinations, is micro-chipped, and is Neutered. \nAdoption fee is $350.\n\n\n**For more information regarding ROAR\u2019s adoption policies and procedures, please visit our website at roar-ridgefield.org and select the \u2018adopt\u2019 tab on the home page.

We are looking for an adopter that will be planning on taking him to training classes. He will benefit from as much socialization as possible because of his Terrier breed. We think he will be medium to large in size when fully grown. He has been around dogs, cats, and lots of people. He needs an owner that has plenty of time to giving him attention and training. \n\nFor adoption please fill out an adoption application on our website,  www.spcaeasttx.com.

He currently weighs 53 lbs, but needs to put on some more weight.\n\nAtlas recently arrived in Maine and was a little timid at first, but is now beginning to settle into his foster home. He is doing well with the resident dog and has been great with the two cats so far. He likes to ride in cars.\n\nAtlas is a very gentle, sweet-natured guy. Everyone at the vet's office loved him when he came in for his exam. We think he will make a nice family dog.\n\nHistory: Atlas was discovered wandering the back roads of Simpson County, Mississippi. He was not wearing a collar or microchip, and nobody claimed him on the area's lost and found website.\n\nAtlas has been neutered and is up-to-date on vaccinations. He is being fostered in southern Maine.\n\nAdoption fees cover age specific vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip, heartworm/lyme/ehrlichia test, worming and transport fees. \n\nAdoption fees: \nThrough 6 months of age $450; \n7 months to through 5 years $400; \n6 years and under 9 years $325: bonded pairs are $500; \n9 years and older $250: bonded pairs are $300 \n\nAlmost Home Rescue of New England is a 501 c 3 non-profit rescue; rescuing dogs since 2005. All Adoption applications are completed on line at www.almosthomerescue.net \n\nThis dog is available unless it is marked as Pending, meaning Pending Adoption. This dog is in foster care locally, ONLY if Maine or New Hampshire is listed next to the dogs name; otherwise, the dog is still waiting with our partner rescue for an adoption or foster home in New England. \n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior dogs have a history of being kept up to date on rabies and distemper, have had annual heartworm tests, and are on heartworm preventative at least 6 months of the year. Current pets must by spayed/neutered. \n\nImported dogs are transported on a USDA approved transport with a Health Certificate. All imported dogs are quarantined 14 days prior to getting on transport.",

We charge a \"VETTING FEE\" of $100 per canine adopted. This \"VETTING FEE\" includes the spay/neuter, microchipping, Rabies vaccination, annual vaccination, Bordetella, initial deworming, city registration, and a surgery filing fee. State law requires that every animal adopted from a city shelter be spayed or neutered. Transport can be arranged to the New England area.</p>\n</div>\n\nRaj is 3 years old",

As far as we can tell, her initial rescuer and her foster\u2026 that\u2019s the only peopling she\u2019s ever done. \n\nWhen Raven came to us she was approximately 4/5 months old and completely terrified and would tremble and cower back from any touch or interaction. Raven has come such a long way, she now asks for affection(but only in the morning and only if you don\u2019t act too excited for it), she chooses to be in the same room we are in, she will play with the other dogs inside instead of only outside away from the humans, she eats her food even when we are standing next to her and will take a treat from our hands! This beautiful girl will be a very easy companion for someone, small kids probably not a great idea simply because she doesn\u2019t care for loud or sudden noises. \nRaven has not one ounce of nervous aggression she simply needs time to trust that you\u2019re a good human! \nRaven will take time, love and patience but the reward of her love and trust makes it easy! \n\nRaven is an 8 month old lab mix. She is current on shots, heart worm and flea and tick prevention, spayed, and microchipped.",

Her coat is jet black with some white markings on her chest; she is a good looking girl! Porsche weighs 48 pounds so she is considered to be a medium sized adult dog. She is leash trained and very well behaved when being leash walked. She would be okay with children but should not be in a home with other dogs--she needs to be an only dog. Porsche is active, playful, and would need a nice fenced yard where she could safely play. If you are looking for a great all around dog please come out and meet our Porsche soon.Dog/puppy adoption fees are $120 and cat/kitten adoption fees are $50. Our adoption fees cover a microchip, microchip registration, discounted spay/neuter certificate, deworming, vaccinations (as age and law requires), and a courtesy vet exam at participating offices. Unless otherwise indicated under 'special needs' our dogs have screened heart worm negative.",

            "description": "Betsy is a 7-year-old mixed breed rescued from a high-kill shelter. This dog is current on vaccinations, microchipped, 4dx/heartworm tested, and spayed/neutered. This dog is also tested with other dogs, kennel-trained, and housebroken. We would love for you to meet this dog and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: While we typically host weekly Saturday adoption events, in order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment and/or adoption handoff. Appointments and handoffs are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, adoption appointments and handoffs are only offered for individual animals. When adopting at an appointment, please be aware that you will be taking the animal home that day. We can not hold animals to be picked up at a later date.\n\nDue to CDC's recommended COVID-19 protocols, we are highly encouraging foster homes and adopters to speak with one another via phone or video chat to ensure compatible matches and limit in-person contact. If meeting in person, our foster homes are encouraged to wear masks, socially distance, and choose an outdoor meeting spot. Should you want to proceed forward with the adoption, all adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees are to be completed electronically. Quick and low-contact animal handoff is also being encouraged amongst foster homes and adopters. As always, we include a one-week trial period with all our adoptions.\u00a0***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption! If you would like more information on our organization please visit our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org.",

We're told that in her previous home, she lived with kids from newborns to age 12 and was fantastic. While she loves people, she's a little more selective when it comes to other dogs (and isn't a fan of small ones) so for that reason, we're going to require a meet-and-greet for any resident dogs. Luna's former owners had this to say about her: Luna is an amazing dog. She is sweet and loving. She is loyal to her person. Her favorite toys are huge stuffed animals. We call them her babies and she totes them all over the house. It's so cute. In play group, Luna was nervous at first, then became social and friendly, initiating and engaging in in a little bit of play. Luna also enjoyed the pool and was friendly to her handlers. If Luna sounds like the girl for you, make an appointment to meet her today.",

Rottie? We do know that whatever got mixed together turned into something amazing. Although he hasn't had much training, he walks nicely on a leash and is a good boy. He loves hanging outside and is looking for an active family to take him on hikes and adventures. Call the adoption desk if you are looking for an amazing big dog. Primary Color: Brown Brindle Secondary Color: White Weight: 38kg Age: 3yrs 0mths 2wks Animal has been Neutered",

            "description": "BonBon is a 4-month-old mixed breed rescued from a high-kill shelter. This dog is current on vaccinations, microchipped, and spayed/neutered. This puppy is currently in foster care learning home etiquette, kennel training, and housebreaking. BonBon is child-friendly with children 8+. We would love for you to meet this puppy and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: While we typically host weekly Saturday adoption events, in order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment and/or adoption handoff. Appointments and handoffs are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, adoption appointments and handoffs are only offered for individual animals. When adopting at an appointment, please be aware that you will be taking the animal home that day. We can not hold animals to be picked up at a later date.\n\nDue to CDC's recommended COVID-19 protocols, we are highly encouraging foster homes and adopters to speak with one another via phone or video chat to ensure compatible matches and limit in-person contact. If meeting in person, our foster homes are encouraged to wear masks, socially distance, and choose an outdoor meeting spot. Should you want to proceed forward with the adoption, all adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees are to be completed electronically. Quick and low-contact animal handoff is also being encouraged amongst foster homes and adopters. As always, we include a one-week trial period with all our adoptions.\u00a0***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption! If you would like more information on our organization please visit our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org.",

            "description": "Meet Scruffy! Scruffy weighs 32 lbs and is just over a year old. Our best guess is that Scruffy is a Lab/Terrier mix.\n\nScruffy gets along with adult dogs but does not have a lot of patience with puppies. His best buddies at the shelter were two large male mixed breed dogs. Scruffy has not been cat-tested.\n\nScruffy has a silly personality and will do the cutest little head tilt when you talk to him, as if he's trying hard to understand what you're saying. He wants to bond with his person so badly, and will be a most loyal companion.\n\nScruffy gets nervous in new situations and will need some time to decompress and get his bearings. We therefore feel he would not be good match for households with small children. His perfect home would be a bit more rural, with another larger, older dog to help show him the ropes. Someone who has experience with rescue dogs would be ideal.\n\nScruffy has been neutered and is up-to-date on his vaccinations. He is being fostered in southern Maine.\n\nAdoption fees cover age specific vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip, heartworm/lyme/ehrlichia test, worming and transport fees. \n\nAdoption fees: \nThrough 6 months of age $450; \n7 months to through 5 years $400; \n6 years and under 9 years $325: bonded pairs are $500; \n9 years and older $250: bonded pairs are $300 \n\nAlmost Home Rescue of New England is a 501 c 3 non-profit rescue; rescuing dogs since 2005. All Adoption applications are completed on line at www.almosthomerescue.net \n\nThis dog is available unless it is marked as Pending, meaning Pending Adoption. This dog is in foster care locally, ONLY if Maine or New Hampshire is listed next to the dogs name; otherwise, the dog is still waiting with our partner rescue for an adoption or foster home in New England. \n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior dogs have a history of being kept up to date on rabies and distemper, have had annual heartworm tests, and are on heartworm preventative at least 6 months of the year. Current pets must by spayed/neutered. \n\nImported dogs are transported on a USDA approved transport with a Health Certificate. All imported dogs are quarantined 14 days prior to getting on transport.",

Her owners were on a fixed income and could not afford to spay/neuter their pets so they requested help from rescue with this litter of puppies.  BARC agreed to help with puppies and spaying momma and daddy dog as well.  This breed is especially gentle and loving and should make excellent family pets.  They are high energy pets and require a lot of love and tender loving care and exercise.   A home with a fenced yard for safe play is a must. Rescue has their vaccines and wormers up to date and they are microchipped.  Rescue also pays for them to be spay/neutered and receive a rabies vaccine from one of our approved vets when they are old enough.

            "description": "Apply at: http://www.plannedpethood.org/adopt/available-dogs.html\n\nHi, I'm Duke. I'm a 6 year old coonhound mix. I am a very sturdy 90 pounds but my people think that I need a diet, whatever that is. I just know that I love food and don't like to share it with the other dogs. I had to be surrendered when my previous owner got very sick and could not take care of me even though I was very loved. I am a super laid back guy. I love to just lounge around and hang out with my people. I am great with kids and cats. I am pretty good with other dogs so long as they are laid back like me. My fosters have a 4 year old lab that I am great with but I think that the 7 month old boxer puppy is a little annoying. He likes to jump on me and try to get me to play but I would rather snooze. I am a very well mannered boy. I do not need to be crated and am fully housebroken. I am very devoted to my people and love to be wherever they are. I am okay on a leash and don't pull but when I pick up a scent, I want to follow it so I sometimes get a little distracted. All in all, I am a very sweet boy just looking for a loving family to call my own. If you are interested in meeting Duke, please fill out an application. \n\nPlease understand the statements about this animal are based upon the foster home's evaluation of the animal.  The animal might behave differently (negatively or positively) in your home.  While the animal might be good with the current foster\u2019s dogs, cats, children, etc., it may not be with your animal(s) or children.  The animal may be housebroken or litter trained in the home of the foster but may relapse in your home.  The animal is represented to the public as it performs in the foster home and any statements made regarding the animal are conditional to that foster home setting.  Those interested in adopting should have read all information about the animal and understand they cannot claim they did not understand the facts about this animal as understood by Planned Pethood and/or the foster.

Meaning he was good with everyone there. =) Very energetic and very strong. Would do well as an only dog too but loves other dogs. He does still tend to \"mount\" them though. shots, rabies, neutered and fixed now. He is also learning, sit, give paw, kennel, and down. Very smart dog.\n\n****PLEASE DO NOT CALL TO CHECK STATUS OF A DOG...PHONE CALLS ARE FOR EMERGENCIES ONLY. EMAIL US WITH ANY QUESTIONS ON ADOPTION AS WE DO NOT GET BACK TO PHONE CALLS ABOUT ADOPTION.\n\nShots up to date (DHPP), wormed, micro chipped, altered (spayed/neutered). We also now give one free vet visit with our local vet within first 3 days of adoption!!\n\nAdoption cost for this dog is $250\n\nWe are a rescue, and although we have a facility in Modesto most of our dogs/pups are currently being fostered in or around our area. So please be willing to make the trip to see them if you are from out of the area. Our adoption process REQUIRES that an application must first be submitted and approved prior to meeting any of our pets. Just note that we may get several responses on one pet at a time so just because you have an approved application does not mean said pet is on hold for you. One must FIRST confirm an appointment to meet the pet after an approved application has been sent. To inquire about this specific pet, please write to info@pupznpalz.org for an application. Please remember to put the pets name in the subject line when emailing, and on the top on the application. It helps us to help you that must faster. We are a group of volunteers, and ask that you please bare with us. We will get to each person just as quickly as we can. If you do not hear back from us within 24 hours, please send another request as we have been having problems with e-mail.\n\nemail: info@pupznpalz.org and ask for an application for which dog you are interested in\n\nphone: 209-480-8662 (9-6 pm only please, cell phone, emergencies only please...do not call to ask status of dog, email please)\n\n**ADOPTION EVENTS: typically every Sat at Modesto Petco 2021 Evergreen Ave from 12-3\n\n**OUR FACILITY: Located at 1430 Carpenter Lane Suite B (by appointment only as we do not have set hours)",

I am  up to date on my vaccines and I have been  neutered. I also have micro chips. I am a puppy and will need regular puppy training and will need a home with a fence. I will need to stay on heart worm prevention and live inside the house. If you would like to meet me please go to www.mobilespca.org and complete an online adoption application and someone will give you a call and set up an appointment. \n\nADOPTION FEE: $250\n3 Months\n7 Pounds\nHeart Worm Negative\n\nABOUT OUR PETS: All of our pets available for adoption have been spayed/neutered, tested for heartworms, given age-appropriate vaccinations, microchipped and are on flea and heartworm preventative medication.\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS: To give each dog the best possible home we require a completed Adoption Application.  Screening and approval by our Adoption Coordinators and a home visit  may be required to make sure  this pet fits into your home and the home fits our pet.\n\nCONTACT US:If you would like  to give this dog a good home please call the Mobile SPCA office at 251-633-3531 or drop by our Adoption Center located at 620 Zeigler Circle W, Mobile, AL 36608 - Tuesday through Friday from 9 a.m.  to 5:30 p.m. and Thursday and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.\n\nCAN'T ADOPT?  SPONSOR OR DONATE!</strong> </strong>This wonderful animal is just one of many in our care right now. Your sponsorship helps us provide shelter, food, and tender loving care for the animals until they find new loving homes. Adoption fees do not cover our expenses, so your sponsorship will make a positive impact on our organization and especially on our animals\u2019 well being. Please note: we are not a chapter or affiliate of any national animal organization. We are, moreover, very grateful for your generosity.\n\nThank you!",
