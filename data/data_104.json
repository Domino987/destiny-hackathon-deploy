Both babies can be protective around new dogs so it's better they go to a home without other dogs.   No apartments, townhomes, or condos, please.\n\nAGE-5.5 years old Energy level- -Low Medical history- Ling just had a complete blood chemistry including a thyroid panel and she is in great health! No issues!  Ideal home- Detached home with a secure fenced yard.\n Lily is 9 pounds.  Lily and Leo are still available for adoption. We will change their status if they are no longer available.  Lily came to CHR with her littermate Leo. We are hoping to adopt them together for the reduced adoption fee of $700.00. Both babies are in excellent health. Lily has a precious character.  She does great on car rides. Lily and Leo hang out together and have very spunky personalities. We are asking that they go to a home with no other pets and a secure fenced in yard. Both babies were used to going on potty pads in their previous home, so the backyard, along with dog walks, is helping with getting them used to eliminate outdoors.  The foster parents are smitten with these cuties.  They go outside for potty breaks every few hours. They need someone home part of the day because they require frequent potty breaks like most small doggies. Lily's foster mom keeps a diaper on her to avoid potty accidents.\n\n Application-https://fs8.formsite.com/Caringhearts/form1/index.html",

PLEASE UNDERSTAND WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EMAILS ASKING IF LEO IS AVAILABLE. \n\nMeet Leo\n\n\nPLEASE READ before emailing. CHR only adopts to the DC Metro area. \nVisit https://www.caringheartsrescue.org/faq  for more information on our policies. \n\nLily and Leo are still available for adoption. We will change their status if they are no longer available. \n\nLily came to CHR with her littermate Leo. We are hoping to adopt them together for the reduced adoption fee of $700.\n\nThis little bumpkin is only 9 pounds.  His owner passed away, and he found himself with CHR in the hopes of finding a new home.\nLeo came to CHR with his sister, Lily.  They seem pretty attached to each other, so we are hoping to find them a home together since they were littermates.  Leo is charming and will seek out attention from his pet parents.  His past parents were worried that a hawk might swoop down and take Ling while out on a potty break outside, so they chose only to use pee pads for elimination breaks. Leo's current foster sits outside with the dogs to make sure they potty outside because they will often run inside the house and pee even after being let outside for a potty break. To avoid accidents, Leo's foster mom keeps a belly band on him.   \n\nBecause the two pups were littermates, we are hoping to adopt them together for the reduced adoption fee of $700.\nHaving a fenced yard is ideal for these sweeties for their new potty training regimen.  \nAlso, they don\u2019t like doing stairs, so keep this in mind if you have long stairways leading out of your home because that would be a problem for them.      \n\nLeo can be barky and snappy at dogs he does not know so we would like them to go to a home without other pets. \n \nLeo did fine at the grooming shop and behaved nicely on car rides.  He\u2019s a very gentle baby boy.  \nVisit his application here-   https://fs8.formsite.com/Caringhearts/form1/index.html\n",

In reality he is a very insecure dog who puts on a front to keep people away. It takes time, but once you gain his trust he becomes sweet and full of personality. \nHe will always have a strong personality and think he is king of the castle so he would need someone with very good dog skills and who can understand him. It is a long process, but so worth the journey.\nHe can live with other dogs, but is very selective who he shares his home with and would likely have to live in a managed home of some kind. Don't let all this fool you because beneath his tough guy exterior lies a sweet, silly little guy who, once he let's his guard down, would make a great companion. He does require relationship building and multiple visits so he would need a patient and understanding person.",

Easy to walk on leash and full of affection! Nala is 4 years old. We believe she was born deaf but we don't know for sure. She became available because her original owner left the state and his job did not allow enough time for her (12 plus hour wok days). Nala knows the following commands by hand signal: Shake, Sit, Down and Stay. She is fully potty trained and barks at the door to let you know she needs to potty. She has never lived with children so an adult only home is best for her. Her ideal setting would be a house with no other pets.  She is easy to walk on leash and has a low to medium energy level.  If interested, please send an email with details about your experience owing pets, your household and where you currently reside (just to know how close you are to our foster home).  Nala plays well with other dogs, however she is food aggressive (not with humans just with dogs) so that is why we are suggesting her as an only pet.  She would be a great human companion.\n\nThank you!\nlovehabitatrescue@live.com\n",

Olive has a pronounced limp, but that doesn't stop Olive from running and playing and living her best life though! Olive is dog selective and should not be in a multi-dog (more than 2) dog household.\n\nOlive should be considered a special needs adoption.  Olive suffered a bad injury to her front leg prior to coming into the shelter.  Unfortunately, this injury was not treated at the time and it healed poorly.   Olive will require long term pain medication to help keep her comfortable.

My name is Callie Sue, and I'm looking for my forever home! I thought I'd give you an update on myself since I've been with my foster family for a bit, and have learned so much. I may not have had the best start to my short life, but I'm learning people and other dogs are nice to have in my life. After living with a family, in a house, and with other dogs, I'm learning to trust. I am still easily startled with loud sounds or quick movements, but I recover much faster and instead of continuing to run and hide, I will now come back and investigate. I am now fully housetrained, and have gone several weeks without an accident! I'm a pretty smart girl. My foster family has 2 other dogs that I live with, and let me tell you- they have taught me so much about what being a dog is all about! I now play with them, and with toys, and act silly and even get the zoomies! I still like to eat in a quieter place, away from any possible interruptions, but it's okay my foster family doesn't mind that I prefer to eat in the living room while everyone else is in the kitchen. I am still a little cautious of new people, but if you just go slow, and give me a minute to figure it out, I promise I will give you all the love. My foster family has been so great in giving me time to get comfortable with everyone. I still tend to trust females faster than males, but if I do come around if you just keep showing me it's okay. My foster mom says the best forever home for me would be a family with older children for now. Because I still startle so easily, it's probably still best that my forever family not have quick moving young children. I won't hurt them, I'll just always be running away from them. It would also be best for my home to have another dog that I can look to for guidance. I do like running and playing with other dogs and I really look to them to show me how to be a dog. I am still working on my basic commands, my foster family had to start at the beginning- just realizing that I could take a treat from their hand. I'm getting it, we're just making baby steps. My foster family has noticed that with my increased confidence that I have quite a prey drive. This means I LOVE chasing the bunnies and squirrels, I will hunt for them even when they get out of the yard. This may mean, I may not be the best dog to live with a kitty friend, but I haven't met one yet, so I don't know for sure. I am also rather athletic and have some serious hops. I tend to jump fences (especially those short ones) when I get nervous. The more comfortable I've become in my own yard, the less I've made an attempt to jump. Finally, once I've learned to trust my humans, I get a little worried when they aren't around. I would love a family that would be around most of the time. If I do need to stay at home without you- it helps if you can leave me with something to keep my mind off of things. My favorite treat is a kong stuffed full of yummy things that my foster mom freezes. Man I can that will keep me busy for a good long while. If you think you're family would love to give a shy, sweet girl like myself a forever home- please reach out to these amazing people at T.A.R.A and ask more about me, Callie Sue! I'm learning so much everyday and I've come so far in such a short time. I may be the perfect fit for your family and you'll never know if you don't ask about me.\n\nApproximate Birthdate: April 2018\n\nAdoption Fee: $150.00\n\nTARA's adoption fee includes: spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, heartworm test (if age appropriate), heartworm and flea prevention, and deworming.

            "description": "Jessie is one of those dogs who will be your BFF no matter what. She bonds with her family and is very loving and loyal with her foster mom and her young daughter. She can be a little reserved with strangers but once she knows you, you have a loyal, steadfast companion for life. Still a young girl at about 2 years of age, this Shepherd, Lab and a mix of possibly a couple other breeds is a very well mannered girl. Jessie spent time with our trainer and quickly learned her basic obedience skills and will respond to her commands quickly. She aims to please but is not up in your face about it. She sleeps through the night and is house trained in her foster home with access to the yard. Jessie is just easy going and will go with the flow observing from afar. She can be your at home work partner because you will hardly know she is in the room while you work away or jump on your Zoom calls. Jessie is wonderful on walks and needs just a walk or two a day to be happy. She is non reactive on her leash when you see people or other dogs which makes your walks relaxing. Jessie loves her 9 year old human foster sister; they play soccer with the neighborhood kids and Jessie is the star! While most of her time is spent lounging, when her playful side comes out, she loves to play with anything - catch, chase and tug of war. She would do best in a home with kids over the age of 6, just due to her size. While she has made a few dog friends through patient intros with her foster family, Jessie can be a little reserved and choosy with other dogs and will need to be the only dog in her forever home. She also thinks kitties should be chased and will need a home without cats. She is a wonderful girl and will do great in a home with a kind and easy going family. If you're interested in meeting Jessie, your first step is completing an adoption application on our website. If you've adopted from us before or are already approved to adopt, reach out to your adoption coach for next steps. This information is as up to date and accurate as possible for the dog in its current environment. All dogs and puppies will need time and training to adjust to their new surroundings and to learn the rules of their new home. If you are interested in meeting one of our dogs, the first step is to complete the Adoption Form on our website at www.labsandmore.org and take some time to review our adoption process. Your adoption includes the spay or neuter, current vaccinations, microchip, and other services provided while in our care. The safety and health of our puppies is priority one, so we only allow approved applicants to meet and handle puppies. Please understand everything we do is for the dogs and conducted by our kind and generous volunteers. We rely solely on donations, and we do not profit from a dog's adoption. Labs and More is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that operates on donations and time dedicated to this cause by volunteers. Your adoption will save the life of future dogs in need. Labs and More makes no guarantees regarding the behavior, breed, or age of the dogs in our care. Although we strive to provide necessary medical care to dogs in our care, we cannot predict future or current medical needs whether they were symptomatic or not at the time of adoption.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application. If you have any questions email us at doginfo@labsandmore.org or call us at 858-273-5386. Thank you for looking to a rescue group to fulfill your dream of adding a new dog to your life!

            "description": "This beautiful lady is Ebony!  She's a 4 year old Cane Corso and weighs in at 106 pounds. Ebony is super lovable, fun-loving, playful, and she has this adorable sassy attitude (in a fun way).  Ebony has so many wonderful qualities, but she is also incredibly strong, so she requires an owner with large breed experience.  She'd also prefer to have a large fenced-in yard to play in. \n\nDue to Ebony's strength and the fact that she can startle easily at times, we are requesting she go to a home with no kids under the age of 16 years old.  She doesn't appear to be a fan of other dogs, though they don't phase her on walks.  Not sure how she'd do with kitty cats.  \n\nEbony has a history of a previously fractured leg which is now completely healed.   Ebony LOVES walks, and she does  well on the leash - though occasionally she thinks it's a toy.  Her friend also tells us that she's excellent riding in the car. \n\nIf you are interested in this beautiful gal, apply today!  Her minimum adoption fee is $275 plus a $12 fee, if 4 months or older, for rabies registration for McLean County residents.\n\nShe has been spayed, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm checked, dewormed, and is on flea and heartworm preventatives.\n\nFor information about this dog's breed(s), visit: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/abc.htm \n\nTo fill out our adoption application, go to: http://fs16.formsite.com/WishBoneCanineRescue/adoptionapplication/index.html",

Not only is Lily a goofball with an active spirit, she is also a gentle sweetie who loves to snuggle, be prepared to have a 80 pound lap dog!\nLily's smile can light up a room and even though she can't hear, she leaves an impression on everyone who meets her. \nLily is Deaf.\nShe is looking for a dog experienced household that is able to continue her sign language and basic obedience training. Lily has learned so much while at CHS which only proves what a determined and smart this gal is.\nLily would do best in a home without young children or other pets. \nShe is a big girl who loves to play, which can be too much for some children and pets. Lily is dog social and would really enjoy going for walks with other pups, but her off leash play style can come across as too much for other dogs.

            "description": "Meet Maddie! She\u2019s a little over a year old and around 50lbs. Maddie had a rough start to life, found emaciated and too weak to move on the side of the road. Luckily she received the care she needed at the shelter. Unfortunately with such a traumatic start to life, Maddie is very fearful of new people. Maddie has been fully vetted and has been living in a foster home for around 6 months. \n\nMaddie is looking for a very specific type of home due to her fear. She\u2019s made progress with socializing and will continue to in the right home, but will need a very patient, quiet, routine place. Her adopter should have plenty of previous dog/training/behavior experience. Maddie seems to bond more easily with women, men are more \u201cscary\u201d and she will bark/growl when unsure. She is working on potty training, is crate trained and knows commands like sit, down, place & stay. Once she trusts you she loves you completely! Maddie walks well on a leash, although with her fearfulness she enjoys walking in more remote, quiet areas at this time. Maddie enjoys running and playing in her fenced yard as well and a fenced yard is a requirement for her new home due to her fear. She would not be a good fit for apartment life or a busy neighborhood. She has a medium energy level and would benefit from continued training with her family. Maddie does well with most other dogs but would do best in a home without cats or kids. She is fully vetted, her adoption fee is $200.\n\nAre you Maddie\u2019s unicorn adopter?

We rescued Madison from a high-kill shelter and since arriving on April 10, 2020 she\u2019s quickly become a shelter favorite. She has a joy for living and she\u2019d love nothing better than belonging to a family who loves her. \nMadison is about 1 1/2 years old and currently weighs 51 pounds. She\u2019s thought to be a retriever mix. She\u2019s a bigger pup, tall and lanky with a beautiful, angora-soft golden brown coat. We\u2019re not sure what this young pup has gone through in life, but she seems afraid of other dogs and will give chase to cats. She's also terrified of children and will shut down, but she LOVES people. She welcomes attention for adults and will happily sit with her person. She is an active girl and an active lifestyle would suit her best. She\u2019s learning to walk on a leash and she knows how to sit already. Madison is being showered with affection and kindness and every day she grows a little more confident in the scary and noisy shelter. If you\u2019re looking for a terrific young dog to welcome as your best companion and make part of your activities, Madison may be the girl for you.\nCall 706-865-4135 for information on additional health services provided as part of the adoption fee.  If interested in one of our puppies or dogs, please submit an application online or at the shelter. Applications can be submitted online at: https://www.charlessmithgallhumanesociety.org/page/dog-adoption-application \nOnce an application is submitted online, you will receive an email saying your application has been successfully submitted.  If you don\u2019t receive this email within 24 hours, please check to make sure all application fields were completed or please call our shelter at 706-865-4135. All adopters must complete an approval process which involves a reference check with current/recent vet and a brief home visit if located in the immediate area. We do permit out of state adoptions. Adopters MUST come to the shelter to transport their new family member home. We do not ship nor do we transport them to their new homes. Adoption policies and application procedures are detailed at the shelter website: http://smithgallhumanesociety.org/ under tab All Adoptable Animals.\nCharles Smithgall Humane Society (CSHS) is a No kill shelter. Animals in our care remain safe with us until adopted. Resident animals are primarily owner relinquished and also accepted from local Animal Control. The facility usually is operating at capacity with a list of animals waiting for space to open.\nAdoptions and meet and greets are being scheduled by appointment only. Please call our office, email us or complete an application and someone will be in touch just as soon as they can. \nLocation: 4823 Helen Hwy. 75N, Sautee, GA 30571, Phone: 706-865-4135\nEmail: smithgallhumanesociety@windstream.net\nOur shelter in Sautee GA is located about 3 miles south of the alpine town of Helen in northeast GA.",

            "description": "Grayson is an incredibly handsome dog with some of the softest bunny fur you've ever felt, but this active pup prefers you not dwell on his good looks or how adorable he is - he's way too busy for all that. But if you're looking for a running sidekick or someone to help you stay active, Grayson's got you covered. This energetic pup can run fast and far, and he'd love to be your trail buddy! This lovable lad is a survivor of Hurricane Harvey, and he came to Austin with some medical issues - distemper, some seizures and skin problems. He will need medications for life, but he has not let it get him down. In fact, Grayson has found a new leash on life, and he wants to share his endless joy with his humans! He has boundless energy, and he's not picky how he gets it out. He loves any activity you can throw his way - running, hiking - whatever he can do to keep moving, because this boy's got energy to burn. If you're looking for a fun playmate, Grayson is more than up for that, too. Grayson is really stoked that toys exist; he knows where the toy chest is and he can barely wait for you to pull out a trinket. If he had to pick a favorite, he'd probably say anything he can fetch. He will sit and wait for you to throw the ball, or if you're the one sitting, he'll drop a toy in your lap until you get the picture that he's waiting patiently for you to throw something. He also likes to play tug of war, but if playing with his human isn't an option, he'll pick out a toy to chew on and keep himself entertained. Grayson would love an active home with a yard and a family with older children who can handle his rambunctious nature. He's giddy when he sees kids, and seems to know they'd make great playmates. If you think you can handle an adorable bundle of energy, come meet Grayson!",

            "description": "OBI WAN is a 3 yr old hound mix.  Obi has a laid back personality.    He likes to chase squirrels and be outside during the day. He sometimes plays with other dogs but mostly he\u2019s a great napper!  Yep, look up the definition of \u201cporch dog\u201d and there\u2019s probably a photo of Obi!    Obi gets a bit territorial around his food bowl & he\u2019s not a big fan of  unfamiliar dogs or humans, but when properly introduced, he is an amazing companion!      ObieWan is somewhat of a dog with a cat soul.  He\u2019s not gonna crawl up for a snuggle but when HE wants some lovin\u2019 & cuddles, ITs on!     He\u2019s a bit afraid of thunderstorms and still thinks he\u2019s about a 10 pound puppy when he climbs up into your lap.     Obie Wan will make some lucky family a precious pet!    \n\nAll our adoption fees include spay/neuter, micro-chip, up-to-date vaccinations, including rabies thru date of adoption. This pup tested heartworm negative, and is on regular monthly heartworm prevention & on flea/tick prevention. \n\nIn order to be considered for one of our beautiful pups, please go to our website and complete and application: https://www.mustluvdogs.org/adoptable-pets.\nPlease note that we are a DUE DILIGENCE adoption organization. Part of our approval process requires, among other things:\n* Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered.\n*The majority, but not all, of our pets require a fenced yard or secure enclosure.  In the case of apartments, we require Landlord approval and designated dog area in complex.\n*Verifiable good veterinary history INCLUDING regular vaccination/visits and good Heartworm Prevention history is a MUST!\n*Adopter must be able to have time to spend with the pup and be able to provide the pup a safe environment to live.\n*ALL our dogs are expected to be primarily INSIDE dogs.  They MUST sleep inside the home.  We truly understand that some folks have working dogs (i.e. farmers, ranchers,etc); however, the majority of our dogs have had a rough life prior to coming to us & we want to make sure that they are showered with LUV & maybe even a bit spoiled for the rest of their lives. \n\nOther facts are also considered, including whether children or other pets are a good fit with the dog. \n\nMust Luv Dogs reserves the right to deny any applications that we don't think are a good fit with the pup. Our first & foremost concern is the dog's best interest. It is our MISSION to place them in a home that is a great fit for their needs for a lifetime of luv & being part of a family.\n*We will consider adoptions in any area; however, will do not ship or transport puppies under the age of 12 mos. We will ONLY transport an adult dog on a transport approved by MLD, at adopter's expense.\n* In order to be affordable and afford every family an opportunity to have a pup of their own, we keep our Adoption Fees low; however, please keep in mind that the fees we charge do not cover all costs for the pup.  Any additional donations are greatly appreciated!\n\nPlease note that all of our pets are in private foster homes. In order to reduce any stress or confusion for our pups, we require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meet & greet for any of our pups.  Alternatively, you are always welcome to come meet any of our pups at one of our regular Adoption Events.   Our events are always posted on PetFinder OR on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/mustLUVdogs.org.\n\nFinally, THANK YOU for considering Must Luv Dogs for your next pet. \n\n*Most dogs require a fenced area in yard. \n*Apartments okay IF nearby dog park or walking trails (with landlord appoval).\n*ALL dogs must be INSIDE dogs and treated a part of family. \n*We are a DUE DILIGENCE Adoption Rescue.  \n*Must have good Vet history & Heartworm prevention is a MUST!\n*ALL dogs are fully vetted, spay/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption.\n\nFYI:   Even though this pup tested heartworm negative, we provide the following procedural information for your information:  Any of our pups who test HW+ are treated with the *slow kill method of treatment.   The *slow-kill method, simply stated, is a 30 day regiment of  doxycycline followed by a monthly dose of Advantage Multi for 12 months, then retesting.   Most dogs test negative after one year of following this treatment; however, we always recommend that potential adopters consult & follow the advice of their family veterinarian upon adopting any of our hw+ pups.   Although the fast-kill method is still considered the \"gold-standard\" by the AVA, and may be preferred by some vets; the slow-kill method has proven to be effective in our rescue. The main reason we utilize this method is due to our limited financial constraints and the high number of our rescue pups that are infected.   In the cases of severe infection and if the pup is highly symptomatic, we sometimes use the fast-kill approach instead.   Again, we recommend for you to consult with your veterinarian after the adoption is complete and follow their recommendations.",

            "description": "Rhodie is a 41 pound, beautiful, playful approx. 3 year old hound mix.  Only a family who has the patience to gain her trust need apply.    It may take awhile to get her comfortable but boy is she worth it!   She is the funniest and most loving pup!  This sweet girl is leash trained, house trained and kennel trained.   She is content to sleep in her kennel at nap time and all night.  She has mastered \"SIT\" and is quickly catching on to other commands.    Rhoda is both very smart and clumsily funny.  This girl is the definition of HAPPY!    When she gets excited, she \"DANCES\" with her front feet.  She would enjoy being in a home with other pups.  She wouldn't be good with kids because they tend to make her nervous.    She LOVES to play chase with her foster siblings all day long but will gladly give up playing for a snuggle session with her humans.   Belly rubs are encouraged!  She really enjoys sniffing and exploring her backyard and trying her best to make friends with the birds and squirrels.     This precious girl would go on walks ALL DAY LONG, if offered!    Like many rescue pups, this furbaby is HW+, but is currently undergoing the *slow-kill method of treatment (see more information below).  \n\nAll our adoption fees include spay/neuter, micro-chip, up-to-date vaccinations, including rabies thru date of adoption. This pup is heartworm positive and is currently being treated with the *slow kill method, approved by her veterinarian, on prevention & on flea/tick prevention. \n\n*The slow kill method of treatment, simply stated, is a 30 day regiment of  doxycycline followed by a monthly dose of Advantage Multi for 12 months, then retesting.   Most dogs test negative after one year of following this treatment; however, we always recommend that potential adopters consult & follow the advice of their family veterinarian upon adopting any of our hw+ pups.   Although the fast-kill method is still considered the \"gold-standard\" by the AVA, and may be preferred by some vets; the slow-kill method has proven to be effective in our rescue. The main reason we utilize this method is due to our limited financial constraints and the high number of our rescue pups that are infected.   In the cases of severe infection and if the pup is highly symptomatic, we sometimes use the fast-kill approach instead.   Again, we recommend for you to consult with your veterinarian after the adoption is complete and follow their recommendations.   \n\nIn order to be considered for one of our beautiful pups, please go to our website and complete and application: https://www.mustluvdogs.org/adoptable-pets.\nPlease note that we are a DUE DILIGENCE adoption organization. Part of our approval process requires, among other things:\n* Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered.\n*The majority, but not all, of our pets require a fenced yard or secure enclosure.  In the case of apartments, we require Landlord approval and designated dog area in complex.\n*Verifiable good veterinary history INCLUDING regular vaccination/visits and good Heartworm Prevention history is a MUST!\n*Adopter must be able to have time to spend with the pup and be able to provide the pup a safe environment to live.\n*ALL our dogs are expected to be primarily INSIDE dogs.  They MUST sleep inside the home.  We truly understand that some folks have working dogs (i.e. farmers, ranchers,etc); however, the majority of our dogs have had a rough life prior to coming to us & we want to make sure that they are showered with LUV & maybe even a bit spoiled for the rest of their lives. \n\nOther facts are also considered, including whether children or other pets are a good fit with the dog. \n\nMust Luv Dogs reserves the right to deny any applications that we don't think are a good fit with the pup. Our first & foremost concern is the dog's best interest. It is our MISSION to place them in a home that is a great fit for their needs for a lifetime of luv & being part of a family.\n*We will consider adoptions in any area; however, will do not ship or transport puppies under the age of 12 mos. We will ONLY transport an adult dog on a transport approved by MLD, at adopter's expense.\n* In order to be affordable and afford every family an opportunity to have a pup of their own, we keep our Adoption Fees low; however, please keep in mind that the fees we charge do not cover all costs for the pup.  Any additional donations are greatly appreciated!\n\nPlease note that all of our pets are in private foster homes. In order to reduce any stress or confusion for our pups, we require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meet & greet for any of our pups.  Alternatively, you are always welcome to come meet any of our pups at one of our regular Adoption Events.   Our events are always posted on PetFinder OR on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/mustLUVdogs.org.\n\nFinally, THANK YOU for considering Must Luv Dogs for your next pet. \n\n*Most dogs require a fenced area in yard. \n*Apartments okay IF nearby dog park or walking trails (with landlord appoval).\n*ALL dogs must be INSIDE dogs and treated a part of family. \n*We are a DUE DILIGENCE Adoption Rescue.  \n*Must have good Vet history & Heartworm prevention is a MUST!\n*ALL dogs are fully vetted, spay/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption.\n\n",

Pretty sad, right? Well that's what happened to me. I am very lucky that someone saw me and came for me. I was there all day by myself wondering how I was going to get out of that mess. I was then taken to animal control where I spent several days waiting to see if someone would come for me a 2nd time. That didn't happen.\nMy name is Floyd and I am look for a new family. I love to play with the other dogs in my foster home and I am a lovable lap dog in spite of what I have been thru. My foster mom says I am a big ole teddy bear. I have 4 kids in my foster home and I love playing with them but I also love being a couch potato so don't let my size scare you off. I love my new toys and my bed. I am crate trained and housebroken. I know a few commands and would like to learn more. My only vice is I am not a fan of cats. I probably wouldn't hurt them but they seem like play toys to me and that's just not good my foster mom says. I am about 2 years old and weigh appx 70lbs. If you would like to meet me send an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com. Please allow 24 hours for a reply.\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vettng...my neuter, a heart worm test, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention and a wellness exam.",

When she was taken into the shelter, she had two severely broken legs; it\u2019s more likely her injuries are due to abuse rather than natural causes; however, we\u2019ll never know for sure. Because of her injuries (or past abuse) we feel it best if Bella go to a home without children. \n\nBella is a sweet girl! She can be shy at first; but, she warms up quickly and is loving and affectionate! She will need a fenced in yard to run around in and cause trouble! \n\nThe fee to adopt Bella is $200.00; this includes spay/neuter, deworming, vaccinations and a microchip. If you are interested in adopting Bella, please visit our website. www.arfhouse.org and fill out an adoption application. \n\n**Please Note: Bella is currently located at our facility in Sherman, Texas. Adoptions are by-appointment only; if you would like to meet Bella, please fill out an application on our website. If approved, we will contact you within 48 hours to set up a time to meet Bella.",

She\u2019s at a great age, middle age, past the puppy chewy stage and ready to be a couch potato.  She apparently is an A snuggler too.   She loves people and love shown to her.   Although she\u2019s totally cool on being an only dog and getting all your attention, she\u2019s also okay with other dogs who share her zest for couch time and snuggles.  In other words no active dogs for her.  If you want a mellow girl to mellow with you, then Katie is your girl. She recently and surgery on her leg, so all though she loves to walk, she doesn\u2019t need to walk far.  Plays a little, sleeps a little.   Sounds pretty perfect!   We do not know about cats or kids.  We expect she\u2019d be fine with kids if they treat her with kindness.    We are posting for a friend and this is not an Abbey dog.   We will be going through an application process.",

She needs time to learn that the world is not as terrifying as she currently believes it is. She previously has lived with other dogs, but seems to be more content when she is the only animal in the home. She needs a child free home, and at the time - a low to no traffic home as well.\nMillie is extremely sweet, playful, and loving once she trusts you.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Porter joined Last Hope after his owner abandoned him, leaving him behind when they moved away. This wonderfully loving boy deserves the very best in a forever home, and we're excited to introduce you to him! Porter has lived with other dogs and children, he is not interested in a home with small animals but instead prefers the company of mellow dogs his size. He has done doggie daycare and is submissive and playful with dogs his size in a small group setting\n\nIn his younger years, Porter was known for his ability to jump a fence...he has proven young at heart and can still do this when tempted! He is mellowed out now at around 6 years old, and with a responsible owner who would never leave him unattended this really should not be an issue. Porter rides in the car like a champ, and he will make a wonderful companion for someone seeking a friendly dog that is moderately active. Porter is strong on a leash, but he is respectful and listens very well!\n\nPorter's adoption fee is $250 and includes his neuter, microchip, current vaccinations and preventatives PLUS a free obedience course at Cedar Run Pet Boarding & Daycare in Hiawatha. Last Hope requires that all animals be kept as indoor pets only, be altered and current on vaccinations and preventatives. Our adoption process includes reference and background checks, a vet check and a home visit. Please submit an adoption application on our website for consideration, www.Adopthope.org",

This handsome young guy, believed to be around 3 years old, is on the prowl for a new home. Diesel is a smart and loving dog, he loves to be around people so an owner with a flexible schedule will be a great fit for him!\n\nDiesel is not a fit with cats or smaller dogs, he loves to play and has wonderful young dog energy that they wouldn't appreciate. He will be best suited with a female dog that is non-dominant and around his size, or as an only dog with a dog savvy dog owner. Diesel will be a star pupil in the FREE obedience class included in his adoption fee! Diesel is friendly with all people, although he ultimately wants a home with older kids who will play with him and help to burn off some of his energy! Diesel may be best suited to a home with a secure and physically fenced in yard as he can get very amped up at other dogs or animals passing by him.\n\nDiesel's adoption fee is $250 and includes his neuter, microchip and current vaccinations PLUS a free obedience course at Cedar Run Pet Boarding & Daycare.

Roxy is 10 years old and has some skin issues which are being treated with medicated baths. Her previous owner said that she is good with kids, good with other dogs, is housebroken, leash trained and knows basic obedience. Poor Roxy was TERRIFIED when she first arrived at the shelter but warmed up quickly. She is super friendly but timid at first with strangers. She does well during baths, walks great on the leash, like other dogs, loves to give you her paw and enjoys belly rubs. She also has dry eye in her left eye that we put ointment in daily. Roxy is a WONDERFUL dog and deserves a second chance after such a rough beginning.  For more info please contact \nKristina Jenshak\nShelter Technician\nSaginaw Animal Services\n(817)230-0460\n\n",

            "description": "*Due to COVID-19, we are currently only processing adoption applications from  Kentucky and adjoining states. To all of our potential adopters, please consider adopting or fostering animals close to home! To those potential adopters in other states, please remember us and revisit our available pet listing once the it is safe to travel more freely! Thank you!* \n\nRosie, called Jo by her foster family, is a fun and sociable puppy and is especially cute with one ear up and one ear down most all the time. She was born in March 2020 and weighed about 30 pounds in November 2020. Her sister's adoptive family had a canine DNA test done and shared the results with us. You can see the results as one of her photos. \n\nRosie LOVES to run and do the zoomies! She loves people and toys! She gets so excited that she would be better in a home without children under 12 years old. She needs a fenced yard where she can run and play. Rosie loves her cat foster brother! She loves other dogs who are nice to her. She can be a little scared of big, over-assertive dogs. She is leash-trained, house-trained AND crate-trained!  She sleeps in her kennel and will go in on command. \n\nRosie is ready and willing to learn! She needs a family with the time and interest to continue training her and  who will work with her high energy. She know \"sit\", \"lay down\", \"kennel\", \"spin\" and \"roll over\" and she's ready to learn more. She has so much love to give! She just needs to right family to find her.\n\nShe will be a wonderful addition to a family who will give her lots of love and care. Like all dogs, Rosie will be happiest when she is involved with her family and their activities his whole life.\n\nAll of our puppies are up-to-date on vaccinations, intestinal worm treatment, heart worm, flea and tick prevention and will be micro-chipped prior to adoption. Our foster families do their best to begin their house-training but please be patient with any puppy you adopt. It's a learning process!\n\nIf you are ready for the work, time, patience, expense and commitment required to raise a puppy, we welcome your adoption application. Sending us a completed application is the very first step so be sure to do that first thing! The adoption donation is $200. All of our animals must be spayed or neutered when reaching the appropriate age. A reimbursement of $50 will be sent to the adopter once we receive the receipt from the procedure. The adoption donation also includes a discount for S.T.A.R. Puppy Kindergarten or Canine Good Citizen Class. \n\nWhen applying for any adoption, please be aware that The Humane Society office is open Mon - Thurs from 10 - 3. We will respond to any inquiries or adoption submissions sent during non-office hours on the next day we are in the office. Thank you for your understanding!\n\nDog Adoption Guidelines:\n\nYou must fill out an application to be considered for adoption. You can find the application at www.ForThePets.org/adoption.htm or email humanesociety@murray-ky.net for an application.\n\nIt is not a first come process; we try to match the dog with the family for a FOREVER home. We process all applications at once and take the dog off the site, place on adoption pending status until a decision is made. If a suitable home match is not found, the dog returns to active status.\n\nThe dog adoption process can take up to two weeks; we are a small group of volunteers who mostly have full time jobs.\n\nAll of our dogs are indoor dogs with outdoor privileges, unless otherwise specified.\n\nWe do not fly or ship our dogs due to heat/cold concerns and safety issues. If you are willing to fly out AND fly the dog back in the cabin (size restrictions) with you, that would be considered.\n\nIf you apply to adopt a dog and are chosen, you must come to Murray, KY to pick up the dog and fill out the paperwork in person.\n\nWe can't provide individual meet and greet sessions for each applicant. If chosen to adopt, you will have plenty of time for your family and pets to visit with the potential new family member before signing any paperwork and will not be committed to adopt if you choose not to at that time.\n",

Dog is friendly with humans, did lunge and hard barked when he saw another dog. NSF. Dog is BAR.Behavior Observation: (4/15) Easily leashed, wiggly, and removed from kennel. Pulls moderately through shelter and does pull towards other dogs in kennel, barking at them piloerect with tail raised. Once outside, continues to pull moderately. In yard, able to handle all over and body language is loose. Accepts pets all over and rolls on back for belly rubs. No interest in toys. Easily returned to kennel and leash easily removed.(4/10) Behavior -- Social and easy to leash. Pulls heavily on leash, and although did look at other dogs in kennels while walking by, did not pull towards them. Appears to be tense and slightly aroused with heavy displacement sniffing, hypersalvation, and avoidance but will allow some gentle petting. No interest in tag/chase games and afraid of bouncing tennis ball.+Bite Details+ Police were called for stray medium sized pitbull attacking another dog on the highway. They said that a man was trying to pull this dog off of the smaller dog who was being attacked, and the man was bitten on the tip of his thumb (not a severe bite - sounds like level 3). Dog was not aggressive towards people but apparently just bit when the man got between the 2 dogs.",

My rescue friends don't know a whole lot about my background since I was found as a stray and brought to the County Shelter. I am housetrained, good on a leash, and love to be outside. \nI am definitely a girl's girl- I love women but I am nervous meeting men but I love my foster dad. For this reason I'll need a wonderful forever home that's just us ladies!\nI do great with other dogs and would love to have a doggy companion or 2! I also like cats and am friends with the cats in my foster home. I love to play ball and I am a Champion ball catcher! I also don't mind sharing my stuff with other dogs and people, and I can be easily convinced to do anything with a treat! \nPlease reach out to my rescue friends for more info on me!Please contact DayOneRescueApps@gmail.com for more info on me!",

            "description": "Behold the future apple-of-your-eye--Bella! Bella is 10yr old Pit-mix, who is an extremely smart, and well behaved older female dog. She is just looking for a low-key, low energy home to live out her Golden Years. Despite her age, Bella still likes to go for walks, a few times a week, but nothing too long or strenuous. She loves being outside in a nice fenced back yard, or can find a few toys tooccupy her time when inside, at home. Bella is house trained, crate trained, comes when she is called, and walks on leash (or harness) w/out issues. Most of all-Bella LOVES her people around her. Whether she wants to rest her head in your lap, is enjoying some one-on-one cuddle time, or is just in the same room with you-she is content. If there might be other dogs around the hone-an introduction with Bella is a MUST.... She is still working on her socializing skills. The ideal home for this gorgeous gal is with minimal noise, older or no kids, a strong, semi-active owner, a secure yard, and nothing but an abundance of love to give. If Bella sounds like your dream come true-pls reach out to DPA for more info! She can't wait to meet you! This pet is available for pre-adoption and may not be officially ready for adoption, as it is still undergoing medical treatment. Depending on the medical status, a Meet and Greet may be put on hold until they can safely participate in a meeting with potential adopters. In some cases, this pet may be able to move to its forever home while it is still under the medical care of Dallas Pets Alive. If you are interested in learning more, apply now and one of our Adoption Counselors will discuss the options available so you can bring home your new furry family member! Applications are processed in the order in which they are received; please be aware that this pet may have interested applicants ahead of you. All Dallas Pets Alive adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon adoption. The standard minimum donation for dogs over six months to seven years is $200, puppies under six months is $250, dogs eight years and over are $100 unless specified otherwise. You can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallaspetsalive.org/adopt/adoptable-dogs/ .

It took us over a month to trap her in Dearborn. She has been at our farm for over a year now and is great with dogs, potty trained and not destructive, so she can be left out. She remains shy of people and prefers to hide out in the bedroom most of the time. She has never shown any aggression. She would need a home with a fenced yard and someone that understands that she needs a long time to trust, but will be your best friend if you give her a chance. She would love a home with another dog to help her feel secure. She is submissive.\nIf you think you can open your heart and home to this sweet girl and give her true personality time to blossom... please fill out an adoption application at:\n                 www.dawghous.com \nThank you",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Meet Marley! This calm, beautiful girl was born around December 2014. This brief video shows how loving and affectionate she is. https://youtu.be/xnfSsO7wKwE\n\nWhen we got her from the shelter, Marley was terrified of everything. She cowered away from people and tried to hide under furniture. After several months of tender loving care from her foster family, she has transformed into her true loving, affectionate, confident self.\n\nOnce fearful of riding in a car, watch how she now lays calmly watching things go by. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqMHiyreBpU\n\nMarley loves people. She adores having her face and booty scratched. She warms up to visitors who come to the house; first she goes to her crate for safety, and eventually comes out. She has not been kid tested, but for now, children in the home should be old enough to know that they cannot startle her or pull her tail.\n\nMarley will learn your schedule very well. At bedtime, she sleeps on her bed in your room along with the rest of the dog pack. She sweetly wakes you up with kisses and demands for attention.\n\nShe gets super excited and jumps all over the place when she knows she's about to go on a walk in the neighborhood! Once you get going, she steps politely into place right alongside you.\n\nHer forever human needs to be a benevolent alpha leader, otherwise her past street survival skills will take over and she will rule the house. She would likely be okay as an only dog if she can spend lots of time with her people. If she has a doggie friend in her forever home, the dog should be easy-tempered and docile, otherwise they will likely clash.\n\nMarley does not tolerate the slightest hint of bad manners or disrespect from other dogs. She even takes offense if a dog accidentally wags their tail in her face or growls during introductions. Any new dogs should be introduced properly to avoid her possible overreaction.\n\nMarley likes having an open-door crate that she can use as needed. She does not sleep in it at night, but takes turns with the other dogs resting in it throughout the day.\n\nAlong with being leash trained, she is house trained and doggie-door trained. She is scared of thunderstorms, so she could use extra love and hugs during stormy days.\n\nShe loves to roam the neighborhood, so she needs a tall wooden fence to prevent her from going on her own walkabout. And she's a door-dasher! You'll have to be careful when opening the front door, otherwise, she'll dash out to go exploring by herself!\n\nMarley loves being outside in the backyard. She takes her toys out with her while she enjoys the sunlight and fresh air.\n\nIf you want to spoil her a bit, she loves having yummy vegetables, eggs, and rice in her kibble!\n\nMarley is very sweet and loving to humans who make her feel safe. She will be a wonderful addition to the right family.\n\nSPIN Pyrs are all in foster homes in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Potential adopters are asked to make travel arrangements if they live elsewhere. All SPIN dogs are spayed or neutered, current on vaccinations and on heartworm prevention. Please go to our website www.SpinRescue.org and fill out an application for this great Great Pyrenees!",

I am a BROC Senior Sunsetter and I've been living with my foster family here for nearly three years. Being a Senior Sunsetter means I'm kinda special. My mom says I'm the sweetest, most loving girl you can find. She must surely love me because even though I have ongoing health challenges, she said she will take care of me for the rest of my life. It has not been easy for her - or me! You see, I have something called 'auto-immune deficiency' so I got this bad thing on my back and tummy. Mom called it MRSA. Not sure what that means but sometimes I sure itch a lot. My mom and the doctors treated me for a over a year with all sorts of medication. Now, my mom gives me special baths every other day to keep me as comfortable as possible. Last year, I had to have surgery in my tummy. They said I had a hernia and they needed to take it out. I don't know what they did because luckily I was sound asleep. I never did see my hernia! I'm so glad that all my family at BROC take such good care of me. I wonder who is taking care of them.\n\nAt Bichon Rescue of Orange County, our commitment to our pups does not waiver when they have special needs. These special needs pups are less likely to be adopted for reasons of age, health or behavior. We have amazing volunteers committed to fostering these pups until the end but we need sponsors to help with funding all of their needs.\n\nWon't you consider supporting Candie by setting up a monthly sponsorship? Even the smallest amount will help. As a Senior Sponsor we will send you photos and updates on Candie.\n\nIf you can find it in your heart to help Candie or one of our other seniors, please copy and paste this link in your browser: https://bichonrescueoc.org/sponsorship\n\n2/1/21 4:59 PM",

Due to a large volume of calls and emails, we can ONLY ensure responses to those who fill out an application on the Carolina Hearts website (link below).\n\nAVAILABLE: Andes\n\nThrough absolutely no fault of her own, our adorable little Andes is back and ready for a new family! She is still a sassy and lovable girl who needsjust the right home to give her the structure and environment that she needs to thrive. Andes is a double merle Mini American Shepherd and at 5 years old and 15 pounds, she's the best companion for both hikes, walks in the park, a game of fetch or just cuddling up on the couch. Due to her start in a puppy mill and improper breeding, she has been deaf all her life. It's easy to forget she can't hear, though, as she is so attentive to her people and has such a zest for life.\n\nSince being back with her original foster family, Andes has grown and matured. She still knows all her original obedience commands through sign language and has learned new ones such as \"leave it\" and \"calm\". \"Place\" is her next one to conquer! She is amazing on a leash and responds very well to learning new behaviors. Andes is full of energy and needs an outlet for that energy to maintain her good behavior. She needs a strong, assertive and very committed family who will keep up the training and structure that she does so well with.\n\nAndes gets along well with people and other dogs once she is introduced properly on a leash. She could stand to learn some better manners when meeting canine friends, but once she is comfortable she loves playing and running around with her foster brother and their pack of friends. She is NOT suited for a home with small children (under 12) or cats.\n\nThis amazing girl will adjust so well once with the right family. She deserves the stability and love of some really great humans.\n\nAnders is UTD on vaccines, microchipped, and spayed. She is fostered in Greer, SC and her adoption fee is $300. If you are an approved applicant and are interested in Andes please contact the adoption committee. If you are interested and not yet approved please visit our website for adoption procedures and application.\n\nhttp://carolinaheartsrescue.org/adoption-information/\n",

I'm Jesse.\n\n I'm a 5 year old Terrier mix and I love to play!\n\nWhen the awesome officers of Hallettsville PD took me in, they tried really hard to find my owner.  You see, my owner more than likely dumped me and left me to fend for myself.  It was a really sad and scary time for me.  I was scheduled to be put to sleep and sent over the Rainbow Bridge when the awesome peeps from Lucies decided to bring me in.\n\nI am soooo much better now and have felt love like I have never known.  I have learned to run and play and have fun!  Being a grown man now, I tend to like the lady dogs better than the males.  ;)\n\nOh yeah, I'm leash and crate trained as well.\n\nI make great eye contact and would give my owner my whole heart and desire to be with them as much as possible.  Won't you please give me a chance???\n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home. Phone interviews are required for all adoptions****",

I've been living with my foster family about 6 months now; ever since this crazy 'virus' has been around.\nThey tell me I am basically a quiet dog that loves people. I am not a good 'watchdog'; I just let anyone walk right in.\nI am an only pet as my foster parents have no other pets and they tend to spoil me. I can not tolerate cats and I have been told that I am allergic to them. I also have a few food allergies that my new owner will need to be aware of.\nI do walk well on a leash until I spy a cat or other small animals that I would like to chase.\nI need a strong 'male' presence in my life that will correct me on walks when I try to go after small prey. I love car rides and prefer the front seat. Because of my super strength, children over the age of 10 would be best.\nI might do well with another dog my size, which is 60 pounds, but wound definitely need a meet and greet to see if we would be compatible.\nI'd like to find my forever family soon... applications are available at petsearchpa.org",

She was born with two front legs that are deformed. Currently, she hobbles around fairly well on her front right deformed leg. Her left leg is of no use. As she gets older and larger, she is most likely going to have issues with holding up her weight, and will need a wheelchair, or prosthetics. Because of this, she will likely do well in a home that she does not have to do any kind of stairs on a daily basis. She can do a small set of stairs now, but if she has to do stairs every day, it will not be a good home for her. \n\nStella is spunky, and playful. She loves playing with other dogs. She loves her toys, and her bones, and her favorite part of the day is breakfast. This girl lives for food! She sleeps in her dog bed every night next to her foster mom\u2019s bed. She sleeps through the night and will not get you up to go potty. She loves laying outside in the sun. She has a favorite place on the couch, and props herself up on the end. She is cuddly and playful. She does not go for walks. A fenced in yard is required.",

She needs a decently long walk each day at the very least, or she gets fussy at night.\nHenna needs to be the only pet in the home. She is reactive to other dogs and critters when out on walks.\nShe is affectionate and likes to be close by. She will sleep in her dog bed at night. She doesn't like spending time in her crate.\nHenna is house trained and makes it clear that she needs to go outside. Great on a leash, unless she sees another animal. She is getting used to traffic and busy streets.\nShe knows some basic commands and is good in the bath.\n\nHenna is spayed, microchipped, up to date with vaccinations and will come with 6 weeks of FREE training through our prison program when adopted.",

So they dumped her at the kill shelter at only 2 years old.  This was last year in Feb 2019.\n\nShe then landed on the Euthanasia list due to her fearfulness and anxiousness. at the shelter.  She was saved by an amazing foster that saved her life.\n\n\nDESTINE'S STATS:\n\nAGE: 3 YEARS OLD\n\nWEIGHT: 50 lbs\n\nSPAYED: YES\n\nGOOD WITH KIDS: YES OLDER\n\nSTRANGERS: NO\n\nOTHER DOGS: YES\n\nON LEASH: YES\n\nHOUSE BROKEN: YES\n\nCRATE TRAINED:  YES\n\nLuna needs a person with strong experience working with dogs that have trust issues.  She will need time to decompress and someone who is patient and able to gain her trust.  \n\nLuna is very afraid of strangers and is aggressive until she gets comfortable with someone.  She will chase cars and try to snap at them as they drive by. \n\nLuna has had a tough go at life as indicated by her initial reaction to people. She can be aggressive and lunges until she is feeling safe and comfortable (it took me about two hours of sitting outside her crate and feeding her treats before I felt ok letting her out), but once she is, she has more than enough love to give. She can be very lovable and sweet, but it is only once you have established a safe and comfortable environment for her. She loves walks but will chase cars and pull towards and bark at passerbyers.  She is good with other dogs and loves to play but gets super excited and can agitate other dogs with her energy. She is a super sweet dog but will need an owner that is patient and willing to work with her issues.\n",

He loves his people and always wants to be right in the middle of the family! He enjoys cuddling and loves to sleep under the blankets! He loves everyone he meets including other dogs and cats. \n\nHe enjoys playing tug of war, football and catch! He likes to go for walks and still pulls but settles down once he\u2019s walked a little. He knows basic commands like sit, shake, high five, stay and come (to a fist pointed at him). He is very food motivated and learns quickly! He definitely wants to please you and get rewarded! He tends to resource guard so will do best in a home with no other pets or children. He has shown some increase in fear/anxiety in unknown situations like a neighbor snow blowing so will definitely need training in this area as well. \n\nDuncan would do best in a home that has no other pets, a fenced back yard and a person who is willing to do more training. He would do best with positive reinforcement and clear boundaries as he\u2019s very sensitive. He is a sweet boy who needs a structured environment with training and lots of love and attention to give. He is estimated to be 10 months old and 55 lbs. Since we don't know at all what doggy genes are in the dogs make up (we don't know who mom and dad are!), we are just guessing on breed and size when grown.\n\nPlease note that because we require a home visit at the time of adoption we can only place animals in homes within a 60 mile radius of Minneapolis. If you are interested in meeting this dog please fill out the pre-adoption application on our website at http://www.safehandsrescue.org under Adopt and we will get back to you to arrange a meeting in the foster home. \n\n",

            "description": "Meet Tootsie!\n\nTootsie was rescued from an animal control facility in Fannin County, where she was scheduled to be euthanized due to limited space. \n\nIt's hard to believe that this beautiful girl would be willing to forgive humans for keeping her chained in a small patch of grass for FOUR LONG YEARS while they used her for breeding - but she did.  In fact, she is extremely loving and affectionate, and grateful to be alive.  Her owner passed away, and the family discarded her to a high kill shelter, like yesterday's garbage.\n\nWe're thinking that Tootsie needs to be a one woman dog, as she aligns herself to the female in the home.  She could live in harmony with a couple, as long as one person doesn't mind not receiving as much of her affection.  We believe that she must have been abused by the (male) owner who was using her for breeding.  She is NOT aggressive toward men, only somewhat timid and fearful.\n\nThe following was written from Tootsie's perspective while she was in a shelter in GA -\n\n\"Distance. It\u2019s something that I hear you humans are learning a lot about lately. As for me, it was how I lived most of my life. My name is Tootsie, and I spent most of my life at the end of a chain, outside and exposed, never knowing what it was like to be close to a human being. Then suddenly, the person who used to feed me was gone and I found myself here at this shelter. I was so scared, but I soon learned to trust the nice people here who took me for walks. That was an amazing experience for me. I\u2019d never known much outside a small patch of dirt, so walks were magical. I lived so long in solitude that I\u2019m not much of a fan of rambunctious pups, because I like things quiet and calm. As long as they\u2019re low-key like me, I\u2019m happy to hang out with other dogs, though. But people are just about my favorite thing in the world. I love having my head in someone\u2019s lap. I hear you have these things called sofas, and I really want to see what those are all about. Things that are soft and warm sound like a dream to me. I\u2019ve longed for comfort for so long, and I\u2019ve longed for love, too. Maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m a velcro dog whenever someone comes to walk me. I can never be close enough to my human friends. They\u2019re my world, but lately they haven\u2019t been here to see me. I guess it\u2019s all part of the distance thing I\u2019m hearing about, but I\u2019m still worried that maybe I\u2019ve been abandoned again. I'm not getting any younger, but they think I'm just about four or five years old. I have been here at this shelter for seven whole months as of today. That\u2019s a long time, and this place is just supposed to be temporary. What will become of me if my friends never return? What will I do without people? Maybe you can help me find someone to love me, a lap where I can always put my head. Tell my shelter friends that I miss them, and I hope they\u2019re thinking of me. And maybe, somewhere, someone is looking for a peaceful 49-pound pup like me. I hope they can find me from a distance. I\u2019ll be here wishing and hoping.\"\n\nTootsie is now in NH and looking for her forever family. She's been here for 8 months, living in a family environment.  We kept her this long so that she could decompress and learn what love feels like, and now we feel that she's ready to find her forever home.  \n\nShe's confident, and absolutely wonderful with women, but initially fearful of men.  Most of the rescuers in the Georgia shelter were female, so Tootsie developed an affinity for women.\n\nTootsie is about 5 years old, and weighs 60 lbs. She is spayed, has all her required vaccines, and is microchipped.\n\nIf you'd like to open your heart and home to this lovely lady, please complete an adoption application at https://www.heartsandtails.org/adoption-application/\n\nPLEASE NOTE that due to the overwhelming number of inquiries we receive daily, we can only respond to those who have completed an online application, and appear to be a good match. PLEASE check all of the fields in this profile to ensure your question hasn't already been answered as most of the information is in this profile.\n",

You may be required to travel if approved for adoption.\n\nSport is a goofy, energetic love with the right person,. Sport is very male selective and will need his space on his time. He takes some time to warm up and adjust, all intros need to be slow, but once he does he really shows you his playful side in the appropriate environment. A good game of fetch, long walks is all he wants. He loves being next to his human while chewing on a bone or hanging outside taking in all the different smells. Sport is 4 years young and still requires an energetic household. He has done amazing with crate training and will now go in with just a simple point and mention of \"bed\". He is a bit fearful of the unfamiliar so patience and slow introductions to all new things are a must but I promise you, you will not be disappointed. Sport does great with well behaved mini humans although due to his energy and size little ones over 7 is recommended. Sport will not do well in a close living situation and will need a fenced yard of his own. His hound instincts are strong so No kitties for this guy please, Sport has a very high prey drive. Dogs ok with proper intros.\n\nSport is available for adoption through Looking Glass Animal Rescue, a 501c3 non-profit animal welfare organization. All adoptions are subject to review and approval. Please complete an application at https://lgarinc.org/adoption-application/\n\nPlease note that you must be 25 years of age to adopt and we reserve the right to refuse adoption to anyone. Please be advised that we will not approve adoptions to persons who mislead or fail to provide accurate information on this application. Incomplete applications will not be processed.",

I am looking for someone who will help me continue to build my confidence and understand that I am a bit shy meeting new people. I have an incredibly strong bond for whoever my person is so I become a little worried when I am left alone for too long. I need someone who has time to check in on me during the day. I am a bit shy around new dogs so I think I would rather be an only pet. I would also do best with older children. I am looking for my forever home. \n\nApply at pittiesandpals.com!",

I was completely shut down when I arrived in MN due to my past experiences. My foster family has been really patient with helping me to build my trust of people. I am still pretty shy and timid, but my foster mom thinks I will thrive with a loving and patient family. I do like my crate to be openly accessible if I get scared.\n\nI am currently in a foster that has two other dogs and they are showing me that humans are not as scary as I think. I am warming up to them and do enjoy playing with them occasionally in my fenced in yard. I definitely need a fenced in yard in my forever home as I get spooked easily which makes me want to run and hide.\n\nMy crate is my safest place. I go there to seek comfort if a loud noise is made or if a new person I don't know comes into my space. I also sleep in my crate at night and hang out in there during the day when my family is at work. I love my crate and do great in there. \n\nMy perfect family would be one that can be really patient with letting me adjust and lets me work through my fears on my own time. A family that doesn't have a ton of activity in the house would be best as a lot of activity and noise can be terrifying to me. I need a home with a fenced in yard so that I can stay safe and one with another dog so that I'm motivated to keep building trust with humans. I am a really sweet girl once you get me out of my shell and am super lovable!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nAll our Warrior Dogs will have all age appropriate medical care and vaccines, a microchip, and spay/neuter before adoption unless age is a factor with a puppy younger than 6-12 months at the time of adoption. If that is the case, the spay/neuter will be covered in the adoption fee and the owner will be responsible to have the procedure completed at a Warrior Dog Rescue Veterinarian at the appropriate time.\n\nPlease note that the majority of our dogs in rescue are from shelters where they have been found as strays or abandoned. Their breed description is based on our very best educated guess based on physical characteristics and their dispositions. If they came to our rescue as an owner surrender, the breed description will be listed as provided by the previous owner.\n\nAdoption Fee - $450\n\nTo apply for this pup, please submit an Adoption Application at http://warriordogrescue.com/adopt/adoption-application/",

This easy-going dog loves a good cuddle session. Layla is a true joy to have around. She's looking for a home where she can be the only pet and get all the love and attention for herself! She enjoys lounging around the house and would love to explore the backyard or just bask in the sun. Layla is dreaming of having a family of her own agaiin for her Golden Years. She'd appreciate a quiet suburban or rural home with no other animals. After adoption, Layla will have access to free training consultations with a certified trainer at North Shore Animal League America to help acclimate her to her new home.",

            "description": "Meet Marlo! He is about 5 years old and we think he is a Pointer mix. Marlo came to Labs and More in rough shape with some broken teeth, very underweight and an old leg injury. He still has some lingering medical issues with his lungs that are being managed with medications and he will need routine checks and medication the rest of his life. While he tires a little faster than most dogs, he enjoys his short walks and can get around just fine. Marlo is house trained and crate trained in his current foster home. He has been around other dogs and done well. He is shy with new people and takes time to build trust, but he has opened up in his foster home and gently asks his foster mom for pets and affection. If you are interested in meeting Marlo, please submit an adoption application on our website. This information is as up to date and accurate as possible for the dog in its current environment. All dogs and puppies will need time and training to adjust to their new surroundings and to learn the rules of their new home. If you are interested in meeting one of our dogs, the first step is to complete the Adoption Form on our website at www.labsandmore.org and take some time to review our adoption process. Your adoption includes the spay or neuter, current vaccinations, microchip, and other services provided while in our care. The safety and health of our puppies is priority one, so we only allow approved applicants to meet and handle puppies. Please understand everything we do is for the dogs and conducted by our kind and generous volunteers. We rely solely on donations, and we do not profit from a dog's adoption. Labs and More is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that operates on donations and time dedicated to this cause by volunteers. Your adoption will save the life of future dogs in need. Labs and More makes no guarantees regarding the behavior, breed, or age of the dogs in our care. Although we strive to provide necessary medical care to dogs in our care, we cannot predict future or current medical needs whether they were symptomatic or not at the time of adoption.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application. If you have any questions email us at doginfo@labsandmore.org or call us at 858-273-5386. Thank you for looking to a rescue group to fulfill your dream of adding a new dog to your life!

They had rescued her from a large hoarding situation and she had done well in foster care in their rescue, but had little interest. They thought she would get more exposure with us, and we were happy to help.\n\nBrynn is a sweet, loving, playful girl who is slightly timid when meeting new people but warms up quickly.\n\nShe does well with other dogs and we would like to see her in a home with at least one other dog.\n\nShe would like a fairly quiet home - a lot of commotion may make her nervous.\n\nShe will make a fabulous family member!\n\nTo adopt please fill out the form at our website - https://www.furryfriendsct.org/adoption-application\n\nADOPTION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES:\n\nOur goal is to help you find a wonderful new family member! We work closely with you to ensure that the dog you adopt will be a wonderful match for your family's make-up and lifestyle. Our adoption and foster placement processes includes an application, personal and vet reference checks, a home visit, and a meet and greet with the dog and all family members and other pets.\n\nPlacement is considered on the basis of the best interests of the dog and the best fit with the family - we do not adopt on a \"first come, first served\" basis.\n\nWe do not transport our dogs outside of the state of CT. If you live outside of CT and are able to travel to us after an application is approved, with your family and other pets, for a meet and greet and to complete the adoption in CT if that goes well, you're welcome to apply to adopt one of our dogs, as long as you live in one of the New England states. We do not adopt our dogs long-distance, or outside of the New England area.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: All of our dogs live in foster homes within the state of CT. We do not have a facility. For that reason we ask that you go through the application/approval process prior to a meet and greet, which is always part of our placement protocol. We do this because we try to keep our foster families' day to day lives s uninterrupted as possible. You can fill out an adoption application at our website, at https://www.furryfriendsct.org/adoption-application",

She is a quiet, calm girl who enjoys being with her person. She needs to be the only pet in the home, she is dog reactive and just a bit too interested in cats. She needs a quiet, relaxed home where she can enjoy laying on the porch in the sun or cuddle up and watch tv with you. She loves going for a ride in the car especially for an ice cream. She needs a home where children do not visit frequently. She eats dry kibble mixed with a can of wet food (salmon flavor is her favorite) 2 a day. She is spayed, up to date with all her vaccines,  tested negative for heartworm and lyme and is on monthly preventative. She was a rock star at the vet visit. She does have a fatty lipoma near her front leg but it's been checked out and they recommend just leaving it be unless it changes. A fenced yard is a must and she needs some work on leash walking.  An approved application and a home visit are required. She is an excellent companion and friend.",

It took him a few weeks at his foster home to get comfortable and he attached himself to the kids quickly as he felt less threatened by kids. He loved playing ball with them!\nHe was adopted out and recently returned to us because his adopter's had a baby and as the baby started walking and playing with loud toys and screaming, it became too much for our shy and fearful boy so they felt it was best for SCOUT to find a home he would be more comfortable. He was adopted again to another family who told us they were a quiet home but turns out they had lots of activity with their teenage daughter and friends, neighbors and family gatherings. It was just too much for Scout to handle and he was stressed and acting out. So he is back with us and we are now looking for a better fitting home for our sweet boy...one that is not full of loud and scary noises....with no children, and preferably with a single woman who is either retired or works from home. \nSCOUT is a good boy! He is housetrained and crate trained. He is good with other dogs and will do best in a home with another calm doggie friend to help him with his confidence and to show him the ropes!\nSCOUT is doing good on his leash walks. He has gotten more confident but still gets frightened of loud noises or \u2018scary objects\u2019.... he likes walking/running on trails in the hills or off the beaten path. He is very happy just playing in the backyard and hanging out on the couch. When things get too stressful or overwhelming for him, he likes to go in his crate. It\u2019s his safe place. \nSCOUT's breed is still a mystery to us! Maybe part lab? maybe part pit? maybe part Aus Shep?? Who knows!??   BUT, He's cute as a button and just the right size at about 45 lbs. SCOUT needs a quiet home with no children as loud noises and commotion scare him. He would do best with a single woman who is retired or works from home, who will make him feel safe, yet encourage him to be brave, but not force him to handle more than he can take, and who will never give up on him, even on his most insecure days, who will accept him as he is and not expect him to be what he is not....and of course, commit to loving him forever. \n\nSCOUT's adoption fee is $250 which includes health examination, current vaccinations, neuter, microchip, flea and de worming treatment, along with any other medical/dental deemed necessary by our veterinarian.\n\nNO LONG DISTANCE (South California) OR OUT OF STATE ADOPTIONS\n\nYou can request applications by emailing Rhodiesrescue@gmail.com or contacting us through Petfinder. \nWhen submitting an application please allow time for your application to be reviewed. We will contact you if we have questions or need further information or to schedule meet and greets. If you do not hear from us within 3 days, it does not mean you are not a good home for a dog, but you may not be the right match for this particular dog.",

Shy at first, he is incredibly sweet, a total lap dog...however, he is not good with other dogs in the home.  Bugsy has a heart murmur requiring medication once a day (Enalapril), he also has occasional  seizures when under stress.  He uses a doggie door, is crate trained, and very quiet.  Bugsy needs to be an only pet in a quiet, stress free adult home with NO CHILDREN. Can you give this sweet pup a warm lap for his remaining years?  Bugsy is about 5# and 9 years old...he qualifies for our seniors adopting seniors program. *** If interested please submit an application at www.becauseofyourescue.org ***\nFully vetted, vaccinated, dental, neutered, heartworm neg & on preventative and micro-chipped",

            "description": "4/22/2020 update - our adoption area is limited to UT, NV, ID, OR, WA and MT with a home visit.  If you are outside of this area please do a search for your local GSP/GWP/Pointer rescue group.\n\n--------\n\nI'm MAYHEM!  My rescue lady just loves me and loves having me at home with her when she doesn't have a bunch of newbie young 'uns that take up all her time.  I love being with her, the other dogs and even the cats.  I'm a little suspicious of people I don't know so I need to get out more for socializing.  I'm very playful with my pack and will tone down my enthusiasm so I don't hurt the little ones.  After all, I'm a Great Big Boy!\n\nMy approx. DOB is 02/12/2017 so I'm finished growing and I'm the perfect weight for my size.  I need an active home to keep me trim and healthy.  I'll be the best hiking/camping buddy.  No one's going to break into your home while I'm there!\n\nI'm not a first-time-owner kind of guy.  My new home needs to know my breed, give me a job and help me become all I can be.\n\nI don't do well in areas where there's lots of pollution or long-lived pollen.  It bothers my sinuses.  Benadryl helps, but a less-polluted environment is better for me. \n\nOh, and as you can tell from the pictures, I like sleeping under the covers. <3 \n\n---------\n\nGENERAL APPLICATION NOTES:\n\nWe strongly urge adopters to consider a male canine companion if they already have a female GSP/GWP. We get asked several times a year to take in one member of a 2-female GSP family because there are control issues between their girls that result in pretty ferocious fights. Interestingly that never happens among males. Go figure.\n\nDogs under 2 years of age need to go to a home with another well-socialized canine companion of a similar size (when grown) and within a few years of the pup\u2019s age. This is how they maintain and continue their learning/socialization process. Socialization outside the home is important but doesn\u2019t replace the in-home learning that is so important as the pup ages. https://www.facebook.com/ UtahsPerfectPointers/posts/ 1460968517254816\n\nMost older dogs aren\u2019t interested in having a puppy incessantly chewing on it and demanding attention. If you live outside of the Salt Lake area and are sure that your older dog just loves puppies, please arrange a visit at your home with a 2-4 month old pup for a couple of hours and make sure that your older dog feels the same way about this that you do. Please video the interactions and send it to us.\n\nJust a word of caution........ most pointer types need jobs. Otherwise they're not good pets. They need to be able to utilize their brains and no amount of exercise without a \"work\" or \"thinking\" component is adequate. The job doesn't need to be hunting. But it does need to be something that satisfies their genetic predispositions - nose work, agility, tracking, dock diving, etc. The job cannot just be obedience. If they can't use their innate senses they're just never going to be the dog you want for the next 15 years.\n\nA physical fence is required for most of our dogs.\n\nAs far as other breeds go, the pointers are generally good with most other breeds with the exception of the Arctic breeds and bulldogs. I'm not sure why, but if there's ever an altercation in daycare between a UPP dog and another dog, it's generally one of those two breeds. It may be the difference in energy levels. It may be some ancient behavior we know nothing about...... Not sure.\n\nUtah's Perfect Pointers is a very small rescue group and doesn't have the resources to adopt to states except for the ones noted above.. If you are interested in adopting a GSP please contact the closest groups below.

They sleep in the same kennel, enjoy going for walks together, and even attend play group as a couple.  They are dog friendly and would do best in a home without small children.

I love the outdoors and would be a great hiking buddy! I can sometimes get a little over excited and nip at you but I don't mean it, I just want your attention.\n\nTo adopt or to receive more information, please fill out an application on our website at www.libertyhumane.org/dogs.

If you are outside of this area please do a search for your local GSP/GWP/Pointer rescue group.\n\n--------\n\nI'm BROOKLYN!  I'm a very busy girl and totally loving.  As you can see, I'm missing a leg from a car accident two years ago.  It doesn't slow me down at all.  I race around the yard with the other dogs with absolutely no problems.  I'm great with other dogs and I'm even OK with cats (with appropriate supervision).\n\nI've had two litters of puppies - both after being hit by a car and losing my leg.  Unfortunately my owners thought it would be nice to breed me \"because I'm from such good lines\". (**%#!)  Those days are over.  It's time I had someone to take care of me as their bff - not to use me for their selfish purposes.\n\nI'm very snuggly.  I love crawling into my people's laps and lying with them while they pet me. <3\n\nDon't let my missing leg fool you.  I'm \"everything GSP\" - cuddly inside and totally \"out of control\" outside.  I bark incessantly because I'm so excited.  I'm terrible on a leash.  I want to run with abandon totally ignoring my people who want me to coooooooommme baaaaccck!  I need a very breed-experienced home that's very active and knows how to get the very best out of me outside as well as inside!\n\n\n---------\n\nGENERAL APPLICATION NOTES:\n\nWe strongly urge adopters to consider a male canine companion if they already have a female GSP/GWP. We get asked several times a year to take in one member of a 2-female GSP family because there are control issues between their girls that result in pretty ferocious fights. Interestingly that never happens among males. Go figure.\n\nDogs under 2 years of age need to go to a home with another well-socialized canine companion of a similar size (when grown) and within a few years of the pup\u2019s age. This is how they maintain and continue their learning/socialization process. Socialization outside the home is important but doesn\u2019t replace the in-home learning that is so important as the pup ages. https://www.facebook.com/ UtahsPerfectPointers/posts/ 1460968517254816\n\nMost older dogs aren\u2019t interested in having a puppy incessantly chewing on it and demanding attention. If you live outside of the Salt Lake area and are sure that your older dog just loves puppies, please arrange a visit at your home with a 2-4 month old pup for a couple of hours and make sure that your older dog feels the same way about this that you do. Please video the interactions and send it to us.\n\nJust a word of caution........ most pointer types need jobs. Otherwise they're not good pets. They need to be able to utilize their brains and no amount of exercise without a \"work\" or \"thinking\" component is adequate. The job doesn't need to be hunting. But it does need to be something that satisfies their genetic predispositions - nose work, agility, tracking, dock diving, etc. The job cannot just be obedience. If they can't use their innate senses they're just never going to be the dog you want for the next 15 years.\n\nA physical fence is required for most of our dogs.\n\nAs far as other breeds go, the pointers are generally good with most other breeds with the exception of the Arctic breeds and bulldogs. I'm not sure why, but if there's ever an altercation in daycare between a UPP dog and another dog, it's generally one of those two breeds. It may be the difference in energy levels. It may be some ancient behavior we know nothing about...... Not sure.\n\nUtah's Perfect Pointers is a very small rescue group and doesn't have the resources to adopt to states except for the ones noted above. If you are interested in adopting a GSP please contact the closest groups below.

Pulls slightly through shelter and parking lot. In yard, Crimson immediately solicits attention and allows handling and petting all over with loose body and tail wagging. Does not show interest in toys but plays tag with handler. Playing tag he does get aroused and starts jumping up and mouthing arm gently but is easily distracted by treats and immediately goes into a \"sit\". Pulls slightly through parking lot. Easily returned to kennel and leash is easily removed.(4/9) Per Previous Owner --The dog is amazing with all children, he sleeps with them. The dog is good with larger dogs, but has a very high prey drive, and has killed the owner's small dog. Crimson is also not good with cats, and has chased the owner's cat many times. Amazing with children, very sweet in general, good with big dogs.This animal is currently available from foster care through ACCT Philly's Adoptions Programs.

            "description": "Shirley is a beagle mix, 5 years old and 30 lbs. She was one of a large group we got of similar dogs who were very unsocialized. All but Shirley and Felix have been adopted. She is one of the shyest. She has progressed a bit; but being in a foster would help, where she would have one on one attention and there would be less going on. She would do well to have a k-9 companion who is confident for her to model.\nShe will need time to settle in, and new owners will have to make sure she can't escape the yard or run out the front door, until she is used to the home. She is not used to leashes.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\n\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

The pups have all been adopted and now it is Jipsey's turn.  Jipsey is sweet, friendly and affectionate.  She is ok with most dogs although would not mind (and might prefer) living as a solo dog.  Jipsey is not safe to live with cats.  Jipsey is crate trained, seems to be house trained and has nice manners.  She is good off leash and loves to hike and run in the woods.  Jipsey is looking for an experienced dog home who can understand her hesitance toward being grabbed by the collar.  She needs hands off training (treat training works well) especially if it is cold out and she doesn't want to go outside!  She is a nice dog who is still learning the ropes of being a \"pet.\"  With positive training and self confidence building Jipsey will be a great addition to someone's home!\n\nAdoption Fee: $100\nBirthdate: 4/2016\nWeight: 50 lbs.\n\nJipsey tested positive for heartworm. HHR will provide 6 months of meds to treat her. \n\nhttps://vetmed.illinois.edu/pet_column/hope-for-heartworm-positive-dogs/\n",

She is a moderate energy dog, playful and active but also settles down nicely indoors by your feet.\nShe is housetrained and sleeps in a crate.\nShe will need an active home that will keep her mentally and physically busy. She will chase cats that run. She needs proper intro to new dogs.\n\nShe is undersocialized and also needs continued training and structure. She needs continued socializing with other dogs and people (reactive in public). She would do best in a home with German Shepherd experience, as she can be insecure and also defensive/protective. She would do best with a single woman, or will need experienced handlers in a multi ADULT home (NO CHILDREN) who will be willing to commit to working on her socialization. NO APARTMENTS!\nPlease contact Diana at (510) 333-4420 or theperfectdogrescue@gmail.com or fill out the adoption application:\nhttp://www.theperfectdog.org/TPDadoptapp.doc",

Thankfully they got him safe temporarily and have reached out to us to help Dude continue on his journey to find a home that will love and care for him always. He is working on his house and crate training and coming along nicely. He hasn't had much exposure to a leash, and it currently scares him for reasons only he knows, but his foster family will of course be working on this with him and helping him understand it means good things for him from here on out! He isn't quite trustworthy with free yet and will need to be crated for the time being. He temp foster had other dogs, livestock and kids and he did fantastic with everything and everyone, making him a super easy addition to just about any home.  He needs a home that will help him gain confidence and let him know that he is loved, he is very food motivated so will learn quickly. A very friendly guy who can't wait to be a part of a family and loved as such.\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Bailey and Lucy (TX) are a bonded brother and sister duo who were born into rescue on May 5, 2019. Bailey and Lucy are Heeler mixes, although Bailey looks more like a Labrador Retriever. Bailey is a neutered male, and Lucy is a spayed female, and they weigh 45-50 lbs. They are good with people of all sizes and other dogs. Their ideal home would be in a quiet suburb with a fenced yard with an experienced dog owner who's very active and is home most of the time. True to the breed, Lucy and Bailey are equal parts super sweet snugglers and high energy whirlwinds and need to be exercised well every day. If you can open your heart and home to Bailey and Lucy (TX), please fill out an application at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org",

            "description": "Shasta is a 5-year-old pittie mix with a shiny black/brown coat and the kindest honey-brown eyes! She came into Chicago Animal Care and Control from Safe Humane Chicago where she was rescued from a terrible situation. She had been found living in deplorable filth after firefighters responded to a fire in the home. The floors were covered in feces and urine. There was no food or water anywhere, but there were multiple other dogs and cats. \n\nComing into the shelter, Shasta wasn\u2019t very sure of her surroundings, but she managed to relax a bit and now\u2019s she\u2019s really living the life in her foster home! Shasta loves to be around her humans and especially loves to snuggle with them! She hasn\u2019t met any cats since being with PFP, but she definitely doesn\u2019t enjoy the company of other dogs, so she\u2019d need to be the only puppy princess in her castle. \n\nShasta does great in the car and doesn\u2019t mind going on rides. She is crate-trained and is an angel in her crate. She can sometimes be shy when meeting new people, especially men. She is potty-trained, and knows some basic commands (sit, stay, lay down, come, leave it, up). She is intelligent and eager to please and has been learning and transitioning well. \n\nAdditionally, she is a great running companion! She loves sprinting, but also does great on well-paced long-range running routes. She is still youthful and playful, and looooves power chewer toys, especially ball-shaped toys! \n\nHer only downfall? She doesn\u2019t like noisy things like the vacuum or coffee bean grinder! The good news is, she\u2019s fine with the blender, so if you need someone to share your smoothie with, she\u2019s your gal! Interested in Shasta?

I am social and love to be beside you wherever you are and I even sleep in a little chair right beside my foster mom while she works. I am not a big fan of sitting in your lap but I do like to put my paws on your lap to get petted. I jump in excitement every time I see my people and if you toss me a treat I can catch it! I have a heart of gold and I get along great with everyone.. dogs, cats, humans. Because of this, I will need to be in a home with a very secure fence. If I can squeeze out to go visit the neighbors I will be next door. As I said.. I\u2019m very social! I am crate trained and pretty much housebroken although a reminder to go outside would be helpful. I need a little refresher on leash training and I can be a bit shy at first but I love to love and I am always very happy!\n\nBirthdate: 3/4/2019\nWeight: 14 lbs.",

I'm just a young pup that was saved from the euthanasia list at the shelter, I went to boarding for awhile, than got a forever home with toddlers. Oh how I loved those kids. I really like kids and women. I do not like drill sergeant men or alpha men. Which is what became a problem. When I would get yelled at for doing something wrong, it would scare me and I would pee. I am house trained, but I couldn't help it cuz I was scared. Well long story short the man of the house, didn't have any patience, and I'm now back at boarding, missing the kids badly. I am a big happy boy who loves to play especially with a ball. I am polite and not grabby with food. I love to snuggle too. I'm looking for my own little family with no other animals and a nice man, that isn't too alpha but is kind and would have patience and love for me. I would love a couple of kids to play with too.

He would have to be adopted to a home with another canine companion to keep him company. Hunter is known to be an escape artist so he would need a 7-8ft fenced in area/ yard. He would also need some house training to spend any time in the house. Hunter is currently learning not to jump up on people to greet them as he does not know his own strength and gets very excited at times. Hunter is a very high energy dog so he would need daily exercise, he walks best on an EZ walk harness. He is a quick learner and very treat motivated. Hunter has no food aggression but could use better skills/ manners when being fed as he gets very excited with food in sight! Hunter has been around children and from what we observed he is good with them so far, it is unknown how he would do with them for long periods of time. He loves to run given the energy he has and would enjoy potential hikes/ long walks with his new owners! Hunter over all has a great temperament and would make a wonderful loving companion animal for the right person!\n\nDo not inquire about or apply for Hunter if you live in any the following States: Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut",

He is manageable around other dogs while out and about, just does not appreciate sharing his home or humans with other dogs.  He is dog reactive, while he is manageable in open spaces,, around other dogs, with out contact with them, he is not a dog that can go to the dog park, or play with other dogs He was fostered with a young child that he was said to do well with, due to his size and not knowing how big he is he would do better with older children. He loves to play fetch, play with his Kong and run around the yard.  He walks well on leash, and knows many commands. He is a very smart boy, who loves to be active, but will also lay around. He knows sit, down, stay, leave it and wait. He loves to learn new things and train, but also lives down time with his humans. \n\nOtis recently completed and passed the Canine Good Citizen test. He has worked hard on his training, and it has paid off.\n\n**Needs a dog and cat free home**",

During the procedure Agent S was nervous but allowed his PE to be done. I was able to touch him with slow precise movements which allowed him to begin to relax slowly during the exam. Agent S showed signs of fear and stress(tucked tail with tense skin) but after check in has been much more relaxed - still tense but I can now go over to his cage and pet him through the gate.(4/10) Unable to check in. Dog is hard barking, snarling, and lunging at kennel door.Behavior Observation: (4/29) Easily leashed and removed from kennel. Pulls moderately through shelter and parking lot. Once he hits grass, immediately urinates and defecates. In yard, explores by sniffing perimeter for a few minutes before returning to handler's call and accepting pets all over with loose body. Loves chasing a tennis ball and returns and drops ball to handler. Pulls slightly back through parking lot and into shelter. Easily returned to kennel and leash is easily removed.(4/21) Per Staff -- Easily leashed and removed from kennel today. Pulls through shelter and out to yard. In yard, initially fairly aloof as he runs laps around perimeter. Does return to handler after urinating and defecating and accepts pets from back of neck to flank with loose body. Easily distracted by passing vehicles does not pay much attention to handler but continues to accept pets with loose body language when handler approaches. Easily returned to kennel and leash easily removed.(4/19) Dog Meet --Attempted dog meet with Sheila through fence. Agent S was very aroused, vocalizing, muzzle punching the fence. When met Sheila on leash, attempted to snap before able to introduce. Took in separate yard and continued to fixate on Sheila from across the parking lot. Still allowed handling and did not tense up. No interest in toys or treats. Pulled heavily through parking lot and into shelter. Placed back in kennel and leash removed without issue.(4/19) Per Staff -- Agent S was easily leashed and removed from kennel today. Still bows when leash is presented but easily looped. Once on leash, pulls through shelter and outside until in yard. In yard, runs laps for 5 or so minutes before returning to handler. Allows handling all over with loose body. Chases a rope toy but does not play with it once he gets to it. When handler stops petting, uses nose to nudge for more pets to flank. Pulls back to kennel but easily returned to kennel and easily unleashed.(4/18) Per Staff -- Moderately difficult to remove from kennel due to dog retreating and then coming forward again. Friendly, but conflicted. Once looped, exited easily and only pulled slightly while walking to evaluation room. Allowed handling all over although did show some signs of stress - heavy panting and some displacement sniffing. No issues returning to kennel or removing lead.(4/15) Was able to remove from kennel again on 4/15. When assessor approaches kennel, Agent S comes to front of kennel, takes treats nicely and pushes against kennel door to solicit pets, allows pets with loose body language. Leashing is easier than last time but Agent S still bows and then retreats before coming forward again and bowing. Is able to be leashed with no snapping at leash and readily leaves kennel. He pulled strongly through shelter and parking lot into yard. In yard, Agent S is initially tense but loosens after a few minutes and allows pets over entire body with relatively loose body language. Did not show interest in toys. One member of the public did walk by the fence which caused Agent S to tense and bark. Handler was able to pick leash up with no issue. Agent S pulls through the parking lot and shelter when returning. He is easily returned to kennel and leash is easily removed.(4/14) Per Staff -- Agent S approached for treats and took them gently but would bow and then retreat to back of kennel once presented with leash. After a few attempts, Agent S became overstimulated and started nipping at leash. A very loud barking dog in the kennel next to Agent S seemed to be escalating the situation. The handlers ended the interaction and moved to the other side of the kennel, which was quieter. Agent S remained at the kennel door as the handlers attempted to leash and accepted pets and treats. The handler was able to leash Agent S and the dog immediately exited the kennel, pulling strongly through the shelter and to the outside. Agent S continue to pull through parking lot, zig zagging in front of handler until we got into a yard. Agent S' body language in yard was tense and handlers attempted some pets to flank which were accepted. Agent S was very aloof in yard, tracing perimeter repeatedly but would accept treats from handler when he passed by. Showed no real interest in toys beyond chasing a tennis ball once. When members of the public would walk by the fence, Agent S would tense and hard bark. Agent S tensed up when handler picked up leash to go back inside and pulled strongly on walk back to kennel. Agent S dodged going back into the kennel but was lured in with treats and easily unleashed.(4/12) Per Staff -- Unable to remove from kennel. Took treats with a soft mouth, ears back, tail neutral. As soon as the leash was in sight he moved to the back of the kennel and would not approach.(4/12) Per Staff -- Still unable to be removed from kennel. Dog is hard barking at front of kennel, retreats and then charges towards front of kennel, snapping at bars. Spent 8-10 minutes attempting to coax with treats and Fresh Pet but behavior continued. When attempted to leash, dog snapped repeatedly and tore leash.(4/10) Behavior -- Initially dog lunging and hard barking at approach of assessor. Ceased barking when treat was presented, but still showing teeth. Assessor dropped treat and stepped away. Approached dog for a second time, dog this time was not snapping/lunging, but was low growling and extremely stiff. Able to drop treat in kennel and stepped away for another few moments. Came back, dog was on other side of kennel, but was able to call him over and again give treat. Dog continued tense posture with low tail, but ceased offensive behavior and growling.(4/10) Upon intake, one individual surrendering the dog had to place the dog in the kennel; ACA commented that the woman who was also present at the surrender said she was \"terrified\" of the dog. Dog was surrendered in a muzzle that needed to be removed, after finder pl",

He is in great shape for a senior dog.\n50ish lbs American Bully mix.\nTank is great with young kids, and other dogs- he\u2019s not fond of cats, opossums, or raccoons. No trash bandits to worry about at your house!\nHe is very relaxed and likes to just hang out. \nHe is a little hard at hearing, with his age, but not totally deaf. He knows basic signs though such as \u201ccome\u201d \u201csit\u201d \u201cshake\u201d. \nHe is house trained and doesn\u2019t need a kennel. He was with one owner his whole life and a well behaved gentleman.\nHe likes his walkies and does well on a leash. When something catches his eye though, he embodies his name and sits like a tank. So he\u2019d like a little time to see what he sees before moving on.\nHe\u2019s just a big love bug! \n\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our dogs are healthy, spayed/neutered, vaccinated and on heartworm preventative. They live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. Many have basic obedience skills and all have been temperament tested. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, please visit our website to complete an application: http://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt\n\nIf you have any questions, please see our website: http://www.takepawsrescue.org/FAQ",

Since being adopted and then returned to us, his confidence has taken a pretty major hit, making him very nervous and untrusting of strangers.  We don\u2019t know much about what happened during his 2 month-long adoption, but we do know that he endured several significant and stressful changes in a very short time and learned that to deal with scary situations, he can be scary himself to back people off.  \n\nPuma is NOT aggressive and he doesn\u2019t want to hurt anyone; he just needs to re-learn how to cope and relax in uncomfortable situations.  His current foster is doing an AMAZING job helping Puma and we\u2019re confident that with continued training and the right family, Puma will be back to his happy-go-lucky self in no time!  We just have to find a patient, loving family willing to put in the effort that Puma deserves to get him there.  \n\nPuma LOVES balls!  He\u2019ll fetch and even drop the ball for you.  He also tears toys apart, but won\u2019t eat the stuffing.  He goes into his crate with no issues, especially when you tell him to \u201chit the hay\u201d and once he warms up to you, he LOVES to cuddle and give kisses!  One of his favorite things is to have his belly rubbed.\n\nPlease help us get sweet Puma into a safe, loving forever home!  If you're unable to help by adopting, sharing this post or donating is always appreciated.  Don't forget, Passion for Pitties is a 501(c)(3), so all donations are tax-deductible!\u2026every little bit helps!\n\nIf you\u2019d like to adopt our loving Puma, please fill out an application at www.passionforpitties.com under the \u201cAdorable Adoptables\u201d heading.",

While we were able to treat his infection, it took much longer to coax him out of his shell. He loves dogs and is very dog friendly, but is not at all cat friendly. He is house trained and crate trained! We feel his ideal home will be quiet with few surprises. Dillon needs a family who can be patient as he learns to be a house dog and also learns how to show affection. He\u2019s a sweet boy who will sit next to you and let you rub his belly all day!

I was brought to the shelter because my owner was no longer able to care for me.  So I'm waiting for that special someone to come along who will love me forever!\n\nIn my last home someone was with me all the time.  There was never a time when I was left alone.  While that was really great that I was with them so much, it caused me to have separation anxiety.  Which makes finding a new family more difficult.  \n\nSo I need a family where I can be with someone all the time.  I would make an excellent office dog!  I spend my days in the office here at the shelter, and 'help' with alllll kinds of things!!\n\nI would do well in a home with kids, but would prefer a home where I can be the only pet.  That way I can have all the attention for myself!  \n\nI'm up to date on vaccinations, spayed, and I also have a microchip.  All I need now is YOU to adopt me!!",

We recommend no small children due to his strength. \n\nWE ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING BY APPOINTMENT ONLY DUE TO COVID-19\nUnless otherwise stated, the adoption fees for dogs over 5 months range from $50-$175. Puppies under 5 months are $175.00. Cats over 1 year are $35.00, kittens under 1 year old are $60.00. Dog adoption fees include a microchip. Cats can be microchipped by request for an additional $5.00.\nThe adoption fee includes the animal's surgery, vaccinations, flea preventative, deworming medication, sample bag of food/treat samples and a free first exam with participating veterinarians. Shelter policy and 2018 Indiana state law decrees all animals must be spayed or neutered prior to leaving the shelter.\nWE ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING BY APPOINTMENT ONLY DUE TO COVID-19\nOur shelter is open to the public on Monday- Saturday from 8:00 am -5:00 pm EST with the exception of Wednesdays on which we typically open by 1:00 pm.

            "description": "VIOLET is a sweet-natured, 2-year-old, 50-pound Chocolate/Black Labrador Retriever mix.\n\nFrom Violet's Foster Guardian:\n\n\"Violet is a sweet, shy, well-behaved Lab mix with beautiful amber eyes.  She is comfortable in a crate, easily housetrained (She only had a few accidents the first few weeks at our house), walks well on her leash, and doesn\u2019t jump up.  She rarely barks or chews(flip flops are the only thing she\u2019s chewed).  She has learned commands such as sit, come & paw very quickly, so she is easily trained and wants to please.   She will follow commands to sit and stay when putting down her food bowl until we tell her to eat.  Since she\u2019s not a chewer, she doesn\u2019t chew on many toys, but she does enjoy a Kong toy stuffed with things like pumpkin, peanut butter, wet food.  I froze them & gave them to her to keep her from boredom during heartworm treatment. \n \nShe is very food motivated, but not food aggressive and she doesn\u2019t counter surf or anything like that.    She is very gentle with taking food and is comfortable with us being close by or petting her while she eats.  She doesn\u2019t usually beg for food when we eat.  If she does, we just tell her no and to go lay down on her bed and she does.  She responds very well to a stern \u2018NO\u2019 which we\u2019ve used very infrequently.  Raising your voice or yelling hasn\u2019t been necessary.  She will stay on her blanket, towel or bed if you tell her to and she will keep her kong/treats on it as well.  We\u2019ve trained her to Stop at curbs while walking.  She is sometimes afraid of very loud noises when out walking.  She also isn\u2019t a big fan of going out in the rain, but she is surprisingly calm while inside during a storm or fireworks.  She happily goes in her crate at night & sleeps through the night.    She now loves a car ride & tries to hop in the car whenever we open the door.\n\nWe have an inside rabbit. When Violet is in the room, we keep the rabbit in her cage.  Violet may look at the rabbit, but just walks by the cage and doesn\u2019t bother it.  \n\nShe enjoys sitting next to us on the floor for belly rubs or while we watch TV.   She lets us touch all parts of her\u2026head, belly, back legs, backside, paws, etc. \n   \nI would recommend a metal trashcan with a heavy lid or one inside your cabinets.  She shows a lot of interest in our trashcan when we open it.\nThe only concern a new owner would have with Violet is our inability to acclimate her to many people during the COVID crisis.  She does not like being touched by people other than our family. (She does prefer some family members over others)   I have been working with friends to try to get her more comfortable.  I\u2019ve had them offer her treats or food and she takes it gently but does not want anyone to pet her.  I\u2019ve had people visit on the porch and she will lay down calmly while we talk.  She does the same thing if I meet a neighbor while out for a walk.  She will also go up and sniff people, but no petting. \n \nAs we\u2019ve had more people come in our house, she has recently started barking at people when they come in our house, especially men.  It\u2019s not a very vicious bark.  I am able to get her to stop by petting her and telling her it\u2019s ok and I usually ask the person to offer her treats.  She will bark again, but I continue to tell her it\u2019s ok & soothe her.\n   \nWhen we first brought Violet home she was awaiting being spayed, so we were unable to let her near other dogs.  Since being spayed, she is awaiting completion of her heartworm treatment.  We need to keep her calm, so we still haven\u2019t been able to introduce her to other dogs. I like to call her a silent observer.  When we are out and she sees people or dogs walking calmly, she watches them closely until she feels they are at a comfortable distance before she will turn her back on them.  If the other dogs are barking at her, she\u2019s significantly more cautious & may give a low growl or bark back.\"\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIf you would like to meet, foster or adopt this pet, please fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser. EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

(during covid initial shutdown)\n\nBEST HOME -\nA quiet home is best suited for him to gain trust with you.\nNo kids/preteens nor dogs is best.\nIt would be best for him to have a home in a remote area, with few visitors/guests.\nWe believe that an apt/duplex/condo with people coming and going would be less than ideal for him.\n\nDuke would do best with a dog savvy owner as he is fearful of certain situations and of people in his space - such as someone met him and bent over to rub him in to spots and he growled and was nervous of what was happening.\n\nDOGS -\nWe have not tested them with other dogs.\nOwner said they should not be with other dogs.\nDuke is said to be fine with the kennel owner's small dog.\n\nCATS -\nThey were said to have lived with cats.\nThey have not been tested with cats.\n\nKIDS -\nNo kids or preteens for Duke at all please - he was nervous near one when eating treats at our  initial meet and greet.\n\nPEOPLE SKILLS -\nDuke likes the people at the kennel.\nHe takes time to trust and warm up to new people.\nHe does not like people getting in his personal space, and he will let you know if you do by trying to back you off, by growling, giving body language to show the warning, and lunging if you continue not to listen.\nTherefore he has not made a good impression on the applicant that met him and sadly he can't live in a multi family dwelling so did not suit the other applicant's home.\n\nTRICKS -\nDuke will shake paw, lay down and roll over with a treat.\n\nVETTING -\nUpdate - after covid restrictions began lifting a bit the boys went for their checkup May 27th/2020 and got vaccines/deworm/chip.\nThe kennel also groomed them.\n+\nHe was also boostered June 26th/2020.\n\nWHERE DID HIS FRIEND GO?\nGinger has been adopted and Duke is still living at the boarding kennel.\n\nVEHICLES -\nDuke rode very well in the vehicle.\n\nWEIGHT -\nHis weight waivers from 37-40 kg.\n\nAdoption fee is $400\n\nHOW TO APPLY -\nIf you are interested in adopting please read the following -\n*We only adopt within Ontario\n*We do not do same day adoptions. \n* No viewings without an approved application\n*We do not deliver pets.\n*Inquiries will not be replied to when all info and link to application is provided below.\n\nAll info on adoption process/policies can be accessed at www.adoptapet,lucknow.on.ca \n**.Applications -http://www.adoptapet.lucknow.on.ca/applications.html\nIt can be completed, saved and emailed back to the rescue at \npetrescue@hurontel.on.ca",

Luckily for me, some people have taken me in and are helping me find a new home. My new foster parents have quickly learned that I like to sleep and that I'm housebroken. I know some basic commands like \"sit\" and \"down\" and I love to be rewarded with treats. I love to play with Clyde the 9-month-old puppy that I was found with. I like to ride in cars and I have a special bark that means \"Good morning, lets play\". Don't let my age fool you. I like to play fetch and I like to play with other dogs. But I also like the company of humans and like to chill on the couch and watch T.V. as well.\n\nInterested in meeting Bugsy text Yvonne at 424-204-3770\n\nThese dogs are looking for homes through private parties in the Los Angeles CA area.

He currently has very limited eyesight in his right eye.  He has severe dry eye which has not been responding to treatment and as a result he will be having surgery to remove both of his eyes.  He will need a special home that is patient and is able to help him adjust to his new surroundings.  He is currently in foster and is not doing well with the other small TFT in the home so it is best for him to be the only animal in the home. He would love his very own human to snuggle with!  Do you think you can open your heart and home to this wonderful little senior? If that answer is yes, we would love to speak to you! Our email address is admin@tftrescue.com",

For  years Charlie was part of a bonded pair.  He  loved  his  girlfriend MERE  and they were always together.  Finding  both of them a home together was  an impossible task. This past Winter Mere  passed  away from cancer.  We  thought Charlie  would  crumple and die but instead he proved us entirely wrong.  He  was on the rebound before he even hit the rim. We  decided  to enhance his adoption chances  by sending him to training. What an amazing surprise that was!!!  There was  a whole  side of Charlie  Brown he kept  a secret from us  for 4 years.  He quickly learned his commands (which we think he knew  but didn't tell) then he became Mr.Popularity at the camp.  He  loved  every dog there and could play non-stop keeping up with the best of them. He was smittened by the trainer  and couldn't keep his eyes off her  which in training is a good thing, We  sometimes thought Charlie  wasn't  the sharpest tool in the shed  but  we  were  wrong again.... he  had the propensity to learn quickly.  Add it all up.... this  is  one  amazing and highly adoptable dog ! Hope  you are interested in meeting him. It  would be well worth it...just no cats please,  we haven't tested him with one.  Charlie  is up-to-date on shots, neutered, chipped and ready to go home. \nHis adoption fee is $200  and that will save another dog in need!",

            "description": "Hi meet Dayana,\n\nDayana is a lovely G. Pyrenees/ Pointer mix who is about 3 years old and weighs around 75lbs. Dayana loves playing with other dogs and toys. Once she warms up to those around her, she is a happy go lucky girl with everyone she meets. She would like a home that will take her on adventures, continue her socialization, and give her lots of love. She wants a person/family who will provide her with a life of mental and physical stimulation while keeping her safe and happy. She may be small, but she would like it if there is a plan for longer workdays, so she is not spending too much time in a crate or alone. \n\nDayana came to us from a fellow rescuer.\n\nWe hold an event every weekend at our facility on SATURDAY 11-5pm.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Please visit our social media platforms for the specifics for each weekend as it changes from week to week. Please find our application at lovejoyfoundation.org when you come to an event please bring that filled out in hand with you.

            "description": "We'd like to introduce you to a very special girl, Miss Maizy. She came into the Maricopa County shelter on Christmas Eve of 2019. She's been waiting such a long time to find her forever home and we just know that perfect family is out there somewhere.\n\nMaizy is sweet, calm and easy going. She's all about quick walks to the ice cream truck and lounging with her peeps. Love you some snacks and couch time? So does she! Enjoy the peace and quiet? She's on board. Do you find yourself telling those neighborhood kids to get off your lawn? Maizy is your girl.\n\nShe's been in foster with our good friends at Dog's Eye View Board and Train for almost 6 months and has learned so much but it's time for her to move on to her forever. \n\nMaizy is approximately 7 years old, spayed, vaccinated and microchipped. She does have arthritis so she will need to be on medication to ease her pain but she sure doesn't let that stop her! She also suffers from seasonal allergies, so her furever family will need to keep up with her allergy meds. She would do best in a home with older or calm children and prefers to be an only pet so she can get allll the attention to herself.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting her, please submit an adoption application: https://www.oneloveaz.org/adoption-process\n\nAll dogs in our VIP (Very Important Pits) Program receive post adoption support and access to our free weekly Mutt Manners training classes. Maizy will also receive free lessons from A Dog's Eye View.\n\nAdoption Fees vary based on shelter promotions but are generally less than $50.",

Please see the contact info at the end of this writeup.**\n\nCOMPASSIONATE RE-HOMING FOR SENIOR DOG\n\nMagi (\n\npronounced\n\nMaj-eye) is a sweet 14 1/2-year-old Lab/Chow mix is looking for a new home.\n\nMagi is 89 lbs.\n\nShe has been an emotional\n\nsupport dog for a disabled person for many years but her person is no longer able to care for her. Now it is her turn to be taken care of and spoiled.\n\nThis senior pup deserves peace in her golden years...this beautiful, shiny soul who is so sweet and loving. She would like a person(s) who will give her a lot of love and spend time with her.\n\nAs she has gotten older, her needs have changed.\n\nMagi needs to be an \"only\" childno cats, no kids.\n\nAnother senior dog might be okay, but a younger one maybe too much for her\n\n.\n\nUnpredictable behaviors are\n\nharder for her to deal with at her age. She would thrive in a quiet environment where her person is home a lot.\n\nShe has had a couple of moves in the last 18 months due to no fault of her own so she may take a month or so to settle in and feel safe.\n\nA consistent routine would really help with this and she is looking for a patient and compassionate human to call her own.\n\nAt her age, she sleeps a lot but\n\nloves to go outside for short walks and\n\nenjoys learning new things!\n\nShe has a slight heart arrhythmia (on meds for that) and arthritis as well as some hearing loss but makes her way around just fine. Unfortunately, she cannot manage stairs as they would be too much for her at this point. Her back leg/hip are weaker and gives her some pain from arthritis.\n\nI know a senior doggie is more work and expense so I would be more than willing to help with veterinary bills. We also don't mind pet sitting if ever needed as she knows us and it would be familiar surroundings for her.\n\nIf you love senior dogs and willing to take on a new animal friend, and would like more information, please contact:\n\nJaimie\n\n(925) 553-7672\n\nhm\n\nbjharnagel@msn.com\n\n2/1/21 9:19 PM",

Patient is at high risk for continued behavioral decline in kennel. (4/12) Visual kennel side exam. Patient is hard barking at front of kennel as soon as approach, occasionally baring teeth, dilated pupils.(4/9) Vet Check -- Patient is no longer limping on right hind leg and is fully weight bearing and ambulatory. Patient's behavior precluded hands on examination. Patient is behaviorally urgent. Behavior Observation: (4/29) Great office dog! Enthusiastically plays with Kong Wobbler although doesn't eat food that is dispersed so switched to treats in Wobbler. Calms down after 10 minutes of Wobbler time and naps. Approaches both staff members to solicit attention and receives pets all over with a loose body. Jumps up into handler's lap for more attention.(4/28) Feces smeared all over kennel this morning. Leo rushes to front of kennel when handler approaches but is not spinning or bouncing off walls. Easily leashed and removed from kennel. In yard, urinates and defecates before returning to handler. Allows pets all over with loose body. Takes treats nicely and can be easily coaxed to use agility ramp. Easily returned to kennel and leash easily removed. Moved to D row for less stimulation from other dogs. Urgently promote for declining in kennel.(4/22) Per Vet Staff -- Initially approached the kennel with loose body language, but quickly became overaroused and began hard barking with dilated pupils and piloerection. Patient was pacing kennel following visual assessment. (4/21) Easily leashed and removed from kennel. Pulled moderately through shelter and parking lot. In yard, urinates and defecates before soliciting attention from handler. Accepts handling and pets all over with loose body language, tail wagging. Easily distracted by female dog in yard across the lot. Pushes through one gate and starts to bite at fencing. Initially unable to redirect but, after 30 seconds, able to distract with treats and remove from fencing. No attempted redirection on handler. After unable to visualize female dog, returns to loose body language. Easily returned to kennel and leash easily removed. Vet check entered for possible injury to mouth from biting fencing.(4/16) Hard barked initially when approached by known handler followed by unknown handler. Was easily able to be leashed and exit kennel. Pulls some while walking, and stops frequently to urinate. In yard, dog continued to be asocial, and avoidant: sniffing around perimeter, and did not look when called. Would occasionally walk by handlers and allowed very gentle, quick pets before walking away again to sniff perimeter. No interest in toys today. Easily returned to kennel.(4/14) Per Staff -- Leo hard barked twice initially on approach but took treats nicely and was wiggly and easily leashed and removed from kennel. He walked nicely through kennel and outside. Urinated and defecated once outside. Pulled minimally and did walk along with Jelly showing minimal interest in other dog. Also met Jelly through fence and again displayed minimal interest. In yard, Leo is loose, allowing all handling and accepting pets although slightly aloof and easily distracted. Plays tag without becoming aroused and readily chases tennis balls and returns with ball to handler. Does initially tense slightly with tennis ball in mouth after approaching handler but then drops ball at handler's feet to retrieve a different one. Easily returned to kennel and leash is easily removed.(4/12) Per Staff- Takes treats from assessors hand but will hard bark and lip curl when no treats are present. Body is tense, tail high, eyes dilated.(4/12) Per Staff -- Hard barking at front of kennel, snaps at assessor's hand but takes treats willingly.(4/9) Per Vet Staff -- Patient charged kennel door, hard barking with hackles up and dilated pupils. Patient responded well to treats and would even sit when directed, however as soon as treats were out, went back to initial presenting behaviors.",

Inquiries requesting additional information will not be returned, due to limited volunteers. Thank you for your understanding **** \n\nMeet Chip.\n\nChip was picked up off the streets in Houston as a stray in January 2020. He is a young dog (estimated to be between 1 and 2 years old) that had previously no obedience training, but is very smart and eager to please. He has learned sit, stay, walks into his kennel (whereas before he would not go in willingly). He loves to play and if his new home has dogs they need to be playful (or at least tolerant of a young and playful guy!) While he is playful, he can also relax once his energy needs have been met. He can be shy in new situations at first, but has warmed up to his foster and will thrive with routine and more socialization.\n\nAll PETronus Rescue dogs receive basic vaccinations (distemper/parvo, bordetella, & rabies), spay/ neuter, and microchip prior to adoption. We also treat any know medical issues, including heartworms.\n\nOur dogs live in foster homes while they wait patiently for their forever families to find them. This is beneficial in that they learn house manners, crate training, housebreaking, etc while they wait and we are also able to get a very realistic picture of their energy level, temperament, etc so that we can place them in a home that is the best fit.\n\nOur adoption fees are $200 for dogs over 1 year of age and $250 for dogs under 1 year of age. Puppies receive 3 rounds of puppy vaccinations.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our amazing dogs, please fill out our adoption application here http://bit.do/PRAdoption and we will be in touch!",

            "description": "Location: Langley BC, CanadaKing Arthur\nBreed: Pitbull terrier mix\nAge: 5 yrs\nGender: M, neutered\nWgt/Hgt: 47 lbs / 26 inches tall\nEnergy level: Average. Medium-high (when playing)\nRelations: Good with dogs after intro, teens, kids/ Not so good with cats\nHighlights: sweet, smoochy, good walking on leash, rides well in car, loves to play ball and go for walks, house trained\nRegion: Mexico\n\nKnights, assembled! Honoring my name, and as the truthful king of smoochies, I'm looking for honorable folks to spend the rest of my life with. If you're up for becoming a part of the Pittie round table, I'm your perfect match!\n\nI am a sweet boy who is super handsome, calm and well-adjusted to being around people.\n\nI was found on the streets of Mexico wandering around; it seemed as if I hadn't been abandoned for very long. I almost got ran over by a truck, but my rescuer managed to get me out of the avenue, safe and sound.\n\nMy rescuer and her family decided to take me in, so I could be safe. Apparently, my looks could have put me in danger. Sadly, my rescuer's country isn't the most pitbull-friendly place.\n\nI must've had experience with travelling by car before, because things went perfectly all the way to the vet. The doctor said I had no health issues, and after a few days, I got neutered, vaccinated and dewormed (not my favorite moment, to be honest).\n\nSince then, I've been taken care of by my rescuer and the vet's team, especially by a very sweet 14 year old guy with whom I spend the most time. I can get a little anxious when \"my\" person leaves and will softly whine. https://youtu.be/939J5WPyZe4.\n\nI don't care much for crowds though and feel a bit stressed at that time.\n\nMy caretakers say that I'm the smoochiest dog ever, a good kiss is all it takes for me to be ever affectionate and just overall happy.\n\nListening is one of my strongest suits, so you can always count on me for that. I love sausages, so they'd do the trick if you want to train me. I can be a little stubborn at first (I'm a king) but I learn pretty fast, so I'll pick up the commands after a short time. https://youtu.be/2r8GFznskqo.\n\nI always have a great time exercising, but I know how to walk calmly on a leash and pretty well ignore most everything. https://youtu.be/S5p7IPOBrvQ.\n\nI'm smart, obedient, clean, and house trained. Yea. I like other dog's company, but I think I will do best as the only one in the house. I sometimes move forward and growl at other dogs when they get too close. With a couple meetings, I usually become friends. I don't like sharing my toys with other dogs when playing though. https://youtu.be/IxHbYTo5rj0.\n\nI have been around a couple of young children and it went well. I just think I might be a little strong to hang out with them often, but I definitely get along with teenagers. They're my favorite!\n\nNot usually many problems with cats, but since I don't like them too close, I can growl when I get stressed, and they can make me a little tense. But you can be sure that my years in this world made me a true gentleman, emphasis on the gentle part!\n\nI don't know why, but recently I've started to bark at many things while in my crate. I'm typically not much of a barker. I just want to be part of a family, where I can hang out with you.\n\nI enjoy any kinds of activity with my human knight, whether it be relaxing after a long day, or racing together in the morning. My energy level depends on what I'm doing, so I can be pretty relaxed while watching a movie or pretty energetic while playing ball (I love it!).\n\nI'm a very adaptable guy. A back yard with a tall fence (since I know how to jump quite high when playing ball- yes, I am quite athletic) would be nice, but I also like going out for walks to enjoy the air and the view. I look forward to starting a new life in Canada and will be sure to bring lots of love and fun to my new home!\n\nI have been neutered and vaccinated.\n\nMy adoption fee is $500.00 CAD, this includes my airfare to Canada.\n\nDisclaimer: It is important for all applicants to visit our website, http://www.lovedatlastdogrescue.ca/adopting/ and read about Loved at Last Dog Rescue.\n\nInformation included in the profile is provided to us from the international rescuer or local fosters.

Our veterinary partner estimates that Layla Ali is 5 years old at the time of intake in April 2020. Layla Ali is good with people of all ages, including children. She is great with cats, but can be dog selective (she is working on that). Layla Ali is not a city girl and would do best in a quiet environment in the suburbs. This poor girl has not had an easy life which was apparent by the rough shape she was in when Rescue Dogs Rock NYC rescued her. But that life is now over, and Layla Ali can look forward to a happy, loving home where she will be a treasured member of the family, where she will feel safe and secure and finally know what it feels like to be loved. If you have room in your happy home and loving heart for Layla Ali, please apply online to adopt Layla Ali at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

            "description": "Mun is about 2.5 years old, approx 50 lbs and we believe she is a dobie Shepherd and possibly Rottweiler mix.  She was dumped at a high kill shelter when her owner's moved and did not take her with them.  \n\nInitially she is shy of new people but once she knows you she is a friendly pup and very social.   She warms up to and will trust a female faster than a male. However, she will accept men with patience. We do not know her history but believe she was abused by a man, so patience is ideal if there is a male in the home.\n\nThe best way to Mun's heart is with treats.  She is like a head-strong teenager who wants things done her way but she also knows when she does something wrong.  She is an Alpha female and is extremely intelligent and an experienced owner would be best and recommended for Mun. A fenced yard or avid runner would help burn her energy.  (Running would be okay once the heartworm treatment is completed).\n\n She loves toys and treats.  Mun loves to ride in the car, likes to be brushed, and be with her person.  She can sometimes be protective of her toys as she has a tendency to resource guard until trust is  built.  Her current foster mom can take toys from her without a problem.  \n\nMun has a lot of personality and once she warms up to you she will be your best buddy and sit on your lap and snuggle.  She will bond to her person.\n\nThe pictures do not do this beautiful girl justice at all.  She is gorgeous in person.  We are working on getting better photos too!\n\nCats would not be advisable in Mun's world.  She does not like cats.\n\nThe perfect home for Mun would be the only pet so she can have all the attention.  A female only home would be great, but, a home with a male will require some patience in the beginning but will work given time.\n\nWe now there is the perfect home out there  for Mun.  Could it be you?  \n\nMun is spayed, up-to-date on vaccinations.  She is heartworm positive and we are doing the slow kill method which is monthly heartgard which has been started.  Her remaining heartgard will go with her adopter to finish the treatment.\n",

He was found roaming the streets outside Long Island and was taken into the shelter where he spent over 4 years of his life.  As you can imagine, being in a shelter environment for that length of time, it takes Socs a little time to trust people and new environments.  Socrates will need to go with a very experienced owner that can provide references and will continue his training so all the hard work he has been doing with pay off.  He absolutely loves the outdoors, hiking, swimming, walks on the beach.  Socs does well with the training he has in place currently with both new people and other pups.  No kitties or kids for this sweet man.  \n\nSocrates is fully vaccinated, neutered, and microchipped\n\nIf you would like to meet Bart please contact pnwpack@gmail.com",

Since she is fearful of strangers, she needs a VERY special and understanding adopter. Someone who is dog savvy and can work with her, patiently. This is NOT to be taken lightly, she is small but has shown aggression in the past (she HAS AND WILL BITE AGAIN if given the opportunity) when introduced to new people in an uncomfortable manner. Do not expect Moe to be a normal doggo, she likely will never be comfortable with strangers. She has even been known to bite humans shes comfortable with. An adopter who is dog savvy, patient, and persistent is a must. A calm and quiet home without children, cats, and frequent visitors would be best for her. A home without a man would be preferred as she has never been known to trust men. She prefers dogs her own size but is currently doing well in a foster home with large dogs. This little lady is house trained on a schedule and is also crate trained! When she was rescued, we noticed that she has major skin issues. Were working to resolve this issue but it may take months to years before fully recovered.\n\nThe adoption fee for this pretty girl is $225. She has been spayed, microchipped and is up to date on vaccines!\n\nWant to meet Moe? Submit an adoption application and someone will be in touch to schedule a meet n greet to see if shes the right match for you!",

He was kept in a pen until he arrived here to live in a kennel. He is around 2 years old. He is extremely affectionate! He sits next to his person, on their feet, or climbs on them constantly. He is very, very needy. He does not like other animals and he would need help with house training. He is very intelligent and seems to catch on fast (we have kept him behind the counter some and he does wonderful). He can jump very high as well as climb a fence so he cannot be left unsupervised in a yard. He is a really sweet and happy boy that will make someone really happy they have him, he just needs a little bit of help. He was born on Christmas Day 2018.\n\nUpdate: AJ had a foster home for about a month. He improved dramatically on his behavior and really improved his housebreaking ability to about 90%. The foster worked very hard with him to help him understand not everything (including people) are a chew toy lol. He got a lot of walks/hikes to help with his energy. Unfortunately, the foster was not able to keep him due to their work schedule and having no one to help with AJ's schedule. The foster felt it was not fair to AJ and we understood.\n\nEverything in the first paragraph still holds true. He needs to be an only and he is very sweet while also being very energetic. He needs a special adopter and will require a home visit to foster/adopt. He rides great in a car and walks great on a leash. He loves to be held.",

            "description": "Location: New Orleans, Louisiana \n\nChloe has been apart of Cane Haven Rescue for a little while now. She is approximately 2-3 years old, up to date on vaccines, spayed & microchipped.  \n\nChloe is a very special girl and has touched the lives of everyone who knows her. She would do best in a home with no other dogs, cats or children. Unfortunately Chloe does not realize how big she is and sometimes her size may be a bit surprising to those who are not familiar with her breed. Chloe must be adopted out to a family that is very familiar with her breed and be willing to work with her. \n\nChloe is house trained, kennel trained & knows her basic commands/manners. Several meet and greets will be required before the right home is selected for this girl. \n\nInterested adopters can fill out an application at canehavenrescue.com. \nAny possible questions about Chloe, please email canehavenrescue@gmail.com \n\nCane Haven Rescue will transport any of their adoptable dogs to the right home. We do require adoption fees that are based on the age & health status of the adoptable dog. The adoption fee covers every single dog in CHR with vaccinations, heartworm test, deworming, microchip, spay/neuter & medications. All CHR adoptable dogs are current on their monthly  heartworm and flea medication. A CHR representative will do a home check to ensure the pets are placed in a secure and loving home. \n\nwww.canehavenrescue.com",

He walks with a limp now but that doesn't stop him. Frank is a volunteer favorite and has been on sleepovers. He appears to be housebroken. His report card was all A's! Come and meet Frank today! No children. OK dogs.",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Garth. I'm sometimes called Garth-a-mus.\n\nI was rescued after I was found abandoned in an apartment with another small dog. For whatever reason, though we got along great, she was happy go lucky and I actually have some anxiety left from the experience.\n\nBecause of that, I'm a happy go lucky guy when I am able to be independent. I'm more of a let's hang out as pals kind of dog, rather than a lap lover or cuddler. I'm perfectly happy to follow you around, watch what you are doing, and going on outings like buddies.\n\nI am looking for a forever home with an experienced family. This is an absolute must. Because my past is unknown we don't really know why I have a few issues but I really don't like to be picked up. I really want to work to be okay with it but I just really struggle with it so I am an all 4 on the floor kinda dog, just like big dogs are. Speaking of dogs, I like to play with other dogs my size and would do well in a home with them but I can also be on my own as well. While I enjoy spending quality time with my people friends, I am also content to spend time on my own as I have an independent spirit.\n\nEven though I do get along with others, due to my size, age, personality, and anxiety, I would do best in a home without children.\n\nMy foster parents have helped me to learn manners or what we call 'Petiquette' and how to be calm though I still sometimes have trouble controlling my excitement and impulses. When socializing I have a hard time with new people so I will need someone who is willing to let others know that I am your buddy, but not everyone's buddy if you know what I mean.\n\nI know basic commands and I 'sit pretty' to get my meals. I love to go on walks but I am still working on how a harness feels. With the right one, I do great though! I am also crate trained and love to have my personal space. Oh, and I also love to jump and dance when I achieve something I'm a bit nervous about. My favorite words to hear are 'YOU DID IT!' :)\n\nIf you think we may be a good match, or you would like to get to know me better, please complete an application at https://www.smallbreedrescue.org/Home/AnimalAdoption/54\n\nPS: I weigh about 7.5lbs, my vaccinations are up to date, I am microchipped & neutered, and my teeth have been cleaned :)\n\nDue to home introductions that are part of the adoption process, we can only accept applications for interested parties who are in or near San Diego County, California at this time.",

            "description": "BEAU the Brave is a 57 pound approx. 2 1/2 yr old pitt mix.  This big, beautiful boy is very quiet and mild mannered.  He is happy-go-lucky & LOVES people and is fine with kids.   At his foster home he lives inside the home with the family and other dogs.  Beau isn\u2019t a big fan of  unfamiliar dogs & May growl.  However, once properly introduced he\u2019s fine.  Beau is house & kennel trained. (He sleeps in a kennel at night.)    Although Beau gets along with most other dogs, we recommend that he not be in a home with other large male dogs, especially around food. Food aggression is a trait that many rescue pups have and can be overcome with time and proper training. However, at this time, we wouldn't adopt him to a home with other large male dogs    Like many rescue pups, this furbaby is HW+,  but please don\u2019t let that scare you.  He\u2019s asymptomatic &  is currently undergoing the *slow-kill method of treatment (see more information below).  \n\nAll our adoption fees include spay/neuter, micro-chip, up-to-date vaccinations, including rabies thru date of adoption. This pup is heartworm positive and is currently being treated with the *slow kill method, approved by her veterinarian, on prevention & on flea/tick prevention. \n\n*The slow kill method of treatment, simply stated, is a 30 day regiment of  doxycycline followed by a monthly dose of Advantage Multi for 12 months, then retesting.   Most dogs test negative after one year of following this treatment; however, we always recommend that potential adopters consult & follow the advice of their family veterinarian upon adopting any of our hw+ pups.   Although the fast-kill method is still considered the \"gold-standard\" by the AVA, and may be preferred by some vets; the slow-kill method has proven to be effective in our rescue. The main reason we utilize this method is due to our limited financial constraints and the high number of our rescue pups that are infected.   In the cases of severe infection and if the pup is highly symptomatic, we sometimes use the fast-kill approach instead.   Again, we recommend for you to consult with your veterinarian after the adoption is complete and follow their recommendations.   \n\nIn order to be considered for one of our beautiful pups, please go to our website and complete and application: https://www.mustluvdogs.org/adoptable-pets.\nPlease note that we are a DUE DILIGENCE adoption organization. Part of our approval process requires, among other things:\n* Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered.\n*The majority, but not all, of our pets require a fenced yard or secure enclosure.  In the case of apartments, we require Landlord approval and designated dog area in complex.\n*Verifiable good veterinary history INCLUDING regular vaccination/visits and good Heartworm Prevention history is a MUST!\n*Adopter must be able to have time to spend with the pup and be able to provide the pup a safe environment to live.\n*ALL our dogs are expected to be primarily INSIDE dogs.  They MUST sleep inside the home.  We truly understand that some folks have working dogs (i.e. farmers, ranchers,etc); however, the majority of our dogs have had a rough life prior to coming to us & we want to make sure that they are showered with LUV & maybe even a bit spoiled for the rest of their lives. \n\nOther facts are also considered, including whether children or other pets are a good fit with the dog. \n\nMust Luv Dogs reserves the right to deny any applications that we don't think are a good fit with the pup. Our first & foremost concern is the dog's best interest. It is our MISSION to place them in a home that is a great fit for their needs for a lifetime of luv & being part of a family.\n*We will consider adoptions in any area; however, will do not ship or transport puppies under the age of 12 mos. We will ONLY transport an adult dog on a transport approved by MLD, at adopter's expense.\n* In order to be affordable and afford every family an opportunity to have a pup of their own, we keep our Adoption Fees low; however, please keep in mind that the fees we charge do not cover all costs for the pup.  Any additional donations are greatly appreciated!\n\nPlease note that all of our pets are in private foster homes. In order to reduce any stress or confusion for our pups, we require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meet & greet for any of our pups.  Alternatively, you are always welcome to come meet any of our pups at one of our regular Adoption Events.   Our events are always posted on PetFinder OR on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/mustLUVdogs.org.\n\nFinally, THANK YOU for considering Must Luv Dogs for your next pet. \n\n*Most dogs require a fenced area in yard. \n*Apartments okay IF nearby dog park or walking trails (with landlord appoval).\n*ALL dogs must be INSIDE dogs and treated a part of family. \n*We are a DUE DILIGENCE Adoption Rescue.  \n*Must have good Vet history & Heartworm prevention is a MUST!\n*ALL dogs are fully vetted, spay/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption.\n\n",

            "description": "1/28/2021\n\nMeet Sawyer Talbot. He is an adorable male dachshund (doxie) mix. He is brown and petite and cute. Sawyer is about 4 years old. He is sweet and friendly with people and other dogs. He was accepted into the rescue w his friend Sarah (female doxie mix). He has been vaccinated and dewormed and is heartworm positive. He will be heartworm treated and neutered prior to his trip to PA. Sawyer is scheduled for transport from GA to PA on Feb 7th. \nApplications can be found at www.wagsrescue.com\n\nOur Adoption Area - WAGS RESCUE is based in BUCKS COUNTY. Therefore, a majority of our volunteers live in the Bucks County area. WAGS will consider adoption applications for people living in the BUCKS and MONTGOMERY areas. On a case by case basis (depending on distance and availability of our volunteers to do a home visit), we may consider applications in the PHILADELPHIA area as well as parts of CHESTER county.\n\nDue to a higher than normal volume of applications, we will not be doing any adoptions outside a 50-mile radius from Horsham Veterinary Hospital.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\nPlease call Colleen @ 267-238-7892 or Susan @ 267-312-3372. To begin the adoption process please, please fill out our online application. Go to wagsrescue.com and click on adoption form. After you complete the application, you will be taken to PayPal so you can submit the $25.00 application fee. Thank you!",

            "description": "Mikki is a 5 1/2 year old Walker Treeing Coonhound mix.  She's an  independent 62 pound LAP dog.  Mikki is a loving and playful girl.    She loves to be outside, but will also curl up on the sofa to nap!   If you're lucky, she will give love and cuddles. She is an alpha female and would probably do best as the only dog, unless you have another dog who is submissive.   Queen Mikki loves her bed and blankies.  She likes being the boss and she will let you know what she requires. lol   Her \"highness\" is  beautiful, smart & may bark until she gets what she wants.  Mikki is sort of a cat in a dog suit.    If you aren't familiar with this breed, just know that coonhounds have a very distinctive (and not a quiet) bark.   Mikki is clumsy and funny and likes to be protective of her toys and food. She has had a \"ruff\" life up til now, but thanks to her foster family she has a second chance to live a great life.  She has adapted well to a routine and it may take her a few days to figure out her new home but she will be a great addition to any family who enjoys outdoors and has love to give to this sweet girl.       \n\nLike most rescue pups, this furbaby is HW+, but is currently undergoing the *slow-kill method of treatment (see more information below).  \n\nAll our adoption fees include spay/neuter, micro-chip, up-to-date vaccinations, including rabies thru date of adoption. This pup is heartworm positive and is currently being treated with the *slow kill method, approved by her veterinarian, on prevention & on flea/tick prevention. \n\n*The slow kill method of treatment, simply stated, is a 30 day regiment of  doxycycline followed by a monthly dose of Advantage Multi for 12 months, then retesting.   Most dogs test negative after one year of following this treatment; however, we always recommend that potential adopters consult & follow the advice of their family veterinarian upon adopting any of our hw+ pups.   Although the fast-kill method is still considered the \"gold-standard\" by the AVA, and may be preferred by some vets; the slow-kill method has proven to be effective in our rescue. The main reason we utilize this method is due to our limited financial constraints and the high number of our rescue pups that are infected.   In the cases of severe infection and if the pup is highly symptomatic, we sometimes use the fast-kill approach instead.   Again, we recommend for you to consult with your veterinarian after the adoption is complete and follow their recommendations.   \n\nIn order to be considered for one of our beautiful pups, please go to our website and complete and application: https://www.mustluvdogs.org/adoptable-pets.\nPlease note that we are a DUE DILIGENCE adoption organization. Part of our approval process requires, among other things:\n* Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered.\n*The majority, but not all, of our pets require a fenced yard or secure enclosure.  In the case of apartments, we require Landlord approval and designated dog area in complex.\n*Verifiable good veterinary history INCLUDING regular vaccination/visits and good Heartworm Prevention history is a MUST!\n*Adopter must be able to have time to spend with the pup and be able to provide the pup a safe environment to live.\n*ALL our dogs are expected to be primarily INSIDE dogs.  They MUST sleep inside the home.  We truly understand that some folks have working dogs (i.e. farmers, ranchers,etc); however, the majority of our dogs have had a rough life prior to coming to us & we want to make sure that they are showered with LUV & maybe even a bit spoiled for the rest of their lives. \n\nOther facts are also considered, including whether children or other pets are a good fit with the dog. \n\nMust Luv Dogs reserves the right to deny any applications that we don't think are a good fit with the pup. Our first & foremost concern is the dog's best interest. It is our MISSION to place them in a home that is a great fit for their needs for a lifetime of luv & being part of a family.\n*We will consider adoptions in any area; however, will do not ship or transport puppies under the age of 12 mos. We will ONLY transport an adult dog on a transport approved by MLD, at adopter's expense.\n* In order to be affordable and afford every family an opportunity to have a pup of their own, we keep our Adoption Fees low; however, please keep in mind that the fees we charge do not cover all costs for the pup.  Any additional donations are greatly appreciated!\n\nPlease note that all of our pets are in private foster homes. In order to reduce any stress or confusion for our pups, we require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meet & greet for any of our pups.  Alternatively, you are always welcome to come meet any of our pups at one of our regular Adoption Events.   Our events are always posted on PetFinder OR on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/mustLUVdogs.org.\n\nFinally, THANK YOU for considering Must Luv Dogs for your next pet. \n\n*Most dogs require a fenced area in yard. \n*Apartments okay IF nearby dog park or walking trails (with landlord appoval).\n*ALL dogs must be INSIDE dogs and treated a part of family. \n*We are a DUE DILIGENCE Adoption Rescue.  \n*Must have good Vet history & Heartworm prevention is a MUST!\n*ALL dogs are fully vetted, spay/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption.\n\n\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nName - Kora\n\nAge -Adult\n\nWeight - approx 60 lbs.\n\nMedical - Kora is on Fluoxetine. This is a daily medication to help with anxiety\n\nOther dogs - Kora is dog selective and can be dog reactive on walks. She has previously lived with other dogs and would require a home with very easy going dogs who would co-exist with her. She needs slow intros or would be best as an only dog\n\nCats - No. She does have a high prey drive\n\nKids - Kora's previous family had children and they said she was good with them. She has not recently been around children\n\nBackground - Kora originally came to us in 2013 when she was rescued from by a Good Samaritan from an awful situation where she was kept on a heavy chain in someone's garage. We adopted her out to what we thought was a good family. Unfortunately they dumped her just a few short years later. We adopted her out again in 2016 to what we thought was her Forever Family. Unbeknownst to us, they gave her away to yet ANOTHER family. Supposedly that family loved her dearly but was forced to surrender her to our local shelter when they had to move and could not take her with. Thankfully her chip is still registered to ITP and the shelter called us to let us know she was there\n\nCrate trained - Kora is used to sleeping and eating in the crate\n\nLeash trained - She can be leash reactive to other dogs (pulls and barks). Her Foster Family has started walking her with a backpack and this has helped her have better leash manners, although she still needs some work in this department\n\nHousebroken - Perfectly house trained and will use the doggy door\n\nEating Habits - Eats normally, not a picky eater\n\nCommands known - Kora knows sit, down ,stay, bed, crate, leave it, wait, gives her paw and knows her name. She is a very smart girl\n\nCar rides - She is used to being crated while in her Foster Family's minivan\n\nBath time - Loves to go in the shower with warm water. She loves being pampered!\n\nAffectionate - Kora is pretty independent. She is not overly affectionate. She is happy to sit near you or rest in the same room as you\n\nActivity level - Moderate activity for her age. Foster Family walks her about 30 minutes a day with the backpack on and this seems to be plenty of exercise for her\n\nPlay style - Occasionally she might chase the ball or tug rope but she is not really into toys\n\nBad habits - Her worst habit is the reactivity to other dogs while on leash. Foster Family has been working with our behaviorist to correct this behavior. Being on the Fluoxetine has also helped calm her and her being able to relax has helped\n\nRedeeming qualities - She is so calm and quiet for the most part and she has the best manners! She does not jump on you, she takes treats softly, she knows her commands and we really appreciate her independent nature\n\nBest feature - Her cute soft ears!\n\nWhat Foster Mom/Dad wants you to know -\n\"It breaks our heart that Kora has been let down and abandoned by her people so many times. We can't blame her for having anxiety now - she has been bounced around from family to family for all of her life! We are working on providing a relaxing environment for her to help with her insecurities. She really is such a good girl - very smart and sweet. The medication, along with daily exercise, really seem to be helping her relax. We hope a patient family will fall in love with Kora and promise to never abandon her again! She deserves her Happily Ever After once and for all.\"\n\nPlease consider sponsoring Kora with either a one-time or monthly tax-deductible donation.

Since they are a bonded pair they MUST be fostered together.\n\nAll potential Forever Fosters must reside within 100 miles of Mt Juliet, TN.

This sweet girl spent the first 5 years of her life at the end of a short chain, living outside with little love.  Thanks to her foster family, she now lives with a family of humans who show love and affection to her regularly.    She loves nothing more than to stretch outside on the porch and nap in the sunshine. Tara also appreciates a good, long back-scratching session from her humans!    Please give this precious girl a family of her very own to love and adore.   She will make some lucky person or family the most loyal of all pets.   Like most rescue pups, Tara is heartworm positive, but is currently undergoing the *slow-kill method of treatment (see more information below).  \n\nAll our adoption fees include spay/neuter, micro-chip, up-to-date vaccinations, including rabies thru date of adoption. This pup is heartworm positive and is currently being treated with the *slow kill method, approved by her veterinarian, on prevention & on flea/tick prevention. \n\n*The slow kill method of treatment, simply stated, is a 30 day regiment of  doxycycline followed by a monthly dose of Advantage Multi for 12 months, then retesting.   Most dogs test negative after one year of following this treatment; however, we always recommend that potential adopters consult & follow the advice of their family veterinarian upon adopting any of our hw+ pups.   Although the fast-kill method is still considered the \"gold-standard\" by the AVA, and may be preferred by some vets; the slow-kill method has proven to be effective in our rescue. The main reason we utilize this method is due to our limited financial constraints and the high number of our rescue pups that are infected.   In the cases of severe infection and if the pup is highly symptomatic, we sometimes use the fast-kill approach instead.   Again, we recommend for you to consult with your veterinarian after the adoption is complete and follow their recommendations.   \n\nIn order to be considered for one of our beautiful pups, please go to our website and complete and application: https://www.mustluvdogs.org/adoptable-pets.\nPlease note that we are a DUE DILIGENCE adoption organization. Part of our approval process requires, among other things:\n* Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered.\n*The majority, but not all, of our pets require a fenced yard or secure enclosure.  In the case of apartments, we require Landlord approval and designated dog area in complex.\n*Verifiable good veterinary history INCLUDING regular vaccination/visits and good Heartworm Prevention history is a MUST!\n*Adopter must be able to have time to spend with the pup and be able to provide the pup a safe environment to live.\n*ALL our dogs are expected to be primarily INSIDE dogs.  They MUST sleep inside the home.  We truly understand that some folks have working dogs (i.e. farmers, ranchers,etc); however, the majority of our dogs have had a rough life prior to coming to us & we want to make sure that they are showered with LUV & maybe even a bit spoiled for the rest of their lives. \n\nOther facts are also considered, including whether children or other pets are a good fit with the dog. \n\nMust Luv Dogs reserves the right to deny any applications that we don't think are a good fit with the pup. Our first & foremost concern is the dog's best interest. It is our MISSION to place them in a home that is a great fit for their needs for a lifetime of luv & being part of a family.\n*We will consider adoptions in any area; however, will do not ship or transport puppies under the age of 12 mos. We will ONLY transport an adult dog on a transport approved by MLD, at adopter's expense.\n* In order to be affordable and afford every family an opportunity to have a pup of their own, we keep our Adoption Fees low; however, please keep in mind that the fees we charge do not cover all costs for the pup.  Any additional donations are greatly appreciated!\n\nPlease note that all of our pets are in private foster homes. In order to reduce any stress or confusion for our pups, we require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meet & greet for any of our pups.  Alternatively, you are always welcome to come meet any of our pups at one of our regular Adoption Events.   Our events are always posted on PetFinder OR on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/mustLUVdogs.org.\n\nFinally, THANK YOU for considering Must Luv Dogs for your next pet. \n\n*Most dogs require a fenced area in yard. \n*Apartments okay IF nearby dog park or walking trails (with landlord appoval).\n*ALL dogs must be INSIDE dogs and treated a part of family. \n*We are a DUE DILIGENCE Adoption Rescue.  \n*Must have good Vet history & Heartworm prevention is a MUST!\n*ALL dogs are fully vetted, spay/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption.\n\n",

We did have one accident but that was the first night and we didn't take her water away early enough and we also tried to sleep in. Now she doesn't have access to water 1.5 hours before bed and I get up every morning at 6 to let her out. Now she will cry at the top of the steps or go and sit in front of the back door to be let out. (...) (paraphrased: She is strong on leash and has leash reactivity issues to other dogs, which we are working on with check-in cues and leash manners training.).This animal is currently available from foster care through ACCT Philly's Adoptions Programs. If the foster has not listed a personal email, contact adopt@acctphilly.org to be put in touch with the foster.We encourage you to visit our shelter during our adoption hours to view our complete selection of available animals.

            "description": "Have you met Roxy?\n\n15-year-old Roxy and her sister Pinky were surrendered by their former owners to the San Diego Humane Society because they were moving and their new home didn't allow dogs. We rescued them with a bunch of other SDHS seniors so we didn't know they were sisters at first. Then, we noticed they were never apart, always cuddled into small beds together, and were nervous if they other left for vetting or grooming. It was clear - these girls are best friends and we will only be looking for a home that can take them together. Roxy has a perfectly frosted face and man is she a fighter! She was surrendered with a huge hernia and a broken leg. She had surgery to repair her hernia and feels like a new girl. Roxy will eat anything and never says no to a snack. Roxy is crate trained and has never had an accident in her crate or overnight. Roxy is a mellow girl, but does get random spurts of energy; she may only have three good legs, but this chick is FAST when she wants to be.\n\nRoxy and Pinky live in a foster home. Their Foster Mom shared, \"Here comes Roxy! Roxy is absolutely loving her retirement retreat. She's so happy, energetic, and just full of life. She may have three working legs but boy she's fast when she gets excited! Best board game companion. Absolutely adores her younger sister, they are just so sweet together!\"\n\nPlease submit an application to schedule an appointment to meet this lovable duo! Apply here: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees and we help with medical costs!\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 1/31/21 KG",

We actually didn't realize that they were a bonded pair when they first arrived at FFF but it soon became clear! These two go together like peas and carrots! Because of their bond, we will only be placing them in a home together. Pinky is the cheeky playful sister. She is solidly house broken and would never even dream of going potty in the house. Pinky likes to hide her treats for later, even though it means her sister with the super sniffer will find it and eat it later. Pinky enjoys long walks, chasing bunnies, and sunbathing naps in the afternoon. She cries in excitement when she sees a potential friend on walks and playfully greets them upon intros.\n\nPinky and Roxy live in a foster home. Their foster mom shares, \"Pinky is most definitely the biggest cuddle monster ever created. She\nis a big energy bundle, she loves to hike, run, and just be outdoors! Roxy loves to be carried outdoors and just look around - what a life!\n\nCuddling together remains their favorite activity though!\"\n\nPlease apply to meet this adorable pair: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family.

            "description": "Lily's mom was a purebred Boston Terrier.  She had three huge pups which required a C-section and soon died from complications of the surgery.  The three pups were hand raised by Grandparents who were taking care of their deceased son's young boys. .  \n\nEventually the grandparents realized the kids had no interest in the pups so we ended up re-homing each pup.  When we finally got Lily she was over 4 mo old and a bit spoiled.  \n\nShe was a house dog.  By the time she reached age 6-months she started to stray off our property and run bunnies.  So we had to lock her up becasue she went missing over 24 hours. Such a terrible life to be locked up.  She shares a pen with a 6 yr old male Mountain Cur, Wiseman, and a female Pit Rat Terrier mix, Pamela. \n\nThis 30-35 pound beautiful girl needs a home with an active owner or kids who will enjoy playing with a dog.\n\nWe don't know how she is with cats.  Good with dogs, kids, strangers. \n\nCall Marilyn at 573-722-3035 to adopt Lily from 9:30am to 9:30pm Central Time.  We have adopted dogs all over the USA, however during the Corona Virus we do not have volunteer transport help nor can we fly dogs.",

            "description": "Boston Mix - Happy BoyMeet sweet boy, Mickey Jacuzzi, who is a 6 to 7-year-old American Staffordshire mix with a little Boston Terrier in him. He is a strong boy at 57 lb. He's fine with all people including kids (bigger are better because of his size) but needs an only-pet home.\n\nMikey would love to have a home and family of his own. He came from a shelter as a stray. We found out he likes to go fishing and will jump in the water to fish on his own if you aren't careful!\n\nMikey is a very sweet boy and tries his best to follow your direction (see the video). He likes to be near his human and will spend some short cuddle time, but his favorite is to play and roll around in the grass. Mikey is neutered, UTD on vaccines, microchipped and heart worm negative. He has even had a dental done!\n\nTo find out more about Mikey Jacuzzi, call his foster mom, Sharon, at 865-255-5567. Mikey's adoption fee is $175.00 He is located in Knoxville, TN. If you are interested in Mikey the 1st step is always an application found on our website: www.bostonterriertn.org\n\nNOTE: Submission of an application and fee does not guarantee adoption of any specific Boston, since that particular dog may have applications pending or may not be the right match for you.\nPlease use the foster momma or dad's contact information above for questions.\nThe process always begins with an application which can be found at The Boston Terrier Rescue of East Tennessee website\nNote that in most cases, we do not adopt to families with small children, e.g., 'under 6,' as a precaution to the child's safety and the dog's safety. In some cases with larger Boston mixes or other dogs, we do make exceptions. Please ask the foster momma.\nWe prefer to place dogs within driving distance of where they are being fostered. If someone from outside the local area is approved for adoption, they must be willing to personally drive/fly to get the dog. The East Coast division (NC/SC/VA/MD/DC) does have special transport capabilties for their kids. Ask them.\nAlso, submission of an application and fee does not guarantee adoption of any specific Boston since that particular dog may have applications pending or may not be the right match for you.",

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN FOSTERING BRADLEY, PLEASE GO TO THE MAKE A DIFFERENCE RESCUE PAGE AND SEND A PRIVATE MESSAGE THAT INCLUDES YOUR PHONE NUMBER AND EMAIL ADDRESS. \n\nBradley is a 2 year old Terrier mix. He loves to be outside, hang out with humans or snuggle up on the couch. Children 16 years old or older. Bradley is good with dogs after a very slow proper introduction is done. Unfortunately, we do not know how he is with cats. He loves to go for walks, play and just do whatever you want to do. His forever home must have a fenced yard where he can safely run, play and hang out with his people. Bradley is neutered, up to date on his vaccinations, on heart worm preventative as well as house and crate trained. Bradley would make a great companion dog.\n\nAll dogs we rescue stay with us until they find their forever homes. We do not do same day adoptions. A home visit is required to ensure our dog is going to a safe environment and our dog gets along with your dog(s) and/or cat(s). We require all our dogs over the age of 1 year attend 1 obedience class (6 week session) outside the home. You must live within 1 hour of Birmingham, MI to adopt one of our dogs. No out of state or outside the U.S. adoptions or fosters. Bradley's adoption fee is $275.",

Had a rough life, being left outside without any shelter all of her life, vet believes she was bred until she no longer could be. With that being said, she has trust issues. \nShe is approx 5 years old, has the heart of a puppy. Alice may have had a rough start at life but she has come out of her shell. She is very vocal, that is her way to express herself. She loves people but can be a lil snappy (protective). She would be better as an only dog, but would be ok with a young submissive dog. Alice will be your best friend. She adores car rides, walks, and hanging out.",

Odin is the most mellow, sweet boy! ??? completely house trained, doesn\u2019t jump on furniture or bark, loves his bed, treats, and stealing my ?? (socks), he likes being brushed and is the goodest boy during bath time. \n\nWe have been walking almost every day...I haven\u2019t noticed any limping. Odin is the easiest dog to take care of and would be a great addition to a quieter home. He did great with other dogs on a walk and meeting my mom, sister and 10 yr old nephew. So older children would be best. Odin weighs about 50 lbs and has an estimated birthdate of April 1, 2020.\n\nOur adoption fees vary, Shelter Dogs are $150, Prison Dogs are $200, Puppies are $250, and Popular Pure-Breeds are $400. The price includes: a Home Again Microchip, set of shots, de-worming, heartworm testing (if old enough), spay or neuter, and a 1 year rabies shot (if old enough). All dogs adopted must leave with a county license at an additional cost of $17, this fee is cash only. The adoption fee can be paid using credit card or cash.  If you are interested in this dog, please call the shelter at 614-879-8368 or fill out an online application at www.hsmcohio.org\n\nHSMC Adoption applications must be done at www.hsmcohio.org  Please do NOT click on the \"Adopt Me\" button on this bio.

I haven't had the greatest life, but I'm now building confidence in people and myself. To help me continue to learn and grow, I think I need a doggy companion to help me out. I'm not especially fond of kitties. To tell the truth, they kind of scare me. I enjoy playing fetch and tug of war. I would prefer my forever home have older children as younger ones make me nervous. I'm sure, with the right family, I will shed my introvert self and flourish into an amazing companion for you. I am house and crate trained, and walk on a leash. I am spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, and tested heartworm negative. I would like an active family that can exercise me and is not gone long hours. I can get bored and destructive if I'm left home alone or in a crate for long hours. My adoption fee is $200 in greater Houston area or $550 (includes adoption fee, health certificate, and transport fee) out of state. Fill out an app at www.soca-fbc.org/adoptables.",

He's full of energy and would dearly love being a part of an active home! He LOVES everyone he meets and is great with other dogs; however, being young and a bigger boy (40lbs) so he needs kids that are teens. Dexter loves to play and he uses the doggie door to zip outside where he loves running in the big yard! Dexter absolutely needs a yard and someone to keep him exercised! Dog friends are welcome but needs a bigger dog to hang out with, he runs over the little ones! With love, patience and guidance, he'll grow into a wonderful best friend and companion for some lucky person or family! He's learning to play ball and is seriously looking for someone to practice with. Could that be you?\nIf you're searching for a fun boy to enjoy life's adventures with, please submit an adoption application for Dexter! He promises life will never be dull and he's anxiously waiting to be your devoted shadow!",

            "description": "German Shepherd Mix 3 years Female Medium 50lbs We found Hema on the side of the road bleeding profusely from his right nostril and took her to two different vets since the first one could not get the bleeding to stop. He stayed at the vet for 3 days while they tried to figure out why she would not stop bleeding. The bleeding was stopped. She was very skinny, and in poor nutritional health so felt this maybe the problem. She has been with us for several years and her nose bleeds if there is hot weather and if she is in direct sun light. She is a special needs dog because of this. She may have a genetic disorder. Von Willebrand's disease. She is best for a home with no kids and no other pets. Hema does have shedding issues due to some skin problems that require daily care. She is not good with strangers and barks excessively if she hears people coming around. Hema can be destructive with household items so its best not to leave her unattended. She also likes to dig and jump fences so you need to have a large high fence. Hema can have separation anxiety as well if left alone too long. She also may have accidents in the home so she has to be watched to be taken outside to go to the bathroom.We do not have a central location to see our dogs. Meeting any dog is by appointment ONLY currently. Appointments can be set up to meet any dog in San Diego. Currently we are unable to do any out-of-state adoptions.\n\nIf you are interested in a particular dog please FILL OUT an Adoption Application at our website @ http://bajadogrescue.org/ready-to-adopt/adopt and we can schedule you for an appointment to meet with a particular dog if it is available. We do require an application if you are interested in adoption. If you are interested in potentially adopting please fill out an application at http://bajadogrescue.org/ready-to-adopt/adopt. Your application will be reviewed and you will be placed on a waiting list for the dog(s). If your name comes up on the waiting list(s) we will contact you. You can see the dogs we have available for adoption on our website at http://bajadogrescue.org/shelter-dogs/\n\nPlease check out our FAQ's page at http://bajadogrescue.org/faqs/.\n\nQuestions?

Fideo was laying in a corner in a pool of blood when we spotted him. Judging from the bag leg wound, he had probably been hit by a motorcycle. Fideo is best in a home with no animals or children. At the same time he is very vigilant. He does bark a lot and and can be hyper aware of his surroundings. The leg wound has healed, but Fideo is still recovering from mange (skin disease which is not contagious for humans). He does medical issues that require daily care. Fideo has some bladder issues as well and can have accidents in the home. If he gets to worked up he does go to the bathroom.

            "description": "Lupa is very energetic little girl. She is about 3 years old and is a wired hair terrier mix. She does like bark a lot and needs a lot of space to run around and play. She is not good with other dogs or with other animals in the home. Lupa can be aggressive with strangers at times. She needs a lot of supervision as she can be destructive to household items and has seperation anxiety as well. Lupa has trouble with one of her eyes and may require daily cleaning of her eyes.We do not have a central location to see our dogs. Meeting any dog is by appointment ONLY currently. Appointments can be set up to meet any dog in San Diego. Currently we are unable to do any out-of-state adoptions.\n\nIf you are interested in a particular dog please FILL OUT an Adoption Application at our website @ http://bajadogrescue.org/ready-to-adopt/adopt and we can schedule you for an appointment to meet with a particular dog if it is available.

Maya is good with people and kids but not with other dogs and should be the only dog in the home. \n\nMaya is housebroken, crate trained and very obedient.  She is quiet and loves sitting by the window and watching the world go by.  She takes treats gently and will give you her little paw. \n\nMaya knows the following commands: Sit, Drop and Come.\n\nShe is looking sad these days since being returned to the shelter after being in a foster home and really needs a loving home as soon as possible.\n\nYou will fall in love with this precious girl.\n\nEmail:  petsandvetsusa@gmail.com",

She can be very loving with certain individuals but does not like strange females as all. She has a fun black white and brown spotted coat. Her little tail always wags when she is happy. She is a very loud barker but is able to be calm in the mornings but can bark at night a lot. She has been fixed and is up to date on all vaccines.We do not have a central location to see our dogs.

            "description": "Meet AJ\nAJ is a happy hound. He was rescued from Animal Control, with his companion Mindy. They arrived at our shelter on April 1, 2020. \nAJ is a wonderful older dog. He\u2019s a seven-year-old hound/shepherd mix. He\u2019s a larger dog, but he moves gracefully and calmly so don\u2019t let his size fool you.  He has beautiful manners. He\u2019s calm, sweet and very friendly. He\u2019s a lower energy sort of guy and prefers to relax with his people and his best friend Mindy. AJ walks well on a leash and he knows basic commands. AJ is happy to go along to get along. He\u2019s just a big love bug who will make for someone\u2019s best companion. He\u2019s very low-key, but loves to see what Mindy is up to and happily follows her around.  AJ and Mindy are a bonded pair and must be adopted together. The way they depend on each other, it\u2019s like a seamless ballet. Each dog brings out the best in the other and together they are probably less effort then having one dog, because they complement each other so well. They\u2019re recent arrivals and we have yet to test them with other dogs or cats, but will do so for potential adopters. Our guess is they could be house-trained, because they are so polite and smart, but it may take some remedial training since they have been without a home for a little while now. \nAJ is exceptional. He seems to be the quintessential family dog. It\u2019s crazy to think he and Mindy ended up homeless. We have no idea of their back story, but they are a delightful pair who would make for a great addition to any family willing to open their hearts and home to them. \nAJ is neutered, fully vetted and micro-chipped. \nCall 706-865-4135 for information on additional health services provided as part of the adoption fee.  If interested in one of our puppies or dogs, please submit an application online or at the shelter. Applications can be submitted online at: https://www.charlessmithgallhumanesociety.org/page/dog-adoption-application \nOnce an application is submitted online, you will receive an email saying your application has been successfully submitted.  If you don\u2019t receive this email within 24 hours, please check to make sure all application fields were completed or please call our shelter at 706-865-4135. All adopters must complete an approval process which involves a reference check with current/recent vet and a brief home visit if located in the immediate area. We do permit out of state adoptions. Adopters MUST come to the shelter to transport their new family member home. We do not ship nor do we transport them to their new homes. Adoption policies and application procedures are detailed at the shelter website: http://smithgallhumanesociety.org/ under tab All Adoptable Animals.\nCharles Smithgall Humane Society (CSHS) is a No kill shelter.

She and her mate AJ were rescued from Animal Control and came to our shelter on April 1, 2020.\nMindy is an Australian Cattle dog mix. She\u2019s about five years old and of medium size. Mindy celebrates her herding roots and has good energy. She loves sitting on your feet and makes a game of getting you to go where she wants to go. She definitely likes to work and keep busy, but her energy is not overwhelming. Given she\u2019s five years old, she is more mature and seems pretty happy-go-lucky. She is very smart and knows some commands. She is leash shy, but does okay once the lead is slipped on. She loves ear scratches and she\u2019ll vocally tell you how much she appreciates the attention and how good the scratches feel. She has a beautiful red and white coat and her eyes reflect her intelligence. Like, AJ, we haven\u2019t tested her with other dogs or cats, but will do so for potential adopters. \nShe and AJ are a bonded pair and must be adopted together. Mindy relies on AJ for comfort and security and AJ loves to be where Mindy is. Adopting this pair may be easier than having an only dog. They complement each other and their interactions are seamless. They love being with people and welcome attention, but they are also content to relax and explore the yard together. They are a delightful pair, who will be no more work than if adopting just one dog. \nWe do not know Mindy\u2019s and AJ\u2019s backstory, but they are polite and may even be house-trained given how mature they are and how well they act. Not sure how they found themselves at Animal Control, but we\u2019ll do everything we can to find them a perfect home and give them a second chance at a happy and secure life. Mindy is a little gem and AJ is a wonderful companion. \nMindy is spayed, fully-vetted and micro-chipped.\nCall 706-865-4135 for information on additional health services provided as part of the adoption fee.

            "description": "Adeline is a 2 year old beagle that has special needs. She was surrendered to us in early 2020 when she developed hind end paralysis. Addy, as we call her, has shown immensely improved ability to stand and walk since she came to us, though she will likely never have a truly normal gait; she no longer requires a wheelchair to get around. She is currently being fostered by All Breed Grooming, Boarding and Daycare; she loves other dogs! Addy will do best in a home without children. Addy bonds hard with her people and does those excited beagle bays when she sees a familiar face! Adeline\u2019s ideal home would be with someone who is retired or works from home; once you get a routine established, her care is really not that time consuming. Adoption applications are at ITVrescue.org.\n\nAll of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heartworm tested and treated if necessary.\n\nPlease realize that many of our animals are kept in foster homes. Please complete an adoption application at http://itvrescue.org/adoption-application/ in order to meet with one of our animals. There is no obligation in completing the application, but it helps us find an animal that is most appropriate for your family.  The ITV Rescue Center is open Tuesdays 12-5; Wednesdays 12-7; Thursdays 12-5; Fridays 12-5 and Saturdays 10-5.  The Rescue Center is located at 1417 N. Stockwell Road.  You are welcome to come to our rescue center during open hours to see all of our great adoptable animals. Thank you for your interest in our animals!\n\nNOTE: Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

Before coming to us, Glory's life was one of suffering and severe neglect. Now, thanks to the dedication of an amazing foster Mom, Glory is learning how to be part of a family. Glory's ideal forever family will be patience, loving and understanding when first getting to know her. They should understand that Glory is a creature habit and does best with a daily routine, also that she is a home body who enjoys snuggling in her favorite chair. Glory has learned to really enjoy spending time with her people and her foster mom says she's a great listener and most of all she's incredibly loyal. Glory is potty trained, crate trained, and walks great on a leash. We also believe Glory will do best in a home with no other pets....and honestly we think she deserves to be the only recipient of all your love!\n\nGlory is a 2-3 year old, 35 pound Terrier mix. She is up to date on vaccinations, spayed, microchipped and she is on monthly heartworm prevention.\n\nIf you would like to adopt, please fill out our application!\ntinyurl.com/thirdcoastapplication\n\nMobile, Alabama",

            "description": "PLEASE NOTE,DURING THIS PANDEMIC/SHUT DOWN- We have been swamped with applications, inquiries and phone calls.  It's been impossible to even keep up with responding to everyone as we would not get anything done considering the overwhelming numbers of people reaching out about all our rescues. \n\nWe can no longer answer phone calls or inquiries because, by the time\nyou INQUIRE  if a pup is available, we have had at least 3-6 APPLICATIONS.  The dog is gone before you can even then fill out an application.  \n\nAs volunteers in rescue, it is all we can do to keep up with responding to multiple applications.  Interested parties should fill out an application.\n\nThe shelter listed our boy as \"Pup\" and guessed him to be around 5 years old. His last day plea and his sweet face caught our attention and it didn't take more than that for us to reach out and say.....Diamond Dogs Rescue will Take him!  Since our rescue, he was fully vetted, neutered, microchipped and made ready to find his family.  Pup is medium sized weighing around 50lbs\n\nCurrently being fostered in New England he lives with two adopted Diamond Dogs and does very well with them.  However, we have learned that proper introductions are important and that a dog that matches his energy level is best suited.  He is dog selective.\n\nPup has herding instincts so he would do best in a home familiar with those breeds.  Your experience in handling will make such a difference in how well this dog fits into your home.    Due to his visual impairment, we recommend a home with no kiddies, kitties or other small critters. He loves to play with some other dogs,  to be outside (fenced in yard best), being brushed and curling up at the foot of the bed at the end of the day. \n\nNote on herding dogs- they show remarkable intelligence, agility and energy. As working dogs, they thrive on activity and sense of purpose. Some of the breeds in this group make excellent family pets, but families need to be cautious of heel-nipping varieties who might try to herd the little ones.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Pup, you can fill out the online application by going to:\nhttps://www.123formbuilder.com/form-2521188/",

She is a very sweet 4 year old Pit mix. Tempest is definitely on the smaller side, and only weighs about 40 lbs. \n\nTempest came to us locally. She was placed on a euthanasia list because she couldn't handle being crated constantly. She would get so excited when someone would meet her, and would jump and run around (we don't blame her). We placed her into a foster home and she does very well. She loves to play, and definitely has puppy energy. She is potty trained, and crate trained. She gets nervous in smaller (her size) crates, but is just fine in extra large ones. \nTempest is a little shy when meeting new people, but warms up very quickly and her tail never stops wagging. She knows basic commands, but can definitely use continued training. She is VERY smart and just wants to make you happy. Tempest does well with children, but older children who can play with her and handle her constantly wagging tail are needed. Tempest cannot be in a home with other animals. \n\nTempest needs just a few things in order to be successful in her forever home. \nShe needs:\n-Training and consistency \n- To be the ONLY pet\n- A fenced in yard or to live in the country with  lots of room to run and play\n- Someone to snuggle with\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this beautiful girl, please go to luckypawsmidwest.org and fill out the adoption application on our website.\nHelp us find Tempest her forever home!! ?\n\nTempest is vaccinated for rabies, distemper, and bordatella. Tempest is spayed and is microchipped. Tempest's adoption fee is $350 plus WI state tax!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Tempest, please fill out an application at luckypawsmidwest.org. Once your application is approved, we can set up a time for you to meet Tempest!\n\nLucky Paws Midwest is licensed and inspected by the State of Wisconsin: 402655-DS",

My family would need experience with mastiffs. Also no kids, unless older than 15, at this time because they move fast, look funny and scare me.\n\nAdoption fee is $250.

Meatloaf, Big Bubba, Baked Potato, Beefcake, Big Hunk, Smoosh. As long as you have a treat in hand, I'll answer to anything! I've been told I need to lose a few pounds, so I enjoy going on several short walks every day. The only thing I love more than food are toys! I love to take all my stuffies and put them in a big pile and roll around in them. I take my food and toys very seriously, so it would be best if I lived in a home with older kids. I would also need to be the only animal in the home, a big loverboy like me is all you need. Please call the Humane Society of North Iowa at 641-423-6241 for more information.\n\nAdoption fee covers the following veterinarian\u00a0services: spay/neuter surgery, age appropriate\u00a0vaccinations, flea and dewormer treatment, feline leukemia/FIV test in cats, and heartworm test for dogs.",

            "description": "Shakira came to us as a stray and is around 3 years old. She received her name because we were so overflowing with dogs at the moment that we had to stick her in the dropbox and she proceeded to howl/sing in a cackle that made everyone laugh.\n\nShe LOVES people. She is also extremely energetic and loves toys. Sadly, she has been here so long that when you go to walk her, she will also pull on the leash trying to tug you with her to go faster. She sits patiently in her kennel and looks depressed at you to guilt trip you (she is extremely intelligent and manipulative lol).\n\nShe started off very dog aggressive. However, we have put her in one of our yards and another friendly one in another yard and she has done nothing, but wag her tail and run the fence line with them. I think previously, she was likely never exposed to other dogs. She is likely going to be dog selective just based on that from what we have seen from her.\n\nWe have put her behind the counter some at work. She does really well when you are with her, but if she is left alone, she will chew anything and everything. And I mean anything. I think that is because she was bored. We have also cratetrained her in the hallway near the counter. She will whine, cry, and bark to be with us when she knows we are around while she is crated. I think that would sort itself out pretty easy, but she needs someone who is patient.\n\nI am not saying all this to dissuade anyone from adopting her. I am being upfront so the right person can be prepared, because she is truly a wonderful dog. A lot of these neurotic tendencies sort themselves out away from the shelter. The best adopter for her is going to be someone who wants a really energetic dog to take running or hiking, that has no other animals (another dog in the home could be possible also), no cats, and does not have small children. I do not think she would be aggressive to children in any way so do not be alarmed with that, but I would be cautious that she would knock them over when she gets rambunctious. Older children that are probably 7/8 years old or up should be no issue.\n\nShe is going to be extremely attentive, loving, smart/trainable, and perfect for the right person. Sadly, I think she was dumped out on purpose because of her energy level and no one wanting to train her. \n\nShe requires a home visit to adopt.",

Therefore, we are seeking a very specific home for her so she can be the best girl she can be! We are looking for a very active adopter for her, where someone is home all day. She would do best in a home as the only dog or a well balanced male dog. We will not adopt her out into an apartment or condo setting. This girl needs a yard to play in, and a family, couple, or single person that will take her running or hiking daily. Maizee's adopter must have experience training high energy herding dogs or similar breeds. \n\nLike all our dogs Maizee is spayed, micro chipped and fully vaccinated. Her adoption fee is $300. .If you would like to meet this sweet girl, please fill out an  application on our homepapge www.lucky dogrescue.org",

His name is Ryder and he's 90 lbs., neutered, microchipped, up-to-date on vaccines and heartworm NEGATIVE! He was a former guardian of the goats but he has quickly adapted to lounging on the couch in his foster home! Ryder will be adopted as an inside dog. Good vet history, a fenced yard, and a home visit is preferred for approval. Fee: $175. Apply online: secondchancedogrescuela.org/adopt-a-dog-2/adoption-application/.

We later found out that this was Pricillas fourth litter and that none of her prior puppies survived. Soon after her arrival, she had 13 puppies! All of Pricllia's puppies have found their happy tails and Pricilla is now ready to find a home of her own.\n\nPricilla has done well when being introduced to other dogs but she can be a little selective as she can be a little protective of her family (she adores children.) Pricilla hasn't been cat tested at this time.\n\nAmazing Grace Bully Rescue is a foster based rescue in the Pensacola, Florida area. We do not have a physical building. If you would like to meet any of our pups, the first step is to fill out our online application so we can contact you.\n\nOur adoption fee for Pricilla is $150 and includes her spay, current shots, rabies vaccine, and a registered microchip.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this Amazing dog, please fill out our online adoption application at www.amazinggracebullyrescue.org\n\nIf you have any questions, please text your question to 723-2037. You may also send a message to our Amazing Grace Bully Rescue Page on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or send an email directly to amazinggracebullyrescue@gmail.com\n\nDisclaimer: We are located in the Pensacola, Florida area and will consider local applicants first, especially with puppies since we use a vet in the local area.",

Please EMAIL apassionforpaws@gmail.com and wait for confirmation of your appointment before coming to visit the Akita Ranch. We also request that visitors wear masks.\n\nBuckley was abandoned at the shelter as a \"stray\" by people who brought him in on a leash. Buckley was growly and protective and didn't want anyone to touch or approach him. After assessing his in-shelter behavior, we decided he needed a chance to demonstrate what his \"real\" personality was since most humans don't behave very well when they're locked up either! In the beginning we had to go slowly with Buckley and earn his trust. Then soon after he came alive during his stay and has shown us he is a big teddy bear!! He loves affection and wants to play! He has a really fun, goofy side and just needed a safe place to show who he really is! We think he will do best in an adult only home with no children or cats. Meet Buckley today!\n\nEmail: apassionforpaws@gmail.com for adoption information\n\nVisit Akita Ranch 28930 Ellis Ave, Romoland, CA, Open 10-5 daily BY APPOINTMENT ONLY.

Georgie can get along with low key dogs after VERY slow & managed introductions, but she doesn\u2019t make fast friends. Georgie is crate trained, walks well on a leash and is almost completely housebroken.  She adores playing with kong toys and nylabones and will entertain herself for hours!!  Georgie would be best suited to an adult only family with a low key male dog or no dogs (no cats for Georgie either).  If you are looking for a lovable, charming, silly, fun companion, than Georgie is the girl for you!!!\n\nGeorgie is spayed, fully vaccinated & microchipped.  Please email kim@barkvilledogrescue.org with any questions regarding Georgie!  If you would like to adopt sweet Georgie, please submit an adoption application for her at https://www.barkvilledogrescue.org/applications.",

She is ready to be your adventure buddy and explore the PNW with you! \n\nShe weighs around 40-45 lbs, and though she is petite, she will need a strong leader both physically and mentally.  She is sweet and independent yet eager to please and has responded well to treat training.\n\nREQUIREMENTS TO ADOPT:\n- Bully experienced home\n- Must be the only dog in the home\n- Fenced yard\n- Kids 10+ (she will knock down smaller children accidentally)\n- No cats or other small critters\n\nAs is typical with most Bull Terriers, Atia is strong yet silly and exhibits traits such as stubbornness and bursts of spunky energy.  She is a goofy gal who loves to go and would make an excellent hiking or jogging buddy.  \n\nWhile Atia must be the only dog in a home, she does fine on leash with other dogs in situations such as hiking or going for walks, but cannot be in nose to nose proximity.\n\nAtia is spayed, UTD on shots and microchipped. Her adoption fee is $450.",

If you think Mario could fit into your home, and be your one and only pet love, please submit an application on our website. He will make an awesome companion for the right person. He knows you are out there, you just haven't found him yet!\n\nAll animals are spayed/neutered and up to date on vaccinations before going home!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting me or want further information, please contact the shelter via email, or phone, or stop by for a visit.\n\nWe are at the Petsmart store in Avon, IN every Saturday from 11am-3pm if that would be closer for you to meet this dog.  Please contact us, to see if the dog you are interested in would be a good dog to send to Petsmart! (Not all are)  Thank you for looking at a shelter dog to adopt!\n\nAs part of the COVID-19 procedures, PetSmart and OCHS have had to cancel Saturday adoption events, until restrictions have been lifted.

This precious little lemon was found running at large in Georgia in early March, scarred up, light heartworm positive and extremely underweight. She sat unclaimed for weeks, and now she is SAFE! Bird Bird is currently 39 lbs - her target weight would be closer to 45 lbs. She has not been treated very nicely and must have had some poor outdoor living conditions based on the old scars on her legs. Birdie has had her treatment for heartworms and she is doing great!\n\nBirdie can be shy meeting new people, but once she has been introduced to new friends, she is puppylike in her behaviors, following people around and wanting to stick close. Birdie loves being indoor dog, and she loves to explore the yard with her foster family as well. Birdie startles at loud noises, so a fenced yard would be safest for her. Birdie is good in cars, and calmly watches the world go by during car rides.\n\nBirdie is good with cats and most dogs. She has learned to play with other pointers in her foster home. Birdie would LOVE to have someone home a lot with her, or to be able to go to work with her family. We can't wait to see what her future looks like, this little lemonhead with an underbite is SO cute!\n\nWant to learn more about one of the dogs we have up for adoption?

He's a 10 year old super sweet velcro dog. This dude is up for doing anything and everything you wanna do as long as he gets to participate!  His favorite activities right now are hanging out in a chair with his tennis ball and going for walks.  He loves tennis balls but doesn't like to share them with other dogs. While on your walk if you happen to drop the leash, don't worry, he has amazing recall and will be back by your side in no time.  When its bed time he's more than willing to crawl into your bed and snuggle, but is also content sleeping on his own bed if you insist. Blake is house broken and likes using a doggy door. Blake isn't a fan of smaller dogs, but more submissive larger dogs seem to be ok after he becomes comfortable with his new place. He does not like crates and will destroy one if left in it. He does have some separation anxiety and does not like to be left alone at home, he currently does well when left home with his dog brother. He does like to get into the trashcan so that needs to be put up when you leave the house. He finished his heart worm treatment without any issues. He does have some arthritis. He would do best in a home where someone is home with him often and willing to take him on a walk most days. \n\nWant to learn more about one of the dogs we have up for adoption?

He enjoys playing fetch and going for walks/runs. He currently knows: sit, stay/wait, down, leave it. He is currently working on \"relax\" on his \"spot\". Tanner also has a sad side to him. He is nervous around new people, but everyone that has given him the time and patience is showered with affection. \nWe are looking for a foster-to-adopt situation with no other animals or children where he can grow into his new home and both he and his new person can learn about each other over time. He will need to continue his professional training and visits with his specialist vet. A home with a backyard is a must. His new person should be female as he warms up to women much faster. Must have some experience with dogs, preferably large dogs. Experience with rescue or fearful dogs is a huge plus. \nSo if you are a woman who lives alone with no other animals or children in a house with a backyard, has a big heart, experience with nervous dogs and is active, Tanner needs you!\n\nNote:  Not all animals attend every adoption event. Please contact us for more information on this dog.\nNote:  Adoption fee includes sales tax.",

Please EMAIL apassionforpaws@gmail.com and wait for confirmation of your appointment before coming to visit the Akita Ranch. We also request that visitors wear masks.\n\nMeet Jaxson today!! This handsome young man knows all his commands and takes treats gently. He is very intelligent and wanting to learn. Jaxson loves to go on short walks and long car rides. He is a happy, loyal companion. While most of the time he is content to just \"hang around,\" he does have a playful side and will even chase after a tennis ball! He is pretty nonchalant around other large female dogs, but isn't too thrilled with male dogs, or small yappy ones. Jaxson has completed many hours of training and is very well-behaved around his tribe. He is cautious of outsiders and can be protective of his family, but is accepting once slowly and properly introduced. He would be OK with 18 and older but no minors please. This guy is a big softy! Weighing 90lbs, he still likes to snuggle up on a couch or bed!!\n\nEmail: apassionforpaws@gmail.com for adoption information\n\nwww.apassionforpaws.org\nVisit Akita Ranch 28930 Ellis Ave, Romoland, CA, Open 10-5 daily BY APPOINTMENT ONLY.

With the proper introduction, I should be fine with other dogs, cats and respectful children. I am working on my house training.\n\nI have had my 1st Parvo/Distemper Combo vaccination and have been neutered, heartworm tested, microchipped and broken nail treated.",

STAR - A#44099880Pictures and Video: Star -- https://youtu.be/JbdfUo_zvKAIntake Type: (3/31) Owner surrenderBehavior Observation:(4/1) Per Staff -- Approached front of kennel, took treats from handler's hand and was easily leashed to exit. Pulled moderately on leash until urinated and defecated and then only pulled slightly. In run, initially explored but returned to handler for pets. Slightly stiff when initially touched but relaxed. Showed no interest in toys. Returned to kennel and removed leash easily.(3/31) Per Previous Owner -- protective, active, aggressive to strangers, hyperactive, playful, jumps on people, goes on walks, fine with owners niece before incident. **Owner emphasized that she is a very good dog, he just can't keep her since she bit his young niece and has now bitten his nephew**++Bite Details++Nephew was in the house, Star was coming in from the backyard. She knows the Nephew and has played with him before, but when she came in the house she ran right to him and bit him on the calf. Kevin was trying to get away but she kept going after him, biting multiple times. Level 3a - the dog bit his calf and then kept going after him, but since he was wearing pants he just got some very minor scratches. No medical attention needed. Prior Incident -- The owner's 10 y.o. niece was playing with the dog in the backyard. The dog jumped and bit the niece's arm, and latched on to her jacket. Level 2 bite, did not break skin. Seems like the dog was very over-aroused.This animal is currently available from foster care through ACCT Philly's Adoptions Programs. If the foster has not listed a personal email, contact adopt@acctphilly.org to be put in touch with the foster.We encourage you to visit our shelter during our adoption hours to view our complete selection of available animals.

She has a very huge personality and some quirks to her like snoring and grunting. She does love to cuddle up with her humans and makes a great snuggle buddy! Addison is very dog selective with big dogs and doesn't get along with little dogs or cats at all. Her perfect home would be as an only dog or another big dog that she gets to meet and see if she likes first. Addison is very people friendly and enjoys kids of all ages, just so long as they are taller than her so she doesn't knock them over when she's excited. If you think your home is the right one for this awesome girl, apply to adopt her today!

We have spent a lot of time with them the last couple of weeks and feel that it is in their best interest that we find them a home separately.  Jill and Jack were given up by their owner when he moved. Now it's time for them to find a loving home of their own.  Jill is affectionate, so we are looking for someone home most of the time to give her the attention she deserves. She loves to wade in a swimming pool.

The last time I updated you on her was before she had her first heart worm injection and she was not doing well at all just with the doxycycline she was given prior to treatment. With her fragile condition it was decided by the processors that it would be best for her to stay with me throughout her treatment. She made it through all her injections and treatment and she is finished with all medications as of 3 weeks ago. She is such an amazing little survivor and I am so incredibly proud of her!!! I have been giving her some time to adjust to being off all medications especially since she does not tolerate any medication well, and have been observing her in hopes of some improvements. Unfortunately, I do not think her incontinence is going to improve. She continues to have a very weak bladder and whenever she is up and walking around she has some leaking at least every 15 minutes or so as she is walking or moving. I have been trying to get her to adjust to being in diapers for the past 4 months and with her older age and being blind she does have balance issues and wearing the diaper seems to make her more off balance and she is very anxious. I have tried diapers of all different sizes. materials, and fit, but she does not really do too well with any of them. She does also have a collapsed trachea, but as long as she has quite a bit of room to move around and get into a comfortable position, she does well. She also needs to eat dry food only because she seems to gag and throw up on the consistency of canned food. She needs to eat two times a day or she gets very weak and lethargic, but mornings are very hard for her and she is a bit cranky and out of sorts, so morning feeding is hard since she needs to be coaxed and supervised as she eats which takes about 20 minutes or so to get all the food into her. She does much better with her evening meal and eats independently. She sleeps quite a bit throughout the day and does not really have any leaking or accidents, but once she is up for the first hour she has no bladder or bowel control and there is a lot of cleaning up after her required. Then the real bad accidents taper off some and the cleaning up is not as extensive. She likes attention after she has been awake for awhile and mostly likes to be held in someones arms as they are standing since she gets uncomfortable if not stretched out with her trachea. \n\n4/1/2020\n\nMillicent is a very sweet, loving, and gentle senior Pomeranian who is 12 years old. She is a tiny little one weighing just 6 pounds. She is blind, has a heart murmur, and heart worm disease. Even though Millicent is blind she is amazing and navigates around her foster home very well. She does like to have some extra space to move around in so she prefers a pen where there is more room rather than a crate. She stays very nicely in her pen and loves to take naps and relax. She also loves to snuggle in her foster mom's arms. She is house trained and walks nicely on a harness and leash, but likes to take short, slow walks because she does get tired easily. She lives with other small dogs and cats in her foster home and gets along with everyone. Because Millicent is quite fragile and small it is recommended that she live in a home with older children or only adults. \n\n\n\n\n  To begin the adoption process please, fill out our online application. Go to wagsrescue.com and click on adoption form.\nPlease call Susan @ 267-312-3372 if you have questions.",

Otherwise, you will NOT receive a response.  We are sorry, but please understand, we KNOW she's cute.  But something VERY bad happened to her.  She's been adopted and returned several times because of the biting, she's GREAT, but she WILL sometimes bite!  The times she mainly bites are when she's startled or, when she's having a harness put on her or taken off her.  She needs an ACTIVE home WITH ANOTHER DOG (this is a requirement because she gets along great with other dogs), and no children!  Bailey is available to LOCAL applicants only, you must live within a reasonable driving distance of Farmers Branch, TX, 75234.  Once you're approved to adopt Bailey, you will need to do the following:\n-Go to the dog park MULTIPLE times, where her current foster dad takes her daily, it\u2019s located in Farmers Branch\n-Interact with Bailey until Bailey is comfortable and allows you to touch her, which doesn\u2019t come easily or quickly.  Her foster dad has been taking her to the dog park for weeks - if not months now, and everybody there has tried to touch her, they\u2019ve been giving her treats etc and, while she will take the treats, she still will not let anyone touch her, and these are people that she sees daily!\n-Demonstrate the ability to take a harness off Bailey and put a harness on Bailey (these are some of the main times she tends to bite)\nOnce Bailey is comfortable enough with allowing you to do the aforementioned, we can proceed to a trial adoption.  We hope you understand but Bailey is a special needs case and getting to know her and be able to touch her is going to be a very slow process of building trust.  We are doing this for Bailey's well being.  Thank you.\n",

Otherwise, you will NOT receive a response.  We are sorry, but please understand, we KNOW she's cute.  But something VERY bad happened to her.  She's been adopted and returned several times because of the biting, she's GREAT, but she WILL sometimes bite!  The times she mainly bites are when she's startled or, when she's having a harness put on her or taken off her.  She needs an ACTIVE home WITH ANOTHER DOG (this is a requirement because she gets along great with other dogs), and no children!  Bailey is available to LOCAL applicants only, you must live within a reasonable driving distance of Farmers Branch, TX, 75234.  Once you're approved to adopt Bailey, you will need to do the following:\n-Go to the dog park MULTIPLE times, where her current foster dad takes her daily, it\u2019s located in Farmers Branch\n-Interact with Bailey until Bailey is comfortable and allows you to touch her, which doesn\u2019t come easily or quickly.  Her foster dad has been taking her to the dog park for weeks - if not months now, and everybody there has tried to touch her, they\u2019ve been giving her treats etc and, while she will take the treats, she still will not let anyone touch her, and these are people that she sees daily!\n-Demonstrate the ability to take a harness off Bailey and put a harness on Bailey (these are some of the main times she tends to bite)\nOnce Bailey is comfortable enough with allowing you to do the aforementioned, we can proceed to a trial adoption.  We hope you understand but Bailey is a special needs case and getting to know her and be able to touch her is going to be a very slow process of building trust.  We are doing this for Bailey's well being.  Thank you.\n",

He has an extensive repertoire of acts for his audience to enjoy, such as: sit, shake, climb the eight foot fence, stay, spin, ignore the electric fence's tickle and go on an adventure, speak, roll over, catch, jump and grab the frisbee, drop it, and dozens more unlearned talents.  As it goes, stardom can get pretty intense and sharing the spotlight is simply not an option.  Bentley does not care for other animals, nor does he wish to share his prized toys with anyone unless you have a very good trade.  At 3 years old, Bentley is fully grown at a hulking 65 pounds.  There isn't a toy or human in this world he doesn't like, so step right up and get your ticket to the greatest show on earth - starring Bentley!!

The first step will be to set up a virtual meeting with their current foster family via phone, zoom, or facetime, to provide you with more detailed information about the animal. Following that, if you feel like it could be a good adoption fit, shelter staff will help coordinate a socially-distanced meeting in person so that you can meet your potential family member up-close and personal. Thank you for your patience during this time. We really appreciate your support!\n\nOrla is a bundle of love. She loves everybody--people, dogs, even cats. She hasn't spent a ton of time around children while in our care, but the few instances where she did interact with them, she seemed mostly uninterested in them. She loves to snuggle and be the center of attention. At the dog park, she is delightfully social. Sometimes her play with other dogs can become rough, but when dogs correct her, she listens and backs off. She's a great off-leash hiking dog. Orla would love to live in a house with a yard. She loves to find a nice sunny spot and snooze. Her hobbies are snoozing, destroying stuffed animals, playing tug, playing with other doggies, snuggling, getting rubs, and eating bones. She doesn't need to be the only pet. We've worked with her on leash training, obedience, and separation anxiety. She has made plenty of progress in all areas, but she is charmingly stubborn and still has room to improve. Orla needs a family or person who can give her stable and predictable routines, Orla settles in quite comfortably. \n",

THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTION AND CONSIDERATION.\nPLEASE ALSO FOLLOW HIS FOSTER MOM ON INSTAGRAM BEFORE YOU APPLY. https://instagram.com/quirky.canines?igshid=85dxg1w8x3vc\nPlease read all his posts and reach out to his foster to under his behavior and issues before applying. Parker receives numerous inquiries but will need someone who understand dog behavior and are ready for a challenge.\nMeet Parker! Parker is a 5-6 year old, 18 lbs., shih tzu mix. He loves affection, being petted, and most of all he loves treats!\n\nParker was found at a park, hence the name Parker. He was extremely scared, matted and malnourished. After a few days of decompressing, he started to come out of his shell. He currently is scared of being picked up and we think that whomever must have owned him, never gave him affection. He is already crate trained, he loves it, He is slowly starting to jump on his fosters lap and enjoying the affection. He would be ideal in a home with older children and other friendly dogs. We believe he would be just fine with cats. He does enjoy car rides and walks.\n\nNote from his Foster:\n\nParker does love cuddles and once he trusts you, he loves being petted. He uses doggy stairs to go into bed to snuggle. Parker loves and greets everyone but he does attach to one person in the household stronger. As he feels better and comes out of his shell, you'll find Parker playing with toys and running around with you. He walks extremely well on a leash and will follow you wherever you go. Food is the quickest way to his heart. He is all smiles and will even give a playful grumble to get his meals or treats quicker. Parker isn't looking for playmates, he'd prefer to be the apple of your eye. He's be fine with older animals, quick movements make him nervous, and he does get jealous. He has learned to sit and be petted before his meals and he goes to the door to be let out. We love Parker and he is a great dog but he has challenges that most people may not be prepared to handle. He has issues being picked up or petted too quickly, especially around his face lower back areas. He will show his teeth and sometimes bite. We emphasize this because it is an issue. We believe he was abused but on top of that he has pain issues. He has done better with pain meds and they will be a necessity. But he will need a patient adopter that can understand he can and most likely will be challenging.\n\nPlease follow Parker on his fosters IG at @quirky.canines and there you will see all his posts. You can find our adoption application at https://muttsandrunts.org/adoption/ Our adoption fee is $150-350 depending on the age of the dog and includes vetting, spay/neuter, updated vaccines, microchip & registration, and current flea/tick treatment. Our fee does not include cost of transportation.",

            "description": "Hi my name is Tommy.\nI'm looking for a confident companion, who lives where the wild things grow. (I prefer no neighbors.) I want to be able to adventure through the woods and roll in fields. I'm a home body, who wouldn't enjoy socializing around town. Even visitors may make me nervous, so I'd like to go lay down when they come over at least until I know they are friendly.  \nBut! I promise to be the bestest friend as long as you will guide me with confidence, patience, & love. I may not be that cute little puppy, but sometimes I play like I'm still little and I am definitely cuuute! I love to cuddle, and love nibble on my humans fingers. And also smother them with all my weight in love.. The staff say I have eyes that can read humans like a book! And I'm sometimes too smart for my own good. I have a few tricks up my sleeve like sit and shake and sometimes lay down. I haven't spent much time with small kiddos, so I think I'd rather live with big ones right now. I havent met alot of dogs, but I have a girlfriend here & we make out through the kennel. (Shh I'm not supposed to kiss and tell.) If you think you have what it takes for this special boy, don't wait another moment! He needs you! \nwww.marshmallowfoundation.org\n\nArrived: 6/24/20 Vaccinations are current, neutered and dewormed. \n\nHi everyone! My name is Tommy and I\u2019m looking for a family to call my own! I arrived at the shelter after my older person could no longer care for me. Before arriving at the shelter, I spent a lot of time outside so I am learning all kinds of new things about being an indoor pet. The nice people here call me a quick and eager learner that glows with praise and encouragement! I\u2019ve even shown good potty training habits!  I\u2019ve worked a little with basic commands like sit, stay, heel, come and down and did pretty well for a beginner! \n\nMy ideal home would be an experienced dog person or persons with a yard for me to play in, preferably fenced, perhaps with another dog to help show me the ropes and grow my confidence.  Once I am comfortable, I love my people and routine and will seek out attention whenever possible.  Older kids would be ok as long as they were active participants in my training and growth. Once I learn about life as an indoor pet, I am sure I will LOVE them to pieces! \nVisitors to the shelter are by appointment only and after an application has been submitted online: \nAdoption Application:    http://www.marshmallowfoundation.org/info/adoption\nVolunteer Application:    http://www.marshmallowfoundation.org/info/display\nDonate:    http://www.marshmallowfoundation.org/info/display?PageID=16147",

            "description": "Zoey is a beautiful young sable German Shepherd female estimated around 1 year of age. Zoey was a stray and we unfortunately do not know her history but Zoey is happily looking forward to having a family of her own.\n\nZoey is a playful and rambunctious young girl. Her favorite activities include playing in muddy ponds, getting all the love, and inappropriately barking at unknown dogs and people. Zoey is learning how to navigate the world and make new human friends. While Zoey can be a very friendly and social girl she is at a critical point in her life known as the 'fear period' and can struggle with reactivity when meeting new people. It is extremely important that Zoey have a confident, experienced, handler that can compassionately guide her through the safe socialization she needs in order to learn how to navigate the world kindly. Zoey is very much a puppy and while eager to please she is still figuring out what is expected of her and how to rise to those expectations. Zoey has been great meeting volunteers with the guidance of her foster home and with those she knows is a very loving, playful girl. She has enjoyed going on hikes around private property and exploring ponds and mud puddles. Zoey is an active and athletic girl who is going to require ongoing exercise and structure to ensure her growth into a well rounded adult Shepherd. Zoey would be a great running companion, hiking buddy, and would likely excel in a number of dog sports. Zoey is NOT suitable for a home with children at this time.\n\nZoey is still figuring out other dogs and how to interact in a polite manner. Zoey can be very vocal when she meets new dogs and was defensive with other dogs when she arrived at her foster home. She has since settled in and is able to enjoy playgroups with other young Shepherds as well as group hikes. Zoey is slowly figuring out that she can play appropriately and doing a great job. Zoey will require ongoing structured socialization and guidance to maintain her progress as she is at an age of development where her socialization both in and out of the house is vital. Zoey is NOT friendly with cats or small dogs as she has shown a very high prey drive with both.\n\nZoey is a young, eager to please, and outgoing Shepherd who is searching for an active, loving, and adventurous home to give her the guidance and love she needs to grow into an even more wonderful companion. If you're the home for Zoey please email Tierhavenrescue@gmail.com for an adoption application or visit tierhaven.rescuegroups.org for FAQs",

            "description": "Buddy O'Pal is a German Shepherd, with a birthdate of March 2013. Buddy does have some trust issues so will need to meet his adopter a couple times prior to adoption. Buddy loves country living and would love a large yard to play in. No cats tho. \n\nBuddy is very smart and very loyal once he gets to know you. Due to his trust issues, there should be no children in the home.\n\nBuddy was recently attacked by another dog so is a bit fearful of other dogs. So Buddy will need to have a slow intro with any other dogs in the home.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Buddy O'Pal is $200. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process.

Located at ACCT Philly, 111 W Hunting Park Avenue, Philadelphia PA !!!Bentley A44055366Intake Type: (3/20) Owner/ Guardian Surrender -- Bite HistoryDog Meets:Bentley and Lexx: https://youtu.be/F7wa_7_6aM8Bentley and Peanut: https://youtu.be/DiVysXhGw7IVideo:Bentley Catches Treats!: https://youtu.be/lyZChySKD20Bentley having fun in the play yard: https://youtu.be/6s-RhnPU0doMedical Observation:(4/5) Vet Check -- Adult male neutered pittie with multiple bite history per owner surrender notes. Being treated for URI and now has reportedly decreased appetite in kennels that may be related to URI, medication, stress or combination of all three. URI is showing improvement with medication and no evidence of medical decline, but if he is not taking his meds not safe to directly pill. Will treat supportively and monitor appetite etc. Currently on trazodone for behavior and should monitor for behavioral decline.(3/21) PE: Apparently HealthyBehavior Observation:(4/10) Evaluation -- Aroused in kennel and attempts to push past handler when being leashed up to exit. Pulls extremely hard while walking and is prone to sudden \"yanks\" on the end of the leash. Allows handling of the head, back, and buttocks but overall, very aroused and mostly uninterested in handling at this time. Engages in tag/chase games in short spurts before being distracted with environment (birds, visitors, cars in street, etc). Will chase a ball but quickly lose interest, and will drop a ball for another to be thrown.(4/5) Per Vet Staff -- not interested in interacting with handlers, dilated pupils and some aversive behavior - turns away from people, trying to back up and move into corners, some thrashing when muzzled for exam and treatments. Not overtly aggressive or trying to bite.(3/26) Per Staff -- Nervous in kennel. Dodged leash but exited easily. Zig-zags and pulls heavily on leash. Avoided all handling in run. Pacing, heavy panting. Hesitant to return to kennel. Immediately retreated once returned, and would not allow leash to be removed.(3/22) Per Staff -- When assessor approaches on morning walkthrough, Bentley is at front of kennel growling and whale eyed. Will not accept treats.(3/20) Per Previous Owner -- protective, active, aggressive with strangers, playful, jumps on people, very selective with people he likes. Always fine with owners children but not with other children. Affectionate, listens, playful. Pulls a little on leash. Knows sit, paw, lay down. +Bite Details+Owner's daughter was playing with dog on the couch. Dog pulled a blanket off of daughter, daughter went to grab blanket back, and then dog bit \"nipped\" daughter's top right face cheek. Dog knew he did something wrong, owner said dog was scared after the bite. Level 3, drew blood, owner did take her daughter a clinic and they gave the daughter antibiotics. Dog is up to date on vaccines, according to owner who took the dog to vet about 6 months ago for shots.This animal may be available through ACCT Philly's Adoption Program.

Danny takes a while to feel comfortable with people touching him and specially when cleaning his eyes and face.\nAt around 13 years old, he has some vision impairment and is mostly deaf. He is housebroken, and gets along well after a few days intros with his foster mom's dogs and cats, but mostly ignores them. Because of his age, we recommend adults only in the home. He needs a little time to get comfortable in his new surroundings. He's not a tiny boy, weighing in at 23 pounds. Emphasis will be placed on an adopter who can easily pick up a dog his size. Do you have the caring heart to give this senior boy the special loving home he deserves?",

            "description": "Oh Jeffrey, or Jeff as his friends call him. Goofy, sweet , silly , charming (when he wants to be) and of course handsome. Just Around 1 years old Jeff is basically an overgrown puppy with no manners. \n\nAs sweet and handsome as this goofy boy is, Jeff sometimes struggles with meeting new people. More specifically he struggles meeting them on leash. He also has a harder time meeting some men vs. women. Though \u201cleash reactive\u201d as we call it, we have been working with Jeff to help him safely interact with new friends while on leash. We have also been working on some Muzzle training with Jeff. It\u2019s safe for every dog to be comfortable in a muzzle to protect them, as well as others. Though he has shown improvement in many areas he still has much to work on. Any adopter should be prepared to work on training with Jeff. \n\nBecause of his weird quirks we do not feel Jeff would do well in a home with kids under the age of 16.  We do feel Jeff would do best in a home that can provide him structure and routine that can help him succeed to be the best dog we know he can be. \n\nThought he has quirks Jeff has many great things about him. Once Jeff is comfortable with you he has no problem giving you a few sloppy kisses. He likes to give hugs too, but we are teaching Jeff that he doesn\u2019t get attention when jumping up on people. Right now we ask him to sit and then he gets his beloved head and butt scratches. He sometimes thinks he\u2019s part cat when he tries to rub all over you for more. \n\nJeff also does really well with other dogs who match his goofy play style. He really wouldn\u2019t mind a confident brother or sister that could show him the ropes. But he would do well without one also as long as his new family understands he will need exercise and structure in his daily routine. \n\nOh and car rides, Jeff loves them. Especially if they end in a hike where he can explore all the smells and sounds around him. Also, though he may protest sometimes, Jeff does very well in a crate here at the rescue, and goes right in for staff when asked. \n\nIf you think Jeff would be a good addition to your family, please fill an application out at dogtownrescue.org Jeff is up to date on vaccinations, neutered and microchipped.",

            "description": "Charlie is an amazing dog who has unfortunately had her world turned upside down.  She was with her family for her entire life and then they dumped her at the shelter stating she was reactive coming out of her crate but they also indicated she was crated A LOT! Since she has been with us we know this: she handles all touching (even nails and cleaning her ears!), can be left not crated and sleeps all night, she is great on walks but gets vocal when she sees other dogs, she loves her people hard so you have to be ok with her laying on top of you and lots of kisses.\n\nCharlie is an anxious dogs in new situations and therefore needs time and a routine.  If you are interested please complete our adoption application on our website.  We would do multiple meets as she literally does not act like herself at first! We are also a very different kind of rescue - our dogs and their adopters become family so with a dog like Charlie that needs a little extra support we would sponsor training and overall would slowly transition her.  Charlie is ok with dogs she knows but will need to be the only pet also!\n\nLooking for a pretty gal that will brighten up your day? Then contact us at Paw It 4ward at adopt@pi4w.com",

With one volunteer available to review all applications, we ask for your patience waiting for an email response. While we are closed to the public, we will only be responding to pet inquiries that accompany an application. Adoption appointments are scheduled first come with approved application, first served. (See our adoption procedures below.)\n\nNot only does Joyce own the dress, she can model it! This smart young lady knows so much. Joyce is petite with a big personality. Unfortunately she got into trouble by jumping over her owner's short, metal fence while he was away. So with a privacy fence, Joyce could be the best diva you could ever adopt! She's about at precious as they come! Joyce's estimated DOB is 8/2018, she weighs approx 29 lbs. and should grow in size.\n\nJoyce was generously sponsored by Regan Ellis during our virtual Reigning Cats and Dogs event. Thank you Regan for sponsoring Joyce!\n\nHSPC's adoption fee is seventy-five-dollars through December 31, 2020, unless stated otherwise within the pet's description. At times, our adoption fees are lowered during special events that are posted to our website or Facebook page. Every pet that is available for adoption has been spayed/neutered, microchipped, and is up-to-date on vaccinations including heartworm preventative (canines). Adopters are required to schedule a wellness exam with their veterinarian at their cost within 7 days of adoption.\n\nPlease only submit one application. Once you are contacted by email, you will have an opportunity to provide us with any additional animal(s) under consideration.",

I am a smart guy - I know sit, shake, lay down and am working on other commands. I LOVE treats - I mean who doesn't? Treats are the way to my heart! \n\nI like to go outside and be active, play with stuffed toys, and be spoiled. I am ready to fall in your lap and brighten your mood. \n\nI am looking for a home that will be patient, work at my pace, and slowly introduce myself to new things.\n\nDo you think I could become part of your flock? Start by filling out an adoption application online at www.al-van.org/adopt. Once reviewed, the humans at Al-Van will contact you to schedule a meet and greet with me.",

            "description": "Damian is around 6 years old and weighs approximately 14 pounds. He is estimated to be a pomeranian/sheltie/chihuahua mix. He requires a patient and experienced adopter and not a first-time pet owner. He has a medium energy level and loves to play. He really enjoys playing fetch! See a post on our Instagram, @poochmatch, for a small clip of him laying fetch with a volunteer. He is very sweet and loves attention. To receive attention, he will jump on your lap for you to pet him: IT MUST BE ON HIS TERMS. He likes to hop up on your lap instead of being picked up and put there. He belongs in a home where he is not expected to interact with visitors or strangers. Damian is NOT suitable for children. If you have kids, grandkids, kids that visit, grandkids that visit, or interested in having kids in the future, he would not be a good match. He requires a quiet home that will let him adjust at his own pace over a couple of weeks, not a couple of hours. Once he adjusts and builds TRUST with his adopter(s), he is happy and sweet (as seen in his photos and video). His trust with you must be built slowly. If you are looking for a dog to be immediately friendly and settled in your home within a couple of days, Damian would not be a good match. He gets along well with other dogs after a proper introduction, but does not require canine companionship. He is not well suited for the dog park/beach. Damian is doing well with leash and crate training. His adoption fee is $365 which covers the cost of his neuter, all core vaccines (Rabies and Distemper/Parvo), blood test to ensure he is in good health, microchip and microchip registration. If you\u2019re interested in adopting, the first step is completing an application which is available on our website, Poochmatch.com, under the adoption tab. Please read the following paragraphs for additional information about our process.\n\nIf this listing is still posted, we are still accepting applications for him/her. We do not do out-of-state adoptions on highly adoptable dogs; we would only consider out-of-state adoptions for dogs that prove hard-to-place locally. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nUPDATE: ADOPTION EVENTS CANCELLED DUE TO PANDEMIC AND SOCIAL DISTANCING. If you are interested in meeting any Poochmatch dog at our weekly adoption event on Saturdays at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda, CA (5521 Mirage St.) between 1-5 PM, please fill out an application from our website, poochmatch.com, and submit it no later than 11 AM on Fridays. Upon receipt AND approval, the dog you are interested in meeting will be made available to meet on a Saturday. Due to the high volume of dogs and puppies in our foster homes, it is impossible to bring them all every Saturday. The only way to ensure that the dog that you are interested in will be at the adoption event is to FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AND BE APPROVED. Otherwise, we cannot guarantee that the dog you are interested in will be at our adoption event. If you cannot make the time frame of our events, appointments can be made at another time and location solely at the discretion of the foster parent. Please understand that private appointments will be coordinated to meet the convenience of the foster parent/transporter.\n\nAll adoption fees cover the mandatory and non-negotiable spay/neuter, rabies, microchip, microchip registration, full sets of core vaccinations (rabies and 1 set of distemper/parvo for adults, 4 for puppies) and deworming. Adoption fees vary based on age, breed, size and the costs incurred on the dog's behalf by us i.e. medical, behavioral training, etc. and they range from $225-$495.\n\n\nCOVID-19 PROCEDURE:\nIn an effort to create a safe environment for our potential adopters and our staff, we have changed our protocols and procedures during these difficult times. Starting immediately, our procedures will change from what\u2019s written on our website and other social media platforms. Our weekly adoption event at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda is temporarily cancelled due to COVID-19 and social distancing. The only way to meet one of the dogs/puppies we have available for adoption is through completion of our adoption application through our website, poochmatch.com, before 11 AM on Fridays. On Fridays when we review the applications, we will pick the best fit for each dog or puppy applied for and coordinate mutually agreeable appointment times for the applicants who are approved that week. Private appointments are currently only scheduled on Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday of each week. Masks or bandanas are mandatory; faces must be properly covered.\n\nWith the overwhelming desire of the public to adopt at this time, we have received as many as 30 applications for one dog in just one week. Working with a staff of volunteers, we are only able to reach out on Fridays to the people we have approved to adopt. If you have not heard from us by Friday, we have selected a different applicant. If you have multiple dogs/puppies that you are interested in, please indicate each dog/puppy of interest on the application at that time so we don\u2019t rule you out for another dog/puppy available for adoption.\n\nPlease understand, we have an influx of texts, phone calls and emails that makes it impossible to get to each and every one of you. Not just for adoption interest, but also from veterinarians, people who must relinquish dogs, people who have found a stray dog in need of pick up, etc. We are currently not in need of fosters. Due to the fact that there is such a high demand, we are sticking with strict protocol to not adopt out of Southern California. We apologize for this inconvenience and difficulty to be able to get in touch with us while there is an overwhelming desire and demand to adopt at this time. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we navigate through these difficult times with every intention to keep the public and our staff safe.",

Because of my instinct, my foster mom says cats are probably a no go, they're just so cute and fluffy...I can't resist chasing them! I would also benefit from having an amazing backyard to play in! \n\nMy foster mom has been teaching me lots of tricks! I'm very treat motivated and easily trainable. So far I am great at sick, know stay, and I'm also crate trained! I'm still young (only two years old!) and have a very spunky and energetic personality! I love all people, especially those with treats! \n\nI'm \"pittie\" strong, which means muscular strong but also stubborn-headed, so will need a great handler to make sure I don't get away with things (such as pulling on a leash). \n\nI'm a very loving gal and I hope I'm the right fit for your family! If interested in meeting or adopting me, you can fill out an application at lpah.org/adoption. \n\n\n\n",

He is a true bro dog, looking for a cool dude to spend his days with. He loves to run! Bugaboo has a lot of energy for one so small, and his zoomies we equate to a bull in a China shop lol so watch your knees lol! Bugaboo needs a home without other animals, as he can be a bit dominant. He also needs strong person/handler, to teach and continue to lead as he will follow. ? He has TONS of love to give and just wants to be right by your side at all times, so a home that can allow him to do his own thing is a must, and or a stay at home family would definitely be a plus!\n\nJaded Paws Rescue is a 501c3 foster run organization, and we do not have a kennel facility for the general public to come and visit. We do this because we find our animals will be much more accustomed to the home environment when the time comes that they get adopted! If you'd like to meet a Jaded Paws Pet, simply email us and we can schedule a meet and greet that is compatible with your schedule. Our adoption process includes an adoption application, a meet and greet and a 7-day adoption trial at the prospective family's home before the adoption is official. Our adoption fees are as follows: Puppies/Adults: $125 Senior dogs: $75 Cats:$50\n\n",

From the looks of him, he has had a really rough life.  He seems to want to please and wants to be loved.  Zeus needs a family that will let him be part of the family and just love him. He so much deserves a life of love and kindness.  If only he could talk I think he would tell us quite the story.  He has stolen our hearts at the shelter and we would love to see him get a good home. Zeus is not good with cats.  Call and make an appointment  to see this guy..  He has been at the shelter now for about 9 months and would love a home of his own.",

We are Hazel (left) and Davy (right) and are a bonded duo who have been together for most of our lives and we want to keep it that way :).   \nWhere did you meet TAPS?  At a local Tennessee Shelter.\nHow old are you?  We are around 10ish years old.\n\nHazel is a lap puppy for sure!  Davy is a lap puppy fetch puppy - he's so silly!  Both dogs are super affectionate and loving.  Their owner died and they were taken to a shelter where no one reclaimed them.  Hazel and Davy need a fenced yard with access from the house.  They were never fully housetrained, but we have been working on that and with a schedule, good quality food and some vitamins, these seniors are getting an A+.  We feel they need to have quick access for potty breaks.  Hazel and Davy need a fenced yard with access from the house. This is a requirement for their next home.  \n\nTo adopt one of our animals, the first step is filling out an adoption application at www.tapsusa.org Please make sure you get a confirmation that your application has been submitted. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY\n\nOPERATION ADOPT\n706 Kiser Station Road\nFriendsville, TN  37737\n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY\n\nAll animals are spayed/neutered, current on age appropriate vaccinations and microchipped before they go to new homes because that's the responsible way to keep them all safe.\n\nWe only adopt to local homes  in the immediate vicinity because we utilize our volunteer force to process home visits.  Photos of your home, letters of reference are not acceptable which is why we only adopt locally. Only in very rare circumstances do we adopt out of area.  Examples of this would be finding the perfect home for a senior animal or one that has other special needs that we have not been able to place locally for an extended period of time.",

Hogan was adopted and 18 months later returned to the Riverside shelter as he did not get along with the other small dog in the family.  Hogan is a curious, playful boy who is so excited to play tug of war with you and his rope toy. He enjoys chasing balls, and playing with his toys are his favorite pastimes besides snuggling up to his humans.  Hogan does not do well with kids in the home! Hogan can get protective over his family when new people come around, so be sure to introduce him to new guests slowly and dont just have them barge in.  He is highly intelligent, loves the sun and the outdoors.  He takes treats very gently from your hand and loves bones. Although crate trained, Hogan is a big baby and hates to be confined in a kennel or a crate. He is however, highly trainable. Hogan loves his car rides, walking with his human and is great on a leash.  No small dogs and not sure about cats for Hogan!  Please consider this playful, outdoorsy boy to be your best friend.",

Event locations do vary so please check the homepage to find out where we will be this week.

So we partnered up to help find some pups homes. Peanut was adopted back in May but sadly it didn\u2019t work out. He\u2019s since been placed back in foster care where he truly has been thriving and doing well with socializing and training. He is now 6-7 months old. He is a  Terrier. He\u2019s not very big at only like 20 lbs and we don\u2019t see him growing a whole lot more. He has these long legs but skinny body. When he first came back into care he seemed to spook when people would open a door and come in. His foster family has worked on this and he is doing so much better. He adores his foster dad but he adores he\u2019s 3 year old human foster sister even more. He\u2019s happy and playful. Loves to run outside and play with other dogs. This boy is utd, neutered and ready for a forever home!\n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159\n",

This big-hearted guy is great with adults and older children (teenagers), soaking up attention and cuddles. He\u2019s energetic, smart, and funny. He loves (and needs) lots of exercise, so would be a great companion for those who are up for exploring with Rocky on long walks, and who have the physical ability to control a larger pup.\n \nRocky is friendly with larger dogs like himself, and gets very excited when he sees dogs on his walks. He is not a fan of small dogs or cats, so should definitely not be in a home with small animals.\n\nRocky gets a little anxious when his family member leaves, but a long walk and a tv on for company helps him to settle in for a good nap.\nThe ideal candidate for Rocky is someone who works from home or works part time. His owner moved and couldn't take him along, so he was surrendered. Rocky deserves a loving, caring home where he can feel safe and welcomed as a member of the family.  He has been neutered, vaccinated, and chipped. Rocky is 5 yrs old.",

            "description": "Patton (also known as Petunia!) is one smarty pants! And boy, oh boy does he love his cookies! He was rescued by Dog Tales Rescue in Canada, and was later transferred to Dogs Playing for Life's Canine Center in Florida for further training. He's been waiting in Florida ever since. \n\nPatton is a purebred, papered American Bulldog. He is super smart and has nailed advanced obedience. He would love to continue to learn more as long as his person is packing treats! He is recommended as the only animal, in an adult home. Patton is a strong, big dog with goofy eyes, who loves to chase squirrels or raccoons, and play tug. \n\nHe needs an experienced owner who wants to continue his training and perhaps even enter him into the world of competition (Senior edition). \n\nHere are a few more things to know about Patton:\n\n*Patton is a staff-favorite at Dogs Playing For Life!\n\n*He is not reactive in public on leash to other dogs, but he does often 'worry' a bit, so quieter more open spaces seem to be more enjoyable for him.\n\n*He is a big, strong boy who initially struggled with resource guarding - he has come a long way and through his advanced training he has learned to \"leave it\" on command.\n\n*Like a fine wine, he has greatly mellowed with age - he is trustworthy in the house during the day and housetrained. \n\n*He LOVES car rides and rides loose in the car.\n\n*He likes training games, like catching treats, tug, etc. \n\n*He is muzzle trained, and does best muzzled for any vetting or more invasive handling, but once he has a relationship with someone he is very affectionate. \n\n*Patton has been with us for three years, far too long! He's more than ready for a chance, he's worked so hard and he'll be a good boy for someone.\n\n*We are open to a foster home with another rescue group or an adopter, and we will support the new foster/adopter with training.\n\n*Patton has a sponsor that will cover his veterinary care for life!\n\nInterested in learning more about this big goober?

I also can get overly excited when seeing my person after a long day apart, so I might jump on accident just to give you a hug! I LOVE to swim!! It is so much fun! I do make a mess because my feet are so big which makes me clumsy! My foster mom says I resemble a hippo when I swim because I love to splash and make noise! I love making new dog and people friends! Dont be intimidated by my size though! I am a complete love bug and just want a nice head rub. I do have a funny bark though! I love a good treat and food! I could eat alllll day. My big appetite makes way for big muscles, so I am very strong! I need a family who understands I need someone to keep me and my big energy under control. I am very smart and a quick learner, so I wont have a problem picking up on manners! I already know how to sit! My energy does run out quick, so I am always ready to crash on the nearest couch after a good run. If you think I could be your girl, please come meet me!\n\nAll dogs adopted through Troy Animal Rescue Project are up to date on vaccinations, spayed/neutered (age appropriate), and heartworm negative.

He was very happy to get sprung from the shelter!\n\nHe's a big boy and sweet, but needs to go to a home with rules and structure and plenty of exercise. He is very smart and a quick learner. He would do best in a home with an experienced large dog owner.\n\nThis sweet boy is about 3 years old and weigh between 60-65lbs.\n\nIf you are interested in fostering or adopting, please complete an application at www.scoutshonor.org.",

I really do not do well around little kiddos as quick movements and loud noises make me nervous. I love to play fetch and I get along with all other dogs big and small. My foster mom has a boxer and an English Mastiff. A friend also comes to visit with a Chihuahua and I like to play with her too. Currently my foster mom has me have run of the house and I like to follow her around all day until we go outside where I like to play fetch, play water sports and rough house with my boxer foster sister. I love to cuddle and I love to sleep in the bed next to you. I can hear everything so I am also a great watch dog. If you are willing to take the time with me I can be a great dog and a great companion.\n\n\nBuzz is currently in a foster home and available for adoption!

We posted him on lost and found pages in Los Angeles County and put up more flyers at shelters in Baldwin park and Pomona.  This sweet boy sleeps like a person and likes to be near you.  We just had him vetted and poor guy had to have 18 teeth pulled.  He is on soft food for now.  Update he can eat dry food too.He is a happy dog but clings to people.  We know nothing of his past.  Only that he may have some separation anxiety.  We are hoping for a family that is home a lot or someone that works from home.  He was not skinny when found and definitely an indoor dog.  Loves beds and couches.  He needs to learn how to ride in a car and walk better on a leash.  He tries to jump out of car so he needs a seat belt harness or needs to be in a crate while in the car.  Sometimes he cries and sounds like a cow.  He is lonely and needs a family to love him. He does like other dogs and has tolerated 2 of our puppies pouncing on him to play?",

            "description": "Hi, I'm Darko! I was rescued as a newborn pup in Mexico after a home-check revealed that I was not in a safe living situation.  I didn't have my dog Mom at that time and sadly, I'm the only survivor of my brothers and sisters, but I'm safe and sound in Chicago now looking for a fur-ever home. I'm young, healthy, neutered, and up-to-date on my vaccinations! My current foster guardians would describe me as a very intelligent and high energy pup! I would LOVE a home where I can be a part of an active person's lifestyle :) I am however very fearful of strangers and I don't enjoy other dogs - I'd rather just hang with my person!  Due to my struggles in the past, I have some behavioral issues. I want to learn, I want to understand love but I need someone who will patiently show me the way, and how to be a companion. I hear that is the most beautiful thing and I want to try that out. If you live a calm, easy going lifestyle and have patience and dog handling experience, please consider me as your pal.  Serious inquiries only because though I am adorable, I need a bit of hands on work, time, patience and most of all ~ consistent love, around the clock.\n\nChicago, IL\nFamousFidoChicago@gmail.com\nSERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY.",

Please email the completed application to newleashrescue2018@gmail.com\n\nBrutus came to us from a local impound where he was an unclaimed stray.  Brutus weighs about 80 pounds and is estimated to be around 6 years old.  Brutus needs an experienced home where every person in the home will be his pack leader, or else he can be snappy with those that he thinks he can be the boss of.  \n\nHe is good with other dogs.  He is in a foster home with mostly medium to large sized dogs but he has been exposed to a small dog too and has done well.  He can be playful and like to run around in his fenced yard.  \n\nBrutus is crated while his foster is gone and at night he sleeps on the floor beside the bed.  Brutus doesn't love the crate but he will go in willingly if a treat is thrown in.  He has a little bit of anxiety and will lick at the kennel door a bit.  He is crated in a heavier duty plastic crate currently.   He would prefer a home where he didn't have to be cratef, if you asked him.   He sleeps on the floor on a dog bed beside the bed at night.  \n\n Brutus does well with his house training after he has been able to acclimate to the house and learn the routine.  Brutus will be best in a home with Rottweiler experience.     He is also a big leaner and has a little weight behind him if he wants attention.   He has not been cat tested.   \n\nHe does have some resource protection around other dogs.  In his foster home he is fed in his crate and does well.  With people eating he will beg for a little bit and then will lay down under or beside the table.  He gets excited when seeing other dogs while out on a leash and will jump and pull.  We recommend any adopter attend training with Brutus.  He is extremely smart and feel he will excel at this.  He is a bit stubborn but is food motivated.  Aren't we all? ?\n\nBrutus has a bite history so please consider before inquiring.   \n\nAdoption fee is $350.00 + tax  (no checks) \n\nFoster to contact: Katie @ kit_n_caboodle22@hotmail.com \n\nPlease inquire whether Brutus will be attending an upcoming event. \n\n Our fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home. An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home. \n\nSometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home and truly become comfortable. There are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption, discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months. We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.",

Zoey is visually impaired and is almost blind, she can possibly see some shadows, but is special needs and is looking for the right fit home.   \n\nZoey will do best in a quieter home, with children age 10 and up.  She is good with other dogs and likes to play some, but she needs a family that understands her special needs.  Zoey will have accidents at first and will take time to acclimate to any new place because she can't see.  She will be shy and take some time to feel comfortable to venture out.   She should not be off leash, and would do best in a fenced in yard where she can move around safely. \n\nA Jagd terrier requires a terrier savvy owner.  These are not a good first time dog and need someone experience to be able to understand and appreciate their antics. \n\nZoey had a dental to remove a few retained baby teeth when she came into rescue.  \n\nPlease contact Zoey's foster to learn more.  \n\nAdoption fee is $350.00 + tax (no checks)\n\nFoster to contact:  Sara - 651-260-3774 or sara.fostermom@gmail.com\n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home.

She had been adopted from the Haven but returned when her human mom got a promotion at her job that involved working extremely long hours. Worried that Zaria was spending too much time alone, she brought her back to us to find a new home. Zaria is a friendly, outgoing girl who would enjoy living inside with her people since that's what she's used to. She would also appreciate a yard or plenty of walks for exercise. She can be picky with the dogs she gets along with, so a meet and greet is recommended for any potential fur-siblings. You can meet Zaria at the Haven from 9-4 any day of the week or call 417-835-3647 for more information. Also, don't forget to like us on Facebook for more featured pets! DOB 3/7/14 60 pounds...All pets have lifetime sanctuary at Haven of the Ozarks. If they cannot remain with their adopter, they must be returned to the Haven.\n\nAdoption fees are as follows: \nPuppies under the age of 6 months - $125\nDogs weighing 30 pounds and less - $125 \nDogs ages 6 months to 5 yrs old - $90\nDogs over the age of 5 yrs old - $75.\nCats under the age of 6 months old - $75\nCats over the age of 6 months old - $65",

Ave has EPI and needs special enzymes power so she can eat.\n\nDogs with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI) have a malabsorption and maldigestion condition where the pancreas is no longer producing enough pancreatic enzymes to digest fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. Because of this, dogs (and also cats) will often present with unexplained weight loss, diarrhea/cow-patty like yellow/pale stools. Although EPI was once thought to be just a German Shepherd condition, it is now found in all breeds.\n\nWithout a special enzyme powder on her food she is not able to put on or maintain weight. She can't be without it. it runs about $50 to $60 a month.",

This is a condition in which the esophagus will not move the food down her throat as it should. Ava has surgery to correct her PRAA and it did lessen the severity of her Mega Esophagus but didnt totally correct it. Ava must eat her food after its been soaked and blended in a blender and she needs to eat out of an elevated feeder. She drinks water normally and is no longer on daily meds. Ava loves other dogs and cats and children. She is almost potty trained but still has occasional accidents. She needs a family that will be diligent on ensuring that no small objects are left where she can get them because they can pose choking hazards for her with her mega E. Please take a few minutes to read up on Megaesophagus to see what it is and what care is required for a dog with the condiotion if you feel you are interested in Ava.",

She is on a raw-based diet that is beneficial towards her health, although she can easily be transitioned back to kibble. Her adoption comes with all her accessories (Outside Dog Run, Collars, Leash, Bowls, Etc), if needed.\n\nBooboo currently has no health issues and is a happy pup. She must go to a home with someone that is experienced with the breed and doesn\u2019t have any other Dogs or Cats in the home unless they are capable of keeping Booboo separated. She is reactive towards other dogs and animals. \n\nBooboo absolutely loves attention and affection. She loves to roll around and especially loves furniture to sleep on. She is a medium-high energy dog that definitely enjoys her exercise and running around. \n\nLittle Booboo is currently located in Lincoln, CA.\n\nContact Janessa if you\u2019re interested in adopting (510) 689-7559.\n",

This boy is so easy to have around, and loves a lazy walk and just to relax and watch a good movie. Max does fine with the two female dogs in the house, but does not like to share attention with his foster mom, therefore, Max should be the only dog in the house. Although Max is easy to have around, he still requires an experienced dog owner. As with most German Shepherds, they are intelligent, obedient, and very protective of their home, environment, and people. The new owner must continue to provide obedience and structure to ensure a happy dog. Max loves belly rubs, and is a very affectionate sweet dog. Max does not like cats. If you are looking for a laid back, loving affectionate dog, this is your boy. Max said he would prefer an adult home with one or two people to adore.\n\nCome see this pup on Saturdays during adoption event hours. Please email Linda at lbredfire@sbcglobal.net or call WT&F's Dog Team voicemail 707-812-9030 to get a jump on the process, ask questions, and/or to confirm they will be there. Dog adoptions are held outside Napa Petco every Saturday - 12:30pm to 4:00pm.\nThis dog comes spayed/neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, dewormed, heartworm tested negative, and more with an adoption fee/donation to Whiskers, Tails and Ferals in Napa, CA. See more information at http://whiskerstailsandferals.org/.\nVisit our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/whiskerstailsandferals/",

This sweet gentleman has gone through some tough times losing his owner and ending up in a humane society and then being adopted by a family who could not keep him. He is now in our care and receiving lots of TLC in his awesome foster home. He is lovely in the house and has lots of charm, however he can be vocal and is not suitable for living in a condo/apartment. Currently he is in good health and this former chunky monkey has lost weight. Mack is now an active fella who loves long walks and to swim laps in the pool. He loves a good game of fetch. He is the size of a small Beagle with a big personality and an even bigger heart! We will not accept applications with children under 14 as to the best of our knowledge he has not lived with children under 14. Mack needs to be the only pet in the home as he much prefers the company of being with his people. Mack will make a lovely companion but he is not suitable for a first time dog owner.",

            "description": "Please contact Susan (ozarksummer@yahoo.com) for more information about this pet.DC is a wonderful, loving, fun kid who wants nothing more from life but a friend to hang with, go on a few walks a week and just live a life of love and care in an adult setting. He MUST have a fenced attached yard or he will roam off in search of an adventure that will end badly!\n\n*************\nDC is thriving in foster care! He has taught his foster parents that he LOVES to chase a ball! Might bring it back, might prefer to play keep away but either way BALL IS A MUST! He is very passionate about playing ball and will need a new guardian that would love to play ball too!!\n*****************************\nDC is a beautiful young adult bull who came from circumstances that define his emotional needs. He is a smart, sensitive and affectionate boy who is a people pleaser but due to his past life he is very unsure and will quickly be submissive. He needs a guardian that is firm, gentle and will lend him some confidence and assurance that he IS a good boy and its ok, he does not need to worry about doing wrong and facing horrible punishment and pain. He just wants to make his human happy! This dog has illustrated that he is not clear on what is his bad and what is not his bad and at some point was punished harshly for things that he did not have a hand in, maybe an angry human or just drunks or who knows what. Many times the ego plays a role in some human types to select this breed and they imprint their lack of self confidence in domination over the powerful beast, some how that makes certain humans feel better about themselves. We don't play into that mentality and will be watching for signs as to avoid placing him where he will face it again.\nDC will sit and speak on request, which is fun! He is good on a leash and will spend all afternoon just playing, romping and snorting around the yard. He enjoys toys and will chase squirrels and birds, which usually qualifies him as not a cat person! He loves to throw and chase so might be a good ball chaser with the right human!\nHe very much likes other dogs but needs possible housemates (if any) that would hold up to some seriously not gentle but fast play. He would not be a good housemate to small, fragile or easily annoyed furkids. He does well with the furkids in his foster home but they are all big and busy kids like himself. We are so heart warmed to see him engage is care free play and running around just to run and feel the freedom it offers.\nDC will need a fenced yard because he will suffer discrimination from neighbors and local governments wherever he lands. He will so need the freedom of going into his yard where he knows its safe and he can enjoy the carefree time that has been so instrumental in his progress this far.\nDC has an adoption donation of $175 of which $150 + any addition donation amount will be tax deductible for you\nPoor guy does have a sensitivity to topical flea treatments so his new family would have to be committed to Nexguard Chewables as part of his regimen. DC is 22 inches at the shoulder, broad and strong weighing in at 70 lbs of solid muscle! He will need a gentle, firm pack leader with a super tight fence. Since he got in trouble over a domestic disturbance and quiet no kids home would be ideal. He loves Leash Walks!!! Please submit your interst at this linik\nhttps://ozarkhavenrescue.weebly.com\n\nGlad to answer any questions at all! 4/27/20 11:31 AM",

He is okay in a household with dog-friendly cats that enjoy his enthusiasm. Some less dog-experienced cats may consider him a pest. He rides well in the car, walks well on leash, knows the commands sit and down, and takes treats very gently from your fingers. He is a smart boy and a quick learner who will do anything for a treat. Duster is perfectly housebroken and crate-trained. His tail is always happily wagging, and he is full of loving kisses. He enjoys leaning against you, looking adoringly into your eyes and rolling over for belly rubs.\nDuster is extremely healthy, neutered, heartworm-tested, micro-chipped, and up-to-date on rabies and distemper vaccines. Duster is in a foster home in Chicagoland and would love to have a loving forever home to call his own.

Messages received through Petfinder will go unanswered.\nCopy and paste this URL link to learn everything you need to know about the adoption process and to fill out the application.\nhttps://www.grandstrandhumanesociety.com/adopt/\n\nPorter has been consistently one of our most human-fearful dog, is protective of his space and becomes defensive when he feels threatened. He takes time to form a bond with someone and trust them enough to feel comfortable. He walks very well on a leash and is very treat motivated with the right person he could be trained easily. Porter will do best as the only pet in a home so that his adopter can give him all the time and attention he needs to adjust. He will not be a dog that can be taken out in public with large crowds. Introducing him to new people will have to be taken very slowly. With the right person he has the potential to be wonderful and loving dog. Overall Porter needs an experienced dog handler who is willing to meet with him multiple times and work with him through his fearful behaviors.",

            "description": "Skippy is a sweet, all-around good dog.  He came to us after being found by a good samaritan, having a  bad wound that turned out to have been caused by a gunshot from a black powder gun.  He came to us in mid-January of this year.\n\nHe narrowly escaped serious injury or death. We were amazed at the trajectory of the bullet and that it didn't cause more damage than it did.  The bullet was the size of a marble and penetrated the left side of his neck, glanced off his shoulder blade, went through one lung lobe, broke a rib and lodged under the skin on the right side of his ribcage.  \n\nSkippy is a trouper and a survivor!  We're grateful and amazed that he has quickly and completely healed from his trauma.  He is very energetic and happy.  He will need lots of exercise and would appreciate a family that is really active and includes him.  He loves people and is good with other dogs.  We don\u2019t know if he\u2019s good with children.  Judging by his personality I bet he would be, but he\u2019s so energetic that they should probably be older children.  Skippy is a charmer!  We think he will make a good family dog...maybe best with older children because he is energetic and enthusiastic about life!\n\nHe's a great size...about 50 pounds...and, he's just about 2 years old.",

Once animals are posted, we immediately begin receiving adoption applications. With one volunteer available to review all applications, we appreciate your patience as you wait for an email response. Adoption appointments are scheduled first come with an approved application, first served. (See our adoption procedures below.)\n\nEddie came to us from an owner who felt he needed a fenced yard for exercise. And he does, because he's an active boy who loves to play fetch. Eddie is a lot of fun and would do best with an active family or owner that is a bit rough 'n tumble like him. Eddie is guaranteed to provide many laughs with his goofy personality. He lived indoors with his family, was house trained, and knows several commands. Eddie's been at the shelter WAY too long, and we cannot believe this ham keeps getting overlooked. Eddie's estimated DOB is 8/1/2018; he weighs about 56 lbs.\n\nEddie was generously sponsored by Peter Farrell during our virtual Reigning Cats and Dogs event. Thank you Peter for sponsoring Eddie!\n\nHSPC's adoption fee is seventy-five-dollars through December 31, 2020, unless stated otherwise within the pet's description. At times, our adoption fees are lowered during special events that are posted to our website or Facebook page. Every pet that is available for adoption has been spayed/neutered, microchipped, and is up-to-date on vaccinations including heartworm preventative (canines). Adopters are required to schedule a wellness exam with their veterinarian at their cost within 7 days of adoption.\n\nPlease only submit one application. Once you are contacted by email, you will have an opportunity to provide us with any additional animal(s) under consideration.",

I can't wait to meet you! I am a sweet girl - I will stare at you with my gorgeous, amber eyes & you'll do anything I want...oh, wait...foster says that is probably not best...I should have some rules so I can be my best self. I am an energetic young adult who enjoys playing as much as I do snuggles with my humans - I am a bit of a bed hog. I love treats & food too and definitely need some appropriate things to chew on. I was born in the rescue & adopted as a young puppy but didn't get the care I needed and was returned. I am a bit of a wild child at the moment on a leash - I'm just so excited! I will need training to reign that in but I am so smart and have so much potential - I am essentially a puppy brain in an adult dog body! Did I mention snuggles - they are oh so important - couch or bed, doesn't matter to me! I am also house-trained - of course any transition could lead to a slip-up - you'd have to understand that in getting any dog. I like other dogs and want to play but I play hard so a friend would have to be a tolerant one. I also don't want to share bones, thank you very much! My foster mom says I'm gorgeous - I have a chocolatey coat with white features, including a white \"knee sock\" on one of my front legs! And my fur is SO soft - velvety! My adopter must have the time and patience to help me be my best self. Could you be my pawfect match?\n\nRoseland needs to be in a home as an only-dog-- she doesn't want to share the love!",

Leah is athletic, loyal and fun.  She is timid when meeting new people but once she warms up to you she is INCREDIBLY friendly!  Leah is good with male dogs and loves to play.  She is a dominant female and would do best in a home with male dogs or as a solo dog.  She is good off leash (once comfortable) and loves to run and play in the woods.  Leah is crate trained (it is her safe spot), house trained and has nice manners.  She needs a family that can allow her the time to gain their trust and help boost her confidence to learn that not all people will let her down.\n\nAdoption fee: $100\nWeight: 50 lbs.\nBirthday: 3/2017",

I get along very well with all the other dogs in the house and love my people after I have a chance to get to know them. I can be a little shy at first. I am very calm, happy to lay on a soft bed and chill, love to eat.\n\nI have some skin issues - lypomas and cysts - so they sometimes get a little irritated. I like to go for short walks and can use the exercise to shed a few pounds. If I don't want to go any farther, I just find a comfy spot to lay down. I will do best in a home with little or no stairs.\n\nWant to adore me forever? Contact CBHR today!\nCarolina Basset Hound Rescue adopts in North and South Carolina.

(: I love to play with all kinds of toys and have tons of energy so will need an active family. After I get it all out though, I make a great snuggler. I am also dog friendly with proper introduction, and totally crate trained. I know my basic commands too! And, I'm doing better on the leash every day. I would do best in a home with older children, due to my energy level.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry\n\n---------------------PLEASE READ-------------------------------\nOur dogs are dogs are fostered in Texas but available for adoption in the Pacific Northwest...With stops in - Lacey, WA  and Portland, OR.\nThese dogs are transported to a predetermined location agreed upon by the rescue.\n\nOur out of state adoption fee is $500. This fee includes spay/neuter, current vaccinations, a registered microchip, a negative heartworm test, health certificate, and transport costs. \nAs an Apollo direct adoption, the adoption interview/meet and greet occurs on video call (Skype, FB Messenger call, Facetime, etc). The adoption application and fee would be finalized prior to transport. \n",

She is sweet, calm, walks great on a leash & is very gentle taking a treat. She is very smart & knows her basic commands & will learn very easily. She absolutely LOVES the water so if you enjoy the Florida life style - boating, swimming, fishing she would make a great companion. With proper introduction she may be fine with another dog in the home. She can be afraid of some people & can occasionally react - this could be that rescue doesn't agree with her so we are looking for someone who is an experienced dog owner, an understanding person who can work with this beautiful soul to help her feel happy, safe & loved as once she has gained your trust she will be the MOST loyal doggy.\n\nSave time & fill out an adoption application or foster form on our website left side forms/apps justinbartlettanimalrescue.org This will just pre-approve you to adopt Jade & won't commit you to her adoption.",

HE WILL NOT DO WELL IN THE AVERAGE HOME. NO CATS, SMALL DOGS OR SMALL CHILDREN.\n\nOakley is a working bred Australian Shepherd and has to have a job or he will make his own job to keep himself busy and that gets him into trouble. Oakley is an awesome disk or agility dog prospect. He would also do great on a working farm doing what he was bred to do. \n\nOakley needs a forever family that understands drive in competition dogs and is a confident leader as he will become the leader if given the chance! Oakley is currently being fostered with a trainer to work on focus and some advanced obedience. Oakley with the proper exercise and mental stimulation does have a cuddly and chill side and loves to cuddle! Oakley is great on outings and a social butterfly. If you are looking for that dream dog to excel in a performance dog sport this may be your prospect!!!\n\nHere is our application:  https://www.australianshepherdsfurever.org/adoption-application\n\nAll adoption fees are used for future rescue efforts.\n\n",

            "description": "Have you met volunteer favorite Janie?\n\nOne day, early in 2020, Janie's owners called LA County Animal Control and asked them to pick up their dog because they were done with her. And that's how Janie came to be in Baldwin Shelter. Only thing is, Janie's not really a senior... she'es only 6 years old! She's still not sure how she ended up at this old folks home! The reality is, Janie REALLY needed us so, we Frosted her on March 24, 2020. Janie had severe dry eye that was untreated for so long she was creating no tears on her own causing a lot of discomfort. We got Miss Janie in to an ophthalmologist who did a parotid duct transposition to lubricate her eyes with saliva. It's a fancy procedure, but if it gives her eyes a chance to heal and be comfortable? Well, only the best for our girl!\n\nJanie has been on a couple Flings. She's the best girl in a home! She's fun, active, and loves to play. One of her Fling Moms shared, \"If you ever lack motivation to get out and exercise, Janie will help! Walking, running, hiking... Janie's your girl! Not confident with your cooking skills? Janie will always be there to taste test, and it's all five stars to her! Live alone? Janie's deep bark warns off would-be intruders, and her snores will relax you to sleep.\"\n\nAnother volunteer who always makes sure to spend a little extra time with Janie told us, \"Janie has SO much love to give! After she's been on a walk to get her wiggles out, the only thing missing for her to have the perfect day is to be in someone's company. She's learned how to dribble her ball back and forth by herself, but I swear it's like she's saying \"I won't make you do much work, just please sit here with me.\" I love how she makes me feel like I'm the best thing on the planet when I spend time with her. This girl would be so happy to finally get a home of her own.\"\n\nJanie lives onsite at Frosted Faces Foundation. Stop by to meet this special girl during our next Open House!\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees and we help with medical costs!\n\nApply to become a family: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 1/31/21 KG",

I'm super playful and high energy but I also love to slow down and cuddle.  If you rub my butt I get the zoomies (it's my favorite!).  So there's the good stuff but like everyone else I have some quirks.  See, I love kids, but I get too attached and become possessive so I shouldn't live with them.  I also don't like to be told \"no\" so I get a little snarly when you try.   But I can learn to be different with some training.  I love toys but I also like to eat them.  I'm a really good girl; I just need the right person to work with me.  So come meet me and see for yourself!!

Gomer would be a great dog for outside.\n\nWE ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING BY APPOINTMENT ONLY DUE TO COVID-19\nUnless otherwise stated, the adoption fees for dogs over 5 months range from $50-$175. Puppies under 5 months are $175.00. Cats over 1 year are $35.00, kittens under 1 year old are $60.00. Dog adoption fees include a microchip. Cats can be microchipped by request for an additional $5.00.\nThe adoption fee includes the animal's surgery, vaccinations, flea preventative, deworming medication, sample bag of food/treat samples and a free first exam with participating veterinarians. Shelter policy and 2018 Indiana state law decrees all animals must be spayed or neutered prior to leaving the shelter.\nWE ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING BY APPOINTMENT ONLY DUE TO COVID-19\nOur shelter is open to the public on Monday- Saturday from 8:00 am -5:00 pm EST with the exception of Wednesdays on which we typically open by 1:00 pm.

When he is walked (but really who is walking who with him), he is raring to go.  Loves toys, treats, and playing outside.\n\nAnd look at those eyes!!  He's even handsomer in person!!\n\n",

GRACIES HEART OF GOLD DOES NOT SHIP OUR DOGS - WE REQUIRE A FACE TO FACE MEETING. WE ALSO DO NOT ADOPT OUR DOGS AS GIFTS UNLESS THE RECIPIENT MEETS WITH THE DOG PRIOR TO ADOPTION. MY ADOPTION FEE IS: $300. THESE FEES HELP KEEP THE RESCUE GOING. PLEASE READ MORE! Adoption fees average $150-$400. This fee varies per animal based on additional vet care required to save them. Due to the rising costs of veterinary care, premium holistic dog food, gasoline prices, and boarding fees, which are paid for out of our own pockets, we recently were forced to raise our fees. We are not funded by anyone - adoption fees help to offset only a part of our cost of getting the dog ready for adoption. All dogs > 6 months are vetted, up to date on vaccinations, spayed/neutered, microchipped, heartworm tested, wormed and have a goody starter bag. Puppies",

As much as she enjoys the company, she does not require constant attention. She is content to sit, play, and chew a bone on her own. She would do best in a home without children and as a only pet.  Baby Girl is a 3 year old Pittie. Her adoption fee is $130. You can meet her at our 505 S. Miller Ave., Marion location.",

He is a fully vetted( and neutered some pics were from when he first arrived), 6-8 pounds, 4-6 year old, Male, Housebroken, Chihuahua.\nWe dont know what he has been through in his life, but we suspect it wasnt good. He makes a horrible first impression, by acting.. well, Chihuahua. He will avoid & try to nip or grab if he is sitting in foster mom's lap and you reach for him. HOWEVER.. he is great with kids & will come to you if you let him.. No grabbing him up to snuggle unless he is asking for it.\nHe really loves children, but does play hard so older, dog-savvy kids are required.\n\nHe cannot go to a home with any other animals Zero, Nada, NONE. He will not adapt to them, he is anxious and confrontational (Ioster mom has tried, it's not going to happen for him) He needs a fenced area when outside as he will run away if not on a leash. I think he would do best with an older family who needs a companion who can be independent, or have the option to snuggle up for a cuddle.\nAre you his new person? Do you know someone who needs a buddy? Let's find him his forever home! If interested please fill out an application here:\nhttps://goo.gl/dGoP1L",

Email animalhelperneworleans@gmail.com for an application to foster or adopt. \n\nRocco was an owner surrender. They said he was hostile, barked nonstop and wouldn't eat. I'd bet money that dog was never hostile a day in his life. He barked and didn't eat due to his bad case of heartworms. That wasn't his fault but his owners. We treated him for a urinary infection. He completed a month of doxycycline. He got a proheart injection which is 6 months of heartworm prevention. He was treated for intestinal parasites. He's had several great exams. After heartworm treatment he will get a dental with a dental xray. He had an echo by the cardiologist. He coughs randomly. The cardiologist found nothing wrong with his heart. The guess is his trachea. He is not the best with house training. I've had this issue with other dogs that ate heavy heartworm positive. They improve after treatment. He will be on prednisone during treatment so hell have to potty lots. He'd be perfect with a doggy door.  \n I think he looks like a hyena. He likes to climb things also. He just wants to snuggle. He loves car rides. He does know his name. He's great on the leash. He loves to play with dogs. He's always happy. Has a smile and a wagging tail. Our vet guesses he's 12. He's around 16 lbs but has super long legs. We have no idea on a breed guess. He's just adorable.\nHes located in New Orleans LA. Email animalhelperneworleans@gmail.com for an application.",

She had been picked up on July 16, 2019. She was seized for a cruelty case. She had been tied to a tree. \n\nTosha is approximately 4 years old and 40lbs. She\u2019s a very loving dog. She loves kids. She is house and crate trained. She gets along well with other dogs. She is not good with cats or pigs. She is active. She would do best with daily exercise. \n\nTosha was treated for heart worms. She\u2019s spayed and microchipped. She had a 6 month proheart injection for heartworm prevention. She is up to date on shots. She\u2019s had a great exam and negative fecal. She does have some slight trachea damage from being tied to a tree. She should wear a harness always instead of a collar. \n\nTosha can be adopted anywhere and is currently located in New Orleans. If she is adopted locally the adoption will include 3 hour training sessions with Canis Integrated Behavior Solutions LLC. They are completely positive. \n\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website. All of our dogs and cats are in foster homes and we have no paid staff. If you have questions concerning a specific animal, PLEASE fill out an application and the foster parent will be in touch. We will not arrange any home visits with any of our dogs and cats until your application is processed. Please understand our foster parents are precious to our 2nd Chance family; without them we cannot function, so we do our best to not burden them with multiple appointments. Our foster parents will choose their top 3 applications and arrange home visits with these applicants. The adopter will be chosen at that time. The process can take anywhere from a week to a month. We want to make sure our little furry ones are placed in their 'forever home' and never have to go through a rehoming again!Hello my name is Yoda or that is what the shelter named me. I don't really know my name :) I just sort of do whatever I want to do. I like to be with my person at all times and I absolutely HATE a crate. I would love a home where they would cuddle with me 24/7. I was wayyyyy overweight so my foster mommy is working with my diet and I feel better already. Yes I am a dog so I will eat anything offered to me but it doesn't mean it is good for me. I couldn't even walk I waddled so I don't want an owner that is going to think that to love me is to feed me!!!Please fill out an adoption application:\nAdoption application (Dog)\nAdoption Application (Cat)\n\nPlease understand we do not adopt out dogs to\nfamilies with children under the age of 5. We do not adopt dogs to renters. Some dogs will have fence requirements while others may not.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment. The dogs and cats in our system find themselves there, for the most part, because their humans did not have the same loyalty to them as they did to their owners. We do not take the adoption process lightly, and will do everything in our power to make sure the animal is placed correctly the first time around for your sake and theirs. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!",

Click on available dogs to see further descriptions. If you are interested in me, please contact us at information@coastalgsrsd.org or call (858) 779-9149. Don't forget to fill out our online application:  http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/webform/1774/adoption-application. The minimum adoption donation ranges from $300 to $400. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is 100%25 tax deductible. Prior to placement, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are usually microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems. Our adoption process begins with completing an application on-line. A phone screening will soon follow, and lastly a home visit will be conducted by our volunteers.",

            "description": "To first see Eden, you might think, she is bold, confident, and very sure of herself. With Eden, looks can be deceiving. She is a beautiful boxer/pittie mix that is approximately 4 yrs. old, and solid 70 or so lbs. Eden is a very special girl, who we want to go to a home, where she will be happy, feel safe, relaxed and most of all, a home that she will succeed and thrive in. She was an owner surrender almost a year ago now, (in February 2020) with some information given but not much detail to go on or work with. Sweet Eden is 100% crate-trained and house-trained. In fact, she loves her crate and finds it to be her safe place when a new person comes to the home (or if she just wants a long nap) We do not recommend cats or dogs for this girl, or anything furry that she can chase. She is very interested in squirrels, or anything that gets in her way on her walks that she loves but does well with treats to distract her attention from them. We did test her with some other shelter dogs through a fence barrier, but although she did okay, we do feel it is best she is the only pet in the home.\n\nWith Eden, it has taken her some time to just simply learn how to be in our home and relax. At first, she was terrified of the stairs, the kitchen, the ceiling fan, the garage, to name a few, but now, (she has been with us now a lil over 2 mos.) She now knows that all these things are not going to hurt her, and she happily runs up and down stairs and in the kitchen for treats and is slowly getting better at the garage. The \"getting in a car is still a no-go for her lol (unless you put her in a crate, or in a gated back part of an SUV) She is not a fan, but with practice, she will feel better with this too! The only thing she is not quite comfortable yet is the young man in the home, who is not scary at all, but she just has not had much interaction with him, so it causes her to be \"stressed\" if he is around. We have seen improvement already, by just having him treat her when he passes by, letting her sit in crate in living room with him, or having her leashed when he is in the same room.\n\nEden is the type of dog, that is just honestly going to be worth every bit of the wait and patience you give her. She is quite low maintenance, and the MOST loveable, sweet Velcro dog you could ever meet! The key with her, is patience, and not rushing her to get comfortable with things, but giving her the time, she needs, and lots of positive reinforcement. She is very SMART!! She knows several commands and has already learned \"twirl!\" and is working on \"drop it\" (trading toy for a treat) and almost knows \"sit pretty\"!\n\nOnce outside, in the back yard, she seems more comfortable and will even do some major zoomies over and over, do a lil digging if she is in the mood, and come to you with her toys for some fetch time or tug of war! As far as children, we strongly recommend based on her timid personality, that older kids will be best. She does wonderfully with the dog savvy young teen in our home right now and often cuddles with her while she does her virtual school classes.\n\nLastly, we will add; Some of Eden's favorite things are: Food, treats, belly rubs (rolls over for them) stuffed animals and toys (she will keep herself entertained most the time) and even paws you for attention! If she is sleeping in a bedroom, she prefers her own personal space in the room, over a spot on the bed. Eden is such a wonderful girl that no doubt, will be a heart-dog to someone lucky enough to adopt her.",

She is gentle and listens intently to her person. She would make the ideal pet for a family or for a single person who needs a good companion and a pet that is sweet, but appears formidable. She is good with other dogs and very affectionate.  Layla was rescued at the last minute from a kill shelter.  She would do well with a fenced yard to give her a safe place to play.

            "description": "<b>If you are applying for McKynlee, please indicate on your application that you have read and understand her specific needs.</b>\n\nBorn on 01/06/20 and raised in foster care, McKynlee is a deliciously loving, 36 lb. Lab mix. With her gorgeous big eyes, this girl looks at you and melts your heart instantly. McKynlee, affectionately called \"Kyn Kyn\" by her foster family, is so full of love for her people and never fails to let them know.  Her snuggles are just the sweetest, and she will mold herself into her people to cuddle or lay against a leg or on a foot.  This girl's love for her new family will be very, very special and her connection to others will develop more gradually.\n\nFunny and feisty, McKynlee loves her toys and enjoys, not just her siblings, but the other dogs in her foster home as well. She can often be found romping with them in the yard and would enjoy a home with another playful canine buddy.   Full of joy in the morning, she makes the cutest happy noises - her foster mom calls it her \"warble\".  McKynlee has also been learning to swim in her foster family's pool, which she usually follows with a sun session in her chaise!\n\nMcKynlee is very connected to her people and her canine friends, but since she is hesitant with new people and new things, she would probably prefer to be more of a homebody than to be the dog going on lots of outings.  As a result of this, she would do better in a home with children over age 12.  This angel is crate trained, housetrained, knows basic commands, and is working on her leash training.\n\nMcKynlee has Megaesophogus, (where her esophagus does not properly carry food to the stomach) that has been well managed since she was about 8 weeks old on daily medication; she will likely need this for life and with it does eat and drink normally. Likewise, this does not slow her down one bit, and she is plenty rambunctious and happy.\n\n\nThank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (https://anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible organization. ANCAR is a foster-based rescue, and we adopt within a 90 mile radius of Bedford Hills, NY.  You will find the adoption application here: (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/).  All fields on the application must be completed.\nPlease read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) so you'll know what to expect when you submit.   \n\nOur dogs are in foster care and we do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. This is a firm policy. Our busy volunteers are not able to respond to questions about the dog or dog meeting requests in the absence of an application.  We know these dogs very well because they are in foster care. Please read the profiles of the dog(s) you are interested in prior to submitting an application.  If there are specific requirements stated (ie: Fenced Yard or Canine Friend Required) these are included because they are vital to the happiness, health, safety and adoption success of that dog. \n\nWe are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering and microchipping before transporting our dogs. We provide all supplies, preventatives and any follow up vet care necessary while they are in foster care. These costs are high and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you.  We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources. If you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through the kindness of supporters like you that we are 'changing lives...one tail at a time' by providing our dogs with 'A New Chance.' (https://anewchancear.org) \n\nThanks so much.",

            "description": "Needs \u2022 Children 8+ \u2022 If you are applying for McKella, please indicate on your application that you have read and understand her specific needs.\n\nMcKella, a 30 lb., German Shepherd/Lab mix female born in foster care on 01/06/20 is a real doll! Often called \u201cKella\u201d or \u201cKella Bella\u201d by her foster family, every minute spent with this darling is truly a joy! If you want a dog who really loves YOU, this is the gal for you! Her connection to those she knows is wonderful and pure; introductions to new people and new things need to be done gradually. \n\nGoofy and playful, McKella has a blast playing with her toys, her siblings, and with the other dogs in her foster home. She would love to find a home with a canine buddy to play with. McKella loves exploring in the yard, finding sticks to carry around, rooting around in her toy box (she will sometimes even climb into it!), and playing around in the hose and the baby pool. She has the cutest happy prance as she dances around. There is nothing like being greeted by her joyful wiggle and precious smile (yes, she really smiles!), and she thoroughly listens when you speak to her.\n\nMcKella is deliciously cuddly and LOVES to curl up on the couch with her people and be near them. As soon as she knows someone is headed to the couch, she\u2019s there immediately to join them. Her favorite spots are snuggled into a blanket with her humans and laying on the pillows with her head over her person\u2019s shoulder. When you stop petting her, she does the gentlest tap with her paw to remind you to continue. She comes to her people and asks to be held, where she will quietly and happily sit on your lap. McKella is housetrained, knows basic commands, and sleeps through the night like an angel.\n\nMcKella has a very mild case of Megaesophogus, (where her esophagus does not properly carry food to the stomach) and is not currently needing any treatment, but there is a small possibility that she may need medication in the future. This, however, does not slow her down and she holds her own in the pack quite well.\n  \n\n\nThank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (https://anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible organization. ANCAR is a foster-based rescue, and we adopt within a 90 mile radius of Bedford Hills, NY.  You will find the adoption application here: (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/).  All fields on the application must be completed.\nPlease read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) so you'll know what to expect when you submit.   \n\nOur dogs are in foster care and we do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. This is a firm policy. Our busy volunteers are not able to respond to questions about the dog or dog meeting requests in the absence of an application.  We know these dogs very well because they are in foster care. Please read the profiles of the dog(s) you are interested in prior to submitting an application.  If there are specific requirements stated (ie: Fenced Yard or Canine Friend Required) these are included because they are vital to the happiness, health, safety and adoption success of that dog. \n\nWe are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering and microchipping before transporting our dogs. We provide all supplies, preventatives and any follow up vet care necessary while they are in foster care. These costs are high and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you.  We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources. If you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through the kindness of supporters like you that we are 'changing lives...one tail at a time' by providing our dogs with 'A New Chance.' (https://anewchancear.org) \n\nThanks so much.",

German Shepherd/Lab mix gem born on 01/06/20.  With the most striking eyes, this guy is full of personality. He is enthusiastic and funny as he dances around excitedly at hearing the voices of his humans. He looks into your eyes with his soulful gaze and cocks his head to listen. McCallen's dopey, airplane ears have not yet decided whether to be up or down and are positioned slightly differently everyday; this only adds to his charm!  He loves playing with his siblings, and when he sees the other dogs in his foster home, his tail starts wagging and he gets so excited and happy. He always greets them with the sweetest kisses and will cuddle up with them for a nap as well! This agile boy would love to find a home with a canine buddy.\n\nMcCallen bounces around carrying big toys and launches joyfully into his bed and onto the couch with them. He will even climb into his toy box to find the one he wants! This silly guy is hilarious to watch as he jumps in and out of the baby pool and barks and play bows at the spray coming from the hose. He likes to sit on the steps of his foster family's pool while he excitedly waits for his canine buddies to swim over.  McCallen loves standing between his foster parents\u2019 feet and mouthing with his canine buddies from his protected spot. A very loyal boy, he likes being near his people and crashing for a nap at their feet, in their laps, or next to them on the couch. McCallen is the most delicious snuggler and has infinite amounts of love for his family of humans. Sometimes he will just come to his people and ask to be picked up for a quick cuddle before resuming his play. With strangers and new things, McCallen is much more cautious and needs slow acclimation, so he would prefer a home with children over 8 years old.  This guy will easily become the center of your world! McCallen is housetrained, knows basic commands, and sleeps through the night like an angel.  He is intelligent, eager to please, and a quick learner.\n\nMcCallen has Megaesophagus, (where his esophagus does not properly carry food to the stomach) that is currently being well managed on medication, which he happily sits and waits for when it\u2019s medication time; he will likely need this for life. However, one should not mistake this malfunction for lack of normal behavior, for this guy truly lives life to the fullest.\n\n\nThank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (https://anewchancear.org).

However, Buddy has a complicated side, he is a dog who respects men more and would do well in a home with a man only. He still takes time to warm up to his special man even, but it is cute to see him acting like a puppy with certain members of our kennel staff. Buddy is good with other dogs, he is housebroken and will be your most devoted dog, but you have to work to win his heart!No cats for Buddy!\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website!

Reggie is working on his dog interactions but has made huge strides and is doing really well! He loves other dogs but tends to overdo it in play. He's been training through Paws 4 Fun in Lincoln, NE, and they have offered to give his adoptive family a free go home training session, a free class pass, and 40% off training for his first year home. His perfect family would be willing to continue his training so he can learn the correct way to play. He does have a high prey drive, so he would do best in a home with no small pet (cats, small dogs, etc.). Reggie is an athlete so he needs a tall fence for his exercise needs. He is neutered, microchipped, and current on vaccinations.  If you are interested in meeting Regulus fill out an application on our website www.revolutionrescue.com and we'll be in touch.",

He has some training and knows, come, sit, wait, stay, down, leave-it and paw. He is fixed, microchipped and his vaccines are current until May. All of Diesel James paperwork says he is a black lab mix. Please contact 321-271-4041 or hopeforbrevard@gmail.com if interested to adding Diesel James to your family.",

Most times it's fairly easy, but this one's a real stumper, and Friday's not talking. \n\nIn early March 2020 Friday was found as a stray right here in West Orange. We posted her on Facebook looking for her family, but haven\u2019t had any luck finding them. So, after the state\u2019s required 7-day hold, off to the vet she went. We thought she was under a year, but the vet thinks she might be as old as 2.  (We're guessing now she's about 3.)  She weighed in at 60 lbs. She was brought up to date on her shots (rabies and distemper vaccinations), was checked for parasites and tested for heartworm and lyme disease (all negative), and was spayed. This was all part of getting her ready for adoption. Unfortunately, this was exactly when the Corona shut down started and we had to temporarily suspend the WOAWL\u2019s shelter adoption program while we, as a community, dealt with the crisis. \n \nSince Friday is at the shelter and not in a home situation we can't tell if she is housebroken, but the ACO's tell us she tries to keep her run clean; and since the shutdown happened on the day she was returned to the shelter, she hasn't been around children. The only other dog at the shelter available for adoption was not good with other dogs, so we don't know how Friday would be in a home with another dog.   \n\nWhen West Orange municipal buildings closed due to the Corona virus restrictions, it included the township's animal shelter. The animals weren't ignored, however, and the Animal Control Officers were in the shelter every day feeding and cleaning and socializing.  Now they are doing adoptions by appointment.  \n\nIf you are interested in seeing Friday please give us a call at 973-736-8689.  It\u2019s voice mail 24/7, but we try to return calls the same day.   \n\nThe shelter is located at 311 Watchung Avenue, West Orange.  Once the Corona crisis is over and \"things are back to normal\" we should be back to the regular adoption hours,  Monday through Friday 4:30 \u2013 5:30 (except holidays) and the 1st & 3rd Saturday\u2019s 11AM \u2013 3PM.   Hopefully it won't be too long before the shelter is once again open, and appointments won\u2019t be necessary.\n\n\n..............\n..............\n",

But it is hard to resist my cute and sweet face !\n\nI am house trained and crate trained.\n\nI am quite energetic and I love to fetch the ball and play tug of war'.I am also smart, and I like to learn new tricks. I am pretty good on the leash but sometimes I get too excited.\n\nI am a bit skittish at times. I need a quiet environment and someone that builds up my confidence and trust. Once I trust you, I will cuddle on the couch with you.\n\nI like kids, but I might be too much for them and vice versa. But it would be super cool to hang out with a teenager.\n\nI need to share one more thing ; I have some liver issues that are manageable. It just requires prescription foodit does not change my goofy temperament and my energy.\n\nIf you are looking for a dog with an original and fun personality, I am your guy! Please fill out an app and I can show you how awesome I am!\n\nTalk to you later!\n\nCheck me out on TV, just type-in http://bit.ly/JaxonBrown\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.",

            "description": "Sophie is a very sweet, friendly, affectionate girl who we rescued in February, 2019 from a house where she was left behind when her owners moved after being evicted. One of her rescuers, Kara, is also fostering her, along with her other dogs, including some other fosters and three large horses. Understandably and to be expected after what she's been through, Sophie has anxiety issues and is currently on prescribed Prozac from a veterinarian, which has really helped her calm down and helped her to become less reactive. She's playful, and loves attention and to be loved on, but has some trust issues that need to be worked through. She has come a long way and although she tends to be dog selective, she is friendly with some dogs. Her playmate is Harley, rescued on the same day and also being fostered at Kara's, and they play together in the large, fenced in area outside all day and then stay inside at night.\n\nI'm Michelle and one of her rescuers, and she's really found her way into my heart. I take her on outings to a local park where we take walks together and she loves it. She doe have a tendency to pull on the leash.\n\nFrom what we gather from the neighbors where she was abandoned, Sophie had at least one litter of puppies that died and her owners neglected her before abandoning her, so this sweet soul has been through so much and has come a long way in a short time. She needs structure and stability and the ideal home would be a place with no other pets and no small children. She is very reactive and fearful of Kara's three large horses and her cats that stay upstairs. She can be triggered by new things so that's why it's important for her to have a daily routine with no chaos. She needs someone with a lot of patience, understanding, and experience with dogs that have behavior issues stemming from being abandoned. She does well in a very structured, routine environment, doesn't do well with a lot of changes.",

She is quite fearful in new situations and gets startled easily. She will pancake to the floor when nervous and will need someone who is patient and understanding to help her feel more comfortable and confident. Despite that she is incredibly happy and sweet! Especially with the people she lives.\nBecause of her general fearfulness, we are looking for a home without small children. Punkin LOVES running around outside in the yard and is always so happy to strut around. Punkin has a history of ingesting toys and had an obstruction surgery when she came to rescue. Because of this, potential fosters/adopters will need to be very careful with the kinds of toys she gets and she cannot be unsupervised with toys that she may be able to rip apart. Punkin does not get along with other animals and she will need to be the only pet in the home. She will also need a home with a 6ft fence. Punk is a special girl who needs a very special home who understands her needs and can make sure she is always being set up for success. She really is a loving girl who likes to snuggle and watch tv and give kisses she just didn't have the best start in life. She was mistreated and never learned love. We just know there is someone out there that can understand her and give her the life she deserves.\n\nHer needs can be discussed in further detail upon request.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting or adopting this animal, please read the following before submitting an adoption application on our website - fureverhomerescue.com.\n\nAdoption fee includes spay/neuter, microchip, age appropriate vaccinations, 4Dx test (covers tick-borne diseases (\nA\n\nnaplasmosis\n\n,\nLymes, E\n\nhrlichiosis) as well as heart worm)\n\n& de-worming. We ask that our dogs live indoors unless otherwise stated & agreed upon. We ask that applicants live in our area.",

            "description": "Wiley is a handsome adult male Pit Bull Terrier mix who was brought to the HSOV on March 6, 2020 by Good Samaritans who found him on Briggs Hill Road in the Belpre Ohio area.\n\nWiley has a brown/brindle-and-white short smooth coat, a long tail, and a beautiful white face with a small patch of brindle around his right eye and a large patch of brindle at the base of his right ear. He has a rather slender muzzle, a black button nose, and short semi-erect ears.\n\nWiley was a very frightened boy being confined in a kennel when he first entered our shelter and was not a happy camper for the first few weeks with us :(  We had hoped that his owner would see the preliminary photos we took on March 8th or that someone will recognize him but, sadly, that did not happen. Wiley was most likely a very different dog in his home with a family who loved him.\n\nWiley weighs approximately 55-60 lbs and has already been neutered.\n\nIn compliance with the Ohio Revised Code, Wiley was held for three days so that his owner would have an opportunity to come and reclaim him with proof of ownership but that happy reunion did not take place.\n\nWiley is beginning to warm up to our kennel techs and, though he is still nervous in our shelter, Wiley is showing us more of his personality.  He will obey the 'sit' command, so someone in his past has spent time training him to recognize that word.  Wiley also loves treats and appears to be an intelligent boy.\n\nThese updated photos were taken on March 22, 2020 when Wiley accompanied two of our core volunteers whom he has learned to trust.  He was still a bit cautious of the 'paparazzi' following him and snapping photos but nice to that lady just the same.  Wiley loved the 'good boy' treats which were offered to him in reward for good behavior.\n\nWiley will require an experienced handler and an 'alpha' leader to give him guidance/training.  Our kennel techs would be happy to introduce you to Wiley and to share their experiences/knowledge about him.   \n\n",

She is in great health, weighs approximately 45.8 lbs and can run like a dog half her age. Paisley is an extremely smart, quiet and sweet dog that would make a wonderful companion for an older or retired person. She loves to be outside, go on walks, but is also content lying on the couch having cuddle time. Paisley shows no hesitation when you open a car door and always seems up for a ride- she just lies down and relaxes or looks out the window. Paisley shows some interest in other dogs and will try to mingle; she has not shown any aggression, but seems better with male dogs vice female dogs. Paisley has done really well when meeting new people and is good with older children. Her foster says Paisley is always looking for food, treats or toys. When vetted, Paisley was found to be heartworm positive, but has already started treatment. Whoever adopts this wonderful gal will receive everything Paisley needs to complete her treatment. She comes fully vetted, spayed, and microchipped. If you would like to meet Paisley, please call Hands to Paws Rescue or her foster at (706) 664-8305. Adoption fee is $125.00.",

Our veterinary partners estimate that Tilly is 8 years old at the time of intake in March 2020. Poor Tilly was stabbed in the face several times and left to die. Fortunately, she was picked up and brought to a shelter, and as soon as Rescue Dogs Rock NYC became aware of her, we immediately brought her to our veterinary partner for the medical care she required to recover from her injuries. Unfortunately, Tilly lost an eye to this cruelty, but it doesn't stop her from enjoying her new life. Tilly is super sweet with people. We haven't yet tested her with dogs, so stay tuned. Tilly is understandably fearful of men, and she is not a city dog. She requires a home in the suburbs where she will be loved, cherished and kept safe and she will lead a life that is far happier than the life being led by the individual who did this to her. If you can give Tilly that life, please apply online to adopt Tilly at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

As a matter of fact, I was recently adopted and returned. I can't wait until I have a family of my very own, because I really like people! My human friends here at Lucy Mackenzie know how much I like cuddling and going for walks. I particularly enjoy the more leisurely-style of walk, one where I can stop and smell the roses, and everything else in between! I'm proud to say that I'm a pretty smart girl, and am well-behaved, too. I'm open to meeting other dogs, and could maybe even live with one, if we got along. I can't live with cats, though - sorry. If you've been thinking it's time you adopted an adorable and adoring dog, stop in and meet me today!",

            "description": "WILLY!!!\n*GOOD with LARGE FEMALE dogs only, GOOD with kids 5+, NO cats\n\n* ADOPTION FEE $400   www.unbreakabull.com/adopt\n\nThere was a movie years ago called \"Free Willy\u201d that was about a whale named Willy that people were wanting to free from captivity and get him back to the ocean where his real home was. Well, I\u2019m not a whale and I don\u2019t live in the ocean, but I do look like Willy in the movie, so that\u2019s close enough :) I was sitting in a shelter after being found as a stray. The shelter was not my home, and I didn\u2019t belong there, but there was not a huge drive to get me out. Well, then came a virus and they were wanting to close shelters and get dogs out and into other homes. Here was my chance!!! A plea went out, and Unbreakabull snatched me up! I am 2.4 years old, and I love life!! I get along great with other dogs, but I am not good with cats. I chase them, and I\u2019ve been told that\u2019s not okay for me to do, but I still do it anyway, so I was told no cats in my life. I am a very high energy boy!! I need someone that has a very active lifestyle and wants to be out walking and hiking and doing lots of things other than sitting at home. While I am good at sitting around when I want to, I prefer to be outside doing things. I am getting used to being in a kennel, but I am not a fan of it and will cry, so apartment living might not be a good plan for me if you are going to be gone all day. I love being with people, hanging out on the couch with pillows that are comfy, and playing with my toys. I just returned from an 8 week board and train program, and I did great! I absolutely love the female persuasion of my kind, but they have to be bigger because otherwise I see them as a cat, so no small girls for me. I also like to be the only male dog, so I can\u2019t be with males at all, but I am okay going on walks and meeting them. I just like to be the sole king of my castle. For the person who adopts me, they will receive FREE additional training if they would like from the board and train facility that I went to. It\u2019s in Sturgeon Lake, MN, but they are excellent people there, and I learned so much while I was there. My soul is finally free, and I\u2019m just waiting for the perfect home. So, while I am waiting for my forever home to be found, I will just enjoy the fact that today I am not sleeping on a shelter bed, but a nice comfy one. If you are looking for a handsome, active boy to be your forever friend, please head over and fill out my application. Until I see you, Love Willy (UPDATED 01/01/2021)\n\n\n\nFore more info and pictures visit\nhttps://www.unbreakabull.com/adoptabull",

You'll love how cute and puppy-like he is when her rolls around on the ground to scratch his back. He enjoys kids as much as grown-ups and is great with all people. Harvey needs to be the only pet in the home and should be an indoor dog due to allergies and sun sensitivity. Harvey is looking for a wonderful forever family who will enjoy company as much as he does.

See I was found as a stray and although I had a micro-chip, my old family told my rescuer that they no longer wanted me. I'm not sure what I did wrong. I'm a very sweet boy, I LOVE cuddling and I really don't ask for much. \n\nI'm housebroken and working on kennel training with my foster family. I get along very well with children and other dogs (when properly introduced, and only been tested with a female). \n\nI\u2019m up to date on vaccinations, neutered and microchipped. I am heartworm positive, but currently undergoing treatment. I'm waiting for a family of my own where I can feel safe and love for the rest of my life. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our dogs are healthy, spayed/neutered, vaccinated and on heartworm preventative. They live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. Many have basic obedience skills and all have been temperament tested. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, please visit our website to complete an application: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt\n(please note: app cannot be done on a mobile device)\n\nIf you have any questions, please email us at adopt@takepawsrescue.org",

            "description": "Morely is a 3 year old big love bug of a dog! He is a staffordshire terrier mix and weighs a whopping 80lbs! He was found running the streets of Dayton and was brought into a rescue that was located in a boarding facility and they soon discovered that he wasn't a fan of other dogs so they ask HALO to take him. Since living at HALO, we've introduced him into a few playgroups and he is adjusting well, however he likes all of the attention to himself so we are asking that he be an only dog! He tends to have a prey drive and will focus on small dogs but he is managed with a head halter (gentle leader) on his daily walks. We also ask that you have a 6' privacy fence because of his reactivity to small dogs (and squirrels). He is PERFECT inside a home! He does not destroy anything while left alone, completely potty trained, and respects furniture and will lay on his bed beside the couch! He loves everyone- never met a stranger!!! He LOVES kids!! This dog is truly the best addition to anyone's home! \n\nIf you want to meet Morley or find out more information, please fill out the application below: www.halok9behavior.com/forms",

Nothing is known about his background and who knows what he's endured or how long he was out there all alone, fending for himself.\n\nClint is currently staying at Graced Kennels in Augusta, Georgia in a huge outside kennel made especially for him and paid for by Vida, who loves him very much but with eight dogs of her own, couldn't keep him. He is such an affectionate, loving, friendly, playful dog and craves a lot of human affection. Clint loves people, is good with kids over age twelve, loves to cuddle but is very reactive towards other dogs and so needs to be in a home with no other pets. He has anxiety most likely from living on the streets and is taking anxiety medication. He gets as much love and attention as possible at the kennel, but it just doesn't compare to a forever home.\n\nHe gets lonely and wants nothing more than human interaction and affection. Hands to Paws is concerned about his quality of life and feels that he would be happy and really thrive in a forever home with his special someone, where he can get all of the attention that he so deserves.Clint is microchipped, heartworm negative and on heartworm, flea, and tick prevention.\n\nImagine how rewarding it would be to give this lonely, beautiful soul a home of his own and the opportunity to become the dog that he's meant to be!",

This 9-11 year- old Lab/Shi Inu mix loves people, is dog-friendly and is a snuggle bug.  Because he is blind (he can see some shadows), he loves being near his human\u2014so if you are looking for a companion pet, he may be the perfect dog for you.  Along with being house-trained, Dexter is crate trained at night.  He loves to chew\u2014but don\u2019t worry!  He only chews on deer/elk antlers and his toys\u2026not yours! With his blindness, Dexter is looking for a family with older children, so he doesn\u2019t accidentally knock them over.  His best environment is a ranch-style home or one with baby gates on stairs.  A fenced yard is best because once he knows his yard, he will love sniffing and exploring to his heart\u2019s content. No swimming pools, please. He does require daily medicine, but he takes it like the champ that he is. \n\nWe hope you will open your heart and home to this wonderful and special dog.  If you are interested, please complete the application at hsuc.org.  His tail is wagging just thinking about his new family!",

She is still working on house training (but doing very well with it) and although she can be a little possessive of food/treats/toys, she is not as bad as when she arrived. She\u2019s vocal, gentle when taking treats, and walks well on a leash. She would do better with older kids as she gets excited to play and tends to nip the humans on accident; we're still working on that! She\u2019s absolutely gorgeous and has come a long way since she came into foster care.\n\nIf you are interested in pursuing an adoption and you live in Texas , please complete the application (links provided below). The process includes a vet check, calling references and doing a home visit. \n\nhttp://www.texassleddogrescue.org/web_documents/tsdr_application.pdf\nor\nhttps://www.formstack.com/forms/?1632205-WX2Zb144ZP\n\nPlease note the following:\nWe usually do not facilitate out of state adoptions.  (Exceptions can be discussed but will be based on previous big dog experience and will require same adoption process.)\nChildren in the home or that visit often must be at least 6 years of age. (Exceptions can be discussed but will be based on previous big dog experience.)\nAdoption donation is due at the time of adoption.  Puppies under 1 year are $300. Dogs 1 year to 7 years are $200 and dogs over 7 years are $150.  As this is a donation, it will be non-returnable if dog is returned to rescue.\nDogs are not placed on a \"first come, first serve\" basis but rather the best home for the dog. \nAll dogs placed by TSDR will be:\nspayed/neutered\nvaccinated for distemper/parvo, rabies, and bordetella\nheartworm tested and treated if needed\nmicrochipped\nother vetting as deemed needed\nNew owners will receive copies of all available vet information and must agree to keep them current on all of the above.",

I need a home with somebody who is experienced with socializing scared dogs. If done properly, I will trust you. But please do not expect that I will come into your home and respond to love and attention. I do better if crated, left alone and allowed to come out of my shell over time.  I need a home with a privacy fenced yard.  I can be pushy and bossy with some other dogs. \n\nI am a male Dachshund/Shih Tzu mix. I am about 7 years old and weigh 25 pounds. I am neutered, heartworm negative, current on shots, microchipped and on flea/heartworm prevention. I have also had a dental done a d a negative fecal. My adoption is $250. \n\nI have never been around children and if frightened or grabbed at, I might bite.\n\nPlease email for an adoption application.\nWe do not adopt out of state.\nDue to many bounced checks, we now require that adoption donations be cash only.  However, if you make a general donation to the organization (not associated with the adoption of a pet) we do accept checks and paypal.  If you are unable to adopt right now, won't you please make a donation to help care for the pets?  THANK YOU!!",

He is actually mellow and gentle and can be trusted in the house when you leave. And will more than likely be in the exact same spot when you return! \u2026the dog bed or couch all curled up.\nHe does enjoy the return of his family and will show it by doing a little dance, prancing and whine some, as to say, I\u2019m so happy your home.\nHe will let you know when he has to go outside to do his business by going to the door.\nIf your looking to take Chauncey out and about, you will be glad to know, he\u2019s fantastic in the car!\nHe will harness up by helping.. good on the leash.. and will jump right in your vehicle. At first he\u2019s curious enough to look around, but after a few minutes, he settles right down. So don\u2019t forget he\u2019s in the back seat when you return home!\nHe can not be trusted off leash. He will chase deer, rabbits and squirrels. And he\u2019s fast!!\nHe\u2019s fantastic with adults,  strangers and well mannered kids. As you may already know, pitty\u2019s like to be warm, so a spot in the bed would be great, if not a nice warm blanket at night would be appreciated. Will sit and give paw on command.\nChauncey does have one rule, he WANTS  to be the only child. He actually needs to be (including cats) He does have fear aggression.. he is not comfortable around other dogs. Something in his past unfortunately happened and now he is always on edge and does not trust other dogs, sadly. We do not want him wondering if he will have to protect himself when at HOME, where he should feel safe and loved.\nSo if you are looking for a quiet companion\nwho knows the house rules already, and will give you sweet kisses.. then this is your guy!",

            "description": "Please contact Sheilah (muttmatchla@aol.com) for more information about this pet.GIGI (female, light brown) & FELIX (male)\nIt's not often we post two dogs together but we feel strongly about keeping these two together as they are very bonded. Gigi & Felix were owner surrenders to the Lancaster shelter. Why? Because a new baby was on the way! We're not sure how these two are related (mother/son or litter mates) but their previous 'owner' said they had them both since puppies and they have lived together their whole lives. Upon impounding they were separated and would have been euthanized alone but we couldn't let that happen! We reunited them and what a happy day that was. They were so excited to see each other they hugged and kissed each other for hours. At some point we may have to consider separating them in order to find them homes but we are holding out hope that someone sees how bonded they are and be willing to adopt them together.\nThese two are a unique mix of Shepherd (possibly Malamute) Boxer or possibly Bulldog. We believe Gigi and Felix are approx. 6ish years old. They are a very affection pair, love humans including children although they are fairly energetic, depending upon the children, a home with small children may not be ideal.\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS & PROCEDURES\nMutt Match L.A. does not adopt out of state nor do we adopt on a first come first serve basis but rather to the home that is best suited for each particular dog and breed. An application, home check, contract and adoption fee are required for all adoptions. All dogs will be, or required to be, spayed/neutered, current on vaccinations and microchipped before adoption. Most of our dogs are from local LA area shelters, we generally have no prior history for them.\nAdoption fees vary between $350 - $450 for puppies 8 weeks - 4 years, $300 5 - 8 years and $250 for dogs over 8 years. Adoption fee covers spay/neuter, vaccinations, microchip a wellness check, any additional medical expenses necessary and of course the all the love and daily care we take with each dog before they are adopted.\nWe believe a well behaved dog is a happy dog and companion. Therefore, we require at least one session with one of our recommended behaviorists for a reduced fee which is not included in the adoption fee.\nFor additional information or questions, please email us at info@muttmatchla.org. To submit an application, please visit us at www.muttmatchla.org. Mutt Match L.A. is an all volunteer rescue, please allow at least 48 hours for a returned response of all inquires.\nThank you! We look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nREQUIREMENTS & PROCEDURES\n\nMutt Match L.A. does not adopt out of state nor do we adopt on a first come first serve basis but rather to the home that is best suited for each particular dog and breed.

She was rescued from a boarding facility with her sister, but they were originally rescued from a rural KY shelter as feral puppies.\n\nDue to lack of socialization, Lexi has many feral-like tendencies. After four months, she will approach her foster mom on occasion, but still does not tolerate being pet. She LOVES the company of other dogs and playing with them is the only time she feels confident. So, she will REQUIRE a playmate.\n\nLexi does not walk on a leash. In fact, she wriggles and flails in fear. It would not be safe to even attempt to walk her right now. So a fenced yard is REQUIRED.\n\nLexi is a dog for someone who wants the challenge of making a difference in a dog\u2019s life. The challenge is just giving her time to trust, however long that may be :)\n\nDue to Lexi\u2019s extremely timid behavior, she is only a foster-to-adopt. This means you have to foster her to see and decide if you are able to commit to her forever :) Must be local (NKY/Cincinnati)",

We think he knows some Dutch language, and he came rom Germany.  SABOR loves long walks and run off his energy.  He needs much more excercise and is very aggitated toward adopters because of it.  A big yard or lots of excercise would do wonders.  He definitely will bnd if not overbond with his guardians when given the chane and a yard and hoe to protect.\n\nSABOR is very healthy and is only 3 1/2 years old and has been completely vetted aslisted below.\nBelow is the list of vetting inluded in SABOR's adoption fee:\n-Neutered\n-Heartworm Negative\n-Up-to-date on all shots\n-Rabies\n-Deflead\n-Dewormed\nSo very healthy and needs no vetting.  Microchipping is required with this animal.\n\n\nDo you qualify to adopt SABOR?\n-Inside dog\n-Fenced in yard\n-Good vet records or willing to make them\n-This animal must be already microchipped or be microchipped per adoption contract\n\nCall us for more inform,ation or email us-we reply quickly!\n(270) 302-6813  Open 7 days a week from 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.\nOwensboro Humane Society\n3101 W. 2nd Street\nOwensboro,  Kentucky   42301\nowensborohumane.org (website)\nOwensboro Humane Society Facebook\n\n",

A Good Sam picked her up and turned her into Animal Control where we were thankfully notified. Her left had to be removed as it was ruptured and riddled with infection. Wendy's right eye was already damaged so she is now blind. She has adjusted very well to not having sight. Wendy gets around with confidence while wearing her protective \"head halo\". She's low-key, a perfect lap dog, gets along well with all animals and people. Wendy deserves love and we know that her forever family is out there! Please email us at info@asafefurrplace.com if interested in adopting Wendy! 1/24/21 2:42 AM",

Please EMAIL apassionforpaws@gmail.com and wait for confirmation of your appointment before coming to visit the Akita Ranch. We also request that visitors wear masks. Adorable Ava is the perfect blend of Akita and German Shepherd! This young adult female currently weighs about 70 lbs. Ava's hobbies include going on walks, running and playing, eating treats and getting her hair done! She is selective about her canine companions and definitely prefers them to be larger boy dogs. She can be a little shy with new people at first, but warms up very quickly... she is a very sweet young girl that loves to be brushed and is ready for her forever home! Ava would do well in a home without cats or children under 18. She is very trainable and listens to direction. She would do best in a home where she can be active, going for walks and playing in her yard and then come inside to settle down next to her humans. A true companion, meet Ava today!\n\nEmail: apassionforpaws@gmail.com for adoption informationVisit Akita Ranch 28930 Ellis Ave, Romoland, CA, Open 10-5 daily BY APPOINTMENT ONLY.

She enjoys running and playing with her ball. She can be a bit quirky with other dogs.\n\nNoah's Arks Rescue is all about giving an Abused Animal a second chance at life and to experience what true love is. We take animals that have been tortured, abused, and neglected and supply the emergency medical care required to get them well.

Saber was rescued from the side of a very busy highway. We can only guess how he came to be there, but his fearful behavior indicates he had been abused. With patient, compassionate treatment, he has formed bonds with a few people and is learning to trust new people more quickly. \n\nThis gorgeous boy does well with other gentle dogs, and he's learning to live with cats. He can get possessive about really yummy food, so we're looking for a foster or adopter who will follow a training plan to help him get over that. Saber needs an adults-only home for now, with people who will continue his training and give him all the love and attention he needs.\n\nPlease fill out our Adoption application: https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/24333/generic\n\nSomeone will reach out to you ASAP to get the approval process started.",

I am a Rat Terrier/Chihuahua Mix puppy who's birthdate is estimated to be 1/24/2020.  I am very bonded with my brother as we love to do EVERYTHING together.  We love playing in the yard, chasing each other around the house, eating together, lounging on the floor together.  We are super playful and full of energy.  We love playing with other dogs as well.  When they are in separate rooms, the other is looking for him.  If you would consider keeping us together that would be so wonderful as we love each other's company.\n\nIf you'd like more information about me and my brother, please send CiMAR an email so they can send you all the information about adopting me.  You can also find more pictures of me on their website:  http://www.cuzimatter.org/adopt-a-dog",

Dillon was probably never a family dog, so he would need love and patience to teach him what living in a home was like. He is dog selective, so a meet and greet is a must. We would probably say that he would like to be an only dog, as he has not liked the many dogs we have tried him with. Dillon does seem a bit reactive to kittiesaw well unfortunately. . Dillon loves to hang out with kids who are respectful of him. He loves the 3 year old daughter of one of our volunteers!",

            "description": "Ramon, a.k.a. Ro, is an energetic, approximately 3 year old boy. According to Wisdom Panel, Ro is 50% American Staffordshire Terrier and 50% Border Collie. Ro is approximately 80 pounds, neutered, and up to date on shots. Ro is house trained, crate trained, and knows sit, shake/paw, down, stay and come. \n\nRo was saved from an overcrowded shelter just days before being euthanized. Although we don't know much about Ro's past, we know that he is still learning to trust humans and understand that they can be kind and loving. Ro's new family will need to be patient and give him time to adjust to his new surroundings and build trust with them. \n\nRo would do best in a calm, dog-savvy home without any small human siblings. That said, he would LOVE to have one or more canine siblings to show him the ropes in his new home. Ro gets along great with other dogs. He has not been cat tested. \n\nRo is a smart, silly, sweet boy who will be a loving member of a family that is willing to give him the second chance he deserves. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our dogs are healthy, spayed/neutered, vaccinated and on heartworm preventative. They live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. Many have basic obedience skills and all have been temperament tested. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, please visit our website to complete an application: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt\n(please note: app cannot be done on a mobile device)\n\nIf you have any questions, please email us at adopt@takepawsrescue.org",

I love to run, I love water and I have the energy to keep up with a busy life.\nMy perfect forever home would be one with a busy life that likes to do stuff outside ( I really like outside stuff). I like kids but older ones are more fun because I like to play. I know the house is not the place to potty and my crate isn't either. I like my crate and I like to sleep there. I don't like being outside by myself but I love it if I'm with my best human friend. I don't really like other dogs, but some girls are ok to play with but really like being the only furbaby and I can toss my own ball.  I love long walks and I know how to act on a leash and in public ( I promise not to embarrass you).  I learn super fast and I know I still need to learn more rules. My Foster mom says I'm the sweets and I give her great kisses. She's helped me learn lots of stuff but I still have a lot to learn so you would need help teaching me. I think I would really like agility training or barn hunt training.  ( those sound super fun). Well that's all have to say but my Foster mom will tell you anything else that you want to know about me.",

I know how to sit and give paw and love to cuddle on the couch with my human.  I love my brother Puddles, and thankfully they let us play and live and sleep together here, and when we are on opposite sides of a fence we talk to each other\u2026 our worlds have been turned upside down, and I know our dad couldn\u2019t help getting sick, but I miss the comforts of my home and snuggling with dad and Puddles\u2026.\nHere I\u2019m friendly with all the humans, I love attention and don\u2019t want to share you with those things they call cats\u2026I can share you with my brother of course and maybe even other dogs\u2026 I am a little nervous here there is lots of noise and commotion and remember I\u2019m 13, this really wasn\u2019t part of my game plan for my golden years.  I know I\u2019m not as cute as I used to be, I am wondering if you can see past that and see me for the good boy that I am\u2026.I\u2019ll be so ever grateful if you take me home with you\u2026and of course if you could by some miracle take both me and PUDDLES together, we promise to be the best pups we know how to be and show you every day how grateful we are that you are giving us a second chance on love and home.  Please remember it\u2019s the season for miracles, and don\u2019t wait too long, remember I\u2019m 13!!!  Love and kisses, Clay\n",

            "description": "Hello I\u2019m Puddles! \nI am about 9 years old, 45 pounds, people say my pics make me look smaller than I am, so I guess that makes me what they call photogenic, right???\n I was turned into the shelter with my brother Clay at the beginning of this thing the humans are calling a pandemic!  Our human dad got sick and he could not take us out, or feed us, and barely could get out of bed\u2026so one of his friends thought we would be better cared for here. The people here are really nice, but let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s not the home we are used to, we miss our dad, snuggling on the couch that\u2019s the life we knew for our entire lives\u2026\nWe are house trained, and only go potty when we are being walked\u2026we both keep outstandingly clean kennels, anything else is just not acceptable!!    We try to put on a happy face here, we are very friendly and love all the humans that we meet\u2026however, those little frisky felines are animals that we don\u2019t understand, and we would prefer to go to a new home that didn\u2019t have any of those.  For a while we went to this thing called a college\u2026there were lots of younger grown-ups there and they gave us loads of attention, love, walks it was fun\u2026they had so much energy and kindness to give to us, and I got to be with my little although older bro Clay.  The semester ended and the fun humans had to go home so we are back at the shelter.  Today when we met the woman who is helping us write this, I went straight up on the agility obstacle without being bribed with a treat, and she even took my picture while I was up there!  I know how to sit, give paw and lay down, and lets face it, I like treats\u2026so I\u2019m happy to learn new things for them\u2026.hey they are yummy!!  Don\u2019t you like cookies?\nI know it\u2019s a real long shot\u2026but if you could find it in your hearts to adopt both of us, it really would be the season of miracles.  Thanks for reading all of this\u2026hope to meet you soon!  Love and but wiggles PUDDLES \n",

The test showed that his retinas are not strong enough so he will not be able to have the cataracts removed. Fritz will need to be on 2 eye meds for the rest of his life. (1 morning and 1 evening). He will also have to have his eye pressures checked every other month. Fritz likes to be around his humans. He has some anxiety when he can't hear or smell someone and he thinks he is alone ( like when his foster mom runs to the basement). He also barks when his foster family leaves the house. \n \n\nUpdate April 20: Fritz went to the eye vet last week for his cataracts. We started him on daily eye drops and scheduled the test to see if his eyes are strong enough for the surgery to remove his cataracts.\n\nFritz is a 6 year old miniature poodle that was recently released from a commercial breeding facility. He is a sweetheart that is leaning how much fun it is snuggle and live in a house. He is learning that he likes dog beds but toys and treats will take more time. \n\nFritz has 2 mature cataracts. He is blind in one eye and can only see light and dark in the other one. Fritz also has some dental issues and may lose some teeth during his dental. \n \n\nFritz and Felipe are not a bonded pair but Felipe helps Fritz get around. Fritz will require a calm fur sibling to help him get around. He will also require a flat home with minimal steps so he won't fall. Fritz will also need a home without small children because sudden movements scare him because he can't see.\n\nFritz's adoption fee is 300.00 and he will be ready for adoption after his neuter and dental. \n\n\n\tWe are an all-volunteer rescue located in Omaha, Nebraska. All dogs are cared for in volunteer foster homes until they are adopted. We do not have a facility.\n\tLWDR does not ship or transport dogs.\n\tApproved out of area adoptions are considered.

I am a Rat Terrier/Chihuahua Mix puppy who's birthdate is estimated to be 1/24/2020.  I am very bonded with my brother as we love to do EVERYTHING together.  We love playing in the yard, chasing each other around the house, eating together, lounging on the floor together.  We are super playful and full of energy.  We love playing with other dogs as well.  When they are in separate rooms, the other is looking for him.  If you would consider keeping us together that would be so wonderful as we love each other's company.\n\nIf you'd like more information about me and my brother, please send CiMAR an email so they can send you all the information about adopting me.  You can also find more pictures of me on their website:  http://www.cuzimatter.org/adopt-a-dog\n",

            "description": "This is Preeya, she is a 4-6-year-old girl that was released from a mill where she spent her whole life breeding puppies. She has been learning the ropes of what fun it is to be a family dog and not a commodity. \nPreeya is now up to date on vaccinations and had her first dental. Unfortunately, during her dental she lost a number of teeth, falling out or needing to be extracted. Preeya will need a soft diet as she finds it difficult to chew a whole meal, but she loves food!\nShe has also had some issues with spotting, so we had a number of procedures done including a Cat Scan. Preeya also underwent a surgery to repair a bladder bubble and hernia to make sure things were all good inside. She is recovering like a champ!\nCurrently we are working on potty training and she will go outside on command, but it\u2019s a work in progress! She is potty pad trained and will need those for the times she cannot hold it. A home with little carpet would be best for her to avoid confusion between carpet and pads. \nShe is good around other dogs of the same size as her, she does prefer women over men, but she warms up with some quality time spent together. She does need a fenced in yard as well as someone who is home most of the time and also, she will need another dog already in the home to help her adjust and to make sure she's not afraid. Being from a mill, she still has some skittish and shy behavior that will take her awhile to adjust.  If you think she might be the little girl for your home, let us know and we'll arrange a meet and see how things go.\n\n1. A home with someone home most of the day to help her learn. \n2. A home with little to no carpet. \n3. A home with another small dog to help her feel safe.  \n4. A home with a fenced in yard. \n\nAll of our dogs are current on vaccinations which include Rabies and Distemper/Parvo, they are spayed and or neutered, have been fecal tested and heartworm tested, and had a dental cleaning if necessary. They are all on heartworm and flea/tick preventative as needed in rescue.\n\nThe adoption process is an application, a vet reference, a home inspection, and a lifetime contract. The requested adoption donation for all of our dogs is $300.\n\nWe do not REQUIRE a fenced in yard (some dogs do not require a fence, as long as they can walk well on harness and leash. This is decided by what is best for each dog individually.) \n\nWe are willing to adopt out-of-state applicants but you must travel to the Omaha area to meet and travel home with your dog. We do not transport or ship dogs. \n\nIf you are interested in adding this beautiful baby to your loving family, please visit our website and fill out an adoption application at http://www.nebraskadachshundrescue.org/adoptapp.htm \nThe Adoption fee is $300.\n\n",

            "description": "Audrey is going stir crazy in the shelter. She is ready to RUN! Audrey has a strong personality so she needs to be the only dog or with submissive dogs. She is not a fan of felines either. Audrey is great with people and would an amazing addition to an active household.\nAudreys scars speak volumes this girl has been through so much in her short life so far. We cannot imagine what she must have had to endure. Audrey is a dominant female, and does well with other dogs who have submissive or tolerant personalities. Audrey did much better around male volunteers this weekend than the last time we met her. Audrey was curious about the cats nearby, but backed away from them once she investigated. Audrey is so deserving of a loving home and TLC.\n\nAudrey is currently in the care of the Vermilion Parish shelter and will be fully vetted updon adoption or placement in a foster home. To adopt or foster, please complete the adoption application at AAVArescue.com",

It was obvious that he wanted to be friends but just didn't trust people.   He has improved dramatically but it is possible when he moves to a new home he may regress.  There is no doubt that it will take time to readjust to a new place which is not uncommon. Apache is used to us and his surroundings now and is doing great so he just needs someone that understands that it will take time for him to come around and get used to a new environment.   He would do best with a person who has had experience with scared dogs in the past.\n\nApache requires a home with a fenced yard and probably also a dog about his size. He loves to play but can play a little rough sometimes so a dog a lot smaller than him probably wouldn\u2019t be a good idea. He also needs a home with no children since he can get scared and kids move quickly!\n\nHe does have a fear issue with a leash being put over his head so that is why he needs a fenced yard. This is something that could eventually be resolved but it would probably take a while for him to get comfortable with it enough so the best option for him is a fully fenced in yard at this time.\n\nApache will make a great addition to the right home.\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please complete our Adoption Application by copying and pasting the following link into your web browser: http://www.caninecastaways.org/adoption-application\n\nFor a full list of dogs we currently have for adoption use this link:  https://www.caninecastaways.org/adoptable-dogs\n\n\nMEDICAL INFO:\n\n\nThe following has been or will be done for this dog...\n- Basic Exam by Veterinarian\n- Spayed or Neutered\n- Heartworm Tested\n- Placed on heartworm preventive\n- Basic Bloodwork\n- Urinalysis\n- Microchipped\n- Intestinal Parasite Exam and medication\n- Vaccinations\n- Placed on Flea preventive\n\n\nADOPTION DONATION: $250\n\n\nThis adoption donation helps to cover the vet expenses for this dog including heartworm preventive which is dispensed at the initial vet visit and then goes with the dog at adoption. All vet records will be provided to adopter. \n\nVisit us at www.caninecastaways.org",

The shelter guessed he is about 4 yrs old but he could be older.. He's not telling! Boomer is about 45 lbs. He's a friendly guy and gets along with everyone. Boomer has finished his heartworm treatment and is ready to go on some adventures with a new family!\n\n**BECAUSE OF OUR REQUIREMENT FOR A HOME VISIT, WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO ADOPT TO HOMES IN THE NORTHERN VA / MARYLAND / DC METRO AREA**\n\nWe have adoption events EVERY SATURDAY from 12-3 p.m. Please note that not all dogs can attend every event, so if you are interested in meeting a particular dog, please complete a no-obligation application on our website at http://www.muttloverescue.org/application.html OR write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nUpcoming adoption events:\n\nMutt Love Rescue is doing everything we can to ensure the health and safety of our volunteers and adopters while continuing our mission to find homes for as many dogs as possible.\n\nEffective immediately, we will not be holding our weekly adoption events. Dogs available for adoption can be met by appointment only. Potential adopters should submit an online application at http://muttloverescue.org/application.html. Once we receive your application, we will contact you to let you know the next steps.\n\nWe are always desperate for foster homes, now more than ever. If you are interested in fostering during this difficult time, please complete an application... unless you are a previous adopter/foster, then you can just contact us via phone (703-988-2608) or email (adopt@muttloverescue.org) to tell us which dog you want to foster!\n\nFor information on sponsoring this dog, please write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nWE NEED FOSTER HOMES! FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE EMAIL ADOPT@MUTTLOVERESCUE.ORG.\n\nVisit us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/muttloverescue\nFollow us on Twitter: @Muttlove_Rescue",

ALL DOGS LISTED ARE AVAILABLE.\n\nAre you looking for the sweetest pup who loves everyone and will keep you entertained? Meet Bo\n\nHe's currently 6 months and over 50 lbs! He's going to be around 70 lbs when he finally stops growing.\n\nHe was in a car accident when he was about 9 weeks old, and ended up with a broken leg from it. Bo was in a splint for weeks and was the best patient imaginable. He's all healed up now and it's like nothing ever happened to it! He's the happiest dog and he loves everyone he meets. He really likes to play with other dogs, so a nice, active, younger adult dog friend would be his dream. Cats? He loves them a bit too much and thinks they're chew toys, so he needs a home without them.\n\nBo loves other dogs but is too rough with the little ones, so is looking for a dog companion closer to his size.\n\n*Bo is UTD on vaccines, is neutered and on monthly flea/tick prevention.\n\n* Must have a medium to large adult dog in the home who is a match with his energy and loves to play\n\n*His adoption fee is $250 ($265 with tax)\n\n* Adopters must live within 2 hours of Florence, KY.\n\nIf you have specific needs that aren't addressed in the bio (children in the home, small animals, apartment/condo living, etc) please email to ask if the dog is suitable for the environment before submitting an application. Once the application is submitted, please expect someone to email you with questions and/or provide more information about the dog is we are unsure that the dog may be a good fit.\n\nMost importantly, please be honest! We have many people tell us what they think we want to read, not what's truthful. If there are discrepancies, your application will be denied. It's important for us to place dogs in a home that's suitable. You may be a stellar owner but possibly not a good fit for the dog you were first interested in adopting. We're not trying to offend anyone, we're trying to set everyone up for success. We're a best fit rescue and will verify your vet and personal references.\n\nAdoption Process:\n\nStep 1: Complete a \"no obligation\" application on our website, www.pawprintsnky.com\n\nStep 2: PawPrints will review the application, verifying Vet and personal references as well as landlord requirements/restrictions (if applicable)\n\nStep 3: IF your application is approved, we will call you to schedule a meet and greet for you to meet the pet.\n\nStep 4: If the meet and greet goes well, we will schedule the home visit.",

In his first couple of years this bashful boy was not often exposed to every day life situations, if at all and perhaps he was even a stray at some point. \n\nSince arriving at TVR, he has become more confident and secure in his surroundings. He genuinely loves to play with the other dogs and feels much safer in their presence and with a pack. He is becoming more comfortable when interacting with people but it still takes a long time for him warm up to new people. In spite of his fears, he does know how to walk on leash and seems to be reasonably house-trained although accidents can occur during any new and/or stressful situation.\n\nLinus belongs in a home with at least one other dog who is super friendly and confident to take the lead and show him the way. He will benefit from an outgoing counterpart that will help him find his courage. His human can help soothe Linus by brushing him (he loves it) and filling his dog bed with cozy blankets before tucking him into bed. \n\nWe are not 100% sure what incident occurred to make the world an intimidating place for Linus, but we know in our hearts that with the right person by his side and the security of a home he will learn to feel safe and at ease. He will finally be able to take a breath and live a happy peaceful life which he deserves. \n\nAre you ready to give this sweet, gentle and shy boy the home he has been waiting so patiently for?\n\n*HEARTWORM UPDATE: Linus has completed his heart worm treatment and is ready to go to his new home! It is very important for Linus to be kept on a monthly Heartworm preventative (such as Heartgard Plus) and not miss a dose. Linus will need to be taken to the adopters primary vet in 9 months (approximately June 10th, 2021) to be retested for Heartworm Disease.\n\nLinus is available for adoption through Their Voice Rescue (www.theirvoicerescue.org). If you are interested in Linus, please contact them by email (adopt@theirvoicerescue.org) or by phone (540) 497-3562.",
