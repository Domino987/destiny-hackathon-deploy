I am housebroken, crate trained, good with dogs of all sizes, I like the cat and kids would be fine too. Because of my size older kids might be better but I like them all... I have a lot of energy because I am only 11 months old but I am not hyper. Just playful which is why i need a fenced yard. I am also very sweet and affectionate and when I am not exploring I can be found cuddled up next to my foster mom or one of my foster siblings. I weigh appx 56lbs now and still have a bit of growing to do. I also LOVE the snow. I had so much fun when it snowed recently.\n\nIf you would like to meet Juno send us an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back with you as soon as we are able to.\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting...my spay, a heart worm test, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention, a microchip and a wellness exam",

She is estimated to be 7-8 months old and 35-40 lbs and recently arrived in NJ from our friends in Louisiana.\n\nMarley is dog friendly and her former owner said she lived with cats and did well. She is a sweet, playful pup and is doing well with the dogs in her foster home however she does not always like to share her toys with her doggie friends. She is a quick learner and eager to please and would do best in a forever home that can work on her resource guarding issues so owner experience is preferred and no small children. She is fixed, up to date on vaccines and microchipped. Marley is heartworm negative.

            "description": "Lisa / Female / 1 Year / 34 lbs / Aussie Mix / Toronto\n\nMeet Lisa! Lisa can make anyone's heart melt when she rests her head in your lap for attention. If you happen to stop petting her - she will offer her paw and gently encourage you to continue. Her fosters say she is 95% a sweet little angel and 5% a tornado. When she gets the zoomies, look out! She becomes a whirling ball of energy and playful excitement, sucking everything she can grab into her vortex of temporary chaos! Overall Lisa is gentle, affectionate, sensitive, quiet, loyal and eager to please her people. Lisa will make the ultimate companion to an active family who shares her love of fun!\n\nWith people she knows or has met before, Lisa is affectionate and wants attention right away. She can be mouthy and demand your focus at times. She has no sensitivities around her body and likes to be touched everywhere! With new people she can be hesitant and prefers to observe from a distance. Eventually, her curiosity will draw her close enough for a sniff. If strangers try to pet her before she is ready, she will back away. Proper, respectful introductions, space and time are key to winning Lisa\u2019s trust. Lisa is very timid around loud or unexpected noises, she startles easily and will bolt and hide. She is only looking for homes without children under the age of 14.\n\nWhen left alone Lisa is crated and settles right away. She loves her crate and has no problem hanging out in there. She has only been tested for short periods, so if transitioning her to a regular schedule she will need adjustment. She is currently getting 2-3 long walks a day and has been successful with this schedule. With consistent opportunities to use the washroom, Lisa is fully potty trained.\n\nTrue to her breed, Lisa is higher energy and needs more stimulation than your average dog. She has some typical Aussie instincts and can be mouthy or nippy when she is seeking approval or attention. She will jump all over her humans if given the chance and if it is not corrected, she becomes even more excitable. Adopters should be prepared to provide extensive mental stimulation, and keep outdoor walks structured. Lisa would likely benefit from having a \u201cjob\u201d outside like carrying a backpack. She is very sensitive and empathetic and may yowl when she hears sirens outside.\n\nLisa is smart and eager to learn commands. She has quickly learned sit, lie down, focus, crate when asked, and come is a work in progress. She is learning to walk on leash but she still pulls a lot. Her progress so far has been excellent, and she is very responsive to gentle guidance. She has a high prey drive and is extremely sensitive to sounds. She wants to explore everything but will also stop suddenly to take in her surroundings. Adopters should have some experience with leash training and be confident redirecting as needed.\n\nLisa\u2019s ideal family would live in a house, with a fully fenced back yard. She would love the opportunity to run freely, but can\u2019t be trusted in an unsecured space yet. She may be able to adapt to the city, but would prefer to leave in a quiet or suburban area. She is best suited for country living with lots of space to live her dreams. Lisa has not been officially tested with dogs or cats.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Lisa please apply at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/adoption-info#adoption-form\n\nLisa\u2019s adoption fee is $700.

            "description": "Miss Maggie came to Critter Cavalry malnourished, shy and unsure of herself, but with a heart of gold. Though we dont know her background, we know it was heartbreaking. She is deathly afraid to be in a home without another dog. If she has that familiar furry friend that she can trust, she will feed off their lead and become the sweetest cuddlebug ever! Without that companion, though she shies at the slightest noise, movement or even shadow and as such must have a home with another dog. She has been around all kinds of dogs, from puppies to seniors big and small and loves them all and seems to have no concern about cats. She makes friends wherever she goes. Everyone she meets either describes her as 'sweetheart' or 'love' and she certainly is both! After she begins to trust - which is no time if there's a dog around - she will climb all over you and mouth and lick and wiggle from head to toe and absolutely loves being with her people - especially if they're on the couch or bed. She has an amazing red ticked coat, expressive golden eyes and the cutest 'yoda' ears guaranteed to melt your heart!\n\nMaggie's an interesting 1 to 2 year old Cattle dog mix - short and stocky and loves to use her oversized puppy paws to bat at her new friends. Don't let her small stature fool you, though, she has energy for days and adores running around 'pretending' to chase a toy... She's always the fastest one to it, but frequently prefers to let the other dogs get the toy so she can 'herd' them in using that cattle dog nature. If she even thinks it's about to be playtime she starts hopping and barking - ready to run! She's now healthy, housebroken and learning basic manners quickly and just needs a loving forever home that will teach her to trust again. This girl is a love.needs a fenced yard for sure and another dog for the long haul.\n\nHer love of dogs is insane and she really has been amazing with every one we've come across regardless of age, attitude, gender, size, etc- and we've been around dozens this month!!! She is interesting with new humans, though.... she just doesnt know what to think of us! She's another special little lady for sure though :) If you are interested in a second companion dog that will love to the moon and back please email us at: ccrtennessee@gmail.com\n\nADOPTION FEE REQUIRED. Contact ccrtennessee@gmail.com.",

            "description": "Scooter Eugene loves you already and you've only just met through a photo! Scooter is a perfect, laid-back, and intelligent senior gentleman, and is SO happy to just snuggle (and play ball of course).\n\nScooter was surrendered when his family was no longer able to care for him, so he has a lot of experience in a family environment. His interests include: treats, napping, and his ball! Though Scooter may be 12 years old, you wouldn't know it when the ball comes out! Scooter does enjoy fetch, but also loves just batting his giant ball around and entertaining himself.\n\nScooter doesn't have any negative traits to speak of. He has loved every human and dog he's met. Potential forever homes must know that he does have a partially prolapsed rectum, and a heart murmur - both have been checked by a vet - neither of which are detrimental or affect him at all in his daily life.\n\nScooter would thrive in a home that allows for naps, as well as would play ball with him daily (ball is life). It would be excellent if he wasn't left alone for long periods of time, as he enjoys his jaunts around the yard every 4 hours or so. He is potty-trained as long as he can get out in that time frame. He is also crate-trained.\n\nScooter weighs about 23 lb, is neutered, microchipped, UTD on vaccines and heartworm negative and on prevention.\n\nScooter can't wait to show you his goofy personality, and his favorite ball! Once you meet him, you'll no doubt fall in love!\n\nTo find out more about Scooter Eugene, contact his foster mom, Brittany, at brittany.hutchins18@yahoo.com or text only to 802-752-5683. His adoption fee is $225. He is fostered in eastern North Carolina.\nPlease use the foster momma or dad's contact information above for questions.\nThe process always begins with an application which can be found at The Boston Terrier Rescue of East Tennessee website\nNote that in most cases, we do not adopt to families with small children, e.g., 'under 6,' as a precaution to the child's safety and the dog's safety. In some cases with larger Boston mixes or other dogs, we do make exceptions. Please ask the foster momma.\nWe prefer to place dogs within driving distance of where they are being fostered. If someone from outside the local area is approved for adoption, they must be willing to personally drive/fly to get the dog. The East Coast division (NC/SC/VA/MD/DC) does have special transport capabilties for their kids. Ask them.\nAlso, submission of an application and fee does not guarantee adoption of any specific Boston since that particular dog may have applications pending or may not be the right match for you.",

            "description": "Meet Comet, a 3 year old Great Pyrenees looking for his forever home. Comet was rescued from an old/abandoned junk yard located in the Eastern foothills of the Appalachian mountains. He was severely malnourished and missing much of his beautiful fur.  Through rescue and an amazing and committed foster family, he is making wonderful progress in every way. \n\nComet is a \"gentle giant\" and commensurate with his breed, is a guardian of his kingdom.  He loves to be loved. He will nuzzle, lift his paw up to get your attention, and walk in synchronicity with you. He has a zen-like energy about him. However, he carries a trait to be independent and GUARD, patrolling day or night. He likes to use his giant size and booming bark at any sights and sounds, or just because. He settles down once he knows everything is safe and secure. He is an intuitive, independent thinker and formidable protector.\n\nWith continued positive reinforcement, Comet was able to be introduced and integrated with the smaller resident dogs. However, it is always with supervision when they are together.\n\nComet's new family must have a fully and sturdy fenced in yard. We will give preference to families with Great Pyr experience because he certainly is representative of the breed! Absolutely no small kids - 15+ only. Owners with resident dogs must understand slow introduction and integration. We will provide training assistance with his adoption. \n\nThe adoption fee of $400 will include spay/neuter, microchip, age appropriate/required vaccinations, treatment for heartworm and any other necessary medical treatment to assure a healthy new pup for your family.\n\n\nIMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: Although we do our best to describe breed, since our pups all come from shelters we can not and will not make any guarantee on breed or size. We can tell you that they are 100% RESCUED! And that is the BEST breed!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting/meeting , please visit our website at www.starfishanimalrescue.com or you may complete the online adoption application on our Facebook Page https://www.facebook.com/starfishanimalrescue/app/134425496630143/?ref=page_internal Once you complete and submit your dog adoption application we will set up an appointment to meet this pup!\n\n*please note that we are a foster home based rescue and we do home visits as part of the adoption process - we are unable to adopt to families who live outside of the Chicago and surrounding suburbs. Thank you for your understanding.",

            "description": "ADOPTION REQUIREMENTS\nFenced yard\n\nMy name is Thor. I am a Chihuahua/ Beagle mix looking for a new home. My person was no longer able to care for me so I went to this great foster home until I could find a new family. I am the perfect combination of my breeds. Not to say that I am perfect because if you know either breed you know that's not true but I am a good boy. I look like a Chi and sound like a beagle on the rare occasion that I have reason to bark. I am a complete lap dog and love to sleep curled up with my foster mom. I am pretty low energy so I don't need much activity to be happy. Going for walks sometimes would be nice but as long as I have a fenced yard I'm good. There are 2 things that make me mad. I do not like to be woken up suddenly if I am asleep and if my foster siblings crowd me too much I will get grumpy. For this reason I would be good as an only dog and in a home without kids. When I am made I might bite which is typical Chihuahua. My foster mom knows just to leave me alone until I am nice again. Thankfully this doesn't happen very often. I am about 2 years old and weigh appx 10lbs.\n\nIf you would like to meet Thor send us an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back with you as soon a we can.\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting...neuter, a heart worm test, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention, a microchip and a wellness exam.",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble.

            "description": "Meet Cobra Kai! This pup is \u00bd Cane Corso, \u00bd Pit bull, and 100% a handsome devil. This giant boy is about 70 pounds and 7 months old (as of 1/28/21). The Cobra Kai way (referencing the great Karate Kid movies and comeback show) is: STRIKE FIRST, STRIKE HARD, NO MERCY! And our boy came with that motto ingrained in his brains. He lives for snuggles and scratchies, he loves to prance around and play, but he also enjoys finding all sorts of ways to keep us on our toes! \n\nHe can snuggle next to you on the couch for hours while you nap; or you can wake up to a hole in his dog bed with chunks of foam covering the floor. He can keep himself entertained with his toys and stay on his spot like a good boy while you leave the room; or you can be gone for 2 minutes and return to a pulverized xbox remote. He likes to mix it up. \n\nKai was surrendered to our vet at just 2 weeks old due an umbilical abscess. After surgery and a couple days in the hospital, he was taken home and bottle raised in foster care. Bottle puppies can struggle to develop normal social and emotional behaviors without their siblings and mother around. Kai started showing aggressive behaviors around 6-8wks old - protecting his toys, growling when disturbed, excessive mouthing, and other behaviors that may be understandable in some settings, but quite concerning for a young puppy. \n\nAs a rescue, we elected to keep him (not post him for adoption) and continue his positive behavior training until his behaviors could become more predictable/controlled/stable. The last thing we'd want is for him to be adopted with mild behaviors, those behaviors intensify with a well-meaning but incapable home, and then he return unadaptable with intense and ingrained challenging behaviors. We feel that he's finally at a place where the right person(s) could take over from here and help him blossom into the squishy love-muffin he's meant to be! \n\nThrough months of positive behavior training, Kai has become much more comfortable with - and often even looks forward to - people taking his bones and toys and tolerant of us messing with him whenever and wherever. He also continues to become less mouthy and develop more and more self control. He's definitely not perfect and since he's a dog, he never will be. His training will absolutely need to continue, especially as he matures throughout the next couple years. \n\nKai currently lives well with 3 cats and 2 dogs and has had a several dog friends in the past. However, Kai is quite keen on cat chasing and has developed an large issue with meeting other dogs. Kai's cat chasing is currently easily curbed with a \"leave it!\" or a \"come!\" command. BUT, the behavior would need to be continually worked on and never tolerated nor trusted, or more simply, no cats allowed. \n\nKai recently started lunging and barking angrily whenever he sees another dog. He does well with his foster siblings - a chihuahua and a pit bull, and had several dog friends of all sizes as a younger pup, but otherwise he hadn't met any dog friends over the last couple months. When we tried to introduce him to a dog friend last week, he started with lunging and barking and couldn't settle down to even officially meet. We've back-tracked a bunch to \"below his threshold\" to start working with him on this, but this is a big new behavior that will need to be continually worked with by us and then his future adopters. \n\nKai has so much potential and he wants so hard to be a good boy. He'll need a very committed home dedicated to continuing his positive-behavior training and helping him be the bestest boy he can be. For further information about adopting Kai, please email MFdogadoptions@gmail.com or go to our website at MFdogrescue.org. Adoption application and approval required. We have an adoption fee of $350 which covers a small portion of Kai's medical expenses covered by the rescue. Kai is located in Christiansburg, VA.\n",

I lived on the streets so I am still learning the ropes as a posh house pet.  I am working on potty training but still have accidents, I know I will get the hang of it though.  I have been learning all about the leash and it\u2019s not so bad, I do enjoy long walks.  I love playing with other dogs and I sometimes do not want them to stop when they want too so I tend to try to push them if they want rest before me.  I love people and I have been introduced to the wonders called your bed, I love to sleep with you but be careful if you leave me unattended the pillows sometimes explode, I don\u2019t know how it happens but it\u2019s really fun.  If you are ready for fun and adventure and to learn with me along the way I\u2019m your Lady as the name says, please consider me for your furever family member.\n\nOur organization only adopts within the United States.\n\nFaith and Hope is a multi-state rescue with locations in Texas, Washington and Oregon. All dogs are rescued from the state of Texas to and transported to our Washington and Oregon locations with placement in their adoptive families. Our $425 adoption fee includes all core vaccinations (DHPP, rabies, spay/neuter, microchip)\n\nIf interested in learning more, please email us at faithandhopeadoptions@gmail.com or fill out our online application.\n\nhttps://www.faithandhopefoundation.org/adoptionapp\n\nIf interested in learning more about our adoptable dogs and adoption process, or our foster home program, please contact us at above email.\n\nDue to the number of requests that we receive on our puppies and dogs, please be advised that all adoption applications are processed in the order received. Once we send you an application, your place in line does not get reserved until your application is returned to us.",

I need to be the only pet and live with adults only. I need someone with dog experience and patience to help me work through some of my challenging behaviors. I enjoy learning and training. With the right person and time to settle in, I can learn to relax. Also, I enjoy quiet walks. My trainer has helped me learn to feel comfortable and relax in a dog crate. This will be a helpful tool to use as I get used to a new environment. If you are looking for a little buddy who will provide companionship and have the time and patience to help me adapt to a new environment, I might be just the dog for you.",

I lived on the streets so I am still learning the ropes as a posh house pet.  I am working on potty training but still have accidents, I know I will get the hang of it though.  I have been learning all about the leash and it\u2019s not so bad, I do enjoy long walks.  I love playing with other dogs and I sometimes do not want them to stop when they want too so I tend to try to push them if they want rest before me.  I love people and I have been introduced to the wonders called your bed, I love to sleep with you but be careful if you leave me unattended the pillows sometimes explode, I don\u2019t know how it happens but it\u2019s really fun.  If you are ready for fun and adventure and to learn with me along the way I\u2019m your Lady as the name says, please consider me for your furever family member.\n\nOur organization only adopts within the United States.\n\nFaith and Hope is a multi-state rescue with locations in Texas, Washington and Oregon. All dogs are rescued from the state of Texas to and transported to our Washington and Oregon locations with placement in their adoptive families. Our $425 adoption fee includes all core vaccinations (DHPP, rabies, spay/neuter, microchip)\n\nIf interested in learning more, please email us at faithandhopeadoptions@gmail.com or fill out our online application.\n\nhttps://www.faithandhopefoundation.org/adoptionapp\n\nIf interested in learning more about our adoptable dogs and adoption process, or our foster home program, please contact us at above email.\n\nDue to the number of requests that we receive on our puppies and dogs, please be advised that all adoption applications are processed in the order received. Once we send you an application, your place in line does not get reserved until your application is returned to us.",

Collins, CO)\n\nOrca's two favorite things are chasing squirrels (never getting anywhere near them, but that won't stop her from trying) and snuggling with any human (kids included) that she can find.  If there aren't any humans available, a bed by a fire, a sunny window spot or buried deep in blankets will do.  Such a snuggle pup.   She is a healthy approximately 6 year old spayed pup who (reluctantly) visits the vet for her yearly checkups.  She does fantastic in the house, and having free range of the back yard (squirrel chasing for exercise) but she doesn't quite understand the outside world. Putting her on a leash and taking her out proves to be quite anxiety inducing, and also not a fun experience for the walker.  She welcomes human guests into the house with four paws on the ground and a very enthusiastic tail wag.  \nShe would be perfect for someone who has no other pets or any animal visits and has a place for her to run free in a fenced yard.",

            "description": "Huey / Male / 2 Years / 56 lbs / Hound Mix / Toronto\n\nMeet Huey! Huey is as friendly as they come - he wants to be pet by everyone. When he wants attention he will follow his people around and paw for attention. As much as he loves to be near his people, he loves playing with dogs even more! He is described as playful, active, friendly, loving, smart and curious. Huey would do best with an active family who shares his love of socializing and outdoor adventure!\n\nHuey is a total gentleman and greets his family by sitting for attention and pets. He even greets the concierge of their building because he knows there\u2019s a head rub waiting for him! Huey wants to sniff everyone, and may pull to introduce himself. His foster family is trying to establish boundaries by teaching him that not everyone wants to be sniffed. Even though he loves affection, Huey likes to decide when he gets it. He has a threshold and will remove himself when he has had enough. His crate is his decompression spot and he feels safest in there. He is a very sensitive boy and does not appreciate being grabbed or hugged, so he is only looking for homes with kids ages 10+. Any children should be dog savvy and understand when to give him a break.\n\nHuey has heart worm and is currently receiving treatment for it. Part of his recovery has meant he\u2019s been primarily on bed rest in foster care. His activity is to remain low until his treatment is complete. This means keeping him calm, and offering controlled access to toys and play time. Walks should be kept slow and short for the time being all while keeping a close eye on his excitement level. He will need adopters committed to providing mental stimulation throughout the day to drain excess energy. In June of 2021, he will need a HW retest to confirm if treatment has been successful.\n\nWhen left alone Huey is crated and settles very quickly. He may resist at first but with a small treat he generally goes in without issue. As long as he\u2019s had enough exercise, he will sleep while left alone. On leash Huey pulls a lot and he is very strong. He is most excitable at the beginning of a walk when he is over stimulated and eager to explore every tree. True to the hound in him, he will follow his nose wherever it takes him. Leash etiquette will be an ongoing part of his training once he is able to go on full walks again.\n\nHuey is smart, but extremely stubborn. If you don\u2019t have a high value treat that motivates him, there\u2019s a good chance he will go deaf. He knows sit and his foster family is trying to teach him to do so before and after he enters their home. He wants to take off and will fire through doors like a bullet if you let him. For his safety it will be very important that this structure continues in his forever home.\n\nHuey\u2019s ideal home would be a house with a fully fenced backyard. He is used to spending lots of time outdoors and would appreciate the space to run freely once he is off reduced activity. He could adapt to an apartment as long as his family is very active and can meet his needs. He will need adopters that in the mean time, understand his physical restrictions. Huey would do best with a family who has some dog experience and at least one other playful dog in the home. Huey would prefer homes outside of the city.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Huey please apply at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/adoption-info#adoption-form\n\nHuey\u2019s adoption fee is $800.

            "description": "In June of 2020, our Cruelty Investigator picked up a thin dog with no fur at all. We can\u2019t imagine the pain poor Lily must have been in for so long; just touching her skin made it bleed. She was covered in scabs, bright pink and had many infected areas of her skin. While she had very little energy, Lily was a survivor, and has been working hard on her health over these past 7 months. She is finally ready to find her forever family and begin moving on from her difficult first few years of life.  \n\nCurrently in a foster home that reports Lily is a \u201chuge source of joy and amusement\u201d this shy but sweet girl is flourishing. She is well on her way to being potty and crate trained. She hasn\u2019t had an accident in her foster home in weeks, and goes easily into her crate but does bark for a few minutes before settling down. Lily enjoys snuggling, chewing on hard bones and now has the energy for going on long walks. \n\nLily has played with other dogs and very much enjoys wrestling and rumbling hard, so much so that she can find it hard to stop playing when other dogs are around! She would do well in an only dog home, or in a home with other dogs who enjoy a good hard romp and humans who could be proactive in reinforcing calm behavior when everyone is together. \n\nLily is around 3 years old, weighs 65 lbs, is heartworm positive and has not yet been spayed. As a big girl who can occasionally be jumpy mouthy when excited she is looking for a home without children under 12 years of age. Having an intact animal in your home is an added responsibility that potential adopters should consider. She has been vaccinated, microchipped, and is current on parasite prevention.\nBecause of the long road to recover that Lily is still on, she is being offered as a foster to adopt candidate. This comes with many benefits such as access to our dog trainer and clinic, for Lily\u2019s needs! The Tulsa SPCA will continue to treat Lily medically until she is healthy enough to be spayed, after which the adoption will be finalized. We will also soon begin treatment for her heartworms, at no cost to her adopter.  \n\nLet us know if you are Lily\u2019s happily ever after! \n\nHOW TO ADOPT\nThe Tulsa SPCA is currently operating on an appointment-only basis.\n- Click on the orange \"Interested in this animal? Click here!\" button to apply to adopt.\n- If you're approved, we'll contact you to finalize the paperwork, collect payment and arrange an appointment for your drive-thru adoption.\n- Please stay home if you feel unwell, especially if you are experiencing symptoms of fever, cough or sore throat.\nThank you for your patience and understanding during this time. These policies may change as the Tulsa SPCA makes adjustments in response to the ongoing situation.",

The shelter was going to spay her while she was pregnant and terminate pregnancy.\n\nApplications for adoption are OFFICIALLY open for 7 days. Please read through and click the link at the bottom of this post for the application. If instructions aren\u2019t followed, it\u2019s possible you\u2019ll miss the opportunity to adopt a pup.\n\u2022\nThings to keep in mind:\n1. Adopters will be required to purchase a training package from an approved (by us) balanced trainer.\n\n2. Puppies will be spayed/neutered at 20 weeks, we will not make exceptions unless there is a medical reason that the dog cannot be put under for spay/neuter. No, we won\u2019t wait till 1 year - Yes, we are aware of *possible* adverse growth affects of spaying/neutering young. Our concern is liability and avoiding accidental pregnancy. If you\u2019re concerned about our spay/neuter policy, there are hundreds of other rescues that you can adopt from :)\n\n3. The adoption process is lengthy, after you submit your application you will receive a follow up email within 10 days either with the next steps or advising we are declining to move forward. Please do not call/email within those 10 days advising you haven\u2019t heard from us. If you haven\u2019t heard from us by 10 days, feel free to email. As a reminder, every single person in our rescue is a volunteer. Once you submit the application you should get confirmation that it was submitted, if you didn\u2019t receive confirmation then the application wasn\u2019t submitted.\n\n4. Puppies (or dogs) are NOT adopted out on a \u201cfirst come, first serve\u201d basis. They are adopted out by best fit - which is at our discretion.\n\n5. We will not be accepting out of state adoptions at this time.\n\n6. It would be HIGHLY beneficial to follow our Instagram: (@californiabullyrescue) to understand our mission and our policies/stances on: training, training tools, flex leashes, crate training, harnesses, dog parks, INSURANCE, multi-dog households, etc.\n\nAdoption fee for puppies are $500 - they will have all medical taken care of (multiple sets of vaccinations, deworming, spay/neuter, microchip, rabies) and they\u2019ve already started participating in training with our trainer. \n\nThere are 4 boys, 1 girl. \n\nLink to application:\n\nhttps://forms.gle/hi6YbKL2zTx67gr79\n",

Bebop's siblings were adopted, but Bebop was held back as he appears to be complete deaf, and potentially has some vision impairment. He's been in a foster home working on some basic sign language, and gaining confidence. He will need to go to a home with at least one dog who is tolerant of puppies, especially those who might get startled while sleeping. He is very active and has two speeds - on and off! He absolutely relies on the other dogs in the home for cues to come when it's too far for him to see his hand signals. He would love a forever home who is familiar with deaf dogs and the safety concerns due to their deafness. He is otherwise completely perfect and loves to cuddle with his person and dogs!\n\nPlease visit our website at faithfulfriendsrescue.org/adoptable-pets if you are interested in adopting.\n\nI am a mixed breed dog. This means I don't have a specific recognizable breed. The rescue uses the following guide which are guesses based on my current size and age for how big I will be when full grown: Mixed Breed (small) up to 25 pounds - Mixed Breed (medium) between 25-45 pounds - Mixed Breed (large) more than 50 pounds. For more information on, please visit the website https://faithfulfriendsrescue.org/adoptable-pets.\n\nWe are setting up adoptions with approved adopters on an appointment basis. We are no longer hosting adoption events at PetSmart until further notice. We are not arranging meet and greets; but appointments to finalize adoptions to limit exposure for all. Our adoptions come with a one week trial period in which if things are not working out, we will refund your adoption fee if you decide to return your newly adopted Faithful Friend. Our adoptions must be done in person and we do not arrange transport to adopters. Our adoption fees vary and we are only able to accept payments by card* at this time but include spay/neuter, heartworm test (dogs), FeLV/FIV test (cats), age appropriate vaccines and deworming, flea, tick and heartworm medication and microchip.",

At SDHS:Koby has been microchipped, neutered, and is up to date on vaccinations. Now he's ready for his new home! Why this pet is the one for you:Meet Koby! This handsome, affectionate guy is looking for a loving home to call his own! Koby can be timid when meeting new people, so it's important to go slow, offer lots of yummy treats, and let him approach on his own. His first few weeks in his new home should be very routine (almost dull) without the stress of lots of strangers. His trainers will be happy to share tips on setting Koby up for success. Because Koby can be particular about his personal space, he will need a home with older, respectful teens (16+) or adults only. Once he's gotten to know and trust you, Koby is a total ball of mush--he'll hang out and get pets from you all day if you let him. Does Koby seem like the companion for you?

He is great with other dogs and is ready to live his life in a warm home with a loving family!\nZeus is a 5 year old Terrier mix. He is neutered, microchipped, current on all vaccinations, and takes preventive flea/tick/heartworm medicine. As with all of our dogs, Zeus must be an indoor dog. If you are interested in adopting Zeus, please email bahshelter@yahoo.com. If there are other dogs in your home, we require a meet and greet, which you can schedule via email at bahshelter@yahoo.com. If you cannot attend your scheduled visit, kindly text or call the volunteer you are meeting with before your scheduled visit. They are taking time out of their day to meet with you. Thank you!\n",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter. We look forward to seeing you soon!\n\nLink to the Adoption Application: \nhttps://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/adoption-application/\n\nAnimal House Shelter\n13005 Ernesti Road\nHuntley, IL 60142\n\n847-961-5541 phone\n847-961-5537 fax\n\nOpen:\n\nSunday-Friday from 11 AM to 7 PM\nSaturday from 9 AM to 7 PM\n\nConnect With Us:\n\nLike Us On Facebook\u00a0!\nWatch Us On YouTube\u00a0!\nFollow Us On Twitter\u00a0!\n\nAdoption Application:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/adoption-application/\n\nAdopt a Pet:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/\n\nDirections to Shelter:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/visit/\n\nAdoptable Dogs:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/dogs/\n\nAdoptable Cats:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/cats/\n",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

It is our understanding that Apollo was too high energy for them.\n\nThis is likely the case of a young dog needing more exercise.  It is our experience that many young dogs end up in shelters when their activity needs do not match their current family situation or lifestyle.  Given the right amount of attention, exercise, and healthy stimulation, we find that these so-called \"hyper\" dogs transform very quickly and positively into well-balanced, calm dogs.\n\nWe are looking for an active family for Apollo.  He will thrive with a healthy outlet for his pent-up energy.  Email us for a pre-adoption questionnaire.  woof@slvaws.org\n\nOnce you are pre-approved for adoption, you may schedule an appointment to meet Apollo.",

Laverne and I are besties so we need to go home together. The great thing about that?? We keep each other company and it helps me feel more confident! I can be a little shy when you meet me BUT I can tell you the way to my heart... A BALL! I absolutely LOVE fetch. Throw the ball a few times and I will relax and open up! Like my bestie Laverne, I love scratches and belly rubs! I do well in my crate and will let you know if I need to go outside! I have a healthy appetite and feel free to be generous with the treats (just don't tell Laverne)! \nAll dog adoptions include the following:\n--Spay/neuter surgery\n--All current vaccinations\n--Microchip\n--Wellness exam through VCA Animal Hospitals\n--Access to our Behavior Helpline for the lifetime of the pet \nFor more information or to schedule an appointment to meet this pet, please complete a Dog Adoption Questionnaire online.

My friend Baxter and I are looking for a forever home with enough love for the both of us!

Come and meet us!\nAll dog adoptions include the following:\n--Spay/neuter surgery\n--All current vaccinations\n--Microchip\n--Wellness exam through VCA Animal Hospitals\n--Access to our Behavior Helpline for the lifetime of the pet \nFor more information or to schedule an appointment to meet this pet, please complete a Dog Adoption Questionnaire online.

I will get this out of the way first, I LOVE TREATS. With that being said, I'm on something humans call a diet (insert eye roll here). But that's okay because while you're working on my leash manners, we can go for lots of walks! Shirley, my bestie, is more of a play ball kind of girl which is great if you're into that kind of thing! I'm sort of what they call Shirley's therapy dog, so we must be adopted together. That's okay though, after all that IS why you have 2 hands! We BOTH love a good scratch and belly rub! I do well in the car. I do well in my crate and I love my soft comfy doggy bed to sleep in at night! I do enjoy the company of my human friends too, so a good cuddle isn't out of the question! \nAll dog adoptions include the following:\n--Spay/neuter surgery\n--All current vaccinations\n--Microchip\n--Wellness exam through VCA Animal Hospitals\n--Access to our Behavior Helpline for the lifetime of the pet \nFor more information or to schedule an appointment to meet this pet, please complete a Dog Adoption Questionnaire online.

I absolutely love toys, treats, walks, cuddles, and... well pretty much everything! Shelter mom has yet to see me without a smile on my face! I have great dog skills and even played nicely when introduced to a little chihuahua friend, but I have the most fun when I get to wrestle with dogs my own size! Shelter mom thinks I would make a great fit for older or dog-savvy kids who I wouldn`t accidentally knock over or pull down while playing tug o` war. I`m the champion of that game!\n\nIf you`d like to get to know Atlas better, just complete our online adoption application and we will be in touch once it has been reviewed.\n",

            "description": "Early on a cold rainy morning, our shelter manager was shocked to find Casper tied to the shelter back door.  Frightened and shivering, this poor dog had been abandoned sometime during the night without any protection from the elements.  He was very happy and relieved to finally be safe and warm.  From his physical condition, it was obvious Casper had been neglected.  He was covered in fleas and his skin had a nasty yeast infection.  After a quick trip to our vet, Casper was soon on the road to recovery.  \nCasper is a snow-white, male Boxer mix estimated to be around three years old.  He is a large dog and underweight at fifty-five pounds.  This droopy-faced boy is very sweet, friendly and gentle.  He gives the best sloppy kisses!  Hard to understand why anyone would have treated him so bad.  Casper will make a wonderful family pet.  He loves people of all sizes and is friendly with other dogs.  We have not had him around cats but can test that for you.  Casper walks well on a leash and sits quietly on car rides.  He is always a gentleman and very obedient and cooperative.  We don\u2019t know if Casper is completely housebroken but he does prefer going on grass.  A fenced in yard is a must to keep him safe when outside.  This special dog deserves a wonderful forever home.  Will you make Casper\u2019s \u201chappy-ever-after\u201d dreams come true?  \n\n\nTo adopt this pet, Click \"More About Us\" and then \"Adoption Application\" to be directed to our online HSNWGA application form.  You will be contacted by our Adoption Coordinator once your application is reviewed and approved.  Due to high volume of applications, we are only able to contact those applicants that best meet the needs of that individual pet.",

            "description": "Meet sweet and spunky Cypress from down South! Cypress is a stunning, 2-3 year old mix (pit bull? lab? hound? shepherd?) who can do it all. She has the youthful energy of a younger dog (loves long walks, hikes, and fetching sticks) but she also totally falls in love with her people, and will just want to snuggle by your side. \n\nCypress loves to play, and would do well as an only dog, or with another dog who could tolerate her playful antics after they have been properly introduced to each other. Cypress has also happily been around dog-savvy cats, again with proper introductions. She's a strong and bouncy girl, so would likely do best around kids 12 and up. \n\nCypress was abandoned in a crate on the side of the road strewn with trash, and she'll need a family that will help her ease into being a dog surrounded by love and safety. She's such a quick learner (fully potty trained, knows sit and stay!) and she just wants to please her humans, so training will be so rewarding. Cypress's forever family must be willing to put in the time to improve her leash manners and turn her into the confident dog she hasn't had the chance to be ... yet!\n\nIf you're looking for a walking, hiking, jogging buddy that will also crash on the couch and adore you, Cypress is the girl for you.\n\n\nName: Cypress\nBreed: Terrier/Retriever\nSex: Female\nAge: Approx 1 year\nWeight: 50 lbs \nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\nVaccinations: Up to date\nHeartworm: Negative\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nBASED ON OUR OBSERVATIONS:\nGood with Children: Over 12 (not formally tested with smaller children)\nGood with Dogs: Yes, with dogs that match her high energy\nGood with Cats: Yes, dog savvy\n\nAdoption Fee: $475.00\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION:\nInterested in a specific dog, please fill out an application if you are interested in a dog. The number of individual inquiries is overwhelming and we are finding it difficult to respond to each one. We cannot guarantee you will receive a timely response.\n\n\nPaws New England is a rescue, not a shelter, and as such we do not have our dogs housed in one location - they are in foster homes both in New England and in our southern foster homes. If you're interested in a specific dog, please complete a short online application and you will receive a reply within 48 hours so you can ask questions.\n\n\nAt present, if a dog is listed on our website, the dog is considered still available HOWEVER, may have applications that have come in before yours but it's still too early to know if any are a good match; therefore we encourage you to apply.\n\n\n\n\nNOTICE WITH REGARD TO LOCATION OF DOGS: Please note: Paws New England is a foster-based rescue. We do not have a brick and mortar building to house the dogs we rescue. We have found that dogs in foster homes are much more adoptable because they have been observed in a home setting. Dogs listed with Paws New England typically reside in various locations throughout the south (primarily Tennessee, Texas, and Arkansas) and New England (not necessarily in the state of Rhode Island). You will be notified by the adoption coordinator of the location of the dog you are interested in so you have the ability to decide whether to pursue adoption or not.\n\nDogs transported to New England are done so at a fee of $150.00 paid directly to the transporting company by Paws New England; no additional transport costs are responsibility of adopter. This fee is included in the adoption donation.\n\nAdoption donations cover pre-adoption vet costs (including vaccinations, spay/neuter when age appropriate, and heartworm testing/treatment when necessary), a microchip, and transportation to New England if necessary.\n\nDonations for our young, healthy puppies and dogs support their fellow canines of advanced age or suffering from injuries and abuse whose donations are reduced but whose veterinary costs are typically much higher. We appreciate your understanding that your dog will help others in need.\n\nAll known information about the animal is listed above. We do our best to give accurate information, but most of our dogs are rescues and do not come with a known history.\n\nPaws New England abides by the dog importation regulations set forth in the states of MA, CT, NH and RI.",

She is a gentle giant and is ready to find her forever family. She does not ask for much just some love and affection.

His nose is always to the ground ready to explore the great outdoors. He also has an affectionate side and will melt in your arms if you scratch him just right on top of his head. \n \nSparky is working on his manners. He has a voice and is not afraid to use it when he meets knew people, dogs and other small animals. Our staff and volunteers are helping him feel more confident and learning meeting new people is not always a bad thing. \n\nSparky's ideal home is with an active family who has a big fenced in backyard for him to run around. He would prefer to be an only fur child, but would not mind some older human siblings. Sparky is looking forward to meeting you and hopes he can gain a new best friend.",

Our little buddy Dodge is ready to fill that spot! Dodge was a little nervous when he first came to us, but with the help of yummy treats and our love and affection, he came around rather quickly. Dodge loves to romp and play in the yard, snuggle up for belly rubs, and eat the tastiest treats! He is learning how to walk well on the leash and will need a little potty training. But one look in those sweet eyes and you will know every moment is worth it! So come on out and meet Dodge today and you won't be able to leave without him!\n\nDue to Covid, we now work by appointment only and work on a first come basis.  If you are interested in making an appointment, please call the HCHS at 512-793-5463.  You can see all our available animals at HillCountryHumaneSociety.org.\nAll our adoptable dogs are treated for fleas, given DHPPV and Bordatella vaccines and are de-wormed.  \nWhen you adopt one of our animals it will be micro chipped and registered at the time of adoption.  Also, if not already altered, you will receive a voucher to get your animal spay/neutered.\nWhile we do our best to determine the breeds of our dogs, the majority are strays, and we have only general appearance, coat type, size, ear type, tail, tongue color and coat color to base breed on.  It is always possible when adopting a puppy that it will change dramatically to look like another breed.\n\n",

            "description": "Sweet dog, would be good for a senior or adult home. NO small children please. He is a senior dog, but still has energy for a good walk around the block daily. Can be vocal, may not do well in an apartment with thin walls as he howls due to seperation anxiety. He was left in our parking lot and surprisingly was not claimed by an owner. He had severe dental disease upon arrival but our Vet staff cleaned and extracted what they could. He will need regular senior dog check ups with a Vet to keep his teeth/gums healthy as well as his body. Senior dogs need to visit a Vet more often than a younger dog, so please make sure this is in your budget. He was adopted since the last statement but unfortunately, was not taken care off as he should have been and was luckily returned to us. He is not a dog to be left outside, he is an inside, lap dog that is very smart if you take the time to pay attention to the signs he gives you. He will whine and walk around rapidly if he has to go outside to do his business. He will also need regular grooming so his hair isn't left to mat up and be painful. He seems to like other dogs, but a meet and greet with your dog is must before adoption. If you are interested, please submit an application and then make an appointment on burbankanimalshelter.org",

First, dogs just want to be happy and feel loved. Living inside and being a part of the family is really important to us. A lot of the things you need as humans to stay happy and healthy, us dogs need too. We depend on you for things like vet visits, nutritious food, clean water, social and play time with people and other pets, training classes, toys, and of course, lots of love and attention! Regular baths, nail trims and grooming help us to look and feel our best, while monthly flea and heartworm prevention help us to stay healthy. Did you know that depending on our size and breed, dogs can live up to 20 years? Just think of the wonderful life we could have together!",

            "description": "Woof, woof! I'm so excited you're thinking about adopting a new fur-ever family member! Here are a few things that may help you with your big decision. First, dogs just want to be happy and feel loved. Living inside and being a part of the family is really important to us. A lot of the things you need as humans to stay happy and healthy, us dogs need too. We depend on you for things like vet visits, nutritious food, clean water, social and play time with people and other pets, training classes, toys, and of course, lots of love and attention! Regular baths, nail trims and grooming help us to look and feel our best, while monthly flea and heartworm prevention help us to stay healthy. Did you know that depending on our size and breed, dogs can live up to 20 years? Just think of the wonderful life we could have together!",

He can get a bit uncomfortable when being handled and is not especially fond of hugs, but he is eager to recieve affection with petting and scratching. Though he is already 2 years old, he still gives off major puppy energy and could definitely use more training. He already knows sit and shake so he is not a stranger to learning new commands. Mojo can get rowdy, especially during play, and needs to learn that a dog his size should not jump on people too much. For this reason, we recommend that Mojo goes to a home with teens and/or adults, where there aren't tiny humans he can knock over. Mojo is also working on his confidence around other dogs. He tends to become frustrated or fearful, so we strongly recommend that his new family have previous large dog experience. Any dogs in the home should come down and meet him. We do not currently know how he would do with cats.",

            "description": "Sauro is an 11 year old former international champion show dog whose owner passed away and whose family surrendered him to a high kill shelter where we immediately were called upon to help with his rescue. This English Cocker boy is now safe with us and we will ensure that he lives out the remainder of his life in a loving and caring home that will not only love him for his beauty but also for his devotion and gentle spirit. Sauro is deaf and may have some minor vision impairment as well but he can get around just fine - just no homes with unfenced swimming pools - we will err on the side of caution on this. Also we will require a home where there are no small children- this kind soul deserves to be treated with dignity and small children can sometimes alarm and manhandle dogs- we do not want that for him and will not make any exceptions. Sauro does get along well with other dogs and cats , but mostly what he enjoys is a soft dog bed or blanket by the side of his foster mom where he can rest and watch the \"world\" from the comfort of a safe place. If interested in adopting Sauro please fill out an application at www.floridacockerrescue.org ADOPTION FEE: $275.00",

He needs an adopter who will be patient and provide him with consistency. He has mild resource guarding with high value treats and bones that needs to be worked on. He would do well in a home with another playful yet patient dog or as a solo dog as he does well entertaining himself with toys. His foster says Gonzo is the happiest dog she has ever met! Apply to adopt Gonzo today! \n\nSee below!*\n\n*Please kindly note: We do not respond to inquiries as we are a very small team!

I can sit(about a 1/2 second) I will be happy to take YOU for a walk. I like to jump, run and play. That is what life it all about, right? I am a medium size dog. Might weight 45lbs. I am around a year old and I still and a pup! I will be neutered Feb 9. One that was not trained. I am HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY! OK I am a silly goof ball. I love people. I meet Ned the cat and even though I am very excited about anything new he was boring! THOUGH it would be cool if he was out of the crate and running! THAT I might like. I am kind of in my teen stage of life and being a teen I am cool, and tough, you know. Try to impress. So I am pretty barky and pushy with the other dogs. Mostly the boys because, after all I just want them to see how cool I am. I do not care how big they are I THINK I am bigger and badder! Other then that I am all about fun. Hiking, jogging, agility( though my attention span is kind of short) would be fun. So if you are looking for a fun loving, cute, energetic, boy to teach to be all he can be I am your guy! I will make you laugh and we can have a blast!",

Her past hasn't been that great but her future will be!\nLucy is very laid back and wants to do nothing more than to be loyal and love her human. She does great with other dogs. This Gorgeous girl needs a soft bed and someone to love her. She is super gentle and affectionate and a bit on the \"shy\" side. Her spirit has been broken at some point, you can see it in her eyes, she will learn to trust again. She is such a sweetie.\nLucy weighs 65 pounds.

For adoption information go to: www.homewardbounddogrescue.com.  You must fill out an application online as we do NOT accept applications at our clinics.\n\nHi there, I am Dash, a male Catahoula mix, 1 year old and 35 lb. I came to the shelter as a stray. I am young and happy and very friendly. I love people and I am good with other dogs and cats. I love toys, especially ones that make noise. I am also very good at tug a war.\n\n\nWe are presently not holding our regular Saturday adoption clinics due to the Covid-19 virus.  We are operating on a limited basis until further notice, but we are still adopting dogs out. We require an approved application before we consider anyone for an adoption - so filling out the application is your first step.   Different dogs and puppies go up for adoption EVERY WEEK so please feel free to visit the site and click on the Petfinder link for updates. Puppies and dogs up to 2 years old are $350. Dogs over 2 years old are $250. 100% of the adoption fees go to help us save more dogs.",

She does well with dogs that aren't too in her face and will play with them once she gets to know them! Heiress loves to go for walks or just lounge around with you. She is 6.5 years old, fully vetted, and does well with kids but not cats. She is potty trained, knows some basic commands, and is very treat motivated! Heiress does have some trouble with allergies and would need to establish a relationship with a vet upon adoption. She was described as friendly, outgoing, quiet, mellow, cuddly, and protective.

He is very sweet and becomes very attached to his person at first. He looks to his people for confidence. He lived with another dog in his former home, so an outgoing dog may help boost his confidence. He's got a really soft coat and is a very pretty fawn color. This sweet boy would love to meet you!\n\nIf interested in Kaleb, please fill out an application on-line at www.puppyhillfarm.com and we will contact you for an appointment.",

            "description": "Mercury is a 5 year old German Shepherd mix (~65lbs) and has the softest ears. Mercury is people and dog friendly. He's more 'dog ambivalent.' At the dog park he gets along with other dogs, and is especially interested in smaller dogs. However, he mainly uses the dog park as a chance to go around to the other pet parents and collect head scratches. Mercury loves all people (male, female, kids and adults). He is especially good with little kids and sits very patiently as they pet him (or treat him like a drum, which has happened).\n\nThis sweet boy is low-energy, and his preferred method of working out is moving from one comfy couch and dog bed to another. He does like to go with you to the park on short walks, especially if the park has super plush grass. Rolling around in the grass is his favorite (as is attracting an audience of people to pet him). \n\nMercury is the lowest maintenance dog his foster mom has ever had. He is house-trained. He is fine alone during the day out of his kennel, and is the only dog not to chew anything, ever. He particularly enjoys Gordan Ramsey shows (likely for the food on screen). He's not into toys, unless they're toys that have treats hidden inside. He loves food and is slowly putting on weight after a rough life. \n\nMercury is looking for his forever home with lots of belly scratches, and lots of treats.",

I am not a fan of other dogs, but I don't mind a cat as long as it's nice and doesn't mind me. I am learning to walk on a leash but I still get so excited to be out and about. But if you stop I will return to your side so I promise I am working on it and will keep practicing with you. I know sit and I am working on stay. I prefer to hang with just a few people so introductions to strangers need to move slow. I am very gentle with the little human (8yrs) that is living here but anyone new I prefer treats to decide if I like them. Lastly, I am fully potty trained! I am ready to just relax and hang and give warm hugs to my new family.",

He does like to get out and go on walks and jogs, and he does well on a leash. He's good with dogs, although he doesn't interact much with my two collies. And he's learned to give my two older cats their space so they're all coexisting peacefully. \n\nBaby Boy is always ready to sit and give his paw for a treat and he loves his squeaky and chew toys. He doesn't like the kennel or getting in a car (really any small space) and he doesn't like being left alone. He'll complain for a minute or two and then he'll settle down. He's potty trained and will let you know if he needs to go out. Overall he's a super sweet dog that just wants to chill by your side.",

He loves to find the warmest, coziest place in the house and settle in for naps, and he'll never turn down a chance for scratches and pets! He's happy to lounge in the same room while you work or do his own thing if you're out. \n\nHe has met other larger dogs and was NOT nice (snarling and growling). He's also been barking at lone strangers on our walks. Honestly, it seems like pretty typical chihuahua/small dog behavior, but I think it might be an indicator that he'll need slow introductions to any dogs or strangers outside of the home. \n\nAlso, we discovered he has no bottom teeth in the front of his mouth! The missing teeth doesn't seem to be cause any issues. \n\nIce is a well adjusted pup who just needs a day or two to get used to his new surroundings and he will make a great addition to any family!",

            "description": "Kate is an extremely loving and quiet dog. She seeks touching, petting, and cuddling and would be a great family pet. She is very tame and kind.\n\nShe is potty trained but not used to a kennel. She sleeps on her foster's bed. When left alone for a few hours, she sleeps on the bed and there is no mess. She patiently waits for the foster's return.\n\nKate doesn't have a strong command knowledge but would learn very fast. She sort of understands but is still nervous. She stays, but temporarily because she wants to be with you. She responds to come. She has limited success with sit and down. She seems good with hand commands and body language. She is smart and simply needs guidance. The basics are there, and she needs someone to spend time with her (which she would like). She's very trainable.\n\nKate walks extremely well. She doesn't pull and comes when you tell her to move on. She stays close beside you. \n\nShe doesn't get aggressive around people or other animals, though she has not been close to other dogs. She doesn't seem agitated at all around them when she sees them. Even when they bark at her. She just looks at them and stays close (but not in a scared way). The only time she reacted was when she wanted to chase a squirrel. She will kind of growl when she sees similar pit bull type dog. \n\nShe would love a backyard but is quiet and might work well in an apartment too.She is a very quiet dog and rarely barks. She does have a soft/gentle whine to get your attention once in a while. She wants love.\n\nKate is an amazing companion. She wants to be sit beside and mostly on you on couch. Wants to be petted, scratched. She doesn't like to play (yet), but with love and trust, she may learn.",

            "description": "For my Petfinder.com friends, please contact the Shelter at (248) 858-1070 for more information. My ID number is 336940\n\nI am available for adoption; however due to my breed my adoption will have to be facilitated through a rescue organization. Please see the front desk staff or contact the Shelter at (248) 858-1070 for more information.\n\nMeet Amelia Braveheart! Isn't she beautiful? Amelia is a super sweet girl, who is excited about life and people! When she first entered the Shelter, she was a bit shy, but she has come to learn that the staff are friends, that give her treats and lots of attention! Amelia did well when meeting her canine shelter friends, although a bit shy with the females. This girl is eager to please and wants nothing more than to be apart of a family, where she can be included in all that is going on! She deserves a loving home, one where she is well cared for!\n\nThe following descriptions describe behaviors that were observed during testing and/or veterinary examination: Evaluated for temperament with 336798 (female), and 336985 (male). Did very well with male, she was a bit intimidated/unsure with female. Needs confidence building. Loves to play 1/27/2021\n\nAmerican Pit Bulls are a misunderstood breed; for this reason, we implore adopters to these beautiful dogs to be very vigilant in training and socialization. This breed is very energetic and will need daily exercise. Because of their strength and energy, apartment living may not be the best fit. This breed can be loving, loyal and very smart. \n\nThe above behaviors and personality traits have been observed while at the Shelter. If this animal was relinquished, information is gathered from the owner regarding behavior. Our wonderful volunteers spend time with these animals and give input on behaviors and traits. However, this description may not be all inclusive to how this animal will act in a loving forever home. Introduction to established family pets should be slow and monitored always. The same goes for children and other family members. Adopting a pet is a big decision and should be thoughtful. We suggest researching different breeds to match traits and personalities to your lifestyle. When adopting a pet, please know that this pet will be with you for their lifetime; patience and consistency will make for a successful adoption.\n\n**Age is estimated** Primary Color: Brindle Secondary Color: White Weight: 52lbs Age: 0yrs 10mths 0wks Animal has been Spayed",

His adoption donation is $275.\n\nPirata is positive for Ehrlichia, which is a common flea/tick-borne illness that is treatable and not contagious to other pets as long as they are current on their flea/tick prevention. He will need to be on a dose of an antibiotic called doxycycline for 30 days, and receive a recheck blood test 60 days after finishing the medication. Swipe left to see a video about 4DX testing!",

Beans is currently the smallest dog at CFC, and though she is the size of a puppy, we believe that she is full-grown.  Since she\u2019s arrived here, Beans\u2019 tail has rarely stopped wagging.  She loves to meet people and can often be seen standing on her hind legs against the fence in an attempt to get your attention.  She loves exploring new places with her nose to the ground and tail to the sky.  We\u2019ve also found her to be really smart!  If you hold your fist over her head, Beans will stand up.  We\u2019re not sure if this was a trick she was taught at some point or if she just likes to stand, but we think it\u2019s cool either way.  Given her intelligence, curiosity, and small size, Beans can be a bit of an escape artist.  Make sure there aren\u2019t any cracks big enough for her to squeeze through!  Beans doesn\u2019t mind being held but prefers to keep her feet on the ground.  She\u2019s pretty uninterested in most toys and would rather run around with you than chase a ball.  Overall, Beans is a cheerful, loving dog that we feel will adapt quickly to living with a family of her own.",

She loves people and getting attention, but also loves running around chasing toys and checking everything out. She is a happy girl and has infectious energy! She seems to be good with other dogs and is still pretty active. She rides well in the car and is always excited to head out with her person.\n\nIf interested in meeting Molly, please fill out an application on-line at www.puppyhillfarm.com and we will contact you for an appointment.",

Sadie does require a home with a secure fenced yard.  We do not know how she is with cats.  No apartments/condos for this girl\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur adoption fee of $250.00 helps cover expenses (vaccinations, microchips, spay/neuter, food, housing) for the homeless pets we rescue.  UAF does NOT ship or adopt our adoptables out of state (Arizona) and to ensure the best fit, UAF conducts a home visit to meet other pets and verify a safe, secure yard.\n\nTo start the process of adopting this dog or any other dog, please fill out our matchmaking form which can be accessed by copying the following address and pasting it into your browser.  Filling out this form does not obligate you to adopt.\n\nhttps://www.unitedanimalfriends.org/index.php?option=com_rsform&view=rsform&formId=2\n\nPlease email uafdogs@gmail.com to learn more about this dog.",

His breed is a mixture of Jadg terrier (Hunting Terrier) and McNab. He knows sit and wait.\nFor a high energy athletic dog Gil does have an \"off\" switch and will chill. . .eventually! Foster mom says Gil needs a very active working home. She can see him doing nose work or barn hunt actives. He is crate trained and rides in the car in his crate. Gil gets along with other dogs and LOVES to play - with other dogs, with his stick, with his toys. . .\nWith Gil's strong prey drive (he is a hunting breed), he will not do well with cats or other farm animals unless they're about cow size. The best home for him is an experienced terrier loving home with another dog to play with\nIf you would like to know more about Gil, or meet him, please email rrcainfo@gmail.com, or go to our website to fill out an adoption application at www.russellrescueca.com.",

She is a Dachshund mix and she is about a year old.\n\nWe have become the best of friends in our foster home and our foster mom would like to keep us together if at all possible. We are both crate trained and sleep in it together. We play together non stop. Layla likes to sleep next to our foster mom at night and I sleep next to her. We are both working on being housebroken. I am just a baby so I'm still learning. Layla was turned in to an outside dog shortly after she was adopted so she never really had to learn where to go. Our foster mom found out and went and got her. That's not allowed here. We are good with other dogs and with kids. I have to eat in my own crate though because I am very possessive of my food. I weigh about 7lbs and Layal weighs about 12lbs. We would be most grateful if you would consider giving us both a home together. Our foster mom said she won't separate us unless it's absolutely necessary.\n\nIf you would like to meet Misty and Layla send us an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back with you as soon as we can.\n\nAdoption donations pays for all vetting for both girls...spays, heart worm tests, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention, microchips and wellness exams\n",

He's doing really well with the resident dog, no accidents in the house and working on leash training which is going well. Aksel is a fairly relaxed boy who would love to lay near you while you work from home. He does ok when left alone but will whine a bit and also get into the trash if not put away :)\nIf you are looking for a running buddy Aksel is not your guy he would much prefer a casual stroll around the neighborhood to any marathon running. Aksel is ok with kids who are respectful of his space. Aksel would do best in a home without small dogs or cats due to his playstyle. In Aksel's original foster home we discovered he could escape from a four foot fence, so he will need a home with either a privacy fence or a tie out to keep him from going out exploring on his own.\n\nIf you have previously applied with us please email mars.apc.dept@gmail.com to reactivate your application with new interest.\n\nor\n\nPETFINDER VIEWERS: Find our applications at www.midwestanimalrescue.org\n\n*The pet you are viewing is a rescued pet which is most often from an animal control facility and does not come with a pedigree. The breed(s) listed are our best guess and are in no way guaranteed. Sometimes the pets appear to be a particular breed(s) in the pictures we receive from our rescue partners and when they arrive we are surprised to see an entirely different breed(s) in person!

            "description": "Jazzy is an 8-year-old mixed breed rescued from a high-kill shelter. This dog is current on vaccinations, microchipped, 4dx/heartworm tested, and spayed. This dog is also tested with other dogs, kennel-trained, and housebroken. We would love for you to meet this dog and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: While we typically host weekly Saturday adoption events, in order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment and/or adoption handoff. Appointments and handoffs are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, adoption appointments and handoffs are only offered for individual animals. When adopting at an appointment, please be aware that you will be taking the animal home that day. We can not hold animals to be picked up at a later date.\n\nDue to CDC's recommended COVID-19 protocols, we are highly encouraging foster homes and adopters to speak with one another via phone or video chat to ensure compatible matches and limit in-person contact. If meeting in person, our foster homes are encouraged to wear masks, socially distance, and choose an outdoor meeting spot. Should you want to proceed forward with the adoption, all adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees are to be completed electronically. Quick and low-contact animal handoff is also being encouraged amongst foster homes and adopters. As always, we include a one-week trial period with all our adoptions.\u00a0***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption! If you would like more information on our organization please visit our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org.",

I had a home, but my family was not able to give me the exercise I needed to be a happy pup, so Mostly Mutts is helping me find a new family to love!  \n\n\u2022 OTHER DOGS/CATS/KIDS:  I came in with another dog, and we get along well, though our play can be a little rough together.  I also met other dogs at MM\u2019s and liked them, so if you have a dog at home already, let\u2019s meet / Cats unknown / I haven\u2019t met kids yet at Mostly Mutts.  My former family suggests older kids, as I may bump over smaller children with my enthusiasm and higher energy level.\n\n\u2022 PERSONALITY/ENERGY LEVEL:  I am a sweet guy with a \u2018big dog look\u2019 in a compact body.  I am playful and loving, though I can be a bit hand shy and skittish with new people initially.  The MM volunteers say that I am a great dog and I like that / My energy level is 6-8, so I look forward to lots of regular opportunities to exercise in my new home.   \n\n\u2022 SKILLS/CRATE/POTTY:  I am now a student in the Mostly Mutts University training program, where I am learning lots of great doggie commands with my trainer.  I have mastered \u2018sit\u2019 (and love to do it!), \u2018down\u2019, \u2018come\u2019, \u2018drop-it\u2019, \u2018place\u2019 and I\u2019m working on good leash manners (we are working on my zig zagging and pulling) / My crate manners are good at Mostly Mutts and my former owner also said they were good / My potty habits have been good at Mostly Mutts, and my previous owner reported that I have good potty habits, also.\n\n\u2022 LIKES/DISLIKES:  I love to play, and I enjoy going to the Mostly Mutts yard play pen for a nice game of fetch, and a soccer type game with a very large ball.  A fenced yard where we can play could be nice in my new home / I can\u2019t think of any dislikes, but I would not be happy if I did not get the exercise, love, exercise, training and attention on which I thrive!    \n\n\u2022 MEDICAL:   I'm current on vaccinations, micro-chipped and neutered.\n\nI am looking for a fun family to give me a great home and love me furever!  My adoption fee is $299.00, and I\u2019m located in Kennesaw, Ga.",

They told us that Stormy has lived with older kids, and two french bulldogs. Stormy is described as shy, wants to be near you always, and smart. These type of dogs, in general, need a job to do. Their minds need to be engaged. This is not a good match if you are a couch potato (but we do have a lot of dogs who WOULD like that lifestyle)! \nTo meet Stormy please call 504 736-6111. \n\nAdoption fee includes vaccinations, spay/neuter, heartworm test, and microchip.\n*Dogs are pending behavior and other-animal assessment unless otherwise noted here.\n\n\nAvailable for adoption, foster, or rescue at the following location::\n\nJefferson Parish Animal Shelter - Eastbank\n#1 Humane Way, Harahan LA 70123\n504-736-6111\n\nPlease provide ID number when  contacting or visiting the shelter.

            "description": "ADOPTION REQUIREMENTS\nFenced yard\n\n\nHi..I am Joey. I am a Boxer mix that's in the market for a new home. I am about a year old and weigh 61lbs. My foster mom says I am a very good boy and she's only has me a few days!! She thinks I was allowed to take people food from the littles in my former home because I think your plate is my plate. I am learning really quick that's not the case!! I am a little bossy with my food so I eat away from my foster siblings. I go nuts when I see a leash because I love going for walks and car rides. I am housebroken and crate trained. I just need some training in the manners area because no one ever worked with me and I am like a big puppy. I am also a huge snuggler and I am all about the belly rubs. I am good with kids and other dogs so far but I'm not sure about those things called cats because I haven't been around them since coming here. I would be fine as an only dog as long as my humans are active and keep my busy\n\nIf you would like to meet Joey send us an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back with you as quick as we can.\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting...my neuter, a heart worm test, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention, a microchip and a wellness exam.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Odin is a large, 4 year old neutered male Great Pyrenees currently living in a somewhat rural neighborhood with his family. He LOVES long walks off leash, chasing squirrels, eating snacks, snuggling with his cats, protecting his yard and lounging with his family. He can be playful for short bursts of time but generally prefers loafing around.\n\nOdin has excellent manners on a leash when people and dogs give him a wide berth on the trail. He is sensitive and smart and responds well to positive reinforcement. He has become increasingly protective of his people and property and would likely make a good livestock or property guarding dog with some training. Odin has lived with other Pyrs successfully and generally ignores other dogs when at a kennel. He needs to develop social skills when meeting new dogs and would benefit from someone with experience doing so.\n\nHe initially enjoyed meeting new people when he arrived to his family, but over time his strongly protective nature has emerged and he now tries to guard his family from others and does not want new people close by. When in situations where he does not need to guard his people or property, such as when he stays at the kennel overnight, he does not exhibit his guarding tendencies and is fairly easy-going with other people and dogs. UPS trucks are his nemesis and he needs to be leashed or in a sturdily fenced yard when they are around.\n\nHis ideal day would be roaming his property during the day, protecting his people and property, and spending the nights inside with his people and cozy bed.\n\nIf you are interested in Odin, please fill out our Adoption Application (transport can be arranged!).",

I could sit under a tree and watch them for hours.\n\nMy friends here at The Buddy Foundation are requiring a fenced in yard for me, so I have plenty of space to run in, play with my stuffed animals and run zoomies around them.

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

Chance is a happy-go-lucky boy who always has a big smile on his face.\n\nChance can be a little slow to trust new people that he meets but once he warms up he won't leave your side. Although he can be vocal at times, his tail never stops wagging and he calms down easily once you show him that you're listening. Chance loves any type of treats that you have for him!\n\nWhile he loves being pet and getting belly rubs all day, Chance has told us that he would love a home with older children that know to respect his boundaries. Chance also gets excited and plays well when other doggy friends are around.\n\nAdoption fee includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, worming, microchip, and a start on flea/tick prevention.\n\nFor more information, please call CBHS adoptions at 319-232-6887 or email at adoptioncounselor@yahoo.com.",

            "description": "Hi, how are you? I'm Dandy! Get it? People might say I'm reserved and bashful with some new people, but to my family I'm just a big lovable lug! I can be hesitant with people I don't know and men in particular, so I'm more of a homebody than social butterfly. Since I get a tad nervous with noises and meeting new people, I'm not suitable for an apartment setting. Instead, I need a low-traffic home without frequent visitors and where any children are closer to their teens. I also will need to be the only male dog in my new home. I would like to meet all family members, including any resident dogs, to make sure we're a perfect match! Dandy is a Diamond Dog and will be shown by appointment only.

He has energy to spare and LOVES attention. He's very friendly here at the shelter. He has had a positive interaction with another dog here at the shelter. He is heartworm positive. This is a curable condition and cannot be passed directly to other animals. He qualified for a 30% off voucher through our Have-A-Heart program. We are open by appointment only to ensure we can properly social distance here at the shelter. We cannot guarantee a specific pet or type of pet will be available at your appointment. We do not hold pets. We operate on a first come first serve basis and while you can put what/who you are interested in in the appointment sign up, all appointments are general dog/cat/other animal appointments since we cannot guarantee what will be available at the time of your appointment. If you would like to set up a non-specific dog or cat appointment we have our scheduling system online now at: https://guilfordcountync.gov/our-county/animal-services/animal-shelter/animal-adoption-scheduling All adopted cats and dogs at Guilford County Animal Services come fully up to date on age appropriate vaccines, spayed/neutered, and microchipped. If you are interested in meeting any of our pets, please visit our website to schedule an appointment online. If you believe this may be your pet, please come to the shelter during business hours and bring your ID, proof of ownership, and proof of spay/neuter and/or rabies vaccination history if you have it. See our reclaiming your pet page for more information.",

One thing about me is I need to go home with someone who will understand my breed. Once I fall in love, I am protective over my people. That being said, in a home I will need to meet new people on neutral ground so I know they are okay. I do have a huge heart, but it does take time for me to warm up to some people. I would prefer a home that had no dogs though. I am great with kids, but I can be protective of them too, so I would prefer a quieter home with less traffic. If you have anymore questions regarding me, please feel free to contact the Humane Society of Sheboygan County! Primary Color: Fawn Weight: 100.4lbs Age: 7yrs 2mths 1wks Animal has been Neutered",

At only a year and a half, Chance has not had the opportunity to thrive. He lived with owners who used to let him and his sister run the streets and didn't teach him any manners.  \n\nWe have worked with Chance, and he now walks pretty well on a leash, and learning commands.  Chance is very energetic, smart, trainable, and loving.  He really enjoys human interaction and is quite affectionate.  Chance would do best with an active owner who can give him the exercise and stimulation he needs.  He does need to be an only pet and in a home without young children.   \n\nUpon adoption, we will cover two training sessions with trainer Katie Gallagher, from Kate's K-9's.",

This boy came to us with some pretty serious health issues and has surprised us all with his incredible recovery, which our vet techs will be happy to discuss with you! He also has some behavioral needs we would be happy to speak with you about. In his previous home, he did not get along with the other dog, so he will need to be the only animal in his new home. He would also be happiest in a home preferably without any children. He is the most energetic love bug you could ever meet! He is a busy body so he will need a lot of exercise and love, but he will make sure to show you that love back X10. If you think this brave guy is the right match for you, fill out an application today!! \n\nThank you for your interest in our adoptable animals! Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we do require appointments to see our adoptable animals. Please complete the adoption application and a Customer Care Associate will be in contact with you. PLEASE NOTE: We ask that when you submit your application, that you are available to schedule an appointment within the next 24-48 hours.",

Bandit came in with some hair loss but he is on the mend and doesn't need anything other than some soothing baths, good food, love, and time to heal up! Bandit weighs about 56 pounds and he has been fully vetted. Since he was a stray we don't know much about his background or how he does with kids, other dogs, or cats. Bandit is a little bit shy when he first meets people but if you have a ball to play with he will become your friend in no time at all! Bandit LOVES to play fetch and is hoping to find a human that is ready to play fetch endlessly, go for long walks or hikes, and provide plenty of tennis balls in the house to keep him happy! Bandit is a big sweetheart once he gets used to you and comes out of his shell. If you are interested in meeting Bandit give us a call to set up an appointment!",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

Please call the shelter at 972.219.3478 for more information about the heartworm treatment protocol.

She's a 2 year-old Pit Bull Terrier that is the size of an overgrown puppy, with the personality to match. She just wants to love you, and she will most likely immediately put her head in your lap the moment you meet her so you can scratch her ears for her.\n\nWe saw her in another shelter and knew we had to bring her here so that one of you could give her the home she deserves, and we think you'll agree she'd be perfect for your home once you meet her. If you've been waiting for the right pup to appear on our website or in our kennel, Akira could be the one for you. \n\nDon't delay, come meet her today!",

She is looking at the bright side and has high hopes her new family is coming soon. Roselyn can be a bit shy meeting new people, but warms up with some food and patience with our volunteers and staff. Some of her favorite things are going for daily walks and showing off her sitting skills for treats. She is the perfect medium size (48 lbs.) and would make a great walking/hiking buddy. Roselyn has not yet been temperament tested with dogs, cats, or had a recommendation about children. Stay tuned for updates!\n\nIf you're interested in meeting or adopting Roselyn, please complete an application at: inapl.org/adoption-application. Once it's processed, a member of our team will be in touch with you to schedule a meet and greet appointment. This is the time when you and all members of your household will come to our shelter to officially make your connection with Roselyn.\n\nRoselyn\nLabrador Retriever mix\nFemale\nDOB: 1/21/2019\nWeight: 48 lbs.\nHeartworm Negative",

In her foster home she has shown that all she needs is someone ready to teach her right from wrong, and consistency.  She was in a home with 2 other dogs. Since being returned we have noticed some fear related issues with some of the other dogs that she has recently met.  We are working with her and will be able to test her in the near future to see if she is good with other dogs and cats. She has done great with the kids in her foster home. They are 9 and up.\nThis girl is an Alpha for sure and would do best in a home with an experienced dog owner.\n",

To adopt, complete our online adoption application and an Adoption Counselor will contact you within 48-hours to schedule your adoption appointment. Adoptions for any pets in foster will be completed offsite at our PetSmart Claiborne location on a case by case basis. The safety of our foster parents and community is of utmost importance to us and it will be at the foster's discretion if they'd like to meet at this time. Thank you for choosing adoption! \n\nOkay, everything about Sugar is wonderful.  She is sweet and easy going, interested in befriending dogs and people she meets, and just plain happy.  This is a great dog; she walks nicely on the leash and gently takes treats.  She likes plush toys.  You are going to love this dog. She even spent some time in a foster home getting a head start on her training! Sugar is an Underdog because despite everything you've just read, she has yet to find her forever home! We want our Underdogs to win, so we reduced her fee to $25! To meet Sugar please make an adoption appointment at our New Orleans Campus.\n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Curry and her siblings were surrendered to us via some fellow rescuers who are working hard to rectify a hoarding situation. We are so thankful for their work and excited to find these deserving babies' forever families!\n\nCurry came to us at 8 weeks old and, thankfully, it's clear this Chihuahua family was treated well and had lots of positive experiences with both dogs and humans during their first 8 weeks of life. These babies are friendly and affectionate, eager to please and feisty, energetic and very playful. They race around at top speeds, bouncing and running and hopping and romping, for an hour and then they crawl and collapse, exhausted, into their crates. These puppies are spunky, and mouthy, and full of sass. They also love to cuddle, chew bones and antlers, and nap! They are NOT potty trained and will require lots of continued training in their forever homes including crate, house and potty training, and lots of continued responsible socialization.\n\nWe do not know the parents of these puppies, therefore, we cannot be sure how large they will be in adulthood. Best guess is that they will be 8-12 pounds, perhaps as large as 15. If small size is important to you, this is not the litter for you. These puppies would love a house with a yard, and a doggie playmate or two. Because they are puppies, they'll be fine with dog-savvy cats and respectful children old enough to have impulse control.\n\nPlease note: socializing dogs, especially young dogs, is critical to their development. Puppies need to have positive experiences with new people, places, sounds, dogs on a WEEKLY basis to ensure they do not grow into insecure, fearful or even aggressive adult dogs. Please consider this when adopting during this pandemic. Socialization is currently more difficult, but it isn't any less important, so please be sure you can fulfill this need in a new dog before committing to adopt.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete an adoption application. Because we are still understaffed due to COVID19, we will only be able to email those applicants that are approved to schedule a meet and greet. Thank you in advance for your understanding if you don't hear back from us regarding your application.",

It in no way obligates you to adopt, it is simply part of our process. If the dog you are interested in is adopted before you can meet them or if we do not currently have a dog you are interested in we still encourage you to go through the approval process. Then you will be pre-approved and ready to adopt when a dog does come along that you are interested in. Apply at www.arizonacattledogrescue.org\n\nHello, let\u2019s talk.  My name is Kane & yours is?  I am as sweet as \u2018sugar\u2019, 1.5 - 2 years old, a true petite girl at just 30lbs - like the old saying goes \u2018good things come is small packages\u2019!  I am playful outside, love to run - quick like a bunny.  I am not a \u2018toy\u2019 player but love your company and other humans & fur kids.  Inside, I get 4 stars for incredible house manners.  I would not be your \u2018alert\u2019 dog because I want nothing to do with chaos or any commotion. I prefer to zoom down into the bedroom, hop up on the bed, and snuggle against the pillow.  I love to snuggle with you but truly on my own time.  I am very sensitive to quick movement & strange sounds.  I do regain my confidence fairly quickly but do not like to be \u2018pushed\u2019.  I like my pace & I\u2019m sticking with it!  :-) When outside, I will alert you to something but not by barking - I prefer to just stand at attention. Walking on leash and riding in a vehicle are ok by me - a little hesitant loading, my recall is outstanding, I know & love my name.  I am living in Mesa with other dogs & we all get along marvelously! I would be best suited in a home w/out young children\u2019. \u2018Quick movements & strange sounds scare me and send me running!",

We are located at 7940 University Ave NE, Fridley. Dogs are at events based on the availability of their foster family. Please fill out a pre-adoption application so we know you are interested in meeting/adopting one of our animals. The breeds of our dogs and cats are a 'best guess.' We often do not know what mix they are and have to base it on what we think they look like, and base it on breeds often found in the area they came from. Most of our dogs who have gotten DNA tests done are 4-10 breeds mixed together. Because their breed mix is a guess we cannot guarantee a 'full grown size' of many of our younger animals.Interested in adopting me? Click here to fill out an application!Happy Tails Rescue Minnesota is located at 7940 University Ave NE, Fridley MN 55432. We are open for adoption events from 12-5 every Sunday. If there is a certain animal you want to meet at one the events please fill out a preadoption application to directly contact their foster family or check our Facebook page to see if they will be there! Their event attendance is based on the availability of their foster family.\nHome visits (video tours or in person) are required for all dog adoptions. All of our cats and dogs are INDOOR pets and are NOT to be left outside unattended (even in a fenced yard), or running loose!",

I personally would hate to see them separated because I do think they're bonded and are so used to being around each other. Their personalities complement each other perfectly as well. \n\nLewie is the more outgoing one, he's like a goofy Scooby-Doo, always marching around looking for something to get his nose in. He loves climbing up on chairs and on our outdoor table to curl up and take a nap. He's very cuddly and social and always wants to be near people. He gets excited by everything but is slightly aloof in an adorable way, in that he will run around and do his own thing but then come over for attention. He's house trained and has done well with every other dogs he's encountered. He likes running around our property and hanging out with Huey. \n\nHuey is a little more timid at first, but he's opened up a lot since he got here. He's always shaking his little nub tail at a 1000 miles a second. He loves to body up to you for pets and love, and really never had an undesirable behavior. He walks perfectly on the leash and doesn't leave your side. He gets along well with our other dogs and loves to eat. He hasn't quite become as brazen as Lewie in climbing up on furniture, but he's become super calm and comfy at home compared to how terrified he was in the shelter when I got him. I remember he just hid in the corner when I met him; now he's a greeter and a happy boy. Lewie is his therapy dog.\"\n\nHuey was part of a playgroup with other dogs on 10/2/20. Huey was unsure about new dogs and appeared to be conflict and possibly prey driven.",

I personally would hate to see them separated because I do think they're bonded and are so used to being around each other. Their personalities complement each other perfectly as well. \n\nLewie is the more outgoing one, he's like a goofy Scooby-Doo, always marching around looking for something to get his nose in. He loves climbing up on chairs and on our outdoor table to curl up and take a nap. He's very cuddly and social and always wants to be near people. He gets excited by everything but is slightly aloof in an adorable way, in that he will run around and do his own thing but then come over for attention. He's house trained and has done well with every other dogs he's encountered. He likes running around our property and hanging out with Huey. \n\nHuey is a little more timid at first, but he's opened up a lot since he got here. He's always shaking his little nub tail at a 1000 miles a second. He loves to body up to you for pets and love, and really never had an undesirable behavior. He walks perfectly on the leash and doesn't leave your side. He gets along well with our other dogs and loves to eat. He hasn't quite become as brazen as Lewie in climbing up on furniture, but he's become super calm and comfy at home compared to how terrified he was in the shelter when I got him. I remember he just hid in the corner when I met him; now he's a greeter and a happy boy. Lewie is his therapy dog.\"\n\nLewie was part of a playgroup with other dogs on 10/2/20. Lewie was calm and mostly did his own thing, but he appeared to be conflict driven.",

When she came out of the kennels she was SO incredibly excited that she was practically pulling me out the door. She was a pro at getting into the car. However, once inside she just couldn't contain her excitement. All she wanted to do was snuggle and roll around the car as I drove. For this reason, we decided to walk locally in the nearby neighborhood. Gina is super high energy and does pull the leash. However, whenever I stopped to tell her \"no, she would kindly oblige (at least for a little bit) but only after giving me a few licks. We stopped a few times for a break, during which Gina would pretend to be a lap dog, roll around in the grass, give licks, and ask for pets. It seems she knows sit, and perhaps even paw/shake. Overall, she did very well on our walk. She mostly ignored other dogs and people walking by. But sometimes, she was in the mood to try to chase cars as they passed us. Gina is a hyper and happy-go-lucky girl. She is looking for an adult-only home where she would be the only pet. She would do best with adopters who are patient and willing to spend time on training, but who also want to include her in their active and high-energy lifestyle so she can tire herself out after a long day.\"\n\nGina was part of a playgroup with other dogs on 12/6. She kept to herself at first, but was friendly when approached. She became more friendly and social with time, and was a greeter when new dogs entered the yard.\n\nGina was part of a playgroup with other dogs on 12/10/20. Gina was friendly, social, and patient. Her play style varied depending on who she was interacting with. \n\nGina was part of a playgroup with other dogs on 1/16/21. Gina was social, playful at times, and offered appropriate corrections. \n\nGina was part of play group on 1/17. She was friendly, social, and playful. She was also very tolerant and offered appropriate corrections when necessary.\n\nGina was part of play group on 1/18. She was friendly, social, and playful.\n\nGina was part of a playgroup with other dogs on 1/21/20. Gina was very sweet and social.",

            "description": "MEET Sterling Archer!  \n1/31 update:  Please note, we are looking for adopters who currently have outgoing, socialized dogs for this pup and two of his siblings.  Because they are so fearful, they will need another dog to show them the way and help them come out of their shells.  Adopters will need to have lots of patience and give them plenty of time to adapt.\n\nSterling Archer is a 14-week old Labrador/Hound mix pup who was rescued in VA from a farm with many other dogs. He has been in foster now and is developing good house manners and has made good progress with potty training but will need a continued routine. \n\nWhen full-grown, he will be a large dog. He would do best in a home who will provide positive reinforcement puppy training. We don't know how he will do with cats.\n\nAll of our dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations & microchipped.\nWe strive to make the best match possible for each and every dog we place.  If you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out the online application (copy and paste into your browser) https://forms.gle/rv5JfMurqAeVJQc98\nOr if you have questions, please email: traveling4pawsadopt@gmail.com.",

            "description": "Bensin is a 2 year old, Hound/Husky mix, who was found as a stray and rescued from a shelter. He is young, energetic, loving and docile. Bensin will race around the yard as easily as he'll nap quietly in the house. He can be a tad stubborn and vocal (that's the hound in him), but a correction always works, especially if a treat is involved. He sits like a pro and takes treats very gently. And he's got the head-tilt down-a very curious, observant, intelligent dog who will give you lots of ear kisses.\n\nBensin is a big boy-lanky. He's underweight, and when he gets to his ideal, I imagine he'll be closer to 65 pounds. Bensin is also very beautiful. His fur is so soft, you'll want to live in it!\n\nHe has shown no signs of aggression regarding food or toys. He greets other dogs beautifully. He wants to play with my cats, but when they sit still for him, he is calm and careful.\n\nBensin would like a family who's home a lot and has a yard where he can play and run, and he'd love regular walks. An outdoorsy hiking family would make him a very happy boy. But it's not necessary. Some daily physical and mental stimulation and being part of his very own home with his very own people is all he needs to be on Cloud 9.\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online. http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\nNote: Some apartments and neighborhoods have breed restrictions. Please ensure you understand those restrictions prior to choosing a dog. We verify rental policies and adhere to any restrictions.",

My favorite hobbies include snuggling with my people and taking naps. I do like to play on occasion. I like to play catch with a tennis ball. I am a team player too because I will easily give it back to you. I walk very well on a leash. We could go for long, leisurely walks together and just enjoy life. If you have any other dogs then I would have to meet them before I could go home. I can't wait to meet you! Please come by and say Hi!",

Even then, she was the happiest dog.\n\nSweet Cheeks has done well with any other dogs and all people she has came in contact with. That being said, she does still have some puppy left in her, so if you're excited, SO IS SHE! Once she knows you, she calms down a lot and is happy just walking beside you on a leash. \n\nSweet Cheeks is PHENOMENAL in a home! This pretty girl also does well in a crate, but once she is left in there for a while, she begins to get restless and starts to whine for you.\n\nSweet Cheeks could adapt well to really any home, but we would recommend any children in the home be 5+ due to her size. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting Sweet Cheeks or think she would be the perfect addition to your family, the first step is to visit the link below and apply!\n\narfofwaynecounty.org/adoption-application",

I promise to always keep you warm with my body heat. I am also a smart girl! I know how to \"sit\"! Pretty cool huh? With some training I'm sure I will learn more. I would be great with kids. And I walk really well on a leash! If you have other dogs then I will need to meet them before I could go home. So, can I join the family? Come in to the shelter and see me!

The last house I was in just had too many dogs for the owners to handle. I am a little shy when first meeting people so I ask for you to be a little patient as I get to know you more. Once I know who you are, I am your best friend and shadow! I love to jump around and play!! I am still getting used to this whole leash thing, but as long as I take my time, I should pick it up in no time! I am looking for a home without any other animals since I want all of your love to myself. If you think I would make a great addition to your family, fill out a pre-adoption form today!\n\nConsidering adopting from Father Johns Animal House? Then apply at fatherjohns.org/adopt/ for any of our adoptable pets!",

            "description": "Tubbs is a spunky boy who has lots of love to give. Tubbs is used to the comforts of home, and can't wait until he can leave the shelter and go back to being loved and pampered. This sweet guy can be shy around unfamiliar people and likes to greet guests at his own pace. However, once he gets to know you he is eager to call you one of his best friends. Tubbs is an energetic guy, who still has lots to learn. He knows a few basic commands and is working on his leash manners. He would benefit from an adopter who can help him further his knowledge. He appears to be housebroken and/or crate trained from what we have seen here at the shelter. He is unsure of other dogs, so if you have others we would recommend setting up a meet/greet for them. If you are interested in meeting Tubbs, please submit an adoption form found on our website: FairfieldCountyDogs.com. Once received, we will contact you to arrange a visit. Primary Color: White Secondary Color: Brown Weight: 59.5625lbs Age: 2yrs 0mths 0wks Animal has been Neutered",

            "description": "I never expected to be at the shelter for so long! I really am a good girl, super smart and trainable, just maybe a tiny bit finicky. Super smart might be an understatement, actually. I know tricks like how to sit AND how to \"sit pretty\" where I get up on my tippy toes and look adorable. I also showed the shelter staff not to underestimate me when I came in on the week of July 4th - when fireworks went off, I broke through every door that wasn't deadbolted and found my way outside! Luckily, I knew to hang around the building and stuck to the woods until they caught me the next day, but that was the first time a dog opened six different doors to get out on their own. I sure showed them!\n\nI am a very determined girl who knows her mind, as you can tell, and that's part of what makes me so fun. I love humans including kids, but I don't tolerate naughtiness of any degree and will put an overenthusiastic child in their place. So I would be best with older kids or a family that understands that a dog needs boundaries and that I have my own rights to protect my space.\n\nI am pretty sure cats are evil creatures from another world, so I do NOT want to be in a house with them. I tend to be reactive to most dogs as well, so a home with no other pets is best.\n\nThis is probably the point I should admit I have some terrible separation anxiety. I really do not like the idea of being on my own, and I've already admitted I know how to open doors so it's not really an option to leave me alone for long. I also am likely to pick a favorite person out of a group and be very protective of them, because that's what friends do is keep each other safe. I don't always understand that humans like to roughhouse with each other, though, so if I see someone getting rough with one of my favorite humans, I might think you're threatening them and try to scare you away with some intense barking.\n\nAll in all, I may sound picky but I'm an incredibly nice girl who loves challenging her brain. Whether it's coming up with new tricks, exploring with my favorite people, or running around with the zoomies, I love when I can try new things and feel safe at the same time. I really want a family and will do everything I can to keep them safe.\n\n*Marquis (pronounced \"Markie\") cannot be in a home with young kids (below age 12), cats, other dogs, or other small animals (birds, rats, reptiles, bunnies, etc.) for the safety of Marquis and other animals.",

I am very much a puppy, so I am going to need you to give me all the training there is. I will need to learn manners too, like leash and house manners. Also basic commands. I love toys! I play really well with them! They are so much fun! I am very energetic and active, so a home with older children would be best for me. I do like other dogs, but if you have any at home then we will need to meet each other before I can go with you. Come by the shelter and meet me!",

We process applications ONLY - there is no guarantee that you will get a response to an inquiry.\n\nMEET MOBY:\n\nMoby is a sweet, energetic Australian Cattle Dog mix. His date of birth is 11/25/20. Moby and his three sibbling were surrendered to a high intake shelter along with their Autralian Cattle Dog momma, Mollie. Puppies need homes where someone is home more often than not for proper house training and socialization. Moby will still need leash training and crate training. He will do best with children over 6 years old, since his breed is classified as herding dogs. Moby will not be a good fit for an apartment/condo lifestyle or mobile home community as this is a working class breed dog and will be very active. He has been exposed to other dogs and children. Moby is at the age where socialization is very important as they are just beginning to show their personalities and they are curious about the world around them. Please keep in mind that puppies are challenging and they are a big responsibility as they are prone to chewing, they will have accidents in the house and they will cause you sleepless nights while crate training. Moby will need a lot of mental stimulus and physical activity to help him stay happy and healthy. Moby is seeking an active family that will love her furever! \n\nMoby is: \nCurrent on age appropriate vaccines\nDewormed\nHeartworm Tested: Negative\nRecieving Heartworm prevention and Flea/tick prevention\nMicrochipped\nNeutered\n\nADOPTION FEE: $350.00\n\nFUREVER TAILS IS A NON-PROFIT, NO-KILL, FOSTER HOME BASED ANIMAL RESCUE BASED OUT OF OAKLAND TOWNSHIP, MI. OUR FOSTER ANIMALS ARE LIVING IN FOSTER HOMES AND TREATED LIKE FAMILY UNTIL THEY FIND THEIR OWN FUREVER FAMILIES. OUR ADOPTION PROECESS REQUIRES AN APPLICATION TO BE COMPLETED AND APPROVED BEFORE A MEET-N-GREET WITH THE ANIMAL CAN TAKE PLACE.

We process applications ONLY - there is no guarantee that you will get a response to an inquiry.\n\nMEET MOON:\n\nMoon is a sweet, energetic Australian Cattle Dog mix. His date of birth is 11/25/20. Moon and his three sibbling were surrendered to a high intake shelter along with their Autralian Cattle Dog momma, Mollie. Puppies need homes where someone is home more often than not for proper house training and socialization. Moon will still need leash training and house training. He will do best with children over 6 years old, since his breed is classified as herding dogs. Moon will not be a good fit for an apartment/condo lifestyle or mobile home community as this is a working class breed dog and will be very active. He has been exposed to other dogs and children. He is at the age where socialization is very important as they are just beginning to show their personalities and they are curious about the world around them. Please keep in mind that puppies are challenging and they are a big responsibility as they are prone to chewing, they will have accidents in the house and they will cause you sleepless nights while crate training. Moon will need a lot of mental stimulus and physical activity to help him stay happy and healthy. Moon is seeking an active family that will love him furever! \n\nMoon is: \nCurrent on age appropriate vaccines\nDewormed\nHeartworm Tested: Negative\nRecieving Heartworm prevention and Flea/tick prevention\nMicrochipped\nNeutered\n\nADOPTION FEE: $350.00\n\nFUREVER TAILS IS A NON-PROFIT, NO-KILL, FOSTER HOME BASED ANIMAL RESCUE BASED OUT OF OAKLAND TOWNSHIP, MI. OUR FOSTER ANIMALS ARE LIVING IN FOSTER HOMES AND TREATED LIKE FAMILY UNTIL THEY FIND THEIR OWN FUREVER FAMILIES. OUR ADOPTION PROECESS REQUIRES AN APPLICATION TO BE COMPLETED AND APPROVED BEFORE A MEET-N-GREET WITH THE ANIMAL CAN TAKE PLACE.

They are the perfect size to be adorable lap dogs, but also adventure buddies for the CO mountains. They are outgoing and have been well socialized since day one. Ziggy loves to play with his toys, romp around the home with his brother, and snuggle up when he is ready for nap time. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting either Poppy or Ziggy, please fill out our adoption application at brighterdaysdogrescue.com",

She is a 5-year-old Terrier Mix who's happy to hang out around the house and nap but would be beyond excited if you're game for a walk (or two) throughout the day. She will need to be the only furry friend in the home, and she will need a special and patient home to help her continue her heartworm treatments. She's a pretty quiet girl - She only occasionally barks. She's good in the car and would do best on a leash or in a fenced-in yard when outside, as she loves to explore and follow her nose! Clara is spayed, microchipped, and up to date on shots. She is truly an incredibly sweet & happy dog that is so ready for her second chance at a forever home!Her adoption fee is $250.

            "description": "MEET PHISH!! Yes, just like fish.\n\nPhish is a great dog. She is very smart and so easy to train! She loves people and loves to cuddle up with them at the end of the day. Have cozy blankets and/or squeaky toys and balls? If you do, Phish will love you forever. Actually, she's such a lover she doesn't need all that, but why wouldn't you want to give her what she loves?\n\nPhish warms up to strangers quickly, and she loves kids. She is gentle--meaning she doesn't jump up on people. However, those zoomies may still hit. Maybe her name should be wiggles because her whole body wiggles when she sees someone she knows. And that smile...pure joy!\n\nPhish had a rough live as a stray. She has the scars to prove it. Phish can get aggressive with other dogs, so it's best she gets all the love and attention to herself. If you are the family for Phish, please fill out an application today.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this dog, please visit our website for our online application www.underdogaz.com\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This dog is courtesy posted for another individual or Rescue.

            "description": "Meet Mailman! This sweet Lab mix is ready for home on 2/2 from Woburn MA. This sweet boy is a tripod as he had a rear leg recently amputated. He was spotted by a woman that runs a rural mail route again and again. He was obviously injured and was losing weight (abandoned in a very rural area of MS). Once rescued, x-rays showed that his back leg had been broken in two places and healed back incorrectly which resulted in pain and required amputation. Like many tripods, he is getting through his new life on 3 legs just fine! He is best without a lot of stairs and like many 3-legged pups, does best with carpet or runners / rugs as wood or tile floors can be slippery. He is very human and dog friendly!\n\nRead through our adoption process and other adoption FAQs here www.rescueinc.dog/FAQs\n\nAll of our pups come with the following: \n\n\n\tSpayed or Neutered\n\tAge appropriate vaccinations + dewormed + 4DX test (if older than 6 months)\n\tNew martingale collar with 6' lead + temp ID tag\n\t30 days free insurance to be activated within 24 hours of your wellness visit with your veterinarian\n\tMicrochip with free registration for your new pup, but also for any other pets in your household too!\n\tSouthern pups, younger than 6 months, come with 1 month of flea / tick / heartworm prevention to prevent any lapse of protection \n\tOur southern dogs, 6 months and older, come with a **Proheart 6 injection which provides 6 months of Heartworm protection (approx value of $100) + dose of flea / tick preventative\n\n\n**dogs surrendered to us in MA do not recieve the Proheart 6 injection but do go home with 1 month of flea / tick / heartworm preventative so there is no lapse in protection\n\nAges listed can be approximate and breed mixes are a best guess based on physical characteristics. \n\nIf you are seeing this listing on Petfinder, please apply through the link on our website at www.rescueinc.dog/adopt \n\nPlease do not email with questions or message through Petfinder. Communication with the rescue always starts with submitting an application. \n\nIf you see this listing, the pup is still available. We pull listings after 2 to 3 viable applications are submitted.",

He is scared of dogs initially but is learning to trust them but would do best as an only dog until that's worked on just a little more. This boy is going to make some family very very happy with how cuddly and sweet he is. \n \n\nIf you'd like to add Rex to your family please apply at ruffhousedogs.org",

Nala is estimated to be 2-3 years old and we are awaiting the results of a DNA test to determine her breed. Nala hasn't met a dog she didn't like. This girl just wants to play and be near her doggie friends. Nala would love to be taken on daily walks and would make someone a great running partner or hiking buddy! She has done well around children, but does not realize her size - for this reason, she would do best in a home with older children.\n\nThis poor girl has been shuffled around for the last several months, due to failed adoptions where she wasn't given adequate time to decompress and adjust to her surroundings. She will need a patient adopter who can be empathetic to what she's been through and can give her the love and patience that she deserves.",

They will be adopted to separate homes, not together. We also have a female littermate named Rivers. She is also available. The pups love other dogs and will be fine with children who have been brought up to be respectful with animals. Our foster homes work on house breaking, crate training and basic obedience.\n\nAdoption Requirements: No Exceptions\n- Cannot reside in an area with BSL\n- No apartments/rentals\n\n\nThese pups are currently available for adoption through R.E.A.L. Rott Rescue. Adoption fee includes DHPP and rabies, vaccines; deworming; microchip and registration; heartworm test (if over 6 months old) and HW preventative to last thru adoption trial; and spay/neuter. \n\n***PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE POST & FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS****\n\nPlease note that our organization is entirely foster based and we are all volunteers. We are based in the greater Cleveland area (OH) however we do have fosters in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Michigan. Once you submit your application, it may take up to 21 business days for us to get back to you. Please be patient.\n\n\nR.E.A.L. Rott Rescue is 100% foster based; we are not a shelter & each animal is in an actual home with a foster family. We receive an overwhelming amount of emails and applications so please be patient. To qualify, an application MUST BE filled out, a Vet Check MUST BE completed by our team, and an approval (or denial) email will be sent. This is all prior to scheduling any \"meet and greet\".\n\nVet Checks:\nWhen adopting through our rescue, we 'ALWAYS' do a vet check on each applicant's pets that they have owned over the past 5 years. Please make sure to call your vet to grant them permission to release this information to our rescue when we call. That being said, all of the animals in each applicant's home must be UTD on all of their vaccines (DHLPP & Rabies), on monthly HW preventative, and spayed/neutered. Please make sure that the veterinarian listed on your application has seen your pet and can confirm the vetting is current.\n\nNotes When Applying:\nIf you're interested in adopting one of our available dogs:\n1. Apply at www.realrottweilerrescue.com.\n2. Please specify if you would like us to screen for other dogs if the dog you are interested in is no longer available.\n3. Please be sure to call your vet to grant our organization permission to do a vet check on your current and past pet/s.\n4. Please be honest & truthful on your application. We always do a vet check!\n5. We do adopt outside of the state of Ohio however, you must have an approved application, you and any humans and canines residing in the home must all make the trip to our foster home/s when meeting a prospective rescue dog.

I am looking for my new forever home, with or without my brother. We are the best of friends are really don't like being apart, but we will be just fine living separately. I will need some basic training, just so we can both agree on how I should behave at home. A fenced yard to play in with my stuffed toys and all my humans would be awesome! If you would like to meet me, come on in to the shelter to say hello.",

We are thrilled that so many people want to adopt right now, but we are not equipped to handle the large number of calls, applications, and email inquiries we are receiving. We are no longer answering phone calls and are doing all communications with adopters via email. If you have a dog you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application before sending us emails. When your application has been processed, you will receive an email from us with further instructions on how to adopt. You do not need a new application for every dog that you are interested in adopting. \n\nAt MAMCO we understand that in order to continue rescuing moms and babies, we must stretch our finances as far as we are able. For this reason we use variable adoption pricing. By assigning higher adoption fees to high demand moms and puppies, we are able to rescue more families in need.The money raised through these adoptions acts as a benefactor to moms and puppies in our care who require expensive veterinary treatments, have behavioral issues, or need more time to find a home. We often reduce the adoption fees on these harder-to-place moms and puppies to help them find forever families. Adoption fees vary, but all include spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccinations and deworming, rabies vaccine at the time of spay or neuter, and 30 days of pet insurance. We also cover hernia repair and cherry eye repair at the time of spay or neuter. Applications can be filled out at mamcorescue.org.",

            "description": "Waif was found living on a construction site with another dog. It was obvious they were both in rough shape and needed help immediately. Waif had a noticeable limp and hairloss throughout her body...but given the conditions she was found in, we're thankful that's all that seemed to be wrong. These pups were sleeping in an active construction zone; screws, broken glass, and staples littered the same floor that they slept on and machines were constantly coming in and out of the site. It's a miracle she wasn't in worse condition.\n\nAfter being rescued from the construction zone, Waif was still very scared. She had to live in fear on the construction site to survive and was struggling to learn to relax. She has made progress in a foster home and is much more accepting of people than she used to be. Waif really seems to come out of her shell around other dogs! She has been in foster for months and is doing FANTASTIC! Waif looks forward to her daily walks with foster siblings and is a super star on a leash! \n\nWaif was seen by a vet and had an x-ray done. She's been on pain medication, but there hasn't been much improvement in her limp. Thanks to our generous donors, 4 Paws 4 Life Rescue will be preforming the TPLO surgery at our veterinarian to stabilize the affected leg before she goes to her forever family.\n\nHere is a link to a video of Waif being reunited with the other dogs found at the construction site: https://youtu.be/g5C1Lj7kq74\n\nHere is a link to a video of Waif being temperament tested off leash: https://youtu.be/8NpFbowNmAc\n\nThis is all the information we have currently.\n\n\n\tApproved Applicants may make the adoption fee payment by clicking donate above. Partial adoption fees will not hold a dog.\n\tDogs adopted with our rescue come with FREE training from #GoodPup to help you build strong bonds from the start!\n\tIf upon meeting the dog of your choosing at an adoption event you find that you aren't a good match, your deposit will be refunded minus a 10% administration fee.\n\tAdoption fees include vaccines up until time of adoption, microchip, spay/neuter and 1st 30 days of free Pet insurance. We are not affiliated with Pet First pet insurance. (you have to sign up for the insurance or it will not go into effect). \n\tAdopters can go to our vet for medical issues that may arise in 1st 3 days of adoption. \n\tThe dogs in our care are fostered in Colorado, Texas, and New Mexico. While all dogs are picked up during our scheduled times, sometimes transport dates change due to unforeseen circumstances.",

Wyn was the last of her litter to be adopted as she was quite\n\nThe spirited little scruffy. Her fosfef family fell in love with her and she has been there for the past 3 years. She has an amazing bond with the human children of the family specifically a boy high schooler. Unfortunately this family is going through a painful unheivel by way of a divorce and is being forced to move into an appt. They cannot take more than 2 dogs to the appt and they have more than that. They found a family to temp take 1 but their other dogs are older and have less energy. No one will take Wyn. Wyn is a FORCE in the best way! She is a free spirit, a wild child, she lives every moment of her life to the fullest with unbridled passion. We is about to lose everything she knows, she is about to lose her best friend, her family, her home. Her mom, human siblings and all of us at HPPAW are devastated. The mom has tried everything in her power to figure something else out, but we haven't been able to and now we have no choice but to list her for adoption with the hope that the 2 families can stay in touch. \n\n \n\nNo unkind words, this is a truly life altering decision that hasn't been decided lightly and those parties named above are very emotional about the situation.\n\n $200.00 Adoption Fee \n\n(Which is considered a non refundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible. The fee itself is not negotiable, our vets don't negotiate and thus neither do we.)\n\nTo Contact Us\n\nMessage us through our website http://www.highplainspaw.org\n\nMessage the Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/HighPlainsPAW\n\nFill out our Adoption Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/adoption-application\n\nFill out our Foster Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/foster-application\n\nEmail us at highplainspaw@gmail.com\n\nCall our VOICEMAIL at (402)957-1578\n\n \n\nWE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY ALL OUR DOGS ARE LOCATED IN FOSTER HOMES. This means there is no place for you to go in person to view our dogs. We ask that an application be filled out and we will go from there!",

She is on the small side for a Shepherd but I'm a pretty big pup for my age so my foster mom thinks I will be larger than my mom. Best guess is 50-60 lbs but there is no way to know for sure since we don't know who dad is. I'm happy and outgoing and like to play just like any other young puppy but i'm not crazy high energy - probably more medium to easy going. \n\n If you are interested in adopting, please complete an application at https://www.circle2rescue.com/dog-adoption-application/ The adoption fee of $600 includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, microchip and dewormer. Adopters will be required to activate the 30 day free pet insurance policy if they want to adopt a puppy.\n\nPlease note, Circle 2 Rescue cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have limited history prior to them entering the rescue. We make every effort to ensure the dogs are healthy.",

She is on the small side for a Shepherd but I'm a pretty big pup for my age so my foster mom thinks I will be larger than my mom. Best guess is 50-60 lbs but there is no way to know for sure since we don't know who dad is. I'm happy and outgoing and like to play just like any other young puppy but i'm not crazy high energy - probably more medium to easy going.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete an application at https://www.circle2rescue.com/dog-adoption-application/ The adoption fee of $600 includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, microchip and dewormer. Adopters will be required to activate the 30 day free pet insurance policy if they want to adopt a puppy.\n\nPlease note, Circle 2 Rescue cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have limited history prior to them entering the rescue. We make every effort to ensure the dogs are healthy.",

During her intake exam an abnormality on her front legs was noticed, and while it doesn't seem to effect her in any way, we want to have it xrayed to be certain that she is perfectly healthy! She is a sweetheart who loves to run and play!\n\nBefore you can adopt, please complete an adoption application on our website at pawscrossedny.org/dog-adoption-application! Once your application is approved, you will be able to call to schedule an appointment. If you have any questions, please email us at adoptions@pawscrossedny.org for more information. Please understand that we cannot hold any pets. All adoptions are done on a first come, first adopt basis for approved applicants.\n\nThe Shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We encourage you to select your new companion by considering each dog's individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on a breed label that is only a guess.",

His 83 year old owner had fallen down breaking her shoulder bone and had to be moved out of her home leaving the dog homeless. As you can see from the previous photo he had severe mange. He was itching and seeping blood. But after several months of treatment he has improved greatly. Bear is a chow mix, about 6 years old. He loves to play with toys. When let out to exercise he has gotten along well with the other dogs.\n He does have a thyroid issue, which explains the thinning fur on his lower back. But the good news is it's easy and inexpensive to treat. Medication is only $15 a month. Please share Bear! PLEASE CONSIDER ADOPTING OUR SWEET BEAR. HE'S LIVED THE SHELTER LIFE LONG ENOUGH AND DESERVES A SAFE HOME",

I am a little shy with new people at first, but after a bit I will open up. A home with older children would be best as the little ones are a bit too much for me. I do love playing with toys. Stuffies and tug ropes are my favorite. I will need you to teach me all the basic training. I am a smart girl though, I'm sure I can learn quickly. I am also very friendly when it comes to meeting other dogs. So if you have any other dogs at home then bring them by so we can all meet! If it sounds like I would be a great fit for your family then come on by the shelter and meet me! I'll be here waiting for you!",

            "description": "Meet Buster. This super sweet guy was returned to us after almost 4 years because of his owners failing health. Buster was very well taken care of and is very sweet and mellow pup. Although, he is used to a quieter home and quieter neighborhood and will bark at noises and people he doesn't know. Buster does get frightened with loud noises. He is housebroken, up to date with vaccines, microchipped and kept on monthly heartworm prevention. He has had some allergy issues since he was returned and we currently have him on Apoquel for his itching. He may need to stay on this as he is doing well, but we are not certain if some of the scratching is due to him being a little stressed from losing his human best friend. Buster loves to play with other dogs, but may do best with a buddy more his size. Buster would prefer a home with a fenced in yard as this is what he is used to, as well as having an owner that is home often or another friendly dog in the home to keep him company so he isn't alone. He is currently about 4 years old and about 65 pounds. Buster's adoption fee is $250.00. He will be sent with a months worth of Apoquel if he needs to stay on that. If you are interested in adopting Buster, please visit our website www.LHARinc.org go to Adopt and complete the dog adoption application.",

Begahoula fits me better, because just like my name I am one of a kind! I am two years old and 45 pounds of pure puppy exuberance! I am super duper smart and I love to play games, Frisbee is my favorite but I will play with sniff, tug, chase, I try fetch sometimes, but I laugh when my foster mom has to chase me so I do not always give the ball back. WoooWooo (dog laughing sounds) , sorry but it is just so much fun to run. Then, when we are done playing my next favorite thing to do is cuddle, oh I love a good cuddle, snuggle, pet my belly kind of break. I sooooo do enjoy laying on my back on the couch with all four paws in the air just getting a good old belly rub, nothin better if you ask this pup. I love other dogs, I mean who wouldn't all us dogs are awesome. Now I know your saying this pup is too good to be true, so I will tell you what things I still need a little help with. I can get really excited and run so fast that I can knock things over. I don't chew anything but I am curious and will investigate your personal items. Things like shoes and little people toys. I just like to gather them up and keep them next to me, cuz it reminds me of you when you are not with me. So I'm lookin for an awesome family, I've got lost of love to give and can't wait to meet you.\n\nTucker's adoption fee is $250 which includes his neuter, vaccinations (rabies, distemper, lepto), microchip, heartworm test and flea and heartworm prevention. Also, six weeks of obedience classes if you chose to do so.\n\nDUE TO COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS: TO HELP US LIMIT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING, OUR ADOPTION CENTER IS OPEN BY APPOINTMENT ONLY TO APPROVED APPLICANTS. PLEASE FILL OUT THE ADOPTION APPLICATION IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MEET TUCKER. FILLING OUT AN APPLICATION DOES NOT OBLIGATE YOU TO ADOPT.",

Inquiries will not be answered at this time. \n\nChaka and his  pack of rascally playmates were part of a hoarding situation that we helped with from another county.  These poor pups spent most of their lives locked in a rv in their own excrement.  The owner would come by once a day to feed over 20 dogs.  They have all since been spayed, neutered and had their basic needs met including, but not limited to a CLEAN living environment, vaccines and they were all treated for giardia and coccidia.  These babies are well on their way to exciting new adventures with YOU.  They are still learning how to be social and most of them are quite friendly.  We do REQUIRE for another dog to be in the house for these sweet babies at it does make them feel better!  Chaka would do great in just about any environment.  He is sweet, loving, and snuggly.  He has not shown much fear around us but he does love pets and snuggles!  Older kids may be best as they don't seem nearly as scary as small ones! Please research POSITIVE training techniques before applying to adopt. We care very much about your application answers and they are reviewed for completeness and the best match. Please fill out an application on the included link: https://threerivershs.org/adoption-app-2/ \n\nThe adoption fee of $350 includes spay/neuter, current vaccines, microchip, free vet visit, 30 days of pet health insurance, puppy book, and engraved ID tag.",

She is working on housetraining at her foster home, but doesn't seem like she has had much prior training in this area and will need someone who is dedicated to working with her.  She has been given a dental and has a clean bill of health.  She loves to be with her people and doesn't appreciate a crate :) \n\n\n\n\nSassy's adoption fee is 200 to cover vetting costs. She is spayed, had a dental done, microchipped, heartworm negative and up to date on age appropriate vaccines and heartworm and flea preventation at time of adoption .\n\nAn application for Sassy can be filled out here:\n\nhttp://www.woodstockanimalfoundation.org/adopt-a-dog/\n\nMeet and greets will be scheduled once a pre approved application is on file.",

I may need some basics taught to me once I get home, like house breaking, manners, etc. I haven't made a dog friend here yet, but you never know, you may have my new best friend. If you have any dogs at home, I would love to meet them. Come on in to the shelter so we can meet and see if I'm the right girl for you.",

I am heathy and still fun. I just like the couch more than I used to. Here is what my foster mom says about me...\n\n Zane is 11 years old, housebroken, crate trained for feeding and treats. Does well if left alone. Gets along with other dogs once acclimated to the environment. Unsure about cats. Loves to snuggle and be right next to you. Gives the best kisses. He\u2019s getting exercise and has lost some weight and showing more energy and personality. Likes to play with other dogs when he\u2019s in the mood. Doesn\u2019t like to be left alone outside for too long. \nHe\u2019s definitely a loud snorer ?\n\nIf you would like to meet Zane send us an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back with you as quick as we can.\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting...neuter, a heart worm test, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention, a microchip and a wellness exam\n",

Sweet Trixie is an active gal looking for a family to spend forever with and would love an equally active family. Trixie is still working on some basic commands and thinks it would be great if her family could help her with some positive reinforcement training! She is very treat motivated so learning new things will be a breeze for this cutie pie. Because Trixie is still working on tricks like \"off\" she will need a family with no children under the age of 10; she doesn't want to knock anyone over when she gets excited! Some of Trixie's favorite things include, playing with stuffy toys, eating lots of yummy treats and sniffing everything around her. She would enjoy supervised outdoor time with her family to keep her extra safe while she explores! If you are looking for a goofy and sweet doggo, then Trixie Tang is the one for you! \n\nIf you're interested in adopting Trixie Tang, please email a completed adoption application to adoptions@kitsap-humane.org.

            "description": "MEET >>> Lovin Mr Doodles!!\n\nHi there! I'm Mr Doodles and I'm looking for a new forever home. My story is sad I got saved from the euthanisia list and went to train and board for a year, where I was so lonely, because I just love my humans! I came back to phoenix, and this nice man adopted me but he is a paraplegic and I'm just too strong for him. And while he loves me so very much, I need to find a new home. I need a home with a nice backyard to run in. I love to play fetch and love walks, but I am a strong boy! Oh so handsome loving Decker is back in town and looking for forever! This kid loves his humans so much! Decker was saved from the euthanasia list and went to board and train up north. He than got adopted by a paralegic, I am just too strong for him. (decker is 80 pounds!) While loving Mr Doodles is strong, he is a lover, total lover with people he knows. Decker loves to give kisses, and to be with his humans. I love to cuddle with my humans. I prefers to be your only animal, but has plenty of love to give. I am house trained, crate trained and love water and baths. Mr Doodles is a little grabby with food, so no kids. I am a gentle giant. I do have some skin conditions, which are improving as we speak. I will need shots about every 2 months around $100 and no grain food. I do not want to go back to boarding. I really needs a forever home asap. If you are committed and have no breed restrictions and no other animals please call 520-800-4633 leave a message if needed. Please call rather than email, as emails sometimes take a long time to get to me. My name is Mr Doodles and I would love to meet you!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this dog, please visit our website for our online application www.underdogaz.com\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This dog is courtesy posted for another individual or Rescue.

Such as, take naps together, go for walks together, and we are even going to be adopted together! \n\nWe can both be pretty timid when we first meet new people, but if you have some patience with us, you'll see what sweet girls we can be! Since loud noises and quick movements can make us nervous, we do do best in a home without small children. \n\nShy and I will need to be the only dogs in the home. So if you're looking for an adorable pair of 25 pound pups to add to your family, schedule a time to come visit us today!",

Such as, take naps together, go for walks together, and we are even going to be adopted together!\n\n We can both be pretty timid when we first meet new people, but if you have some patience with us, you'll see what sweet girls we can be! Since loud noises and quick movements can make us nervous, we do do best in a home without small children. \n\nSassy and I will need to be the only dogs in the home. So if you're looking for an adorable pair of 25 pound pups to add to your family, schedule a time to come visit us today!",

He is just a happy boy whose mission in life is to make you smile. Mr. Blonde wants love and attention, it doesn't take much to please him. This handsome fella can't wait to find a home to call his own. He is still very puppy-ish and loves to play.\n\nMr. Blonde will be available for adoption on 1/29/2021 at 12:18 PM.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet please fill out an adoption questionnaire at www.yakimahumane.org. A Yakima Humane Society staff member will contact you once your questionnaire has been received.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this pet you can fill out an online adoption form at www.yakimahumane.org. Please give the name and ID number for the animal you wish to adopt.\nIf you are thinking about adding a pet to your family, be a hero, please consider adopting a shelter pet and if you already have pets \u2013 for life\u2019s sake \u2013 spay and neuter. Spaying and neutering your pets is the single most important thing you can do to help decrease our nations severe pet overpopulation.\n*NOTE: Nearly 90% of the animals that come into our shelter are abandoned, neglected, traumatized, injured, or ill. We attempt to give our best assessment of the animal\u2019s welfare and temperament. Unfortunately, due to lack of funding, volunteers, and resources our physical and mental assessment of the animal is not always 100% correct.",

This cute boy came to us with an injured eye and unfortunately needed it removed, but he doesn't let it get him down! Reese can be a shy boy, but woud really like to be friends. This happy guy likes to play, but is still learning to share his toys and would do best in a house with adults only. Reese likes playing with the other dogs here at the shelter, but should meet new canine companions one-on-one to ensure they are a good match. This pup will require guidance and supervision learning to use the bathroom outside only, but our staff can give you tips to help with this.",

The reason I am marked as special needs is simply because I only have three legs, but that doesn't stop me at all! I seem to get along with dogs pretty well, I just prefer the ones that don't have over the top energy and get in my face. I would do well in a calm and quiet home where I have regular routine and not too much hustle and bustle. I am going to need exercise, training, socialization, and affection. In return, I promise to bring you years of love, laughter, and loyalty. My adoption fee includes my neuter, a microchip, vaccines, and a fourteen day limited health guarantee through Redstone Animal Hospital! Come and visit me today!

This pet is  , up to date on all age-appropriate vaccinations and preventatives, heart-worm negative, and micro-chipped!\n\nShe is House trained and uses an electronic doggie door.  She is treat-motivated.\n\nShe is good with cats, dogs and children.  She has a low energy level and will sit in your lap all day!  She sometimes gets jealous when food is being served when other dogs are nearby.\n\nSissy is a loving gentle incredibly sweet girl.  She is a medium size dog, very quiet and low key.  Even though she had 18 of her teeth surgically removed recently, she likes her wet food.  She really likes scrambled eggs on Sunday morning!  She sleeps well all night long.  She particularly likes sleeping in front of the fireplace on a nice fluffy bed.  She likes the warm sunshine and will sunbathe on the porch.  She takes an interest in family by wanting to be included in the group.  She has one dark eye and one blue eye which makes her unique!  \n\nYou can apply to meet / adopt this pet at www.muttmisfits.com/adoption-application!",

This litter came to us after their mama got hit by a car :-( they needed to be kept safe! They are little chihuahua mixes, just over 3 months old.\n\nThe puppies are full of life! There is never a dull moment with 6 puppies running around! They are very playful, sometimes rough but always ready for cuddles with their foster family. They live with other dogs of various sizes in their foster home and do well with everyone. They like the house cats too! Although they have not been exposed to kids while in rescue, we do not believe there will be an issue as long as the kids are kind and respectful of their small statures. Housetraining is still a skill in need of work - right now they use pee pads. One or two will venture outside into the snow but then quickly hightail it back inside! They love toys and chewies are a favorite. They are gated or penned at night and when their foster family is gone for the day. They still need training and that\n\nNeapolitan or Neo as his foster mom calls him has stolen everyone's heart! He is full of mischief and likes to get in trouble! A champion wrestler too! When he is all wiped out Neo likes to cuddle up with his siblings and anyone else that will have him. He will do what ever it takes to get his foster mom's attention so she picks him up. If someone wants to spoil a little dog, this may be the boy for you!\n\nNeo is scheduled to be vetted on Feb 2 but we are accepting applications now. He will be neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, flea/worm treated at the time. His adoption fee is $400",

So with a little training in my new home I will learn when and how to let you know that I have to go outside. I am a smart gal, so I'll catch on quick. I will need some basic training. I would do best in a home with much older children, if any. If you have any other dogs then I will need to meet them before I can go home. I am already spayed, microchipped, and up-to-date on my vaccinations. I am ready to start my new life with my new family. Come meet me!",

He has lots of energy and would be an excellent running companion. He is working on crate training and potty training and is doing well with both. He walks well on the leash but can get spooked by traffic here and there especially those scary loud and large vehicles. This is getting better and better everyday so we hope he will continue to gain confidence on leash even in high traffic areas. Caleb doesn't really care to compete for your attention and would prefer to be an only dog.\n\nCaleb is approximately 11 months old weighing in at 32lbs. He is UTD on all vaccinations, michrochipped, and HW negative. He will be neutered prior to going to his forever home.",

I came in with my brother, and I just can't believe my family didn't pick us up. We have the most beautiful coats that are shiny and sleek! Although I love my brother, I'd prefer to spread my wings and move into my own place going solo. I prefer not to be around other dogs so I'd like to be the only pooch in my new home. I am currently vaccinated, wormed, microchipped, heartworm negative, had flea treatment applied, and sterilized. If you are interested in adopting me, please copy and paste the link above into your web browser and fill out an adoption application. I cannot wait to meet you!",

Toasty has been adopted out twice here, but just cannot seem to find the right home, even though there are a lot of different types of homes that she can fit into. Both of her previous homes note how loving, affectionate and cuddly she is in the home. She can get along with multiple people in the house as well, but would be better suited with older children. She sleeps well, is potty trained and has her basic commands down as well. She enjoys to run around the yard, chase balls, and chew on her squeaky toys, so she is also trained on appropriate methods to help get her energy out. Toasty is missing the home life and would like to show you how good of a companion she can be. If you are interested in meeting Toasty, please fill out an application at www.highsierraanimalrescue.org. We do not discuss potential adoptions without an already submitted application.",

I'm laid back and go with the flow for the most part, but I can run for miles if that's your jam. Sometimes I get too excited about running and barrel into your knees. I also forget that I'm bigger than the smaller humans and knock them over. But I'm the best cuddler. I love being the little spoon or just leaning against you! Also, I play dress up! If I see my sweater, I try to dive bomb it to get it on as fast as possible! I love grooming other dogs, the cats (who sometimes don't want me too and then I pout), and rabbits. The last bunny I lived with was fast! I didn't chase her though unless she initiated it and even then I stopped before I got too close. I love playing with other dogs as long as I'm given time to get to know them. I make a lot of loud noises when I play and I can be super dramatic. I would steal my sister's ball when I wanted her to run with me! l love walks but I do still pull sometimes when I get excited, but I'm easily trainable, especially if you have yummy treats. I'm kennel trained and house trained. I'm not very toy motivated, but I like treats and jumping in water. I hope I find someone who gives me lots of affection and lots of running!",

Cyrus has a soft temperament. He is wiggly, loves cuddling. Cyrus is a young puppy....meaning he is maturing slowly and foster parents have had trouble housebreaking. Cyrus is looking for love, for patience, for activity. He needs calmness and confidence building and he will be an absolutely wonderful dog.",

I'm the newest member of the HBR family. I may be small, but I am mighty! I love walks, toys, people, food, naps, my new bed, toys, snuggles, and did I mention toys? I'm a 4 year old Frenchie who is trying his best to figure out how to live with an older bulldog and a very strange animal called a \"\"cat\"\" - I'm very excited to have fur siblings, but they aren't quite as excited as I am! I'm working on eating better and figuring out how to fix my skin allergies/condition - but I am positive I'll get there! I am definitely a lap dog and I try to sit in my foster mom's lap when she is working. I sleep in my crate and go to the bathroom outside like a pro! I'm almost the perfect dog. At least that's what my story is so I can find my forever folks when I am ready!\n\nLove, Benz",

He was found alone as a stray so it takes him a little bit of time to get comfortable with new situations.\n\nDucky is a mellow pup that is just trying to navigate his new world. Each day he gets more and more confident and he is figuring out how to play and be the goofy pup that he is! He\u2019s discovering the joy of toys and puppy zoomies and loves to get all the attention. \n\nDucky loves his humans. He really depends on them and loves to snuggle and hangout. We are looking for a family with older kids or a couple that is looking for a new companion!\n\nDucky is completely crate trained and is working on his house training, which gets better everyday. He is on schedule for his vaccinations and has been deemed healthy for adoption by our local vet. Ducky is not yet neutered so this will be your responsibility as the adopter to do so when he reaches the appropriate age of 7-9 months.\n\nIf you are interested in giving this sweet boy the loving home he deserves, please fill out an application on our website, www.outriderdogs.com, under our \u2018Rescue\u2019 page.\n\nThank you!\nOutrider Dogs Rescue\n\nFacebook & Instagram: @outriderdogs",

She takes a few extra seconds to warm up to new people, but once she does she is the biggest love! When she first came to us, she was petrified! She didn't seem like she had ever felt a loving hand! She has had lots of them during her time here and she can't get enough! Lizzie loves giving you hugs to show her affection. And trust us, they're the best hugs ever! We have been doing \"clicker\" training with her and she has responded so well! All she wants to do is please! Lizzie would do best in a quiet home without any young kids (16+), due to her sometimes getting overstimulated. She would do well with another dog, as long as its the right match. Lizzie is looking for her forever home that has nothing but love to give! If you are interested in meeting our sweetest Lizzie, please fill out a questionnaire (either in person or online at gobroomecounty.com/shelter) and staff will contact those we would like to move forward with. If you have further questions about Lizzie, please call the shelter at (607)778-2493 or email us at muttsrus@broomecounty.us.",

He recently underwent entropion corrective surgery. Entropion is when the upper and/or lower eyelids roll inward the eye causing the hair to constantly rub and irritate against the eye ball. Shapei's are the poster child for this condition. This surgery should correct this and should not cause any further health concerns in the future. Brute looks a little rough post surgery, and it will tend to look worse before it improves, but we are hoping his future home can overlook is current appearance and open their hearts and offer a forever loving family.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Shih Tzu/Maltese | 6-months old | 5 pounds | Adoption Fee: $575Let me introduce you to the newest member of the Rescue Crew. Matador was found in a abandoned house very skinny and full of mats and only weighed about 5 lbs when he was removed from the home. We do not know anything about his life before he came into rescue , but what we do know now is that Matador is the sweetest and most energetic puppy. He favorite pastime is playing fetch , getting belly rubs, following foster mom around the house and going for walks inside her jacket. He loves woman and is very sweet around his foster mom's 5 month old grandchild but can be very nervous and vocal around men, When a male enters the home he barks and becomes very protective of his territory . Speaking of his loud voice, he loves to alert his foster mom of every little sound he hears, so a family living in a apartment or townhouse would not be a good fit for him.\n\nWhen this sweetheart arrived , he was not at all potty trained. But now with his hard work, he is now about 50% there.\n\nMatador also is not a big fan of his crate but is learning to adjust to it more everyday. He still barks a lot when his mom leaves for work but is now learning that at the end of the day, she will come back home to him.\n\nMatador does fine around large dogs (he currently has 4 large foster siblings) but is protective of his food around them. He has no fear of chasing them away from his bowl of food. He is learning that he will always have a bowl full of food to fill his belly. We don't think he has been socialized with other dogs in his past, but he is learning to co exist with my dogs and is getting so much better with his manners around them. Over time, he has become more comfortable with them and likes to try to be the alpha.\n\nPlease submit a application If you think you may be a good fit to give this sweet boy an amazing life that he so deserves.\n\nThe adoption fee covers the cost of the animal's spay/neuter surgery, microchipping, FIV/FeLK testing (for cats) or Heartworm Testing (for dogs), deworming and all core age appropriate vaccinations. For the most complete information regarding this animal, and all of our adoptable pets, please ensure you are visiting our website directly at www.RescueCrew.org. You can also access the necessary online adoption application here as well. Thank you.",

She needs a loving home that is willing to work with her needs. She will need alot of patience as she suffers from anxiety. The staff is more than happy to answer questions about her.

            "description": "Meet Britt. Born approximately October 2020, she is super cute and sweet and loves everyone she meets. She is curious, bouncy, and fun but also loves to be cuddled.\n\nThere is a lot for a Great Pyrenees/Siberian Husky mix puppy to learn, so she will need to find a home where someone is very available to her in these early days. She loves the companionship of other animals and requires another dog to act as her mentor as she continues to understand her new world's rules.\n\nCurrently, her Foster family is teaching her the difference between her toys and others' prized possessions. This cute little girl is not going to be little for long. Now is the best time to jump in and continue mentoring her. It is going to be so fun watching her fill out and fit into those big paws. Please complete an Adoption Application. Britt is only available for adoption in OR and WA.\n\nPUPPIES ARE ONLY PLACED IN HOMES WITH YOUTHFUL, PLAYFUL RESIDENT DOGS.\n\nOur requirements for puppy adoption are simple and necessary.\n\nOur puppies are not livestock guardians, they are family pets that live inside the family home.\n\nPuppies must be placed in homes with a youthful, adult resident dog of similar size. This gives the puppy a mentor and a solid foundation for becoming part of the family.\n\nPuppies are only adopted to homes with someone at home at least part of the day. If no one is home for 6-8 hours at a time, please do not apply.\n\nPreference is always given to those with Great Pyrenees experience.\n\nApplicants must have secure, visible fencing and a socialization plan in place.\n\nThe fastest way to be considered for a puppy is to fill out an application. Adoption is not first come, first served. GPRS and its fosters work diligently to find the right fit for each and every unique dog and puppy.\n\nApplicant's personal pets must be current on vaccines & heartworm/flea prevention and be altered.\n\nAdoption Fee: $450 (Adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm test, rabies, distemper, parvo and health certificate for travel). Northwest adopters pay the cost of transport to independent transport service ($225). Adoption applications can be found on our website at\n\nhttps://www.greatpyreneesrescuesociety.org/\n\nADOPTION, FOSTERING, AND DONATIONS are just some of the ways you can help a rescued dog. We have worked hard to cultivate a large network of volunteers to save this majestic breed. While monetary donations are always much appreciated, you can also help by donating your time as a GPRS foster or volunteer!",

Death in his family and subsequent move out of state is his reason for needing another loving family. He is used to a calm, loving 9 year old female beagle. House trained. His family says he loves a routine, especially going for a walk out in the front yard every day.\nHe is wary of strangers and has not yet accepted B&B staff as BFFs. We are giving him CBD oil to help his fears. So it may take him some time to learn to trust as his own pace.....patience, training on your part, LTC, CBD......will all help. Complimentary training book authored by Terri Steuben with each adoption.\nWe're gonna see if our groomer can spiff him up and give him some Reiki treatments to help his disposition.\nEmail your application (see beaglesandbuddies.com - adopt a dog section) and give us at least a week thereafter to review and email you back for a one hour appt on Fridays/Saturdays 10 am to 2 pm or Sundays from 10 to noon. Carefully proofread app - we cannot process incomplete forms. Let us know how long your dog/s are home alone on any given day-now and after pandemic abates....full descriptions of any other dogs in the home - age, weight, breed, disposition and pretty much same for human kiddos. Thanx!\n\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\").

She came from her 1st home that loves her very much; death in the family and move out of state causes her to seek a new home. She is used to being with a male dog her age (red terrier mix Chet)- but not restricted to this in a companion. Her main need/wish is: LOTSA LOVE. We are told she is 9 yrs young, but she sure doesn't look it Her teeth are very white, and she's lost a little weight at B&B - about 25-30 lbs\nEmail us your impressive application (see beaglesandbuddies.com - adopt a dog section) also add in how long she would be home on any given day...now and after pandemic abates. Age, sex, weight on any other dog/s and similar stats on human kiddos. Allow us at least a week to respond via email to set up one hour appt on Friday or Sat from 10 am to 2 pm and Sundays 10 to noon.\n\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment.

He's happy\nto romp around the beach or go walking to find fun sticks to play with. He's a great pup with great manners already under his belt! He does have some sensitive skin so needs someone who will take care of his skin with his allergy pills and food without chicken etc. He is waiting to meet new friends for adventures, could that be you?\n\nIf you are interested, please fill out the Interest Form linked, please fill out the Interest Form application link here https://amazingstraysrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms/form?formid=5860\n\nThe adoption fee covers vaccinations, Rabies, spay/neuter, and microchip.\n\nAmazing Strays Rescue Team\nW: https://www.amazingstraysrescue.org\nE: info@amazingstraysrescue.org\nFacebook",

We think he led a sheltered life previously, and he can be timid about new things. When this boy warms, he is just the sweetest guy who longs to be close. He will blossom with a family with some experience willing to slowly broaden his horizons and build his confidence. Baron is best for a family with adults and children 15+ due to being quite jumpy at times. He is looking forward to his brand new start with a family that loves him.\nxxx\n\nPlease note: \nWe are not currently adopting to Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine or Rhode Island due to burdensome regulations involved with importing an animal.\n\nInterested in adopting?

This little guy is blind, but it doesn't stop him from being his happy go lucky self.  He likes to cuddle with his human foster parents, and he does well with his foster canine siblings.  We are not sure about cats.  Frankie loves a comfy dog bed and would make a perfect binge-watching buddy.  He knows that senior dogs have a hard time finding homes, but he is confident that there is a family out there who will give him a chance.  He promises to be a loving companion in return!

Beanie is super happy & easy going but like most chihuahuas can be leery of strangers. She loves to snuggle with her people, in bed she prefers to sleep under the blanket. She loves to play with toy & her foster siblings. Beanie is good with other dogs (takes a bit longer to warm up to dogs bigger than herself), likes kids & doesn't mind cats. She dives ok in a car but needs some help with leash training.\n\nBeanie is fully vetted, microchipped, current on all shots and flea and tick prevention. Her adoption fee is $300.  \n\nTo adopt, please fill out the attached application. https://form.jotform.com/202415148836051",

I will be 6 years old in March and am a petite, pretty Pit Bull mix. I was found as a stray, but happened to be chipped. However, my first family rehomed me, and my most recent family couldn't be located. I wasn't in the best shape though, so it's probably for the best. I was skinny, dirty and needing medical care. I got that and then some here! I'm feeling so much better. I can be anxious, but I love getting affection from people. I am sweet girl, love to get belly rubs and maybe play with some toys. A home with kids over 10 years old is recommended for me. I can be unsure of some handling, and I prefer to be left alone while eating. I love food and at times can be grabby when it comes to yummy snacks. I eat out of a slow feeder here, and it might be good to continue doing so as my food is gone as fast as it arrived! I did not mind meeting a cat or a dog here. I was off leash with both and behaved appropriately. I wasn't much into playing with another dog, but we coexisted well and just enjoyed each other's company.\n\nMedical: Shey has tested positive for Anaplasmosis during her time at HSHA.  Anaplasmosis is a tick-borne disease (similar to Lyme) caused by the infectious bacterial organism Anaplasma phagocytophilum.  Infection often causes lameness, joint pain, fever, lethargy, and anorexia (lack of appetite), or a serious condition called thrombocytopenia which causes low platelet counts and can effect blood clotting.  Shey has received treatment with 3-4 weeks of oral antibiotic to help clear the infection.  We recommend speaking with your veterinarian about the condition and following their recommendations for ongoing care and routine monitoring (which may include annual blood testing). \n \nClient Education Document:\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/anaplasmosis-in-dogs",

His #1 goal is to make you feel special by letting you know you're his everything. Once you have developed a mutual trust, He will go the ends of the earth for you. He will want to know you feel the same for him. A few soft hot dogs, some floor time with toys, kind-hearted patience, a soft voice, snuggles under the covers & you will earn his undying love.\n\nRocky does seem to prefer the ladies over the gents. He is fine with men once you work him through his fear. It shouldn't take long, he now loves his foster dad just after a week! In transition in his foster's home , Rocky was quite vocal so shared walls (townhouse, etc) may not be the best living situation for this guy. After he became comfortable though, his voice became quieter and he is rarely heard barking.\n\nRocky enjoys not only his favorite human(s) but also enjoys the companionship of another dog. Another dog isn't required but it might make his transition a bit smoother and his days a bit happier! As far as cats, probably not the best match for Rocky according to his Texas foster.\n\nRocky prefers to roam free in the house. He resists being crated but has done fantastic in his foster's home when left out. He would love nothing more than to sleep the night away in his human's cushy bed.\n\nRocky is house-broken but \"marks\". He is learning to change this behavior by wearing belly bands and having close supervision when not wearing his belly band. Belly bands are easy to purchase off Amazon, cheap and re-useable. Rocky's definitely making improvements every day and will hopefully soon enough not need to wear these bands anymore!\n\nRocky is full of antics! He might pick up a shoe and throw it in up the air, trying to catch it again & again! Or, he might push his toy around like a vacuum. Whatever the case, He's sure to make you belly laugh! When not involved in playful fun, Rocky might be found snoozing in the sun, curled up in your arms, or asking for a walk! He walks great on a leash by the way! And, even though a Texas transplant, Rocky's really been having some fun outdoors in the snow!\n\n**Rocky would not be best fitted in a home with young kids ** older respectful kids only please.\n\nIf you think you have what it takes to invest in Rocky's forever home, Consider applying to meet Rocky today!\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal.\n\nPlease check out our website,\n\nwww.ruffstartrescue.org\n\nfor more details and additional pictures on any of our animals!\n\nAll Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs).\n\nRuff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue. Animals are located in homes throughout Minnesota. We do not have a facility where animals are kept.\n\nRuff Start Rescue Adoption Policies:\n\nhttp://www.ruffstartrescue.org/info/display?PageID=11744",
