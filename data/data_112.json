An application starts the process.  We are not able to answer calls with questions about the foster pugs. ***\n\nHi there!  We are Pretzel and Twinkie, 10-year-old pug sisters who are BFFs (that's Best Friends Forever, for those not familiar with that term). When we came to APARN, we told the Fairy Pug Mother that all we wanted was to stay together, and she said that was a wish she could happily grant! We are together ALL the time. IF you think you can away with loving on just one of us, you are wrong! You\u2019ll have two pugs in your lap faster than you can say \u201cbrachycephalic\u201d!  We sleep together, lay around together, even go outside to go potty together! The only thing we need to do separately is eat, as we do not like to share food! We are very quiet pugs and really don\u2019t require much other than some loving interaction.\n \nNote: Twinkie is a three-legged pug; she was missing her front left leg when she came to APARN, so we don\u2019t know what happened to her. While only having three legs does not slow her down, she did have a small Mast Cell Tumor removed from her right thigh two years ago.\n\n***We encourage you to come to our adoption events to meet the pugs in person if you are interested in adoption. Again, please do not call regarding the adoptable pugs.  APARN is an all volunteer non-profit organization. We do not have a shelter. Our dogs are currently being fostered in private homes generally located throughout the greater Phoenix metro area.***",

He is fully grown at 56 lbs from his most recent vet visit. He has a big fenced in yard at his foster home that he loves to run in- we would ideally love for him to have a fenced in backyard at his furever home as well. He loves to hang out with other dogs and keeps himself entertained as well. He knows basic commands such as sit, stay, etc. He is great on leash or with a harness. He gets along great with other dogs that are medium size and larger. He cannot be placed in a home with a smaller dog. He would be fine in a home with children but is young with plenty of energy so he could knock little ones over. He is house and crate trained.\n\nDeuce is UTD on all shots, neutered and microchipped. He is also heartworm negative. All of our dogs are current on flea, tick and heartworm prevention. \n\nDeuce is available for meet and greets locally. He can also be adopted out of state- a transport fee would apply in addition to his adoption fee. \n*All of our dogs come with 30 days of pet insurance when microchip membership is enrolled by adopters.",

            "description": "Hi guys my name is Red. Let me tell you a little bit about me. My bio may list me as a generic \u201chound\u201d but I am anything but ordinary. I know my own mind and what I want more than anything is a family of my own. I\u2019ve been waiting a long time (2 years) and once I find my special someone I want to be your one and only. This is what I bring to the table. I\u2019m a bundle of fun and actually pretty larger than life with my goofy antics and oversize personality. I have all you need and more wrapped up in one gorgeous package. I am fun, active, loving and loyal. I will listen to your problems and never judge or offer unwelcome advice. What I will do is love you unconditionally, no matter what. As a matter of fact that is my specialty. \n\nSo what does my favorite volunteer say about me: \u201cI wish with all my heart Red would find a family of his own. He was left behind by my former neighbor and I got him to K4K a few years ago. I worry about him not getting enough time to run. He\u2019s an active guy and would love an active family. I can see him curled up in someone\u2019s home being spoiled rotten. It\u2019s what he so deserves. He has had to compete for resources in the past and so does not really enjoy being in the company of other dogs. For a family that wants an only dog Red will be an awesome addition\u201d.\n\nSo the take away here is my name is Red and I am in a word: Awesome. I\u2019m a big ole hunk of love. I\u2019m a pretty active 3 years old and I love walking, running around, giving kisses and hanging out with people (not dogs). I\u2019m easy to get along with and a great listener. I know my own mind and a family of my own is my biggest wish. Please come meet me so we can get our life together started right away. For more info or to set up a meet and greet just email Karin 4 Kritters at karin4kritters@gmail.com or use the button at the top of this page to inquire about me. I'll be waiting patiently for you here at the rescue. Much love and kisses - Red...\n\n***Note Red has tested positive for Heartworms. This is something we at the rescue will take responsibility for and will treat either before he is adopted or better case scenario in a foster to adopt situation. The rescue will pay for the treatment and Red\u2019s new family can help him through the short recovery period. This consists mainly of short leash walking while minimizing over excitement. Red is a wonderful dog and is expected to live a normal life with a normal life expectancy after treatment and with a regular HW preventative after treatment. We recommend a preventative for every dog adopted from us or any other rescue or shelter.  If you have read this bio and would like to foster to adopt or outright adopt please contact us and we can explain the treatment and recovery in more detail or if you have decided he is not the right dog for you but you would like to contribute to his heartworm treatment please email the rescue at karin4kritters@gmail.com to find out how you can make a donation toward his treatment or to one of the other heartworm positive dogs at the rescue. Thank you.***\n\n\n",

For this reason, she has been passed up year after year. She is great with other dogs both male and female. If you think you could give this shy girl a home where she could blossom into the dog we all know she could be outside the shelter environment, then come on out and meet her.",

I was found as a stray and no one ever came for me. I am about 2 years old and weigh appx 50lbs. I am good with other dogs as long as I am introduced properly but I would be fine as an only with an active family. I love car rides. I don't like to be pet on top of the head by people I don't know. Once I know you though I don't forget and you are my friend for life!! I am crate trained and housebroken if I am kept on a schedule. I love chew toys and bones so be sure you have plenty for me. I won't chew on things I'm not supposed to if I have stuff of my own. If you would like to meet me send an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and they will respond as quick as they can\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting...neuter, all vaccinations, a heart worm test deworming, flea prevention and a wellness exam",

She sometimes gets the 'zoomies' when she's around her caregivers and feeling especially happy. She gets equally excited to snuggle or to go for a walk on the trails. Feebee has a routine when meeting new people and she will need to continue this training in a home. Feebee thrives with structure, routine and a little patience. As long as she has that when she goes into a home, she will settle in just fine. Feebee is working on making dog friends but right now she is only comfortable walking next to them and not actually meeting them, so she would do best as the only dog in her new home. Feebee loves to learn and especially loves to show off the skills she has already learned. Feebee is an affectionate girl and a joy to be around, she would love to be your new best friend!",

She LOVES to be near her human and will forsake a good game of tag with her siblings just to be near you.  \n\nShoeshine is very clever, although she outwardly doesn't appear so, like her sister Smudge.  However, she will sit back and  figure out how to do something, without needing the trial and error her siblings use. \n\nShoeshine likes to play tag, but is beginning to tire of the game.  She has learned how to use the agility tunnel and is proud that it doesn't frighten her as it does her sisters.  She loves praise and there isn't much she won't do to get some. \n\nIf you are looking for a friend who wants to be near you always.....Shoeshine is a great choice.

Odie tries hard to do what he is told, it's just sometimes hard for him to understand exactly what that is.....so his new family should be patient with him.  Like his Momma, Mona, Odie has a shy side, but only needs a tiny bit of cajoling to understand that everything is gonna be fine.\n\nOdie is up-to-date on shots, preventatives and knows some basic obedience.

            "description": "Poor Becky has had a tough time of it and REALLY, REALLY wants a family who will love her FUREVER!!!!!!!   \nShe came into rescue emaciated, scarred and heavily pregnant with 13 babies.Despite her \"pit bull look\", all we heard from her transporters was how wonderful, sweet and calm she was during her ten hour ride with four different families.  And she was just as loving as they come. Because she was so undernourished, six of the pups needed major surgery to reconstruct their bellies\n\nWhen her babies were finally in their forever homes, it didn't take long for Becky to  find a foster-to-adopt home with a young man who truly loved her, and she him.  He would walk her daily, which she loved and they were very strongly bonded.  Sadly, when he lost his home, so did Becky.  After two years, she returned to rescue, but her heart was clearly broken.  It took weeks before we began to see the infamous, \"happy dance\"......but it DID return.  \n\nBecky is housebroken, crate trained and has been cleared of her heartworm.  Her green eyes will make you smile everytime you see her.  If you are interested in adding this gal to your family FUREVER THIS TIME....Please go to https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1EHxp-7yawtDX2N50CEtUJECNh548bkLPFyJfJ3Zjg9w/edit and complete an application.",

She is not good with smaller dogs or cats.  She is good with kids over 12 yrs. She is a certified dock diving dog and would love a home where she can continue that diving. She needs a fenced yard and someone who will exercise her - at least one walk - every day.  \n\nApplications can be filled out at our webiste and are non-binding. If approved, they are good for 1 year on any of our adoptable animals.  \n\nhttps://pawsuppetrescue18.rescuegroups.org/\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt!",

She is a very sweet and submissive girl, but can take a while to warm up to new people. Countess does well with other dogs and has a moderate energy level but is very playful. She would do best in a quiet home without young children, and with a dog savvy family who is willing to work with her and help her progress even more. We are estimating she is around 2 years old, and she weighs 25-30 lbs. \n\nThank you for showing interest in our dogs, however due to the recent influx of applications and emails we ask that you avoid sending emails asking if: a listed dog is still available, if we received your application, or if we have additional photos (we always post whatever we have). Due to the current pandemic we have been receiving a huge influx of interest and emails and appreciate your help in lessening the workload for our volunteers. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: If you are interested in adopting a dog or puppy, please follow the steps below and submit an application. If you have questions you must reach out to us as we do not have the capacity to individually contact all applicants. During this time we are only accepting appointments at our Kingsburg facility, so please do not apply for a dog if you are not willing to drive to us.\n\nOur dogs may be met by appointment locally in Kingsburg. Copy and paste the link below to submit a pre-screen application for the dog of interest, or find the link on our website www.pawsitiveconnections.org. Due to the overwhelming amount of interest our dogs have been receiving during this time, we unfortunately will not be able to reach out to all applicants who apply. If you do not receive correspondence from us, it is likely a reflection of the amount of applications we received. \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGSOxbGTIIintrGXUi8H-ddLv41aA0XUbELmNi0YhUIWQHRA/viewform\n\nAdoption fee will include spay/neuter, microchip, rabies vaccine (dependent on age), bordatella vaccine, parvo/distemper vaccine (1-4 depending on age of dog), dewormer (2-4), monthly nexgard for flea and tick treatment. \n",

We will update this listing when she is feeling better.\n\n***\n\nUPDATE 3/20 ... From one of her favorite volunteer-pals: \"We are kindred spirits in a way. I am usually not in a hurry and neither is she. She only gives me grief when I am rushing her back to her run.\"\n\n.***\n\nMore than just soft fluff and a pretty face, Moxy is in search of a family that sees her for the smart, sweet girl she is, as well as the happy, confident dog she is capable of becoming. \n\nMoxy has lost her home twice over\u2026 so who can blame her for being a little insecure? Her first family moved to a place that didn\u2019t allow pets. After a short stay at STAF, she was adopted by a nice, loving lady who was very generous with sweet words and snuggles. But Mox, with her chow guarding genes and boxer spunk, needs more. \n\nWithout a strong, sure human to take the lead, Moxy became very protective of her owner both inside the house and out \u2026 which made her family more and more anxious \u2026 which only reinforced Moxy\u2019s tendencies. A series of unfortunate events added to her inner turmoil: the death of her dog companion, the move to a new house with a smaller, unfenced yard, and the introduction of an invisible fence. (Not the right option for this already stressed dog.)\n\nDespite her sporadic reactiveness to other dogs on walks, Moxy did great in doggy daycare. She was also making great strides with the in-house trainer \u2026 but unfortunately her owner could not get over her own anxiety. And since there are two ends to every leash, that meant Moxy could not move past it either. \n\nThose volunteers who have won Moxy's trust are granted the privilege of giving her long, leisurely belly rubs. (See video clip.) Yet the stress of shelter life is wearing on her, and she is desperately missing the comforts of home.\n\nMoxy is eager to go on walks, but only allows those in her \"inside circle\" to leash/harness her. She is perfect in the car and so grateful to just sit and enjoy the view. She is house-trained and does well in her crate during the day \u2026 and also does fine when left out of the crate. She knows basic commands, including sit, down, and \"watch me.\" She is around six years old and weighs in the low/mid 30s.\n\nMoxie takes time to accept new people. With those humans she has come to know and trust, she will roll over to get belly rubs. But overzealous people who move in too fast may elicit a growl or a nip. She is not a social butterfly who enjoys having lots of people over, attending soccer games, or mingling at Starbucks ... Moxy is more of a hanging-at-home-with-the-family kind of girl. \n\nShe has shared her homes happily with both cats and dogs, but the sometimes-unpredictable energy of younger kids and their friends would be too much for her at this time. \n\nMox is in search of a confident, devoted human leader to help her overcome her fears and insecurities. She needs someone with prior dog experience who is versed in positive-based training. Another well-socialized dog may make Moxy\u2019s transition to her new home easier. A fenced yard is a must--no exceptions. Sorry, but apartment dwellers and first-time dog owners need not apply. Her family-to-be will need to take it slow, making multiple visits to spend time with her at the shelter before taking the next step. If you fit the bill and think you might finally provide Miss Mox with her happily ever after, we can't wait to hear from you!\n\n\u2022  All of our animals are spayed/neutered and current on shots.\n\u2022  We do not do same-day adoptions; we ask that you return for a follow-up visit before taking an animal home.\n\u2022  You must be 21 years or older to adopt from STAF.\n\u2022  We require a 4-foot-tall physical fence for homes with children under the age of 11. We also may require a physical fence for specific dogs on a case-by-case basis, depending on each dog\u2019s behavior and exercise needs.\n\u2022  Invisible fences: Due in part to increasing coyote activity/incidents in the area and the difficulty of predicting how a dog will respond to invisible fence training, we cannot adopt to homes with invisible fences.\n\u2022  We do request vet and personal references.\n\u2022  We can facilitate adoptions within a 75-mile radius of our Cincinnati-based shelter.\n\nPlease visit www.STAF.org for visiting hours, a downloadable application, and additional information.\n",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 02/26/2019\nReason for being in rescue: Truman was part of a group of dogs seized from a home. CPR partnered with a local shelter to help these animals.\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? None noted, he is a bit spicy but can be sweet, too.\nWeight: 8.8 lbs\nHeight: in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? yes\n\nWhat is my personality like? Truman has a personality the size of a Great Dane. When he steps out into his yard, he wants everyone to know it. To a new face, he wants to seem like a scary junk yard dog, but to his people he knows, he's simply a cuddly little mess. Truman is more comfortable with women than men, but a patient man can still win his heart. With new people he will bark and if pressed too hard, he'll bite. However, with treats and time, he will learn to trust anyone, and become a new snuggle buddy! He is very affectionate with the people he knows, but he is also very jealous.\n\nTruman does not like having his ears messed with! If you pull on his ears, Truman will show teeth and let you know he is not happy.\n\nTruman will chase away other dogs if they come too close while he is getting loved on. He always wants to be near his human friends, and will follow you everywhere. For a dog that tries to come across as scruffy, he is very affectionate. He is terrified on a leash, and freaks out as soon as he feels anything around his neck. He won't need professional grooming, but he will need someone very patient to bathe and brush him. He isn't one to really mess with toys yet, and playing with other dogs isn't something he does often, but he will get along with others in his area, as long as they aren't trying to steal the spotlight from him.\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? The best home for Truman would be a quiet home with no children or other dogs. Someone who is patient, loving, and willing to understand where Truman came from. Knowing that he was in a hoarder situation, there are some behaviors he picked up to survive, and some of them will dissipate completely with time. Some, however, will always be a part of him, like a scar that won't heal. Truman will never be the dog that shows off his newest trick to your friends, but once he is familiar with them, he will be more than happy to con treats and belly rubs out of them.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? At first, Truman will bark a lot, and if pressed too hard, he will bite. Feed him treats, and let him come to you, and soon you will have him eating out of your hand. He really does want to be loved, but his past makes that difficult for him.\n\nMedical Information - Truman is up to date on all of his shots, Heart worm negative, and neutered. Unfortunately, he also has a long standing fracture in his jaw with a large piece of mandible missing. If a reduction were to be done, a major deformity would result causing a severe wry mouth worse than it is now. If repair was to be attempted, the success of this is speculative, and would need an oral surgeon to evaluate.\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Truman's estimated birthday is 02/27/2016. Truman is a good boy, with a hard past and a lot of love to give for a long time to come. He needs a loving home that will help him take the difficult steps needed to learn how to be a normal lap dog.\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

Stewart needs a home that will be patient and work with him on house training and socializing. Stewart is good with dogs his size and prefers female companions over males. He also needs a fenced yard where he cannot escape, and his \"beagle nose\" get him into trouble. He would not do well in a subdivision, apartment, or townhome. He is very vocal so a place with a little more land would be more suitable.\nIf you would like to make Stewart a part of the family, fill out an application at www.barktownrescue.org\nSTEWART'S ADOPTION FEE IS $170The shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at the dog's predominant breed or breed mix. We strongly encourage you to select your new pet by looking at each dog's individual personality and pet qualities rather than relying on a breed label that is only our best guess.\n\nOur adoption fees vary from $150 and up. All of our dogs are up to date on vaccines, heart worm preventives, and flea/tick medication, and will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Portions of your adoption fee also help care for the sick and injured animals that we take in. Thank you for supporting us and considering a rescue dog!",

            "description": "To quote Yogi Berra you might be thinking \"dj vu all over again!\" Yes, I am the same Babe (\"Baby\") you might remember from before, but I am a new girl in some ways. When I first came to CBHR a few months ago, I was rescued with Budde and we were very much dependent on each other. After some TLC from my fosters and a lot of socialization with another pair of bassets (Bo and Daisy), I am now my own woman. In fact, I am confidant and secure enough to live in a separate home. Just in case you're interested I am including our group photo while we were looking for attention (snacks actually) as part of my album.\n\nI am healthy and friendly. Over the course of time my weight has caught up with me and my foster mom is helping me lose a few of those extra pounds. Otherwise I am in good shape for the shape I am inJ . Most of my days are spent resting and napping. I have found a corner in my fosters' yard that is my favorite place to be alone and just be. I have good manners and am content to be loved and fed. I am very good around people, cats, and other dogs. I guess you could say I just like to fit in. I have also become a bit of a \"watch basset\" and will let you know is a stranger is in the area.\n\nYou can most certainly still adopt Budde and me together, but I will be happy to be your only girl. I promise to just hang out with you and be a great, loving companion.\n\n5/23/19\n\nTo apply online or to see other available Basset Hounds, go to www.cbhr.com.\n\nCarolina Basset Hound Rescue adopts in North and South Carolina.

Please understand that this is a process, and it may take some time to both review and process your application, as well as to potentially adopt one of our Labs. One of the reasons that we ask for an application fee ($25) is that it takes the limited resources and time of our Trustees and volunteers to thoroughly review and process your application.\u00a0(This fee is deducted from the adoption fee when you adopt.)\n\nPlease be patient; and be respectful of the volunteers and fosters that will work with you through this process. No one is paid, it is a labor of love, and we do our best to respond to applications and inquiries in a timely manner.\u00a0\n\nThat said, there is a reason that we ask applicants to specify the name of a dog in our application. With limited\u00a0resources, we\u00a0want to make sure that we are processing applications that will result in a successful adoption of one of our Labs in need. We cannot guarantee that you will be able to adopt the specific Lab that you are inquiring about. We always have more qualified applicants than we have Labradors available for adoption.\u00a0\n\nOur job, and most especially the job of our fosters, is to place their dogs with the adopters that are the best fit for that specific Lab, and will offer them the best chance for success. If the Lab you originally applied for is adopted to someone else, please don't take it personally; and remember that we are always bringing in new Labs in need. One of them may very well be the perfect fit for your home.\u00a0\n\nYour patience and understanding of our process is very much appreciated. Thank you!",

Please understand that this is a process, and it may take some time to both review and process your application, as well as to potentially adopt one of our Labs. One of the reasons that we ask for an application fee ($25) is that it takes the limited resources and time of our Trustees and volunteers to thoroughly review and process your application.\u00a0(This fee is deducted from the adoption fee when you adopt.)\n\nPlease be patient; and be respectful of the volunteers and fosters that will work with you through this process. No one is paid, it is a labor of love, and we do our best to respond to applications and inquiries in a timely manner.\u00a0\n\nThat said, there is a reason that we ask applicants to specify the name of a dog in our application. With limited\u00a0resources, we\u00a0want to make sure that we are processing applications that will result in a successful adoption of one of our Labs in need. We cannot guarantee that you will be able to adopt the specific Lab that you are inquiring about. We always have more qualified applicants than we have Labradors available for adoption.\u00a0\n\nOur job, and most especially the job of our fosters, is to place their dogs with the adopters that are the best fit for that specific Lab, and will offer them the best chance for success. If the Lab you originally applied for is adopted to someone else, please don't take it personally; and remember that we are always bringing in new Labs in need. One of them may very well be the perfect fit for your home.\u00a0\n\nYour patience and understanding of our process is very much appreciated. Thank you!",

My name is Bentley, and I hailed from Turkey. Some kind-hearted people took me in from the streets and surrendered me to RAGOM.\n\nI'm healthy at 10 years; I enjoy walking and outside time is my favorite! I love to just hang out in the grass or chase a few balls. I need a physical fence because I have a high prey drive and can't help running after those critters.\n\nWhen I'm happy, which is most of the time, my whole body wags. With my natural zest for life, I may knock over the little ones inadvertently, plus I like to keep precious things to myself, so I should not live with children.\n\nI love other dogs. The girls especially have me acting silly, dancing and spinning to get them to play with me! I probably shouldn't live with cats and small pets, though, due to my prey drive.\n\nAll in all, I'm a sweet, happy, goofy boy with lots of love and laughs to share. \n\nTo learn more about Bentley, see his bio at:  https://ragom.org/dogs/bentley-19-096td\n\nPlacement Requirements:\nGood With Dogs: Yes\nGood With Cats: No\nGood With Kids:  No due to resource guarding tendencies\nFence: Physical fence required\nAge: Approx. 10 \n\nIf you are interested in any of the dogs available at Retrieve a Golden of the Midwest (RAGOM), you can read our adoption process and apply to adopt, which can be found at https://ragom.org/our-adoption-process. RAGOM\u2019s adoption territory includes: Minnesota; Iowa; North Dakota; South Dakota; Western Wisconsin (within 75 miles of the Minnesota border)",

            "description": "2-1/2 year old, handsome Taylor is in need of an adult-only home with someone who can give him some special help! He needs someone to teach Him how to be a treasured member of the family because it seems that his previous home may have kept him as an outside dog away from the comfort and companionship of his humans.  Taylor would love an active home where he can go on lots of hikes and walks and continue socializing with people. Taylor loves to play with his bones and toys. He would do best as the only pet in his forever home due to his prey drive and tendency to be selective about which dogs he wants to hang out with. Of course, he would also prefer to have the undivided attention, structure and training from his humans so they can help develop the  wonderful potential we see in him. He is doing well with his housebreaking and is learning manners that no one ever taught him like \u201csit,\u201d \u201ccome\u201d and how to walk nicely on a leash. He\u2019s also learning how to properly greet new people as he gets very excited and wants to jump on them to say \u201chello.\u201d Taylor has lots of energy and will need an adopter committed to providing  regular exercise, however, he settles down once he\u2019s burned off the excess caffeine. Taylor is a very happy lab/pit bull mix at best guess who is somewhat independent, but also enjoys time spent with his humans and will make a loyal companion to whomever is lucky enough to adopt him.\n",

Filling out an application does not obligate you to adopt, but merely begins the process. SEPR DOES adopt out of state!\n\nAdoption fees: All SEPR adoptions are $300 for adults and $400 for puppies 1 year and under.  This includes: adoption fee (spay/neuter, utd vaccinations, micro-chipping), microchip registration, Gentle Leader, and two tie downs for use in your home. \n\nSEPR requires all adopted dogs attend a training class with their adoptive family within 90 days of their adoption. If an adoptive family completes this training class, they will be refunded $100 of their adoption fee with proof of licensed certificate. SEPR even offers an obedience class called Train-A-Bull to alumni over 1 year of age on a seasonal basis.  These classes are currently free!\n\n*All other pets in the residence must be spayed or neutered and all pets up to date on vaccinations.\n\n*SEPR requires all applicants must be 21 years of age.\n\n*SEPR dogs are adopted to be inside the home, \u201cpart of the family\u201d dogs only.\n\n*Families with children 5 years of age and under wanting to adopt puppies will be reviewed on a case by case basis. Raising a puppy properly takes a lot of time, and we understand that in families with small children, time can be a limited commodity.",

He is currently eating and drinking safely on his own and we don\u2019t believe his cleft lip/palate will require any surgical intervention. \n\nSawyer will always need a little extra supervision to make sure he doesn\u2019t eat anything dangerous for him, and will never be able to safely eat wet or goopy foods like canned food, peanut butter, yogurt, or any other liquids other than water. But otherwise he is expected to live a long, healthy life. \n\nThe spina bifida causes Sawyer to be incontinent and to have some weakness in his back legs. He can walk and get around very well, but he will be in diapers for the rest of his life. He is a very happy, spunky pup and is friendly with humans and other dogs. He needs a committed home willing to give him the extra care he needs to thrive.\n\nSawyer has been neutered, is current on vaccinations, has tested negative for heartworm and is also micro chipped. \n\nWe are committed to doing our part to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Until life goes back to normal, we will not be doing adoption events at PetSmart. Instead, we will be doing individual meetings by appointment and practicing social distancing at each meeting.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our online adoption application at www.uaaf.org. For more information or to schedule an appointment, please email Jenn at jennc@mac.com or text at 801-554-9501. \n",

I am an only dog kind of dog. I like to give you all my love and attention verses having o share. I'm nervous around kids which makes me not a good fit for them. They stress me out pretty bad. I need a home that understands I am nervous and try to be intimidating at first and need time to warm up to you. I am not good with strangers so when you introduce me to someone I need time to adjust. I really do have a heart of gold and I am very intelligent. I am actually a little spoiled here and play a game with the staff when it's time to go outside- I prefer to be walked outside so I am picking and don't always go out willingly. I enjoy the personal time with them when they walk me. I'm not good with other dogs, one attacked me and it changed my outlook on dogs- even if they try to be sweet towards me. If you are willing to give me the chance, I would love to spend forever with you! Come see me a few times and see if we could be friends? \n\n",

His family had an accidental litter of puppies and they couldn't find a home that could meet his special needs.\n\nFinn was born with a form of spina bifida called sacral agenesis. This means he was born without his sacrum. The sacral area is the control center for bowel and bladder control. Little Finn physically can't control his bowels or bladder so he has to wear a diaper.\n\nFinn is pretty good about his diaper but sometimes he protests and removes the one that covers his rear end. He loves to run around naked!\n\nFinn receives weekly chiropractic adjustments to help keep him as aligned as possible while he's still growing to help avoid any neurological issues in the future that a misalignment can cause. It also manages any pain he has from missing an important part of his back.\n\nGiven he is missing a pelvic stabilizing bone, his back end can be wobbly when he stands on his back legs. This does not slow him down ONE bit! He is FAST and can turn on a dime.\n\n1/15/21 6:56 PM",

Avis is outgoing and loves to be a lap dog.With as generous as she is with people, she is not so fond of other dogs. We've seen her be ok with some dogs but primarily she wants to be the only dog. Avis was in a prior home for 6 months but broke away due to a loose harness and went after another dog.For this reason, Avis will do best in a strong, sturdy fenced-in yard and should not be walked unless she has a good-fitting harness.Avis is a loyal companion with her loved ones and will give them kisses in return for attention, ear rubs and belly rubs!",

She's lively, fit and really enjoys going for long walks.  I know what you're thinking, little 8-pound dogs are yappy!  Not this one, she keeps a lid on it, because she's mature and doesn't get excited about every little thing. \n\nFofina's also an aficionado of House music, (old school, not the Johnny come lately stuff), which is to say, she likes \"4 on the floor\", which is to say, she would prefer not to be picked up.  It's embarrassing.\n\nShe's good-natured and a very well behaved little companion who would assimilate easily into an animal loving home.\n\n***\n\nOLDER DOGS ARE REALLY COOL...\n\n...and I'll tell you why.  Because they're already broken-in!  Someone else has done all the heavy lifting. Taught 'em to take care of business outside, not to jump on company, some human language, how to be chill in the car, maybe even a few impressive tricks.\n\nThere's no better friend on Earth than a well-seasoned dog!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption.  This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nAnimal Alliance is not a shelter where all the animals are housed in one location. Animal Alliance is a foster care network and animals are housed in many different locations. If you are interested in adopting a pet, please apply using the online application; applicants who call our phone line will hear a recorded voicemail with this identical message. We adopt many animals each week and meet prospective adopters at various locations so they can meet the animals they are interested in.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

            "description": "Bentley is a black and tan hound, 4 years old. About 50 lbs. Long legged. Friendly boy. He was very good in the car on the way to our rescue. Be sure to bring your dog to meet him - he seems to want to be the boss with other males. He recently met a tiny senior chihuahua and was sweet and kissy with him.\nHe's looking for a home that will help him to be active. He loves to go jogging and to play. He has a lot of energy and will need a doggie pal that can keep up with him!\nHe'd been an outside dog and may need to work on housetraining, though he does not soil where he eats and sleeps. Smart guy and the better teacher you are, the better student he is.\n*Ready to go; he has all his shots, is chipped, and is neutered.\nHe was good friends with a large female dog at B&B - so we thought he was good with other big dogs....that has not been the case. Big potential companions come to meet him and he is fine for a little bit - social, playful - and then makes his move to see if he can be named Top #1 dog.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\n\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

She has several wounds that we\u2019re treating, as well as a misshapen head. We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s from an old injury, if she was born with it, or if it\u2019s some kind of muscle degeneration. She got a good health report, other than a prescription for antibiotics for her wounds. Hazel is so sweet and loving. She deserves a much better life than what she has endured in the past. We would love to find a foster home for her, where she can heal physically and emotionally from all she\u2019s been through. We will know more about her as we spend more time with her, and will update her information then. More pictures in the comments below. Contact us if you\u2019re interested in meeting Hazel.",

She also has a white patch on her chest and weighs in at 47 pounds.  Sienna is a loving and affectionate girl that enjoys lots of attention. She loves to play and run so she will require a fenced in yard. Sienna will need to be the only pet. And no children for her. She is hoping to find her forever home very soon.  She can't live in apartment/condo/townhouse due to close proximity with other dogs. We would like to adopt her out to a local family because we will be paying for her to see a local trainer.  \n\nBirthdate:  07/11/16\n\nEffective February 1, 2020 the adoption fee for dogs is $220 for adult dogs and puppies.  This fee includes a test for heartworm and a fecal test. All of the dogs at Pet Project are tested and examined by a veterinarian before they arrive at the shelter.   The adoption fee also includes vaccinations, microchip and spay or neuter..",

I could win the eating Chompion of the World.\n \nMy only grievance about my Foster Home is that they were feeding me 3 times a day and now that reduced it to only two. Hey, I want breakfast, brunch, lunch, linner, dinner, supper and bupper, if that\u2019s a thing!\n \nI am a blond bombshell and true to my girly roots, I love to steal, swipe, pilfer or borrow, yeah borrow\u2026.that sounds nicer\u2026my Foster Mom\u2019s shoes. Don\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t chew them up, I just like to relax with them and sniff that beautiful aroma alah Foster Mom Feet. Ahhhhhh!\n \nI am not destructive and already know about house and crate training. I am after all a big girl now and not a puppy at just over 1 year old.  I am learning more manners. Plus at my Foster Mom\u2019s house, I am learning to even take my own self out to potty with a tiny hobbit door made just for doggies and hobbits, I guess!\n \nI am a work in progress, as all young German Shepherds need continual guidance and training to stay on track. But with my brains, I can learn anything. My Foster Home doesn\u2019t have kids, but I am a gentle and sweet girl and would be good with older kids, but due to my health issue, a home with small kids would not be ideal.\n \nWhat health issue? Glad you asked because I didn\u2019t know how to bring it up in a normal convo. I do need a bit of help in the how do you say\u2026.powder room area? I have a broken tail and need to stay on a proper diet and be kept clean, so I do require a bit of assistance in the powder room. If all that sounds cool to you, apply for me today!\n \nBasics:\nJordi- spayed female, 1 year old, German Shepherd, current on shots/microchipped, heartworm negative and on prevention, good with other dogs, good people, okay with cats, does have a broken tail so requires a special diet and some extra care, due to health issues no small children recommended.  See special diet below. ??\nSPECIAL DIET FOR JORDI:  Cooked white rice mixed with RX clay available on Amazon.  Currently Venture brand turkey and sweet potato kibble but Costco Nature Domain turkey and sweet potato is okay. Also mix rice and clay mixture with a tablespoon of canned food for sensitive stomach and then mix the kibble with it. \n\nLink to Application:\nhttp://www.gsdrescuectx.com/adoption-application.html\n",

She is not a dog for a first-time owner but would be a great addition for a family with German Shepherd or similar breed experience who understands the need for structure, leadership, and training. She should not go to a home with young children due to a strong herding instinct.\n\n\t\tZelda gets along well with the other dogs in her foster home but you won't have squirrels or cats in your yard if she has her way. She can be a little dominate over a submissive pack mate so she would do best as an only dog or with a confident male. \n\n\t\tShe is missing some of her lower front teeth, its is unknown why, but has a clean bill f health from her dentist! Now she is ready to find someone with the dedication to direct her energy in a positive way.\n\nThis dog is a Level 3. Please be sure you understand what a dog of this Level requires. Go to our home page for an explanation of the Dog Rating Levels.\n\nFor more information and to see when this dog will be attending an Adoption Day, please see our Dogs page on our main website at www.gcgsr.org. \n\nWe operate within a reasonable driving distance from the Greater Sacramento area, the \tCentral Valley down to Merced, and Lake Tahoe. A reasonable driving distance is determined by where one of our volunteers is willing to drive within our areas of service. That means we don't adopt out of our area, to Southern California, or Out of State. \n\n\nThank you for visiting!",

Harrison was turned over to the police and was on his way to a kill facility if we didn't step up to save him. He has lower lumbar paralysis, meaning he can't use his rear legs. He is also bladder and bowel incontinent, so his bladder needs to be manually expressed 5 plus times a day. His bowel movement release on its own and you can manually speed the process most of the time. \n\nHarrison has no idea he is injured, he happily plays fetch and lives each day to the fullest. He is a wonderful companion for someone willing to keep up with his needs and in-home physical therapy. We are looking for that special person to see past his limitations and fall in love with his very deserving spirit. His previous people did get him the spinal surgery but didn't seem to do rehab. He\u2019s been receiving Acupuncture, laser therapy, physical therapy and aqua therapy with a group of specialists who have trained us how to continue his therapy at home. He has also had I-Therm therapy which has helped and we are looking to get a machine for our rescue to continue his rehab and help our other special needs dogs. He shows signs of feeling from his paws and he has positive reactions to therapy. \n\nHe sometimes uses his legs by showing strength. We are hopeful he will walk with continued home therapy. This absolutely adorable little guy is only a year old and 8 pounds. We are looking for a home for him who can keep up with his monthly grooming and heartworm prevention as well as daily health care and maintenance. \n\nHis adoption fee is $200 to go towards his vetting (vaccines, spay/neuter, heartworm/Ehrlichia/Lyme test, fecal test, pre-op blood work, dental cleaning, microchip, and all his therapy/rehab). \n\nIf you feel you can fulfill Harrison's needs he will drown you with kisses and his fantastic personality! If you are interested please fill out the adoption application For additional information regarding our adoption process, please check https://www.getalifepetrescue.com/galpr-info/adoptables/item/410-harrison.html\n\nPLEASE READ HIS FULL BIO BEFORE APPLYING TO ADOPT! That means you need to READ!!! PLEASE BE AWARE***\n\nWATCH VIDEO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwgJ0U3OEL4&feature=youtu.be",

            "description": "Zeus loves to play with the tennis ball almost as much as he loves getting pets. He is an all time favorite of our volunteers! We love him so much. He's got the most grateful heart and is always a happy boy. He loves to play fetch, chill on the couch next to you, go on walks (especially by the lake), and is always up for having a good time. He loves his people more than anything else!! He's got the best puppy dog eyes and is a big ole baby who enjoys being tucked in at night by our volunteers. Zeus is a loyal and incredibly loving boy! This boy is precious and whoever adopts him will be one lucky human. \n\nIf you'd like more info on Zeus, please click \"Adopt Me\" to fill out an adoption survey. By filling out an adoption survey, we will be able to contact you to answer your questions about Zeus and to help set up a meet and greet! (An adoption survey is not a commitment to adopt the pet you are interested in.)\n\nP.S. - Zeus currently lives at our Brownsboro Lifesaving Center and would love a foster home while he waits for a furever home, because nothing beats a warm cozy home. If you're interested in becoming a foster, please fill out a foster form so we can invite you to a foster orientation.",

Rex is the biggest snuggle bunny boy ever!\nHe loves scratches all over, especially butt scratches. Rex loves to lay on your lap and give you kisses forever! Rex is friendly with kids and people over the age of 14 and does great with other dogs as well. We are not sure about cats. Rex is super smart as well- when you call his name or talk to him, he will tilt his head to understand what is being said.  He is FULLY TRAINED, good on a leash, enjoys his walks and a great rider in the car. He's a medium energy dog that would make a fantastic pet. He can be a little bit leash reactive to other dogs at times, but it can easily be corrected with a bit of training! That being said, Rex is going to need someone that is going to continue with his training. He also needs a strong handler, and an experienced handler. Rex is not for first time dog owners. \n\n",

He was terrified of everything & needed lots of time to figure out he was safe & what many things were, for example, the TV, stairs & even a dog bed. Jasper has come far but still needs patience with slow introductions to anything & anyone new to his life, therefore, he needs a very quiet, structured household with no children or cats, with an experience, patient dog handler who will understand & allow him time to adapt since new things & people still scare him.  He would make a great companion for a woman since he prefers women & is especially timid of men. He gets along well with other dogs that are his size with slow introduction & lives with 2 other dogs in his foster home. Words from his foster mom...\"Jasper has found that dog beds are comfortable. He goes to the door to go out. Hides his 'treasures' in his crate (socks , toys, anything he likes that belongs to someone else but he does not damage them). Cuddles his stuffed toys. His favorite thing is his Kong. He walks well on leash & can be silly & dances!\" This boy is guessed to be about 5 years old, weighs 58 lbs, up to date with vaccines, neuter, microchip, house trained, crated trained & the cleaning his pearly whites. Jasper had a rough start to life, has gone through heartworm treatment & is now Heartworm negative & given a good bill of health. He is maintained on Heartworm & flea prevention. If you think you could be Jasper's special person, please email Streethearts,animal.rescue@gmail.com & ask for an adoption application.",

            "description": "Date of birth: 9/20/2015\n\n12/17/2020: Sela is a wonderful Pit Bull mix with the best smile!  She's a bundle of love -- she absolutely LOVES people and is extremely affectionate. She bonds very quickly. She is about 5 years old and she weighs 70 lbs.  \n\n\u2022 Sela is fairly energetic and she loves to go for walks.  \n\n\u2022 She\u2019s a big strong girl! She\u2019ll need a home with someone who has dog experience and can handle a strong dog on walks etc.\n\n\u2022 She's very smart and has had some obedience training.  \n\n\u2022 Sela has gone on weekend overnights with a volunteer and she's done very well in the home. She acts like she's lived in a home before. She's done well with being crated and only had a couple accidents when loose.  \n\n\u2022 Sela is choosy with other dogs, so if you have a dog we'd ask you to bring your dog in to meet her so we could see if they could be buddies. She may do best as an only pet.  \n\n\u2022 She has a prey drive and needs a home without cats.  \n\n\u2022 She's kid friendly but she does get very excited when meeting people and needs some manners so that she learns not to jump up, so we think teenage kids would be best.\n\n\u2022 Sela is not very vocal. She'd probably do okay in an apartment as long as her person provided plenty of exercise for her.  \n\n\u2022 Sela was originally picked up by KCK Animal Services as a stray. She was there for several months so we transferred her to our shelter to find her a home. She has been spayed, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for heart worms. Sela has so much love to give\u2014 she will be a loyal and adoring companion! \n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE: PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU. Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info.\n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.596.1000 ext. 113\nhttp://hsgkc.org",

He is also learning social skills with other dogs as it appears he was not socialized. He would do best in a home with older children, teenager preferably. He knows very basic commands, is learning manners and boundaries .  He would do well in an active home, would love to be someone's hiking or running partner for sure. Dylan is crate and house trained, working on leash manners. Knows sit, wait working on down command along with other commands. Please consider giving Dylan a loving forever home.\nOur adoption process includes filling out an application as the first step, second step would be a meet &greet to see if the dog and people are a good fit, if all goes well a home check must be completed. If all seems to be a good fit for both the adoptable dog and home, then the dog will be either delivered or picked up , at that time his or her adoption fee will be collected.",

            "description": "Hello, my name is Kris and I\u2019m a volunteer for Karin 4 Kritters. Please meet my good friend Buddy. I write a lot of the Petfinder bios. I try my best to keep them light and entertaining while also giving the best glimpse of each dog\u2019s unique personality. And that is what I did originally for Buddy. Of course I mentioned his extreme good looks and those adorable ears \u2013 so extra! I mentioned his eager enthusiasm for absolutely everything and his happy go lucky view of the world. But as I have gotten to know Buddy, and really fall for him, I realized that a cute bio with the clich\u00e9 \u201cwould love to be your running partner\u201d and the now obligatory bio standard \u201cperfect companion to Netflix and chill\u201d lines were just not enough to describe this amazing dog. Buddy is so much more than a few cute words and now tired catch phrases. And that is why I felt I had to do something different. I needed to give you, the reader, my experience with this wonderful dog. To say Buddy is beautiful is an understatement. If you could see him in person your jaw would drop. As beautiful as he is on the outside he is even more beautiful on the inside. \n\nSo let\u2019s start at the beginning. Buddy lived most of his life outside on a tether with his mom. Not fixed. One day the neighbor\u2019s dog, also unfixed got into the yard and ran to Buddy\u2019s mom. Buddy as you might imagine didn\u2019t like that and a scuffle ensued. As a result both dogs were surrendered to K4K. Sadly Buddy\u2019s mom was not surrendered so even though he had to leave his mother behind, finding himself at the rescue was actually his lucky break. It has given him the opportunity to find a loving forever home, inside, as a member of the family.  Here\u2019s the thing I don\u2019t understand, especially since I know Buddy so well. He has gotten no inquiries since we started the Petfinder profiles earlier this summer. The few people that come to the rescue never stop to look at him or ask about him. This is so surprising to me. Buddy has a deep capacity for empathy.  It\u2019s a special ability that a select few dogs have as strongly as Buddy. He loves people and is so grateful for any attention shown to him. He is well mannered even in the face of great excitement \u2013 like the first few minutes after getting out of his kennel. He is eager to please and wants to learn. Someone that is willing to spend time with him training and laying the foundation for a strong lifelong bond would be ideal. Please don\u2019t think for one minute that Buddy is all serious and no fun. Nothing could be further from the truth. He loves to have fun and act silly. That is what makes him such a great companion. He seems to know what you need and since he loves to please that is what he gives you. I find Buddy so lovable I can\u2019t believe it isn\u2019t obvious to everyone that sees him. I wish I could find the best way to let you know honestly and believably how wonderful this dog is. How he would be such a huge part of your life and how you would wonder after a few weeks with him how he was not always a part of your life while also seeming to have been a part of it forever. But then that is the magic of Buddy, which is best experienced in person.\n\nIf I have intrigued you even a little then you should email www.karin4kritters@gmail.com or inquire from this page. We will set up a time for you to meet this magical creature with the fantabulous ears for yourself. I can all but guarantee that if you meet Buddy you will love him just as much as I do. Thanks for reading about Buddy and his story of hope. We would love to hear from you...\n\n***Note Buddy has tested positive for Heartworms. This is something we at the rescue will take responsibility for and will treat either before he is adopted or better case scenario in a foster to adopt situation. The rescue will pay for the treatment and Buddy\u2019s new family can help him through the short recovery period. This consists mainly of short leash walking while minimizing over excitement. Buddy is a wonderful dog and is expected to live a normal life with a normal life expectancy after treatment and with a regular HW preventative after treatment. We recommend a preventative for every dog adopted from us or any other rescue or shelter.  If you have read this bio and would like to foster to adopt or outright adopt please contact us and we can explain the treatment and recovery in more detail or if you have decided he is not the right dog for you but you would like to contribute to his heartworm treatment please email the rescue at karin4kritters@gmail.com to find out how you can make a donation toward his treatment or to one of the other heartworm positive dogs at the rescue. Thank you.***\n\n",

I love to play with toys and be with my people. Other dogs make me nervous- I prefer to avoid them. I've never shown any dog aggression, but would likely do better in a home with either no other pets or only calm ones. Sudden movement startles me, so a mature home would be preferable at that. If you have any questions, please contact my shelter! I'm a long timer and deserve my happy place with a family that loves me.

Honey is a shepherd mix and is about six years old. She is an active girl who loves to run and play! Honey is very toy motivated, more so than treat motivated. Honey's favorite thing to do is to play fetch out in the yard. Honey will also keep herself entertained and play by herself with her large rope toy. Honey does well with other dogs her size as long as they are polite. She does not like being jumped on. Honey has a major prey drive and would not do well in a home with cats or small dogs.\n\nThe adoption fee for a dog is $100. This fee includes the dog being current on vaccinations, heart worm tested, spayed or neutered, and microchipped. The shelter is open for visitation from 10am to 5pm Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday and 10am to noon on Saturday. The phone number for the shelter is 812-376-2505",

He is good with cats but no small kids (he is big and a bit clumsy). Sammy can be bossy so a home with bully breed experience is best.\n\nSammy has seperation anxiety when someone is home and he is put up (mostly verbal) that we are working to regulate through medication and exercise so he needs a home that will integrate him into their daily routine. Sammy cannot be kenneled but does well without it and is not generally destructive (save a few pillows that have fallen victim)..\n\nSammy came off of death row in St Louis County (he was Buckett there), for him to end up homeless again is devastating. He deserves a chance to live with a family again. Please offer to help. His life is in the balance.\n\nFOSTER. SHARE. HELP!!!!\n\nThe adoption fee is $200. We do home visits as part of the adoption process for all of our dogs.  Due to that we only do adoptions within the Metro- St. Louis area.",

I am very friendly and quite an energetic guy who would love to find a home with a big yard and people who will love me forever! \n\nI would make for a great hiking partner, but regular neighborhood walks will do. With that being said, I am a favorite among the volunteers and staff when it comes to going on nice long walks, with a side of kisses. I am a bit more selective with my 4 legged dog friends but I do appreciate meeting calmer companions closer to my size. Cats and kids are nice and all but not for me.\n\nI may be a \"senior\" but I am a young buck at heart and soul. I need some help continuing obedience and manners in the home, I do have separation anxiety so I would also need my people to work with me on improving my strong urge to be by your side 24/7. Due to my \"hound howl\", I would not do well with living in apartments or townhouses... don't wanna disturb your neighbors. Luckily, I will come with a training sponsorship from the sanctuary, so I will be set up for success!\n\nIf you would like to meet a southern gent, email us at adoption@sdsanctuary.com with any questions and to schedule an appointment to meet Peter!",

When I\u2019m not chasing around a tennis ball, I can be found going for long walks with my favorite people (sometimes they take me for car rides too, which I LOVE!).

Maybe you\u2019ll be my lottery winnings!\n\nBirthday: 09-11-2010\n\nMeet-Your-Match Canine-ality color is: Orange Busy Bee!!!\nFor safety's sake, we are looking for homes with physical fenced in areas.\nPlease fill out our online adoption survey at www.mackenzies.info",

His ideal home would be as a single dog with not too many visitors, no young children, and no one who isn't capable of following the dog rules as he doesn't like to be confronted with another dog he doesn't know.  He is very good in the house, doesn't make a mess and really doesn't like to get dirty.  He responds well to routine, and is a super good boy on the walk.  He is kennel trained, and has no problem spending the night in his kennel, or perhaps during the day while you are out.  He does not have fear of storms or loud noises and is calm and non-reactive in his kennel.  We do not know how he would react to cats, but he can be aggressive with other male dogs if approached or charged. Some females he tolerates well if they do not get in his face or jump on him.  Gerard was neutered some time ago and is up to date on all shots.  He is ready to go upon an approved home for him.",

It is recommended that his diet not be changed under any circumstances and the feeding protocol including times of day, portions, and access to potty time be maintained consistently.  Currently his IBD is stable and he is not on a specialized prescription diet, simply a good quality kibble with added plain puree pumpkin with a multivitamin daily.",

He's best with strong female leaders in his household.  That includes having a female master (he absolutely will take advantage of anyone that shows him they are scared of him), and also a strong female dog that likes to play ROUGH like he does!  He is solid cattle dog when he plays -- teeth, chasing, body blocking, the whole 9 yards.  He needs a good fenced in yard and LOVES water.   ABSOLUTELY no children, cats, chickens, or any other small creature in Sammy's life.  He is crate trained and we believe he will be house trained.  Loves balls!\n\nSammy will not like a new person right away.  It will take several meetings on neutral turf before he accepts you.  Thusly, he will not tolerate strangers coming to your home or on your property, so you must be prepared to secure him if you have new people coming around.  \n\nWe hope that there is a perfect family for Sammy.  He waited in the animal shelter for 6 months, and now he has been in rescue over a year.  \n\nSammy is neutered, up to date on vaccines and flea/tick prevention, microchipped, heartworm negative, and is ready to leave for his new home right away!\n\nHe is currently in foster care with our rescue in Cleveland, TN,\n\nFor information or inquiries on how to adopt, please email us at pawsofvalor.ar@gmail.com.  \n\n",

He is wonderful with people and would benefit from an active lifestyle.  He would do best in a home without Cats and without other dogs so he could be the primary attention getter and he deserves it.  In return he will provide unconditional love and loyalty. \n\nPlease call Amy 305-304-4441\n\nor Homestead Animal Hospital  305-247-3845\n\n**COURTESY POST DISCLAIMER**\nPlease note that This is the Dog! has not evaluated the dogs marked as courtesy listings and makes no representations as to their health, temperament, or suitability for adoption.\nWe assume that all the information provided by the lister is true and accurate, but cannot be held responsible for the animal itself or the animals health and temperament.

            "description": "Please read this entire paragraph.  We have dogs coming in all the time.  Because of COVID, there is a shortage of small, fluffy dogs.  We are struggling with our rescue partners to find these great adoptable dogs.  The shelter partners only have large dogs available as you can view for yourself as you check shelters and local rescues.\n\nYou will have to check our Petfinder website each week.  We hold applications open for two weeks as we match dogs and will not allow first come first serve.\n\nWe may not be the group for you as we don't allow apartments, condos, and out of area adoptions. We also require a fenced in yard and your patio or porch with a railing does not count.  The invisible fence is not allowed.  During the year we received only 17 dogs when we usually have 70 dogs throughout the year.  Each pet received 30-50 applications.  The last female dog we had in November 2020 received 80 applications.  We are telling you the statistics so understand that the past year was no usual dogs needing homes.  There are hardly any dogs in the shelters except large breeds.\n\nReputable breeders are not found in Penn Yan, NY, or the Southern Tier as the Puppy Millers live there. If you buy from a breeder ensure this breeder is of good standing and not breeding to make a living.  The parents should be in the home when you visit.  If the parents are not on-site, you are in a Millers' home.  Don't buy a puppy from a miller, as the mother dogs are held hostage for reproduction.  You don't want to be a part of the problem.   You should do the research and ask your vet for recommendations. The AKC has a list of breeders and this is where you should start your search if waiting a year for a shelter pet is not available to you.  Remember AKC has to follow the guidelines of the breed which in turn will result in a healthy dog, with no behavior problems.",

He loves to walk, run with you and swim. He knows sit, lay down, up, right paw, left paw and we tried high five. He is a great listener and likes to sprawl out on the floor in the lobby. We\u2019re not completely sure about other dogs but while he was in our lobby with another dog neither one paid attention to the other. A family who knew him in his original home came in with 2 small dogs and he was happy to see them.   He\u2019s pretty perfect. Be sure to check out his video in our Puppy Playground.",

I'm a whole lot of fun packed into a chunky lil package. Sometimes I may come across as a little, ahhhhh, bossy. That's ok I'm really just a girl that knows her own mind. Being at Karin 4 Kritters and getting so much love and attention has helped me build my confidence. I'm getting better at walking on leash and I have found I'm a pretty good listener. That means I know how to take direction from the human walking me - that is if, big if, I don't come across a really interesting scent trail. Then you might have to have a treat handy to gain my attention. Treats are the bomb.com. I blame treats for my, ahem, plump figure. I'm a lot to love with a bit of junk in the trunk. Big trunk big personality that's what I always say and who doesn't want more of a good thing, more to love, more is better, you know it's true (wink).\n\nNote from my favorite volunteer: \u201cMaude is a hoot. She can be so silly and so loving all at the same time. She loves nothing more than to boss around her brother Claude, who is also available for adoption.  Maude is almost 2 and has been with our rescue for over a year. We love her dearly and want nothing more than to see her settled into her very own special home. She is such a chonkette and when she gets that junk in the trunk wiggling - it's the happiest sight you will see all day. I love this sweet, funny, amazing girl so much. It will be a happy day when I see her drive off on her way to her new home.\"\n\nCome meet me like today. I'm ready to bring the fun and the funny, not to mention lots of love and slobbery kisses to your life. If you're ready to make your life immensely better you better come get me. Email the rescue at karin4kritters@gmail.com or hit the button on this page to set up an appointment to meet me. See you soon - love Maude...\n\nPS: An additional note from Maude's biggest fan - Maude loves adventure, going to new places and riding in the car and running errands is an adventure to this sweet girl. She loves everyone and meeting new people is her favorite thing. She always calls shotgun and she makes an awesome wingman - girl - dog. You know what I mean...\n",

We think she\u2019s a lovely girl with so much potential, and 19 months is way too long for her to spend in a shelter.\nShasta is an American Blue Heeler mix. She\u2019s three years, eight monthsold and weighs 58 pounds. Shasta is very timid and doesn\u2019t trust easily. However, once she trusts you she is so loyal, faithful and dedicated to her person, just hoping they\u2019ll be good to her back. Shasta tries so hard to please. She learns quickly, follows directions easily and just laps up the attention of a good ear scratch or belly rub.\nShasta is very frustrated in the confines of her kennel and longs to be out and with people she likes. She is leashed trained and is easy to walk. Shasta is selective about what dogs she likes. She seems to be afraid of most of them and will go into a defensive posture to keep them away from her. Shasta may do best as an only dog, but we can test for potential adopters. Shasta\u2019s behavior may change when out of the kennel and she\u2019s able to bask in the steadying hand of love and a family who understands and protects her. \nIf you\u2019re looking for a wonderful, beautiful girl to make part of your family, come meet our Shasta. She has so much potential and lives to be someone\u2019s best girl.\nShasta is spayed, micro-chipped and fully vetted. \nCall 706-865-4135 for information on additional health services provided as part of the adoption fee.

He is a big strong boy, super smart, makes great eye contact and wants to please. Friendly with other  calm dogs his size with proper introductions but would be best as only dog in his own house. Max has received  professional obedience and leash training.  He would make a great addition to an active adult only household. A single woman who works from home would be ideal. He loves daily walks and is a natural swimmer. He also loves just hanging out in the yard so a home with a fenced yard is a must.  Max is house and crate trained. He is being fostered and trained in Riverside Co. Come meet this special boy. Your heart will be won over at first sight!",

            "description": "Teddy is  a two and  a half  year old  German Shepherd who was purchased  from a breeder.  The owner bought him on a whim and quickly lost commitment as  Teddy grew  from puppyhood  to adolescence. Teddy  was  very smart  and  wanted  attention  but was  given none.  He needed  training but was given none. Instead  Teddy  was  then surrendered  to a high-kill shelter  and  was  rescued from the euthanasia list the week of July 4, 2018 by our rescue.    Teddy  came  to  us  with myriad of  issues.  His  behavior  left  much to be desired.  His  energy level was high. And most important,  Teddy  had  a health issue no one knew about.  In our care,  Teddy  was agitated, assertive  and losing weight by the pounds.  Through  a  grant  from the Petfinder Foundation we  were  able  to diagnosis and treat  Teddy's ailment.  Teddy  was  diagnosis-ed  with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency known as EPI.  This is a condition in which the pancreas fails  to produce enough digestive enzymes which leads  to weight loss, diarrhea and makes the dog  feel overall lousy.  This  is  a  condition that  is  easily  treated  with a dose by weight of  enzymes.  Teddy  has  been  on enzymes  for  a year and has gained weight, developed  a personality in which  he listens and has learned some commands.  He  is less  irritable  and has become more social with other animals.   \nThe story of Teddy  is  a tough one because it exemplifies poor  breeding and poor ownership.  The story of  Teddy  is  why our  shelters  are filled daily with dogs people  have thrown away.  I will  be  honest with you  Teddy  was  a first for our rescue and he  was a major commitment  but  we refused  to give up.  Today Teddy  runs  and plays  like a normal dog.  You  can see it in his eyes  he is ready to please someone and fulfill  someone's life. If  you are interested in Teddy please know  that  his  enzymes most likely will  be a lifelong commitment as well as  a financial commitment.  Teddy  is  ready...finally!!!  We  are  willing to provide transitional training upon adoption. His adoption fee is $200 \nPlease email haltrescue@gmail.com or visit www.haltrescue.org for an application to adopt.",

A gentle soul and a dog who truly needed rescuing. We are here for Valen and now we're looking for his forever champion. Someone who is willing to get to know this sweet dog on his time, letting Valen decide how fast the relationship progresses.\n\nYou see, Valen came to us afraid of humans; terrified really. Too scared to eat when we're around, shutting even the softest noise or smallest movement, so terrified of human touch that he would urinate as soon as he felt our touch. He'd never lived in a house, known a soft bed, abundant food, clean water.\n\nHe rehabilitation has been painstakingly slow, requiring hours of patience. But the reward has been great. Just to see any bit of acceptance, maybe even happiness, from Valen is enough to make your heart soar! We're seeing glimpses of a dog who is now recognizing joy and good things in life.\n\nValen is now searching for his forever champion. That person or family who is willing and able to give him the best life he can have. Who lives in the country, has a fully fenced yard with a fence at least 6 feet tall, who has another dog and who is quiet and gentle. Someone willing to help Valen continue to learn about the big, scary world, but who is also willing to meet him where he is and accept him for who he is. Valen loves to go for walks but only the nature kind as sidewalks and streets are just too intimidating for him right now.\n\nIf you would like to be loved by this great dog, please email us to begin the conversation. Please note we require everyone to complete an adoption application prior to meeting any of our dogs. An adoption fee will apply. Valen is being fostered near Ottawa, Ontario\n\n2/1/21 2:58 PM",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nI'm going to be somebody some day!Date into Rescue: 9/9/2017\n\nReason for being in rescue: I'm a Hurrican orphan\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? none noted- I do have a small mass on the right side of my eye but I am in no pain\nWeight: 54 lbs\nHeight: estimated 22\" at the shoulder\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $99\n\nFence needed? Yes, I really need a place to run and play off leash. If you don't have a fence do you have a dog park near by?\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Dylan needs an active home that could possibly give him a job to do! Dylan still does not get along with other dogs and would do best as your one and only boy.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Dylan is most certainly the type of dog that doesn't let his smelling senses go to waste. Everywhere he goes, he is sniffing everywhere out. Once he starts, it is hard to divert his attention. He could make a great nose work dog. The caregivers have been working with him and have noticed he has gotten better with listening.\n\nDylan is extremely intelligent with a lot of drive. He knows how to sit and has the potential to learn so much more. He is very treat motivated! Even though he is athletic, he still has his sweet/laid back side from time to time. CPR coordinates with other rescues during times of disaster and Dylan was caught in a disaster - a hurricane. Dylan does not need a ton of attention, but we think that he will bond with that right person and be a very loving and loyal dog. Recently, we took him on a trip to the lake. He got a fish hook caught in his paw. While we rushed him to the vet, he decided he could take care of it on his own. By the time we got there (a 5 minute drive), Dylan had already taken the hook out by himself and was ready for another adventure. He is one tough guy!\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Friendly but he pays more attention to things going on around him. Once he has sniffed everything out, he likes to be pet and loved on. He will approach you for attention, but doesn't beg for it.\n\nOther tips and tidbits: One of the \"breed experts\" here believes Dylan is a Belgian Shepherd/Malinois hound mix and he has the personality to go with it. He is still working on leash walking. He pulls with all of his might. But that can be helped with the right kind of harness and training. Dylan is very assertive and alert. You can't sneak anything by him!\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

I need lots of love but also have lots of love to give.\nPET PEEVES: being backed in a corner\nMY FAVORITE SONG: Time, Love & Tenderness by Michael Bolton\nMY MOTTO: Be Loyal and Faithful\n\n\nNOTES FROM MY FOSTER FAMILY:\nWhen Dante came to us from Animal Services, he was terrified and did not want to be handled.  It didn't take long for us to win his trust and see what a wonderful little dog he can be.   Dante is a sweet boy but needs a home that is patient and understanding of his fears of new people and situations.  Once he trusts you, neighborhood walks would be great but until then he will definitely need a fenced yard.  Dante snuggles on the couch under a blanket during TV time and loves to play with other dogs.   He is even OK with cats but small children are not a good idea.   \n\n\nDue to COVID-19 we are a little more limited on volunteers and the availability (and safety) of home visits.   Local applications are given first priority and some out of town areas will not be able to be processed.\n\nAt this time, we will only be able to process applications that have an excellent current vet history.  If you haven\u2019t had a pet or verifiable vet history we will not be able to process your application.   \n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please complete our Adoption Application by copying and pasting the following link into your web browser: http://www.caninecastaways.org/adoption-application\n\nFor a full list of dogs we currently have for adoption use this link:  https://www.caninecastaways.org/adoptable-dogs\n\n\nMEDICAL INFO:\n\n\nThe following has been or will be done for this dog...\n- Basic Exam by Veterinarian\n- Spayed or Neutered\n- Heartworm Tested\n- Placed on heartworm preventive\n- Basic Bloodwork\n- Urinalysis\n- Microchipped\n- Intestinal Parasite Exam and medication\n- Vaccinations\n- Placed on Flea preventive\n\n\nADOPTION DONATION: $250\n\n\nThis adoption donation helps to cover the vet expenses for this dog including heartworm preventive which is dispensed at the initial vet visit and then goes with the dog at adoption. All vet records will be provided to adopter. \n\nVisit us at www.caninecastaways.org",

She was unfortunately hit by a car and that accident caused the loss of her back leg. That didn't slow her down at all though, she popped back up after surgery and carried on with life! Like most of our dogs, Amelia is searching for an extra understanding home that gets that she carries some baggage. Amelia would do well in a family with other dogs, however she guards her resources so no young children for her! Amelia is more of an independent, happy go lucky pup! She enjoys sun bathing and snuggling up on the couch at night, or just doing her own thing in her bed at night - she also LOVES swimming! Let's chat more about this stunning beauty!\n\nInterested in adopting Amelia? Please visit our website and fill out an adoption application! pitbulladvocates.org \n\nWant to learn more?

            "description": "Blue is around 6 years old and weighs 120 pounds. He is a gentle giant and very well-mannered. He LOVES belly rubs! He is active, but not hyper. He enjoys being outdoors with his humans. He would do best with mature children, over 13 years of age. He must be the only pet in the household. He is crate-trained. While he is a big, loving goofball, Blue would do well with someone familiar with his breed and not intimidated by his size. He does not require walks, but would like a yard where he can run and play. He loves to play with toys! He is a great dog and will make a wonderful companion. Blue was abandoned in the backyard of his home when his previous owners moved out and did not bring him with them. Luckily, a neighbor realized he was left behind and contacted us. His adoption fee is $295 which covers the cost of his core vaccines (Distemper/Parvo and Rabies), deworming, microchip, and microchip registration. If you are interested in adopting, the first step of our process is completing the adoption application, available on our website, poochmatch.com, under the \"Adoption\" tab. Please read the following paragraphs which detail our adoption process.\n\nIf this listing is still posted, we are still accepting applications for him/her. We do not do out-of-state adoptions on highly adoptable dogs; we would only consider out-of-state adoptions for dogs that prove hard-to-place locally. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nUPDATE: ADOPTION EVENTS CANCELLED DUE TO PANDEMIC AND SOCIAL DISTANCING. If you are interested in meeting any Poochmatch dog at our weekly adoption event on Saturdays at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda, CA (5521 Mirage St.) between 1-5 PM, please fill out an application from our website, poochmatch.com, and submit it no later than 11 AM on Fridays. Upon receipt AND approval, the dog you are interested in meeting will be made available to meet on a Saturday. Due to the high volume of dogs and puppies in our foster homes, it is impossible to bring them all every Saturday. The only way to ensure that the dog that you are interested in will be at the adoption event is to FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AND BE APPROVED. Otherwise, we cannot guarantee that the dog you are interested in will be at our adoption event. If you cannot make the time frame of our events, appointments can be made at another time and location solely at the discretion of the foster parent. Please understand that private appointments will be coordinated to meet the convenience of the foster parent/transporter.\n\nAll adoption fees cover the mandatory and non-negotiable spay/neuter, rabies, microchip, microchip registration, full sets of core vaccinations (rabies and 1 set of distemper/parvo for adults, 4 for puppies) and deworming. Adoption fees vary based on age, breed, size and the costs incurred on the dog's behalf by us i.e. medical, behavioral training, etc. and they range from $225-$495.\n\n\nCOVID-19 PROCEDURE:\nIn an effort to create a safe environment for our potential adopters and our staff, we have changed our protocols and procedures during these difficult times. Starting immediately, our procedures will change from what\u2019s written on our website and other social media platforms. Our weekly adoption event at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda is temporarily cancelled due to COVID-19 and social distancing. The only way to meet one of the dogs/puppies we have available for adoption is through completion of our adoption application through our website, poochmatch.com, before 11 AM on Fridays. On Fridays when we review the applications, we will pick the best fit for each dog or puppy applied for and coordinate mutually agreeable appointment times for the applicants who are approved that week. Private appointments are currently only scheduled on Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday of each week. Masks or bandanas are mandatory; faces must be properly covered.\n\nWith the overwhelming desire of the public to adopt at this time, we have received as many as 30 applications for one dog in just one week. Working with a staff of volunteers, we are only able to reach out on Fridays to the people we have approved to adopt. If you have not heard from us by Friday, we have selected a different applicant. If you have multiple dogs/puppies that you are interested in, please indicate each dog/puppy of interest on the application at that time so we don\u2019t rule you out for another dog/puppy available for adoption.\n\nPlease understand, we have an influx of texts, phone calls and emails that makes it impossible to get to each and every one of you. Not just for adoption interest, but also from veterinarians, people who must relinquish dogs, people who have found a stray dog in need of pick up, etc. We are currently not in need of fosters. Due to the fact that there is such a high demand, we are sticking with strict protocol to not adopt out of Southern California. We apologize for this inconvenience and difficulty to be able to get in touch with us while there is an overwhelming desire and demand to adopt at this time. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we navigate through these difficult times with every intention to keep the public and our staff safe.",

We go to the lake and play in the water and take long car rides. I'm a great snuggler so much so I have to be the only animal snuggling. I'm great with kids, love to take long walks and chew on my peanut butter bones. I need a furever home where I am the only one being spoiled. If you love my ears in pictures wait till you see them in person!!\n\nIncluded with adoption: Age-appropriate vaccinations, up to date heart-worm preventative, heart-worm test if over 6 months, insurance for 30 days, microchip with registration, and spayed or neutered- if not already, a voucher is provided. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry",

Twister had never been around people other than his owner, so he is very, very shy. He would hardly make eye contact with people when he first arrived, but he has improved a  little. He has been in a foster home and his foster mom told us this about him, \"Twister is still doing well and seems to be thriving on his break from the shelter. He\u2019s still shy but desperately trying to communicate with us. He follows us around the house. He sleeps in a soft dog bed through the night. He\u2019s walking well on a leash and eating treats from our hand. The other day he was howling (softly almost singing) at the wind chimes. He\u2019d make an awesome companion dog - very low maintenance, and he's content with simple acts of kindness and inclusion.  He definitely takes his cues from our dogs. He needs to be in household with another dog, and he gets along well with our cat.\" \n\nHe and Mimi need to be adopted together.\n\nTwister's date of birth is 6/27/2010 and he weighs about 48 pounds. We discovered recently that he has a heart murmur, but he is doing fine. \n\nYou can submit an adoption application for this sweet boy at http://www.fayettefcar.com/applicationform, where you can also review FCAR\u2019s adoption requirements.\n\nAll FCAR adoptable dogs have been spayed or neutered, are current on all vaccines, on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, microchipped, and come with a 30-day pet health guarantee. The adoption fee is $95 with an approved application. A fenced yard is required for Twister.\n\n",

There you will find our online application to adopt and on the same page at the top some of our guidelines and policies and geographic areas we cover.  Many of your questions may be answered here.  Please read Mugsy's bio--it answers the common questions of good with children, if has to have a fenced yard, etc.  If you still have questions, please email the foster parent listed at the end of Mugsy's biography, not the general inquiry button found on this page.  \n\n Mugsy is an adorable little black Miniature Schnauzer.  He is on the smaller size and about 7 years old.  He loves attention, but on his terms\u2014he will cuddle on the sofa beside you, but does not enjoy being picked up\u2014ask him to join you and he is all in, though!  Typical terrier, typical Miniature Schnauzer, and Schnauzer of small stature\u2026. he thinks he is the biggest dude around, so he would best fit as an ONLY PET with his ALL ADULT family home with a fenced in yard. He can be a barker, so will do best in a single family home rather than an apartment or condo. \n\nMugsy's family moved and were unable to keep him where they would move to.  But earlier Mugsy had been attacked by a large dog.  So, the outcome is he is all about Mugsy--he is going to take care of Mugsy first.  He does not care for larger dogs and sometimes not for dogs his size.   Take it slow and easy with Mugsy and he is your buddy, but if you try to make him do something his little terrier mind does not want to, he can be nippy.  He bonds rapidly with his new human and wants to keep them all to himself.  Mugsy needs a home where he can have his confidence built but also one that is Schnauzer smart and willing to work with a trainer to  help him be more comfortable in his own skin.  In trade, Mugsy will be on the sofa beside you every night watching news, sitcoms, whatever you choose, he doesn't care. \n\nMugsy is up to date on all of his vaccinations, microchipped, on heartworm preventative, and neutered.  He is looking for love\u2014is your\u2019s the right place?  For more info, contact his foster mom, Nancy, in Cincinnati, OH at kismet1@fuse.net.",

He is an active dog and he is bonded to his favorite playmate, his brother Chico. They play and wrestle together. He doesn\u2019t ever want to go inside, although this could change with some patience. He needs room to run and a privacy fence due to his ability to climb a chain link fence. Rico is butterscotch colored with white and black markings and beautiful eyes. He is neutered, up to date on his shots, microchipped and healthy. He is a beautiful mix of breeds but mostly Boxer with a date of birth of 3/26/18 and full grown at 73 pounds. Rico would love to find a home with his brother Chico.\n***************************************************************************\nThis pet comes with an implanted 24 PetWatch microchip and free registration into the 24PetWatch pet recovery service. \n***************************************************************************\nThis dog is available for adoption at the Humane Society of McCormick County for an adoption fee.

Chico is an active dog and he is bonded to his favorite playmate, his brother Rico. They play and wrestle together. He doesn\u2019t ever want to go inside, although this could change with some patience. He needs room to run and a privacy fence due to his ability to climb a chain link fence. Chico is butterscotch colored with white and black markings and one brown eye and one eye that appears white. Chico is neutered, up to date on his shots, microchipped and healthy.  He is a beautiful mix of breeds but mostly Boxer with a date of birth of 3/26/18 and full grown at 68 pounds. Chico would love to find a home with his brother Rico.\n***************************************************************************\nThis pet comes with an implanted 24 PetWatch microchip and free registration into the 24PetWatch pet recovery service. \n***************************************************************************\nThis dog is available for adoption at the Humane Society of McCormick County for an adoption fee. To adopt, contact 864-391-2349 or HSMC2000@gmail.com. We are an all-volunteer 501c3 organization. To learn more, visit www.mccormickcounty.petfinder.com.\n",

            "description": "Meet our girl Raelynn! Rae Rae is a 4-year-old black lab mix and she weighs around 50 pounds. Raelynn came to us after being found in a vacant home with her puppies. She is normally a quiet girl, only barking when other dogs bark. Raelynn would love a home where she can get her people\u2019s attention all to herself. She is said to be house-trained and signals by crying and running to the door. Raelynn takes a bit to warm up to men, but has made great progress in the time we\u2019ve known her. She doesn\u2019t seem to be a jumper, takes treats gently, and loves sleeping in bed with people. Rae Rae is good on a leash and would love to walk out the door with you! If you want to make her a member of your family, please fill out an adoption application at itvrescue.org!  \n\nAll of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heartworm tested and treated if necessary.\n\nPlease realize that many of our animals are kept in foster homes. Please complete an adoption application at http://itvrescue.org/adoption-application/ in order to meet with one of our animals. There is no obligation in completing the application, but it helps us find an animal that is most appropriate for your family.  The ITV Rescue Center is open Tuesdays 12-5; Wednesdays 12-7; Thursdays 12-5; Fridays 12-5 and Saturdays 10-5.  The Rescue Center is located at 1417 N. Stockwell Road.  You are welcome to come to our rescue center during open hours to see all of our great adoptable animals. Thank you for your interest in our animals!\n\nNOTE: Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

He definitely does better in an environment with an owner who has rules and makes him follow them.  He is a very sweet boy and loves his people.  He does ok with low key dogs, but I would recommend a house without young children as he can be pretty rambunctious and may knock little kids down.  He is house and crate trained.  He is fully vaccinated, neutered and microchipped.  He tested negative for heartworm and has been kept on Heartgard and Bravecto since he has been in foster care.  His adoption fee is $200 plus ky sales tax.  Please email saveourshelterdogs4@yahoo.com for an applciation.",

She had several bite wounds, lacerations and a severe ear infection at intake, which have all improved immensely. Sweeter than candy, this darling is calm, gentle and sometimes sensitive and timid. Brooklyn's an excellent walker who will readily sit for treats or toys. Some dogs can barely contain their excitement over treats or toys, but Brooklyn's one of the special ones whose eyes do all the talking. We'll never know if she was running to or away from something, but we're certain she'll make a fast, loyal friend. Brooklyn's adoption fee is $150 and covers her spay, worming, vaccinations, microchip, monthly heart worm, flea and tick preventive and care while at CCHS. If you're seeking a special girlfriend, Brooklyn won't disappoint!",

She is such a great little lady that it is hard to imagine that she was a stray. Callie had been hanging around the neighborhood for several days when Miss Jeanie took her in. It is obvious that Callie was at one time someone's beloved pet but no one has come looking for her. Callie loves people but would do best as an only dog. She just wants to be with you and with her family. She is sweet and gentle--an all around great girl who will be an excellent addition to the right family. She needs an active family with older children or an active couple. A fenced in yard is a must as she needs space to run and play. She would be a great playmate for older children or another young big dog. Callie is an inside dog. She loves to play with toys. She is housebroken. She is learning to walk on a leash and to not jump. Continued training will be needed. She rides well in the car. Callie is spayed, current on all her shots and microchipped. She is also heartworm negative and on monthly preventative. To be considered for Callie's forever family please contact Vivienne at viviennejames@comcast.net or 615-943-7311.

She is a petite Pibble/Boxer gal who wishes for a home. Rose has an adorable underbite and wears a beautiful dark brindle coat. She is the perfect combination of playful at times and calm/cuddly when shes ready to relax. She loves to play with other dogs that are similar in size who can match her playful style.\n\nRose has excellent house manners, housebroken, with basic commands. She walks well on the leash, rides great in the car, and loves to play fetch.\n\nThis beauty can be cautious with new people, so proper and slow introductions to new people will be important. Rose will want to meet you a couple of times to make sure you all match well together. Because she can be cautious, we are looking for an adult-only home for Rose. Once you win her over, she will reward you with tons of affection and love. She will snuggle into your lap and simply melt into it. **She is currently located in the Douglasville, PA area**\n\nPlease visit www.mostlymuttz.org/adoption-application/ to complete an application for Rose.",

He loves attention and is very playful.\n\"Homie\" likes to run fast, and will chase smaller animals: cats, ducks, rabbits, but he ignores my chickens. I would suggest a fenced in area or yard/pen for him. He does dig a hole to lie in when he is hot. He loves car rides, really gets excited when he sees/hears a Pickup truck.  I suspect his former owner had one. He loves guys and gals, unknown how he is with kids, but I would not place him with a toddler as he likes to jump, and may knock a small child down. He is about knee-high to an adult, and about 55 lbs. \nHe barks when he sees strangers and other dogs, but I feel he is not being aggressive, only inviting play. He will fall on his back with his legs in the air for morning belly-rubs, he adores them.  Since his head and neck are the same diameter, he has learned to back out of a collar. I tried a harness on him, and he had chewed it off in a few minutes. Homie\" is neutered, current on all shots, on flea and tick killer and heartworm negative, and on meds to prevent heartworms.  He is a good eater, not finicky at all. I feed him dry food mixed with a pouch of Pedigree wet stirred in for breakfast, and doggie biscuits for midday snacks, and he gets a pouch of Moist and Meaty with another pouch of Pedigree wet for his dinner. He was thin when found, but has gained weight with proper foods.  \n\"Homer\" is a very handsome young dog, very playful, and wants human company very much. I think he would make a good pet for a single person, or family without toddler children. He loves just to lie beside you and gaze at you. He loves being brushed, loves his toys, he is just a bundle of joy waiting to be loved!  I would",

I\u2019ve been in foster care for MORE THAN A YEAR. I like to play with toys with my foster moms boy. I\u2019m more to mind my own business when I\u2019m out in the play yard with other dogs . I am good with most dogs, but some intact males I\u2019ve met I didn\u2019t care for. I love human interaction.  I'm so good with my foster humans boy . I don\u2019t like cats, just dogs and people for me.  I\u2019ve got a med-high energy level. I\u2019m wide open when you let me out. So my family would need to be active I need exercise to burn my energy. I\u2019m very fun and loving. I do good in a crate and I'm house trained.  For my safety I need a fenced in yard to run in. \n\nPlease give this stunning tiger striped guy a chance. To schedule a meet n greet please fill out this form https://tinyurl.com/keelysadoptionday",

She had a family but due to unforeseen circumstances, her Dad was no longer able to care for her so we agreed to take her in to our rescue.  Sarah has previously had puppies but those days are now permanently behind her.  She is very sweet and friendly. She is strong on a leash but listens to patient redirecting.  We have noticed she has issues with other dogs near her food, so a home without young children where the family will keep an eye on her is a must.  She gets along well with other dogs as long as food or treats aren't involved.  Sarah is smart and food motivated so with some time, you will have a wonderful furry family member.  She is already crate trained and housebroken. \n\nAmazing Grace Bully Rescue is a foster based rescue in the Pensacola, Florida area.  We do not have a physical building. If you would like to meet any of our pups, the first step is to fill out our online application so we can contact you. \n\nOur adoption fee for Sarah is $150 and includes her spay, current shots, rabies, and registered microchip. \n\nIf you would like to adopt this Amazing dog, please fill out our online adoption application at www.amazinggracebullyrescue.org",

            "description": "Up for adoption in Texas: Cammie Marie!\n\nCammie is 2-3 years old and 53 pounds.\n\nCammie was an owner surrender from a shelter in Houston.  All Lucky Lab really knew when we saved her, is that she was underweight, heartworm positive, and had clearly mothered a few litters of puppies in her lifetime.\n\nOver the last few months, Cammie has been treated for heartworm disease, spayed, and gained a healthy amount of weight.\n\nSince moving in with her foster family, Cammie has really blossomed!  Her favorite thing to do is to be with her people, wherever that may be.  \n\nCammie is very treat motivated and has done great with obedience training! She has learned commands such as come, sit, down, bang, kennel, and place, in a short period of time.  She is starting to play fetch in the backyard but is just as happy sitting on the porch being petted.  \n\nDuring the day, Cammie does well in her kennel.  She may or may not have a track record of destroying small toys, haha, so a kennel is recommended.  Cammie has done well with all adults that she has come in contact with.  \n\nWe think Cammie would do best in a home with no other pets and no young children. \n\nWhat makes Cammie\u2019s day is cuddling.  If you are looking for a dog that will be your shadow, Cammie may be your girl!\n\nCammie is fully vaccinated, microchipped, spayed, and ready for her forever home!

I was rescued from a construction site, it took the humans quite some time to help me, but I am thankful they did. I am a little timid, but thanks to my foster mom, I am learning to trust. They praise me for being a great leash walker, being potty-trained, and a calm companion. I like having other dog friends around, they help build my confidence and work as perfect role models around the home. Sunbathing and sleeping on a comfy bed is also an essential part of my daily routine, not sure about swimming yet, but with enough time, I might be open to adventures. Can you give me a chance?

I spent the first several years of my life as a Border Patrol dog!!! It's not easy being in law enforcement. I had to be very serious all the time and constantly be on watch. As a result, I'm not your typical goofy Golden. It takes me some time to get to know people, so you must be patient with me as I become familiar with you. In my line of work, I had to be on guard all the time, so since I have retired those old habits are tough to break. I met a lot of not so nice people along the way so it's in my nature to be a little standoffish at first. I'm happiest when I have a job. I love to chase the ball or chew on my Kong. Give me something to do and I'm on it! After I have had the opportunity to spend some time with you and get to know you, I warm up quite nicely and can be very cuddly. My foster has been working with me and showing me what it's like to take it easy and enjoy playing in the yard and going on long walks. I am an excellent communicator, so if you watch my cues, we will get along just fine! I do wear a vest when I am out and about so folks know I'm working and don't like a lot of attention. I'm looking for a forever home where I can spend my retirement, taking it easy in the peace and quiet. I'm not crazy about other dogs so I would need a home where I am an only dog. I do like cats though!!! I need a tall fence and no children in the home. I had so much excitement as a border patrol dog I am looking to find a quiet home without a lot of commotion and visitors. I can be left alone for a little while if you need to go out for a bit. If visitors do come over, I can go into my own room and be quiet too!  I'm so grateful to AGA for trying to find me the right home where I can finally be a Golden Retriever and enjoy my retirement years!!!",

I had two large ulcerated mammary tumors that were seeping.  I was in a lot of pain.  After I was rescued, I went to the vet and eventually had major surgery.  Turns out I had a really bad case of mastitis.  I had two long incisions closed with staples and tubes sticking out but I started feeling better right away.  A couple of weeks later, I was spayed.  Now I\u2019m all healed up and a happy dog.  Really glad don\u2019t have to wear that silly cone around my head anymore. I\u2019m so happy to be living in a home where I get meals every day.   You might think I look a little on the skinny side but I\u2019ve gained a lot of weight since being rescued.   I especially like it when I get treats.  Since I\u2019m finally healed up my foster mommy has been working on basic obedience commands.  I know how to sit.  I\u2019m also potty trained.   I like to go for walks but I am a strong girl and I\u2019m still learning how to walk nicely on a leash.  I\u2019m good in my crate.  I\u2019d much rather curl up on the couch with my foster mommy but I\u2019m not allowed to be out and about the house when no one is home.  You might have to trick me with treats to get me to go into my crate but I won\u2019t try to escape and I don\u2019t bark or howl when I\u2019m in there.  I might whine a little but not for long.  You might hear me snore once I\u2019m really comfortable.  I\u2019m learning how to play, but most times I run past the frisbee.  I just get the zoomies when I\u2019m really happy.\n\nManhattan will do best if she's the only dog in the home. If interested in meeting her, please fill out an adoption application.",

As pet of the month, Bella\u2019s adoption fee will be reduced 25%. \n\nShe is a playful and affectionate little girl who loves to play, zoomie around the yard, and show off her many tricks and commands that she knows. Bella will thrive in a quiet, adult-only home with patient adopters. She likes other dogs but is not a fan of cats. If interested, please email an application to dogs@daws.org. You can see Bella in action by visiting https://youtu.be/xqtcUiDDx60.\n\nHere\u2019s what a volunteer has to say about Bella: \u201cThis sweetheart keeps getting overlooked because it takes her a while to warm up to strangers. Most adopters want a 'ready-to-go dog' who will fit into their busy lives without much effort. Bella is truly an amazing dog, who once she trusts someone, will be a forever BF. She is housetrained and has done great while visiting in my home. She doesn't get into things that are not hers, and is as happy sleeping on the couch, or in the bed with me. The love this dog has to give is well worth the time it takes to earn her trust.\u201d",

Grover was spotted abandoned by the side of the road chained to his dog house. He sat there for days before good Samaritans were finally able to get him to safety!\n\nGrover is a sweet boy who can be a little shy at first but loves people and just really wants to be loved and to be in a home. He plays well with female dogs, but is selective with male dogs. Grover would benefit from the nurturing of his adopter to gain confidence with his new environment, other dog friends and walking on a leash. This dog so desperately deserves a home to call his own after all he has endured!\n\nOur adoption fee includes age-appropriate vaccinations and vetting, deworming, microchipping, and transport expenses. \n\nAll children at home should be at least age 5 to be approved for adoption!Adoption fee is $150 to help offset travel and medical expenses.",

I am a bit shy at first, but once I get adjusted and get to know someone I am very friendly and playful! I absolutely love to play with my toys, people and other dogs. I also love kids! I currently have 3 elementary aged kids in my foster home who I do great with! I have lots of energy and love to go for walks!! I\u2019m a very loyal boy who just wants to be loved by a family of my own. \n\n\n***Dallas area/metroplex adoptions only.***\nThe first step in our adoption process is to fill out an adoption application http://elmanimalrescue.org/adoption-application/.

            "description": "Oliver is a smooth collie mix who was born on January 4, 2018 into a litter of 10. His father was a short-haired merle collie and his mother was a collie-pharaoh hound mix. He was originally adopted at the too-young age of 4 weeks and has grown into a gorgeous 90+ pound bundle of energy.\nAt 18 months, he is still very much a puppy....a BIG puppy....with all of a puppy's affection, playfulness as well as unbridled energy. While Ollie loves to cuddle, play fetch, tug of war and run around with other big dogs, sometimes he can also be somewhat grabby and quite protective.\nOllie was neutered at 6 months and is fully house-trained. He is very, very smart and knows basic commands having worked with two trainers.\nOliver needs a very active and engaging home life. He requires a yard with lots of space so he can run around to burn off his still-puppy energy. He could probably be trained to be a great agility or working farm dog. \nOliver absolutely requires a physically and mentally strong person who is willing to devote the necessary time to continue his training. This individual needs to be an exceptionally savvy dog person who is motivated to work with Ollie to make him into a great companion.\nBecause of Oliver's size and energy, he will not be adopted into a household with cats, small dogs or children under the age of 16.\n\n\n\n\n<p>\nWe have many wonderful collies awaiting adoptive homes.

You must be able to control her and manage her in situations where other dogs may be present. She lives with dogs, but has to be introduced slowly and monitored until she and the other dog(s) have settled into their respective roles. For this reason applicants with significant experience with dogs are preferred. Shes very laid back and does not require a lot of exercise. She occasionally plays with toys but is most interested in her food. She does tend to gain weight easily so she needs a human who will help her moderate her snacks to keep her at a healthy weight. She likes to talk and just wants to be with her human. She is good with cats and lives with cats in her foster home. She seems to be good with children but, like most dogs, does not like fast moving children running by her crate at adoptions. If you are interested in adopting Braeden please contact us.",

Her rear legs especially are funky looking (and you can spot her a mile down the road because of the way she walks!).  But she doesn't care.  Pepper is one of those happy-go-lucky dogs who looks and acts goofy.  She can be very stubborn - SHE decides how far and on which side of the road she walks.  She loves to hold onto her bigger balls/kongs (but she is NOT a retriever for sure - she just thinks she looks cute!)  Dr Pepper tried living with kids once but they move too quickly for her.  Other dogs for the most part are okay but she can be very pushy and she can't tolerate other dogs jumping on her.  .  Please meet this kid in person - she's worth your time.

            "description": "<br>Update 3/10/20:  Betsy has completed her heartworm treatments and is now off any restrictions on her activity.  She will still be required to continue to be on her medication. She is now 50lbs and our vet thinks she is between 3 and 4 years old.  She will have her final appointment for her heartworm treatments the end of June and at that time, we will know if we can reduce her meds or if we have to continue with the same mount.  Needless to say, she will have to continue visiting a cardiologist on a regular basis.\n\nBetsy is heartworm positive and is preparing for her heartworm treatments.  The heartworms have caused permanent heart damage and she will be required to take medication (about $300.00/month) for the rest of her life.\n\nBetsy has had a very hard start.  She was found emaciated, her ears cut and in need of medical attention for a prolapse rectum.  She has come a long way and is now looking for a forever home.  Betsy is heartworm positive and will be adopted with her medication and will need to have regular visits to the vet until her heartworm treatment is  completed.  Her prolapse rectum has been surgically repaired.  Her adoption fee is $300.00<br>\n<b>We are not a shelter.</b>  Because all our pets are in private foster homes, we require everyone to fill out an adoption application and have their references checked, prior to meeting our pets.  If you are interested in this pet, please email info@k9sinneed.com for an adoption application.  You will need to indicate in your that you understand she will require daily medication and regular visits to a cardiologist for the rest of her life if you want a response from us. NJ RESIDENCE ONLY PLEASE.\n<br><br>\nPlease note:  Dog breed listings and their descriptions are best guess' and not guaranteed.

Sometimes, he is a little afraid of men, so he would love a female household or someone who will understand and give him time to come around. \n\nTo adopt or foster, please submit a fully completed application on our website at www.nalasrescue.org/adoption-application.\nWe are located in Palm City, FL and we adopt mostly in a 50 miles radius.

She is playful out in the exercise yard when she gets out but she is also very calm and loving when we're inside her kennel just spending time together. She like to get her body as close to you as she can while receiving 'pets' to the point that it feels like she trying to hug you with her body. She is such a love and would love to find her own forever home.\n\nThere is a $65 fee for adopting one of our male dogs/puppies or a $75 fee for adopting one of our female dogs/puppies. The fee helps cover the Spay/Neuter vouchers and the Rabies Vaccine voucher. Please look at our home page for more information about a adopting a new friend.",

Everyone seems to have a different theory about what he is, but to us it doesn\u2019t much matter. We just call him a North American Handsome Brown Dog.  He is an incredible athlete - his frisbee skills are second to none.  Since he is an active dog, he will need an active home with previous experience.  Small dogs and cats are not in Keno's future. Come meet Keno!\n\nInterested?  Start with filling out the on-line adoption application at www.traineddogsforadoption.org\nThis does not commit you to anything, it just helps us understand what you are looking for.  We will contact you shortly thereafter to discuss further!",

She is 5 1/2 years old (as of November, 2018), a Dobie-Greyhound mix (definitely), and she was dropped off by her owner at an animal shelter. Her face was so sad that no thinking rescuer could abandon her to whatever fate would have befallen her after her shelter pleaded for rescue assistance on her behalf. Scarlett is a tall, lean girl who is a little insecure, probably having never been away from home before, but she warms quickly to a gentle, caring person. She appeared to have been a house dog because of her tender feet and loving behavior toward kindness. She's also an excellent watchdog.  Unfortunately, Scarlett didn't work out in her last home because she was too unwelcoming to strangers and overprotective.  Visitors were frightened by her and her owners couldn't curb the behavior.  She is devoted to adults that she lives with but she will need safe confinement when anyone visits, even if she has met them before. She cannot live with small animals or other large female dogs.",

She has been treated and is now up to her normal weight of 45 lbs. Petal has bowed legs and arthritis which make it difficult for her to go up and down stairs. She also suffers from recurring pancreatitis and requires special food. Petal's perfect forever place will be a quiet home in the suburbs or rural area with a fenced yard and minimal stairs. We don't know what Petal's life was like before we rescued her, but we know it was not good as she is scared of many things, including cars and noises. Petal is a sweet, terrific dog who has so much love to give. She just needs someone with pati\nence and love who will understand her fears and work with her at her pace to overcome them.\nIf you are the special person who can make room in your heart and home for Petal, please apply online to adopt this senior beauty at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org",

After many miles of walking and getting to the northside. they both rested under one of our trees in front of the shelter.  The pavement being so hot in June the young man carried Nick for about a mile before he stop to rest. Nick had blisters on the bottom of his feet. Needles to say the young man did not feel Nick could continue his journey to Pa with the man.\nNick is very food motivated and would do well in a training class which PRN will be  happy to pay for. He loves toys.He is getting kennel crazy. He is exercised twice a day at 20 minutes a time but unlike some of our dogs he really is not adjusting.  We are always so leery abopting out pits due to the fact so many people hate them.\n He would love to have  a fenced yard to play in. We would love to have a vet reference. No children as we do not know if he has been with children.\n\nI",

The world can be a bit overwhelming for Watts at times so to help with his confidence his caregivers have been doing nose work and hiding treats for him to find. He has quickly become a master sleuth and can figure out any puzzle. \nBecause Watts can get overwhelmed at times, his ideal home would be quiet with a family that would allow him to do things at his own pace. He is a great companion who will respect your space and although not overly affectionate, when he is in his element with the people he loves he is happy and enthusiastic. \nHe has lived with other dogs and mostly keeps to himself so he would make a great companion for another dog that isn't looking for a lot of attention. Watts is looking for that perfect person to help him enjoy life and grow into an amazing confident dog!",

He would do best in a house with no children or dogs, as they tend to startle him. If you have patience and love in your heart, consider Sparky.\n\nAll animals are spayed/neutered and up to date on vaccinations before going home!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting me or want further information, please contact the shelter via email, or phone, or stop by for a visit.\n\nWe are at the Petsmart store in Avon, IN every Saturday from 11am-3pm if that would be closer for you to meet this dog.  Please contact us!  Thank you for looking at a shelter dog to adopt!\n\nAs part of the COVID-19 procedures, PetSmart and OCHS have had to cancel Saturday adoption events, until restrictions have been lifted. If you are interested in an animal, fill out an application at ochumane.org. A shelter staff member will contact you, to set up an appointment to meet one of our animals at the shelter.",

You see, I have some very specific health needs and I will need a very experienced, very patient and very loving human to live with.   I am a 4-year-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and weigh about 20 pounds.  You see, I have some some compression in my spine that occasionally hurts but mostly if you try pick me up so please don't.  I also have a suspected neurological disorder that causes me to go into a short period of disorientation.   When this happens, I will not recognize you and will nip if you try to touch me.  A few minutes later, I come out of it fine with my tail wagging and looking for a treat.  I will not do well around younger children because of this, but may be okay with older teenagers who understand and respect my limitations.  I am house-trained and I really am a sweet girl and love people.  I am happy to sleep the day away, but I do have spurts of energy and like to play with toys.  I do enjoy human companionship very much.   If you think that you can accept and help to care for my health challenges and help me to live within my means, I would love to meet you!",

            "description": "DJ's Dallas is proof that great things come in small packages.  Believe it or not, she is part German Shepherd.   DJ, their mom, came to us very pregnant and within a week of joining Coastal, she gave birth to Dallas and her littermates.  Dallas has been holding off for the perfect fit.  She  is the sweetest of sweet, the most energetic of energetic.   She cam jump very high and when she wants to capture the soft spot in your heart, she can do the low crawl straight into your arms.  What is she mixed with?  Cattle Dog is our first guess, but there may be some Jack Russell and Beagle in there too.  While she may be what many would refer to as a Heinz 57 and not a purebred German Shepherd, she is 100 percent pure love.  \nShe needs a yard with a good fence to play in, as she can jump like she's on a pogo stick, especially when there's something she wants to get.  She needs a comfy bed inside with her family, someone who can throw the ball for her, go on walks with her, help her burn her energy, and someone who can relax and watch a movie with her too.  If she could be a lap dog, she would love to be just that.    She is not too picky on her canine companions, but she would like to live with one that can keep up with her energy.  They don't necessarily have to run circles as fast as she can.  She's happy to do her circles around them while they catch up.  They do need to like her kisses, though.  She loves to snuggle and nuzzle with her doggy foster brothers and sisters.  \nShe has not been around children.  So, while older children will probably be okay, young children, toddlers and babies are not for her.  \n \nPuppies are a life-long commitment. They need time, training, vet care and healthy feeding to become good canine citizens. Don't even think of adopting a puppy unless you intend to invest the time and money and commitment required, and you can expect to lose a few good shoes along the way!\n\nIf you are interested in me, please contact us at puppies@coastalgsrsd.org or call (858) 779-9149. Don't forget to fill out our online application:  http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/webform/1774/adoption-application.\n\nThe minimum adoption donation ranges from $300 to $400. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is 100% tax deductible.\n\nPrior to placement, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are usually microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.\n\nOur adoption process begins with completing an application on-line. A phone screening will soon follow, and lastly a home visit will be conducted by our volunteers.\n\nWe show our dogs at adoption events every weekend! Please click on events at Events to see where we'll be next! Coastal German Shepherd Rescue of Southern California is a non-profit 501(c%293 public charity dedicated to finding loving homes for abandoned German Shepherds. Your tax deductible donations go to support these very deserving animals. Coastal was formed to serve communities in the counties of San Diego, Orange, Los Angeles and the Inland Empire. We are committed to finding loving permanent homes for the orphaned dogs in our care. Coastal is an all volunteer, no-kill, 501 (c%29 3 non profit organization.",

Chip is ready and willing to be your play buddy, snuggle buddy and jogging or hiking buddy. Such a smart little girl, Chip has learned to sit, come and fetch! She is very dedicated and loyal to her person, and aims to please. Chip girl is a bit nervous with children, so a home with adults would be a better match for her. Chip truly is a sweet heart!\n\n*Chip is on a training plan and requires more than one visit with our Behavior team. If you are interested in meeting Chip, please contact us at adoptions@pawscrossedny.org for more information!*\n\nBefore you can adopt sweet Chip, please complete an adoption application on our website at pawscrossedny.org! Once your application is approved, you will receive a link to schedule an appointment online. If you have any questions about Chip, please email us at adoptions@pawscrossedny.org for more information. Please understand we cannot hold any pet. All adoptions are done on a first come, first adopt basis for approved applicants.\n\nThe Shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We encourage you to select your new companion by considering each dog's individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on a breed label that is only a guess.",

We took Sparky to the vet and he has had all his vaccinations and has been neutered.\nSparky is a wonderful young dog that really deserves a chance to live! He is in a foster home now under the Dexter Foundation. We are looking for the right person for a forever home! He needs an adult home where he can feel safe and be loved. Being handicap, he does take some extra attention.\nI have been fostering Sparky for several months now and I can say I\u2019ve seen him turn into a wonderful dog again. He loves his bones and enjoys his walks. I think he would be a great fit to someone that wants to love and take care of this little guy.\nWe have raised enough for Sparky\u2019s wheelie, booties, toys and diapers. Sparky took to the wheelie right away! He's able to go for a walk again! Sparky's forever home should be someone that is willing to work with him or keep him safe at home.\nSparky weighs about 23lbs and is about 1 to 3 years old we think. We think he is a Shaba Inu, Basenji, Puggle and shepherd mix. Maybe even a Corgi mix. He is a bit stand offish at first but will warm up to you as he has with me. He is currently getting along with some dogs but some smaller aggressive dogs he does not. I think it was because of his handicap and the small dogs he\u2019s being fostered around were aggressive. Sparky is located Torrance Ca.\n \nThank you so much!\nContact Donnie 310-292-1526 Text ok\nEmail: r6donnie@sbcglobal.net\n",

His enthusiasm for treats helps him learn more commands, plus it helps that he is pretty smart as well. Finch will love to be by his human as much as possible, so he would do well with not being left alone for long periods of time. Finch loves to play, but by far his favorite game is fetch. He will play until he is as tired as can be.\n\n",

Cookie lived most of her life in a happy home.\u00a0Tragedy struck and\u00a0her loving owner passed away. Her new family couldn't provide her the\u00a0safety she required and\u00a0surrendered Cookie to the shelter where she now lives.\u00a0\n\nCookie grew up playing with another dog and does get along with some dogs (if they are very submissive.) A meet and greet with any dog prior to adoption is a must. She\u00a0displays a high prey drive so no cats.. Due to her\u00a0strength and size\u00a0we think kids over the age of 12 would be best.\u00a0\n\nThis princess has lots of\u00a0energy! She loves to romp\u00a0around our dog park and play with staff and volunteers.\u00a0We hope to find this funny, amazing girl the furever home she deserves.",

            "description": "Reilly came into foster in December ??of 2018. He is a Great Dane/German Shepherd/Pitbull mix. ????\n\nIn August 2020 he will be 2 years old.When he arrived we knew there was something wrong with his back and that was about it. At 4 months old he could hardly walk and generally was in a sitting position dragging himself wherever he went. When he was able to see a specialist we found out that what we thought was a broken back was actually a birth defect and once he quit growing the birth defect stopped getting progressively worse.\n\nReilly has learned how to be a dog ?in foster. He walks, he runs, he plays just like any other dog. He moves differently but he is a happy and confident young dog. ?Reilly has some incontinence issues that we continue to work on. In the last few months Reilly has gotten progressively better with grooming himself. At one point he could not groom himself at all.\n\nReilly is funny and seems to have a real sense of humor. He may not be perfect but has worked very hard to just be a dog and if he could tell you himself. I have no doubt that he would say that he is just like everyone else. ?Reilly does require a bit more work then your average dog but he is well worth it. He is as sweet ?as the day is long. And would love to have his own family.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Reilly you can email us at dogrescue0146@gmail.com or go to www.fewstepsfromhome.com and fill out the meet and greet application",

His future \"furever\" family will need to be prepared for the long haul.\n\nBruhno is terrified of new situations. His main and immediate response is to immediately empty his bladder Any adopters will have to be prepared for this. He is house trained; this is a fear response.\n\nIf you are interested in Bruhno or any of our fosters, please go to our website at www.mastiffrescueoregon.org, click on adoption info, and submit an application online.\n\nAn application is required for any meet and greet.\n\nAll of our fosters are in private homes. Please be courteous, and do not call prior to 8:00am or after 8:00pm",

He has obviously been let down by humans his entire life.\n\nHe is currently living with our trainer, who is helping him understand that humans can be good and trusted.\n\nPierce is just about 2 years old, 60 pounds and maybe a schnauzer/husky mix. He needs an experienced handler who can continue to help him build h\nis confidence and trust in humans.\n\nPierce is up to date on vaccines, neutered and microchipped. Pierce is currently heartworm positive but we will continue to cover treating him through the slow kill method.\n\nIf you are interested in fostering or adopting this handsome guy, just fill out the appropriate application found at scoutshonor.org.",

He was surrendered at just a mere 8 months old to One Dog at a Time ODAAT because of his severe separation anxiety. He was born in February 2018 and is a Husky, Terrier mix. A lot of people might have given up on Rex. He is deaf, suffered from severe separation anxiety, and had no training whatsoever. But the people at ODAAT believed he'd be a perfect candidate for their training partnership with a local prison, Rockview. Rex learned great basic commands while staying at the prison and a couple of really special ones. He is no longer in the program and is ready for his forever home. Because Rex is deaf, we truly feel he would require another pup to be able to live life to the fullest. Older children only. Rex is protective of his people. He is committed through and through with the person he bonds with. He will require a special family to be able to bring him to his full potential. Rex will not be able to be a social butterfly. If you're looking for a dog that will be a great companion, this is your boy! His best friends are Deitz, Vader and Dugan, three of our ODAAT rescue pups. So if you are in the market for an awesome pair, trio, or quad group... just let us know! Applications can be found at\nwww.onedogatatime.us.",

Here is what her foster mom says about her, \"Cupcake is a super happy girl who loves to go for short walks around the neighborhood and let's you know when she needs a potty break. She bonds deeply with her humans and really loves the man of the house. Cupcake loves her plushies and should be supervised with them to make sure in her excitement she doesn't inhale anything on accident! Cupcake might not have received the food she needed in her previous life, so she is sensitive about her food and should be fed alone without other dogs or children around her. She gets along with all dogs big and small in all other situations and interactions. She is even cat savvy as she lived with multiple cats in her last home.\" Do you think you can provide Cupcake with the truly forever home she deserves? \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter. Applications can take up to 3 weeks to process. Application submission DO NOT guarantee approval for adoption..",

He came into rescue neglected and has recovered beautifully!! He is very playful and loves to run but is also quite attached to his humans! He is looking for a home with either a fenced yard with room to run or one that will take him out on hikes, walks or runs. (On leash of course!) He seems to prefer being an only dog/child. Pistol is a spunky young boy that loves affection. He will run and jump like a kangaroo in excitement to see you!! He is very afraid of fireworks so needs a home that will understand and keep him in a safe place during those booming nights. He is a very sweet boy that will steal your heart!

He is still waiting on that forever home that realizes that with age comes issues and that is OK.\n\n1/27/20 - Sweet little Louie went to the doctor recently for bloodwork and his thyroid was low.  The vet started him on Thyroxine (1/2 pill twice daily) and we will recheck in 1 month to make sure this dosage is accurate.\n\n6/18/19 - So here's the deal.  Dad started to have to travel a lot for work which meant I was left alone of had to be boarded.  Dad knew this wasn't what he or I wanted, so we sat down and discussed it and I agreed it would be best if I joined another family that was around more.  Now, here I am in a foster home with Yorkie Haven Rescue.  I used to be an only dog and know I'm in a home with more furry friends.  Even though we don't actually play together, I sleep in the bed with them and get along with them all fine.  Even though my eyesight is getting a tad cloudy, my hearing might be a decibel off and my joints are definitely not what they used to be, I can see, hear and get around fine.  I have arthritis in my left front leg and will hold it up at times, but I'm taking some Glucosamine for it and I can run like the wind in the back yard.\n\nI am a hearty eater, good for a bath, have very soft hair and a teddy bear face.  I would love nothing more than a home where mom, dad and I can sit around watching some shows, go out in the backyard and play a little while, back in for a snack, take an afternoon ride in the car, come home for some loving and cuddle time, eat some supper, watch a movie and then lights out.\n\nI will make the perfect addition to your family and all I ask in return is your unconditional love.... well, food, your bed, baths, toys and treats would sweeten the deal.",

            "description": "Hi, I\u2019m Denali, and I am SO EXCITED to be here! I mean, it sure beats the streets of Bakersfield where lovely people found me wandering. I was pretty sick and overweight with open wounds and a terrible sunburn (I\u2019m pale, folks - the shade is my friend) but even though I wasn\u2019t feeling my best, I was sooo grateful to be taken care of by kind humans. I\u2019m a 5 year old cancer survivor who\u2019s doing great after having several tumors removed. Oh, and I\u2019m deaf but it\u2019s no big. I see everything! I\u2019ve been recovering in a foster home, losing weight thanks to a twice daily thyroid supplement, growing lovely snow white fur, and having regular spa days - such luxury! I\u2019m the perfect petite size at 42 lbs., and honestly I\u2019m a completely different dog now! I\u2019m hoping to find a compassionate adopter who will protect me from the sun\u2019s harmful rays and help me to live my healthiest, happiest life. In return, I\u2019ll be the most loving, affectionate doggy ever because once you\u2019ve won my trust, I\u2019m yours.\n\nOkay, yes, I\u2019m a little nervous around new people, a little insecure in new situations, and I might turn into a pancake until I know it\u2019s safe to show my lovebug personality - but I\u2019m always willing to try and to trust. If you\u2019ve got a nice gentleman dog-friend for me, I might love to play with him, but I\u2019m also happy just being with my people. My perfect home is a quieter house with low foot traffic, older respectful children if any, and a private yard with lots of shade. I\u2019ve been learning boundaries, structure and communication, and I\u2019m crate trained and have good house manners! I\u2019m so ready to find my family.

            "description": "Big Caesar spent four years in a home full of people and proved to be a wonderful family dog. Affectionate, low energy and low maintenance, this sweet guy loves nothing more than hanging out with his people and spending the day relaxing. Described as a very caring and affectionate teddy bear, Big Caesar has a human-like look in his eyes, he's really good at knowing when you're down and is always there to give kisses to make you feel better. Big Caesar will let you love on him anyway you wish and is up for cuddles whenever you are, laying his head in your lap to ask for pets. He thinks he's a big lap dog, but he's also happy just being by your side. He loves meeting people, but doesn't get jumpy about it, though he is usually playful right away and will bring them his rope toy to play with. While he's typically relaxed and lazy, he does like to play tug of war and a bit of fetch. When he wants to play, he'll bring you his rope, then lay it down next to you and wait for you to pick it up. On top of being a total sweetheart, Big Caesar is also a very well-behaved pup to have around and has impeccable manners - he doesn't take food that isn't given to him, he doesn't whine, he's fully housebroken and is great being left home for extended periods of time. He also doesn't need a crate, will only chew on his toys, and he'll spend most of the day just napping on his bed until you return. And this smart guy does just about anything on command: sit, lay down, stay, roll over, shake. He even plays dead. If treats are involved, you could probably get him to drive you to the store. Big Caesar is showing off his skills and learning more in APA!'s Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC's Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Big Caesar has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him expand his skill set to become the best dog he be! Skills such as walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, and 'place', which means he will go to a specific place in your home on command. Once he successfully completes all the skills on his training plan, Big Caesar will be considered TOP Dog Ready! He is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA's Total Obedience Program, you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with him after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA's CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 As long as he has people to love on and a cozy bed to call is own, Big Caesar would be comfortable in any sized home. He's just a good, calm boy who would make a great addition for someone looking for an easy-going companion who will still shower them with affection. If you think you can handle all that, come meet this amazing pup!",

            "description": "Looking for a young, fun loving k9 companion? Caine may just be the perfect furry friend for you! This 2-year-old athletic fella is hoping to find an adult-only household where he can really shine as a wonderful companion. Caine has a lot of energy but knows how to contain it when necessary. Caine enjoys extra cuddles and attention, car rides and long walks. He avoids pulling on his leash while walking although he will attempt to chase the occasional lizard or rabbit. Fortunately, because he's quite person-focused, his attention is easily redirected to his handler when on leash. If the weather isn't suitable for walking, Caine loves a good car ride and knows the etiquette of staying in the backseat. Watch your cheeks though, because he will sneak in kisses from the back seat from time to time! Caine is bound to make a great companion especially for someone with an active lifestyle looking to include a four-legged friend in their activities.",

Needs an experienced terrier owner due to behavioral issues. \n\nAdoption fee of $250 covers all vetting including spay/neuter surgery, vaccines, microchip heartworm test and treatment if needed and any other medical that may be required while in rescue. \n\nWe only do adoptions on Saturday and not all animals are able to attend so if you would like to see a specific animal please let us know so that we can make arrangements for it to be present at the event. Event locations do vary so please check the homepage to find out where we will be this week. Please do not ask us to reduce adoption fees since all fees help us to cover medical expenses for all of our animals, some of which can be very expensive.  Saving lives is not cheap so thank you for your understanding and helping us save as many as possible.\n\nPlease email lowcountryanimalrescue@ymail.com for an application.",

Riley arrived pregnant, confused and full of parasites. She is now a healthy girl and full of love.\n\nShe\u2019s a sweet loving lap dog who is great with dogs and cats and extremely loyal to her foster Mom. We don\u2019t recommend Riley in a home with children as she has some fear issues with certain situations. \n\nRiley walks beautifully on leash and is quiet and well behaved making her a great addition to most homes. \n\nFor more info on Riley girl, please inquire at harescue1@aol.com or haar13@aol.com",

Hound breeds are very prominent in the rural south and usually the first to be euthanized at the shelter due to the overpopulation of this breed.\n\nGood with:\n\nDogs\n\nEXPERIENCED OWNER ONLY WHO UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF BALANCED TRAINING!\n\nNot tested with:\n\nCats\n\nHi, I'm Hopper! I'm a sweet and loving Hound mix who has had a rough start to life. I have a great personality and despite a less than stellar start to life, I just want to get love and give love. I do like to have a lot of time to chill by myself but then am always up for a long walk, hike on trails, etc. I am very headstrong and can push boundaries and then I wait for feedback on those boundaries. I just love learning and practicing new skills though! I am good on the leash and know how to heel. I am looking for a home with a family preferably with no children. I am easy-going but cautious. Younger kids frighten me and I have \"air snapped\" as a warning that they were in my personal space. I spent time with a trainer and after a few weeks of structured and balanced training, I am able to go on stress-free, fun walks and ignore children that run past us.\n\nI love my crate and I am comfortable there, sometimes I consider this \"my space\" though and I will need boundaries and structure and proper, balanced training or I'll start claiming some of your stuff as mine!! I also like to hang out on my dog bed. I would do best in a home with another larger female or male dog. A senior or puppy would not work well for me as I love to run and play chase. I do very well in daycare with all size dogs when my foster is at work.\n\nI am a fast learner and I can't wait to find a forever family where I can build trust and share all the love I've got to give!\n\nAdoption Application:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/adoptrdr\n\nAdoption Application:\nhttp://bit.ly/adoptrdr\n\nFoster Application: http://bit.ly/fosterapprdr\n\nAdoption Process: In order to adopt, we require an adoption application. After you submit an application, if you pass the screening, we will contact you to schedule a phone interview. We will call your references, including your veterinarian and landlord (when appropriate). We will also conduct a home visit. After these steps are complete, you will be approved to adopt a dog. Please note this process takes 1-2 weeks so applications submitted when you are ready to bring a dog home within that time frame. You can meet our adoptable dogs at events, however, we cannot guarantee that dogs at events do not have pre-approved applicants meeting them there as well, so the application is the best way to start the process.\n\nMission Statement: Forever true to \"The Underdog\", Rural Dog Rescue is dedicated to saving the lives of dogs in shelters who are often overlooked for adoption or rescue. We save the dogs who are at most risk of being euthanized: the hounds, the black dogs, the seniors, the sick and the broken. We make a commitment to reserve a minimum of 50% of the dogs we save to The Underdog. Root For The Underdog!\n\nRural Dog Rescue's home base is in Washington, DC. We adopt to the Washington, DC metropolitan area to include Maryland and Northern Virginia.\n\nWe support several high kill shelters that euthanize in 72 hours and whose kill rate is 70% or higher in rural areas of Virginia, West Virginia, North and South Carolina. Rural Dog Rescue also helps dogs in need in Washington, DC and Maryland.\n\nWe are 100% volunteer and foster based and no salaries are paid. 100% of your donation and adoption fee goes to helping the dogs and cats of Rural Dog Rescue.\n\nAlthough we try to be as accurate as possible, Rural Dog Rescue cannot guarantee the breed or full-grown adult size of any of the dogs or puppies in its care. Because many of these dogs were found as strays or are the result of irresponsible, unplanned breeding, we do not know the dog's exact background and can only list breed and size by our best educated guess. If exact breed and size are important to you, please consider adopting a dog from a specific breed rescue. Our goal is for our dogs to be adopted by people who will love and care for them forever for who they are - no matter what breed and size they turn out to be!\n\nAll dogs go to their new homes spayed or neutered, up to date on all shots, dewormed (although a second deworming may be required), started on heartworm and flea and tick preventative and sometimes microchipped.",

I was rescued from the shelter after I was hit by a car and my original owner dumped me there: I had a broken pelvis and pyometra :( \n\nThankfully Delaney's Dog saves many medical dogs like me when other rescues will not because of the expense to do so. \n\nMy foster mom says I am so sweet, obedient and a great dog. She says I will make an amazing family dog especially since I am so good with children. \n\nI am a special-needs dog however. It is believed that as a result of my fractured pelvis from being hit by a car I became incontinent and do need to wear diapers.\n\nI can't wait for my happy ever after! Hope that is with you! \n\nPlease apply online at: https://www.delaneysdog.com/adoption-application.html if you are interested in adopting me! \n\nxo, \nCoco\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nInterested in adopting? If so, please complete an adoption application first at www.delaneysdog.com/adoption-application.html\n\nAll Delaney's Dog adoption fees include :\n-Up-to-date vaccinations\n-Spay/neuter\n-Microchip & microchip registration\n\nThe adoption process requires an initial approved Adoption Application, a home visit to ensure safety and well-being of adoptee & a separate Adoption Agreement.\n\n**Adoption fees vary and are NOT NEGOTIABLE. \n\nNOTE: An Adoption Application does not guarantee an adoption. Adoptions are based on the best possible situation for each dog and their prospective owners. Not all breeds are right for all people and not all people are right for all breeds. Our commitment is to place these animals in the right homes so that they never again have to face re-homing. They deserve a forever family too.\n\nAdditionally, each adoption includes a one week, partial fee refundable, trial period to ensure pet is a right fit.\n\nNO OUT OF STATE ADOPTIONS",

Her thick coat is chocolate brown, with the most stunning red highlights.\n\nBold and playful, Dakota can often be seen enthusiastically playing and horsing around with her canine foster mates, happily running around the yard chasing and being chased.  Intelligent and fun, this gal enjoys playing fetch (including in the pool) and is quite the swimmer; she also loves catching the water in her mouth when the hose is turned on. Dakota is connected to her people and attentive to where her humans are and what they are doing. She often follows her foster mom, settling by her feet as she works.  This silly girl loves taking all of her toys out of her toy box (especially after her foster mom puts them away!).  After a long day of activity, Dakota likes to settle on the couch near her humans and spends the night sleeping in her foster parents' bed.\n\nDakota is house trained and knows basic commands. This is a girl who is loyal like a Retriever, enjoys activity and play, and with proper exercise and stimulation is just a delight to have around. She needs a home with a large fenced yard and an active canine playmate her size or larger.  Since Dakota can be mouthy and overeager, we will not consider applications with young children for her. \n\nPlease note that Dakota has hip and elbow dysplasia and is currently on a medical management plan. She will only be adopted to a home that is committed to continuing this care.\n\n\nThank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (https://anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible organization. ANCAR is a foster-based rescue, and we adopt within a 90 mile radius of Bedford Hills, NY.  You will find the adoption application here:(https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/).\nPlease read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) so you'll know what to expect when you submit.  All fields on the application must be completed in order for our volunteers to process it (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/) \n\nOur dogs are in foster care and we do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. This is a firm policy. Our busy volunteers are not able to respond to questions about the dog or dog meeting requests in the absence of an application.  We know these dogs very well because they are in foster care, so please read the profiles of the dog(s) you are interested prior to submitting.  If there are specific requirements stated (ie: Fenced Yard or Canine Friend Required) these are included because they are vital to the happiness, health and safety of that dog. \n\nWe are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering,  and microchipping before transporting our dogs. Then, we provide all supplies, preventatives and any follow up vet care necessary while they are in foster care. These costs are high and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you. We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources, so if you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through the kindness of supporters like you that we are 'changing lives...one tail at a time' by providing our dogs with 'A New Chance.' (https://anewchancear.org) \n\nThanks so much.",

Does not ruin toys or bed in his crate but does cry and bark.\n\nLeash trained - walks pretty well on a slip leash or martingale with minor corrections. Prefers to walk on the grass vs sidewalk so some slight pulling towards the softer ground. Will sometimes freeze/crouch when he sees another dog while walking.\n\nHousebroken - Fully house trained\n\nEating habits - Loves to eat! Has not shown any food sensitivities. Loves vegetables for snacks!\n\nCommands known - sit, shake, and come\n\nCar rides - perfect passenger!\n\nBath time - does not enjoy bath time but is very tolerant. Needs assistance getting in and out of the tub.\n\nAffectionate - doesn't give a lot of kisses. More the type to lay next to you vs on you. Loves a good belly rub\n\nActivity level - low energy with arthritis in his shoulders so he would do better with a yard to sunbathe and go potty without needing to go for a walk each time. Will need a home without stairs.\n\nPlay style - not much of a player. Will sometimes chew on a bone though it is short lived. Needs to be watched with a very careful eye as he will chew & break through almost all toys very quickly!\n\nBad habits - is dog reactive, especially on leash. He has made progress in this department but will require a strong dedicated handler if owner wants to take him out on walks. Has separation anxiety and has been known to attempt to chew items within reach while his mom takes the other dog out for a walk.\n\nRedeeming qualities - the sweetest boy! Loves to cuddle and just wants to be with his people. He is extremely patient with puppies once he is familiar and is excellent with other dogs that he is familiar with (this takes time!!)\n\nBest feature - his charming and silly personality\n\nWhat Foster Mom wants you to know -\n\nCimmy is such a goofy, sweet and easy going boy. He absolutely loves his people and he's amazing with my 10 month old puppy. I know the dog reactivity can be a huge turn off to potential adopters but I wish people would just give him a chance! He's the perfect house/yard dog and would love to keep someone company while they work from home. He doesn't ask for much, just some snuggles and snacks! We live in a condo so all our potty breaks require a walk, so walking him is definitely not impossible! He just needs someone who is proactive and crosses the street away from other dogs and redirects his attention before he has a chance to become anxious and go into fight or flight mode. He is such an amazing boy and just needs someone willing to see how great he is and to give him a chance.\n\nPlease consider sponsoring Cimarron with either a one-time or monthly tax-deductible donation.

Good\nGood with kids? \nNeeds a fenced in yard?\nAdoption Fee: $\n\nAny other info:\n\nPolly is so very special to our hearts and is one of our longest term residents.\nUnfortunately Polly she is STILL searching for her forever home.\n\nPolly is a special needs pocket pitty who has basically lived in the shelter system for her entire life.\n\nShe came to us from St.Clair Animal Control in March of 2019 as a special needs/medical case. She has spinal damage that has caused her to walk on the wrong part of her feet leaving her with blisters and incontinence meaning she cannot hold her potty like \"normal\" dogs.\n\nSince coming to us Polly has seen numerous specialists, attended physical therapy, gotten chiropractic care, received acupuncture, gotten an MRI... \nShe has improved but Polly will likely never walk like a normal dog. But that's the point...Polly isn't normal.\n\nShe is special in every single way. \n\nSpecial in the way that she loves you unconditionally. \n\nSpecial in the way that she smiles with her teeth and her whole face lights up when she sees you.\n\nSpecial in the way that she appreciates every little thing in life because she has been denied so many of them through no fault of her own. Like a car ride, a walk outside of the kennels, or chewing on her favorite toy.\n\nSpecial in the way that she loves to watch movies (yes we have a TV outside of her kennel) and look at herself in the mirror so proudly.\n\nSpecial in the way that she wants so badly to please everyone she meets even though she is the one who was dealt a crappy hand of cards for life.\n\nSpecial in the way that she sits day after day here with us, and although some days are harder than others, she still tries so hard to be the very best girl she can be.\n\nWe are looking for a special adopter who will love Polly through her many imperfections. Polly loves children and cats but can be selective with dogs. \n\n\n\nOur adoption fees include the pets spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccines, heartworm/tick disease testing and fecal check.  All adoption fees can be found on our groups' Petfinder page. \nThe first step to our adoption process is to fill out an adoption application on our website,  www.serenityanimalhospital.net, under the \"Adopt From Us\" Tab. Please email the application to adoptions@serenityanimalhospital.net or drop it off in person during our business hours. Any questions regarding our adoptable dogs can be emailed along with your application.\nPlease do not call the front desk with questions about our adoption program, as our receptionists are not involved with the adoption program. Allow us a few days to contact you about your application as we do get many in on a daily basis.  We will contact you as soon as possible. \n",

Bolt has now been at our shelter 2 years. She is very playful and should make a great family pet. She is the smartest dog at the shelter. She learns very fast and loves people. As of Dec. 2020 she has been at the shelter 1 1/2 years.\n\nBolt will need a home with a secure, tall fence, privacy fence will be the best. She can go over low fences and she can lift handles on a gate. Plays well with male and female dogs and loves toys. She should do well as a running companion.\nMicrochipped Adoption Fee: $150",

Since I am a modern man, I went ahead and got a mani and a pedi, but appawrently the cataracts are a little harder to deal with. Despite the vision issues, I still see fine enough to get around indoors and out.\n\nI am a handsome dapper non-whippersnapper lapper 15 year old Chihuahua. I had an owner for a very long time, but their living sidge changed and they had to give me up to a Foster Mom. Who moved my cheese? Ever read that book? Whelp it is a muttivational fable about dealing with life changes. Change is like a hard cheese, smelly and hard to digest. It is especially hard on an ole man set in his ways, so I struggled initially to transition.\n\nOnce I completed the obligatory settle in time, I learned to relax and chill with all the other small dogs that reside here. I love to go outside and walk about the patio and listen to the breeze. Inside, I do need a belly band to catch my tinkles until I adjust to where your door to outside is.\n\nI enjoy scritches and cuddles while sitting in your lap. I will duck my head under your chin and whisper sweet somethings to you. I am not a yippy yapper like the stereo type would indicate. I have howled a few times, but I never bork. I am a quiet guy content to sit in a lap for hours on end. Do you have a retirement lap available? \n\nGOD'S DOGS Rescue, in San Antonio TX, does not have a shelter - Our dogs are raised in foster homes in the San Antonio area. Each dog comes spayed or neutered, up-to-date with age appropriate vaccinations, microchipped, heartworm tested and are current with monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventatives. \n\nALL OF THIS IS INCLUDED IN THE Local ADOPTION FEE OF $200.00 for ADULTS. (Local is in the state of Texas). Medical records will come with each dog at the time of adoption.\n\nIF THIS IS AN OUT OF STATE ADOPTION, TRANSPORT TO YOU is included in the adoption fee of $400.00 for ADULTS. We transport all over the country!!\n\nOur dogs are socialized, and we try to provide you a good understanding of the dog\u2019s personality. Please contact us at info@godsdogsrescue.org for more information about adopting one of our dogs and puppies or fill out an adoption application at http://www.godsdogsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-application/ \n\nPlease visit our website http://godsdogsrescue.org/ for helpful information re: transport, our adoption process and application, volunteering and fostering, and photos of our dogs/pups looking for homes!!\n\nThank you for wanting to adopt a rescued dog, their LIVES depend on it!",

We saw a passionate plea for help because this girl was living outside on a ranch with newborn puppies and a large mass that hung down to the ground.  It was vital that she get medical attention quickly so we took her in.  Foxtails and a horrific amount of ticks covered the little family but we quickly got all of those under control.  We originally though her mass may have been a hernia but it turned out to be an uncommon but thankfully, a benign mammary tumor.  She has since recovered from that major surgery, got spayed so she never has to be a momma again and she is ready for a new life.  Dina wants to be a part of the family, in the home, hanging out in the yard or going on adventures.  She's probably a Dobie/Rottweiler mix and somewhere between 3 and 5 years old.  She's athletic enough for action but calm enough to be a well behaved house dog.  She loves belly rubs and has lived with lots of other dogs but ideally, she should share a home with a larger male and no cats.  This sweetie pie is charming and she deserves a chance to find a home where she is truly cherished.",

Her body shows signs of having litter after litter, but we fixed that. No more babies for Dixie! Because she was used for breeding and not a companion, she is very independent and likes to do her own thing. She does love to hang out with the volunteers when we are at the shelter on Saturdays. Dixie is reactive to other animals, so she will need to be the only animal in the home. We are also recommending a home with no little kids. Dixie is fully vetted, but will require heartworm treatment once she finds a forever home (treatment is covered by the rescue). Dixie is ready for a home who will love her and teach her how to be a cherished member of the family. \n\nDixie has been at the Vermilion Parish Rabies Animal Control since 5/27/19.",

He would do best with someone who will do  daily walks since Ollie has perfected the art of climbing fences.  He is such a wonderful and loving dog but gets bored easily.  He  would also do best in a home with no other pets.\n\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING, PLEASE FILL OUT AN APPLICATION FROM OUR WEBSITE: www.hoperescues.com.

Please email the completed application to newleashrescue2018@gmail.com\n\nMeet Tater!  What a handsome guy he is!  He likes swimming and being with his people!   He loves to be a couch potato too!   He's a good boy who loves to go for walks!  \n\nHe originally came to us from a shelter that was closing.  He is not good with cats.  He has prey drive for birds and squirrels when he is out for walks and will do best in a home with a fenced in yard.  \n\nHe needs a home where kids are ages 15 and up because he does not do well with kids.  He will snap at them.    An adult only home where he would not be taken to family get-together's with younger kids is preferred.  \n\nTater also displays some leash reactivity toward other dogs, but does much better when off leash in his yard.  He is dog selective and doesn't get along with some male dogs.  \n\nHe needs a family/more experienced owner that is willing to continue working on training with him and will provide a more structured environment.   \nTater's best fit is someone who is more of a home body that won't be looking to take him to places where there would be other younger kids or other dogs. \n\nHe's about 3-4 years old and about 50 lbs.  Up to date on all his shots, dewormed, neutered and microchipped. Who wouldn't just love this cuddle bug?!\nHe is an absolutely cool dog!\n\nAdoption fee is $275 + tax (no checks)\n\nFoster to contact: Kim at 507-351-6647 or k.balder@hotmail.com\n\nTater will be at an event.  Please contact foster for more info.\n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home. An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home. Sometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home and truly become comfortable. \n\nThere are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption, discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months. We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.",

This big boy is solid built and has a very friendly disposition!  Tank loves attention from people and enjoys playing toys---especially the squeaky ones!  He might enjoy a larger dog companion, but he is not good with cats or smaller dogs.  Tank seems housebroke and his manners are fairly good although he does pull on the leash.

            "description": "Special Needs Doggie! (The Divine) Miss Boss She's large and in-charge and knows what she wants. And what she really, really wants is her own family. Boss is looking for a very special friend; someone who will overlook her shortcomings, work with her on challenges, and most of all, appreciate her for her talents. If that sounds like a lot, it might be, but Miss Boss is totally worth it! First thing first: for Boss, compromise is key. She wants to be your partner! Some may consider it a shortcoming, but we think it demonstrates her intelligence. Boss can be a little bit stubborn. Say, you want to walk across the street, but there is a great scent (or a big puddle) she needs to examine on the grass. Well, Boss will let you know that she's not ready to cross the street. She won't bolt, but she will stop and will stay where she stops until you compromise. A little treat and a kind word and she knows you're working WITH her. She's ready to please. So why does a little thing like compromise require a special friend for Boss? Boss has one big challenge. She has never met a fence she can't get over. Never. No one knows what she's running from, or running to. We don't think she really knows. When asked why he climbed Mt Everest, George Mallory responded: \"Because it's there. That's Boss. Sadly, the world is not a friendly place for a big girl like Boss to run loose. That's why she needs a very special friend. Someone who will protect her from her own inner challenge. If you are that person, someone willing to put in the time and the resources to keep her safe and loved, you will earn a friendship (and plenty of fun stories) that will make your heart shine! Boss is not only beautiful inside and out, she is very talented and she knows it all. Sit, Down, Up, Off, Stay, Come; (relative to these last two, Boss is admittedly a bit selective in her response ). Boss is loyal, loving, funny, playful, treat driven, good on a leash, an excellent running partner, very smart and an all-around wonderful companion. As you can see by her photos, Miss Boss is a favorite to many volunteers at ACT. She is has our dog walking group named after her, \"The Boss Walk.\" The group walks every day. Call if you'd like to walk and meet Miss Boss. She's willing and eager to be a partner, are you?",

He was adopted out briefly once, but when he was left unattended for a long time in the yard, he had an altercation with a cat, so back he came.  Gilmore is about 11 years old now and this marvelous mutt is just a good ole' boy.  You'd never know he's 11, since he has plenty of spunky energy and loves to run and chase after a toy or two.  He has great manners and is housebroken of course, sits and offers a pawshake when asked, and he positively loves people.  Obviously, he needs a home with no cats, and his ideal home is one with no dogs either, but he sure loves people of all ages, and he'll give you the love and devotion of a dozen pets if you give Gilmore a chance!  Call 609-693-1900 or email:  office@ahsppz.org for an appointment to meet Gilmore.\n*If you can't adopt Gilmore, you can sponsor him on our Share-A-Pet program under Sponsor at ahscares.org*\n\n<p>\nIf interested please visit our Forked River Shelter. We are open Mon. - Fri. from \n12:00 P. M. - 6:00 P. M.; and Sat. & Sun. 12:00 P. M. - 5:00 P. M. for directions call 609-693-1900. There is an adoption donation required. The society cannot accept personal checks but we do accept Visa, MC, AE, Discover and cash. As part of our adoption process, we must have proof of residency. Homeowners must show proof of ownership; landlord approval is required for renters before an adoption can be approved.And as always we thank you for your kindness in opening your heart & home to a Society orphan.",

She is very friendly, adventurous and LOVES any sort of affection. Would make a great family dog. She is a princess and wants to find just the right family that appreciates her and sees her as the center of their universe. \n\nShe's a big fan of chasing tennis balls and toys, and she's all about sitting on your foot when things are slow. Branna is very eager to please. She loves people very much.\n\nShe is obedient and is downright cuddly when a lap presents itself. She is a good companion dog to the right person and situation and such a goofball. She's playful and goofy and gentle and fun loving with folks. \n\n----\nPeach County Animal Rescue is a rescue located in Fort Valley, GA. Our adoption fees range from $250-350+. Although our rescue dogs share a common bond with one another, no rescue story is the same (even when similar). Vetting costs vary depending on their health conditions. For us, it is never about the money. We are a non-profit. Thank you for your love and support! All of our dogs are fully vetted: up-to-date on annual shots, spayed/neutered and microchipped with a lifetime registration. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nIf you would like to send in an application for this dog, please use the link below! https://peachcountyanimalrescueandrehabilitation.org/apply-now-2/",

He's not, but we're grateful for their error because we really like Cyrus - whom they called Blue Cyrus - because he's charming in all of the right ways, and we were his only ticket out of the animal shelter. Cyrus is about 7-8 years old and is probably blue Dobie and American Bulldog. He's a tall fellow with an adorable big jowly face, and once he gains much-needed weight, he'll be quite a large dog, certainly over 80 pounds. We did kennel Cyrus with a female but their relationship became strained and he has been kept alone ever since. He also has an amazing BIG bark to go with his large body size, so he'll deter unwanted intruders easily. His behavior toward kids isn't yet known.",

            "description": "My name is Lemon, I am available for adoption through Colorado Canine Rescue (CCR) - a nonprofit dog rescue located in the Denver area. My vet and foster mom have guessed that I am around 2 years old and an American Pit Bull Terrier or \"pit bull-type dog.\" I was rescued from an overcrowded shelter in New Mexico. I have completed a board and train program through High Drive Dog Company in Longmont, Colorado. Part of my adoption requirements include follow up training with High Drive (sponsored by CCR for 3 months), no other animals in the home, no children under 12, and no cities with BSL (breed specific legislation). It is preferred I am adopted to a home with a 6 foot wooden fence. These requirements are non-negotiable. Lemon would do best living with someone who has bully breed experience. Lemon weighs around 60 pounds, is crate trained, and doing well with housetraining. She can be vocal when she needs something, and is not appropriate for apartment/condo living.\n\nLemon had a rough start to life; being kenneled 24/7 for 2 months straight prior to arriving in Colorado was a lot of stress. Lemon has worked through a lot of reactivity issues. She actually plays well with a lot of dogs. She is NOT a candidate for dog parks. However, she is always welcome to attend supervised playgroups at High Drive (please see http://www.highdrivedogco.com/ for more details about the company). Lemon is not a coach potato. She is bold, eager to learn, and ready to take on the world. Lemon needs to be challenged physically and mentally. She is funny and affectionate. This pup may have started out as a lemon, but she is quite a peach.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Lemon, please submit an application located on our website, www.coloradocaninerescue.org. We are asking for a $200.00 adoption donation. Lemon is spayed, up to date on vaccinations, and micro-chipped. Please note, CCR cannot guarantee the breed composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have no history prior to them entering the shelter. In addition, most dogs listed as potty trained will experience an adjustment period as they learn the routines in their new home.\n\n1/28/21 4:55 PM",

She was brought to her former owner when she was spayed and vaccinated. Although not chipped back then she is now. She has been updated on allnher medical as well.\n\nHer owner had her for 9 years and sadly due to his wifes passing from COPD as a result of cancer treatmenta he has lost his home and was left no option but to put Luna in a predicament that was no fault of her own.\n\nShe is an alpha dog. Crated to eat but can get bossy to other dogs. House broken and still very playful. She is a velcro dog to her human and might best do well as a solo dog again. \n\nPlease consider her for a furever friend and although her time with you may be more limited than a puppy or younger version of herself..she is worth the love and goofiness she brings.",

She is a great travel companion and loves to go to Starbucks as much as I do! She also loves to go for walks and meet new people! One of my favorite things about her is that while she likes to be beside you, she is content doing her own thing like playing with her toys. She doesn't demand your attention but is happy to receive it! In the evenings, she loves to lay right on top of you and smother you with kisses, and then she will slowly wedge her way between you and the sofa to fall asleep.\nThanks to donations by some amazing volunteers, Suzy graduated from the Stay & Train program at Paws & Play Resort & Training Center where she learned important behavior skills making her the perfect little companion.",

            "description": "Like most pitties, Franny is a big cuddle bug! She will take every opportunity to sit on your lap and give you kisses. She has the perfect balance between chill & playful. She tends to snooze most of the day (which is perfect for those who work from home) and will get a burst of energy whenever you are ready to play. She likes to run and play in the backyard with a tennis ball or chase the bunnies out of the yard. She is also a big fan of plush toys that she can destroy! She is not destructive with any furniture but if it's on the floor, it's fair game, so keep your shoes put away.\n\nFranny is a bit timid around loud noises (i.e. fireworks, wind, sirens, etc) and will hide from the FedEx truck during walks. She is very protective of her home and her people, so new people and dogs should be introduced outside so she can get to know them first. She gets along great with the neighbors and their dogs in the backyard though.\n\nSpeaking of outside, Franny LOVES walks! She does great on leash, especially with a harness, but will sometimes go after a bunny or get excited around other dogs, so be sure to hold on tight to the leash. She is very treat motivated and knows how to sit, shake, high five, and lay down. She gets SO excited during hikes though that she tends to forget her manners, so we are working on that. \n\nFranny is experiencing some hair loss from the stress of being moved around but we're hopeful it will grow back now that she's in a loving, stable foster home. Because of her protective nature, she would be best suited in a home with no small children and no other dogs.\n\nFranny has so much love to give and is looking for that second chance!\n\nBSL RESTRICTIONS APPLY\n\nEstimated DOB: 03/30/2017\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

He was covered with fleas and biting everyone who tried to get him. We were asked to help and we were shocked with how tiny he was when we arrived hahaha. Sybil threw a towel over his monkey butt and put him in her car and the rest is history hahah. Over the last year he has lived at A fosters homes with a lot of dogs and while he can be dominant when meeting new dogs, overall he corrects easily and then does fine going forward. He loves to play and he does play a little rough with other dogs so keep that in mind. He is a cuddly and sweet boy to women and would make an exceptional family member for a female only, or mostly, home. Vinnie has an amazing personality, he is such a clown and not only does he have epic bed head all the time, he SMILES, and is just hilarious! It's clear that Vinnie didn't have a good start and he LOVES his foster home, however he deserves a home where he gets way more attention and that is less busy as the coming and going makes him hyper alert. He is a good guard dog, despite his size, his bark is loud and unignorable, and he takes his job as protecting his person and home very seriously! \n\nIf your looking for a charismatic, smiling, scruffy lil guy Vinnie is your man! \n\nIf you would like to help Vinnie please contact us! \n\n $200.00 Adoption Fee \n\n(Which is considered a non refundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible. The fee itself is not negotiable, our vets don't negotiate and thus neither do we.)\n\nTo Contact Us\n\nMessage us through our website http://www.highplainspaw.org\n\nMessage the Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/HighPlainsPAW\n\nFill out our Adoption Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/adoption-application\n\nFill out our Foster Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/foster-application\n\nEmail us at highplainspaw@gmail.com\n\nCall our voicemail at (402)957-1578\n\n \n\nWE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY ALL OUR DOGS ARE LOCATED IN FOSTER HOMES. This means there is no place for you to go in person to view our dogs. We ask that an application be filled out and we will go from there!",

            "description": "Meet Woodrow\nSometimes we just have to shake our heads and get it together for the dog\u2019s sake. You see, this beautiful boy\u2019s previous owner just walked away from him and never looked backed. Woodrow was found in an empty apartment after his owner moved out. He\u2019d been without food, water, fresh air and no way out for who knows how long. Eventually, Woodrow was found by someone who works at the apartment complex. When Woodrow\u2019s finder tried to keep him he was told no way by apartment management. Luckily, Woodrow\u2019s hero asked us for help and we gladly took him in on June 8, 2019.  As of this date, he has spent over a year and a half in our shelter, which breaks our hearts.\nWoodrow is a wonderful dog. He\u2019s nothing but silly and sweet. He is currently 4 years old and weighs 65 lbs. Our best guess is that Woodrow is an American Pitbull terrier mix. He has stunningly beautiful markings and a sleek physique, and the cutest little bark. He loves every person he meets, but he does not like other dogs and cats so would be best as an only pet. Woodrow is showing himself to be a big love bug. He is an active dog and would do great with a family or person that makes him part of their activities. He walks well on a leash and is housetrained. We\u2019re saddened that he could be so cruelly abandoned, but heartened that he is now safe and being loved on by shelter staff and volunteers.  He is definitely a favorite with staff and volunteers, and everyone is cheering for him to find his perfect home.\nWoodrow has been fully vetted, neutered and microchipped. If you\u2019re looking for a gentle- and fun - giant to make part of your family, come meet Woodrow. He\u2019s that special kind of dog that will love to be your forever companion.\nCall 706-865-4135 for information on additional health services provided as part of the adoption fee. If you can offer a safe indoor home to our puppy/dog, submit an application online https://www.charlessmithgallhumanesociety.org/page/dog-adoption-application\nOnce an application is submitted online, you will receive an email saying your application has been successfully submitted.  If you don\u2019t receive this email within 24 hours, please check to make sure all application fields were completed or please call our shelter at 706-865-4135. All adopters must complete an approval process which involves a reference check with current/recent vet and a brief home visit if located in the immediate area. We do permit out of state adoptions. Adopters MUST come to the shelter to transport their new family member home. We do not ship nor do we transport them to their new homes. Adoption policies and application procedures are detailed at the shelter website: http://smithgallhumanesociety.org/ under tab All Adoptable Animals.\nCharles Smithgall Humane Society (CSHS) is a No kill shelter. Animals in our care remain safe with us until adopted. Resident animals are primarily owner relinquished and also accepted from local Animal Control. The facility usually is operating at capacity with a list of animals waiting for space to open.\nOur shelter is currently closed to the general public as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. However, for approved adopters we are making appointments to meet and adopt your fur baby. \nLocation: 4823 Helen Hwy. 75N, Sautee, GA 30571, Phone: 706-865-4135\nEmail: smithgallhumanesociety@windstream.net\nOur shelter in Sautee GA is located about 3 miles south of the alpine town of Helen in northeast GA.",

He is fully vetted. He is good with older kids, other dogs, and cats. He was rescued from an abandoned house along with his siblings. He is feral and is about 70% rehabbed. He would do best in a home with other dogs. His perfect adopter would be one that not only understands his situation but is willing to put the time in to teach him his job, which is to be a good family dog. He is very responsive to teaching but needs personal attention on his journey to being at peace with being a family dog. He has been with a professional trainer and knows commands and does very well on the leash. He needs to be with a family who understands and embraces his shyness and can continue to work with him.\n\n Austin would do best with a couple of meet and greets with potential adopters.\u00a0\n\n---\nPeach County Animal Rescue is a rescue located in Fort Valley, GA. Our adoption fees range from $250-350+. Although our rescue dogs share a common bond with one another, no rescue story is the same (even when similar). Vetting costs vary depending on their health conditions. For us, it is never about the money. We are a non-profit. Thank you for your love and support! All of our dogs are fully vetted: up-to-date on annual shots, spayed/neutered and microchipped with a lifetime registration. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nIf you would like to send in an application for this dog, please use the link below! https://peachcountyanimalrescueandrehabilitation.org/apply-now-2/",

            "description": "Bunny was found on a freezing January 2019 day, emaciated and missing a large portion of her face. Her skull and teeth were exposed, her injury was so severe we expected she would need to be euthanized. Her wounds were typical of those sustained in a dog fight, and we feared she\u2019d been used as a bait dog. The vet had not seen anything quite like it and estimated she\u2019d been in this condition for 3-4 days. She was truly a survivor!\n \nEventually her body was strong enough that we could begin the different surgeries she\u2019d need to heal her face and ear canal, as well has her broken hip. Her severed ear canal was removed and sealed off, and while she cannot hear out of that side anymore, she still has that cute floppy ear! As for her broken hip, which caused her to limp and hop around, earning her the name \u201cBunny\u201d, was corrected with a procedure called an FHO. We chose to go this route because it\u2019s a faster healing process, and gives her back almost full range of motion. She\u2019s also heart worm positive, so she\u2019ll begin treatment for that soon.\n \nNow that Bunny is feeling better and healed, she zooms around the house at full speed! She loves to steal shoes and take them to her bed. Thankfully she just collects them and doesn\u2019t chew on them! She loves to run around the back yard, bark at the sky and lay in the shade under a tree. We don\u2019t recommend a house with cats (to be on the safe side) because she has a pretty good prey drive. She literally ran headfirst into a fence chasing a lizard. LOL! The one time we know of where she had a cat encounter, she chased the cat but didn\u2019t know what to do once she cornered it. The cat hissed at her and she ran away.\n \nGiven her rough life, it\u2019s shocking how sweet she is with people. She loves to give kisses! And she\u2019ll occasionally try to climb up into your lap! We\u2019re currently working on her manners, teaching her not jump or climb on people. Having been malnourished for so long, she\u2019s very food-motivated, so she\u2019ll do anything for a treat! We also believe that for now, Bunny should be in a single dog home, allowing her time to continue to heal. \n \nUsing clues about Bunny\u2019s age, temperament and injuries, we have a pretty good idea of her history. Because she\u2019s so loving and good with people, she was probably somebody\u2019s beloved family pet. Then she was either lost or stolen and her new owners overbred her. During this time, she outlived her usefulness and was likely sacrificed as a bait dog. After she sustained her horrific injuries, she was cast out in the streets to die. Amazingly, Bunny\u2019s will to live persevered and she was able to hang on long enough for us to find her and nurse her back to health. Her sacrifice did not go in vain and now she has a fabulous life and all that unpleasantness is behind her. Bunny is looking for her forever home where people can play with her, take her running and treat her like the princess she is!",

            "description": "Due to COVID 19, and the Illinois Shelter in Place order, we have experienced an overwhelming increase in the interest of animal adopting.  We have been inundated with more applications than we can process, as we are an all-volunteer agency.  \n\nWe do sincerely thank you for your interest in adoption.  At this time, we will only be reaching out to applicants who may be a potential match for one of our available animals.  \n\nNOTE: WE ARE FOSTER BASED, AND ONLY FULLY APPROVED APPLICATIONS ARE SCHEDULED FOR A MEET AND GREET. \n\nAgain, we are all volunteers, and do our best to acknowledge/respond to all applications and inquiries, in a timely manner. \n\nPlease read the bio below - in it's entirety - before submitting an application.  \n\nThank you!\n\nHello, my name is a Pepper and I am a two and a half year old American Bulldog mix.  I am an incredibly loving dog that would be a joyful addition to a good home, but first I want to tell you about my history.  \n\nI was taken into foster care because of terrible neglect.  I was skin and bones and never knew love, everything was survival to me.  No one ever taught me human rules.  That all changed though when a nice lady rescued me.  Since then, I have learned a lot and everyone is very happy with me and my progress. \n I have even been to school to help me learn my manners.  I have learned, sit, come, stay and drop it. I am good on walks and excellent in the car. I am well behaved in public, but sometimes need to be reminded to calm down when I see other dogs or squirrels.\n\nI wait until I am invited to my food and will just walk away to avoid a conflict if you decide to take it from me. I absolutely adore people. I am a super-snuggler and love human contact. I sometimes still get a little mouthy or too goofy with excitement, but I have learned to calm down if told to do so. I\u2019m okay with children and other dogs, but I think a home without young children or other pets may be best for me. \n\nI\u2019m okay with the vacuum cleaner. I don\u2019t like it, so I just avoid it. It\u2019s a fair compromise.  I\u2019ve even learned to get over my fear of the dishwasher when it\u2019s running. I need an active family or person that is calm and consistent with manners and rules in order to thrive. I am extremely athletic and would do well in agility courses, jogging with you or going on hikes. I need physical activity. I love to play and have a darling, funny personality. I love my toys and understand now, that they are to be shared and enjoyed not guarded.  I also love to binge watch TV on the couch for hours. \n\nI am smart.  I lean very quickly and want to please. I am a happy, sensitive soul.  Do I sound like a good match for you?  If interested please fill out an application at www.placingpawsrescue.org.  I promise, you won\u2019t regret it. \n\nADOPTION FEE: $350.00 The adoption fee includes all age appropriate vaccinations including rabies, HW test if age appropriate, de-worming, microchip, fecal, spay or neuter, Heartworm and flea and tick preventative.  ADOPTION PROCESS: PLEASE READ CAREFULLY The first step in the adoption process is to fill out an application online at www.placingpawsrescue.org. Once we review the applications, those applicants that are thought to be a good match will be contacted as quickly as possible. We ask that you please be patient with us as we are all volunteers. Then a telephone interview will take place, references checked and a home visit will be conducted. We will then arrange for you to meet the dog. We require that all family members, including current dogs meet the dog prior to adoption.  We put all of the known information in the animals description. If the animal is listed on the website, we are still accepting applications for that animal. We only remove the animal when the final adoption paperwork is signed. The best way to contact us is by email at placingpaws@yahoo.com. It is very difficult for the limited numbers of volunteers to return all calls. Thank you.",

He is very easy going in the way of daily routines, and he\u2019s happy to hang out & lounge, or nap, or be active and play or go for a walk as you wish. \n\nForrest can keep himself busy with a bone or ball. He is potty trained and is used to going out 4x a day for potty breaks. He is not destructive, and should be fine wandering free in a house. \n\nHis quirks are that due to his past, he does not appreciate anyone touching from the back of his neck back to his rear area. So keeping the petting to his head is a must. Also once he is given a bone or ball, if it is within his reach, he\ndoes not appreciate anyone coming near it. However we have worked on \u201ctrading\u201d his treasure for a high value cookie, and that works. I throw the cookie away from the item, then pick item up out of his sight. \n\nHe needs an understanding home who won\u2019t push the boundaries that he is comfortable with. That being said, he is a wonderful companion who would be a great couch and hiking buddy (not interacting with other dogs, however).\nHe does not appreciate other dogs in his space - although he is a fine gentleman in his kennel room, with guests across from him.\n\nHe prefers patient soft spoken female humans, or a gentle-man who is patient and calm.\n\nEmail harescue1@aol.com or haar13@aol.com for an application. \n\nThe application can also be found at http://fs30.formsite.com/HAA\u2026/AdoptionApplication/index.html",

He had wounds on his head, a big hole in his leg, and a badly torn foot pad.  After he came home from the vet he dutifully wore his plastic collar for weeks without a word or tearing it off.  He never complained and never had any accidents in the crate.\n\n  He is so patient and good natured, yet loves to run and play with a favorite girl of similar size as he doesn't realize his own strength.  A home with a female dog would be heaven for him.\n\nHe loves the car (and hates to have to get out of it after a ride) and walks well on a leash.  \n\nHe needs a fenced yard and someone with the time and love to give him - you will be richly rewarded with a great dog as a companion..  If you think you fit the bill, please call (landline only - no texts) me at 575-586-0784.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

He's about 2 years old and weighs 70 lbs. He is a playful hound who loves to have fun but settles down nicely. Watson is housebroken and crate trained. He pulls a little on walks which is easily corrected with a training collar. He is good with dogs his size but is not good with cats or small dogs. Watson would do best in a home with a fenced yard and another active dog his size.\n\nOur adoption fee includes the dog's spay/neuter surgery, parvo/distemper shots and rabies shots (for dogs over 3 months), deworming, microchipping, flea and tick protection, heartworm testing (for dogs over 6 months), and monthly heartworm protection until the dog gets adopted.",

If you are interested in fostering please fill out an online application.\n\nHi, I'm Jackson a sweet American Staffordshire Terrier X who was rescued from an LA shelter by someone out-of-state who wanted to give me a chance at finding my forever home.\n\nI was evaluated by a trainer who said I was stressed but calm. Who wouldn't be stressed not knowing when your last day might be.\n\nI accepted being touched all over my body including my paws, tail and mouth. I know sit, shake and take treats gently. I did not exhibit any food aggression when tested with chicken.\n\nThe trainer took me for a 30 minute walk and I pulled at first but listened to instructions about not pulling. I walked well after that. I did not react to strangers or other dogs we encountered on our walk. I showed more interest in people. This has since changed while I was in a foster home. I need to be the only dog in the home. I jumped in the trainer's car when given water after our walk. I didn't want to get out, I thought I was going home.\n\nI'm grateful and happy to be in a safe place where I'll be taken care of and given lots of love and attention. I hope the next car I jump into will take me to my forever home.\n\nSomeone who hasn't even met me in person was willing to give me a chance, won't you give me a chance too? Stop by and meet me. I'll be waiting.\n\n*Thank you to Jill for sponsoring this wonderful dog at the Burnice Kraemer Sanctuary and giving him the chance for a better life.\n\nAdditional information: *Current on shots\n\n",

WE WILL CONSIDER AN OFFICIAL ADOPTION TO WHOMEVER HAS HIM.  WE JUST WANT TO KNOW WHERE HE IS AND MAKE SURE HE IS SAFE.********\n\n\n\nAPPLICATIONS (at www.lovinliferescue.org) TAKE PRIORITY OVER EMAIL INQUIRIES. \n*** You will be contacted if you are a potential match. \nContact could take up to 48 hours (Volunteer organization)*** \n\nMeet WOODROW! This gorgeous pup with stunning light green eyes is a 1-1/2 year old  (approximate), male, 50 lb, American Pitbull Terrier mix (just a guess). Imagine our surprise when we saw this baby on deathrow! Woodrow is darling and such a GOOD puppy!! He is SUPER friendly with every person he meets and he loves to give hugs! He is good with some dogs (lives with 3) and is crate trained. Woody is an active, fun-loving puppy and needs training, but he is as smart as a whip and learns quickly! He is already making progress learning how to walk well on a leash and knows \"sit\". Woodrow has not had one accident in his foster home! He is such an affectionate sweetie and will curl up right in your lap! This little love is sure to find his Forever Family quickly, so fill out our application soon!\n\n\n***TRAINING IS MANDATORY FOR ALL LLR ADOPTABLES!!\n\nNOTE: We do NOT adopt out of state. Our range is no further than 40 miles North / Northwest from Chicago and 25 miles South from Chicago. This is because we PERSONALLY do home visits for every single dog / puppy. Exceptions ONLY in certain cases where a sweetie has issues (medical / behavioral / special needs) and we have had him / her for a longer time. We will then travel to the Moon for a Forever Family!\n",

            "description": "Casey is a 9 year old neutered male sable & white Sheltie. He came from a bad situation and is shy with people until he gets to know you. He has come a long way from the fearful dog he was through a lot of socialization in his dedicated foster home. He has settled in nicely to family life and seems very happy to be around people. He has become accustomed to most noises that once scared him, but he still panics at some particularly loud noises such as thunder and power tools.  He is more comfortable around women than men and still is somewhat fearful with men. His foster family is working with him everyday to continue to build his trust with men. Casey is crate trained, but he prefers to hang out in a comfy corner of the kitchen. Casey would do well with a female owner that could spend lots of time with him. He is very loving and is a good companion. Casey has been diagnosed with dry eye and will need inexpensive eye medication administered daily for life. He also has some elevated kidney values and must be kept on another inexpensive medication for this, on food with less than 30% protein content, and monitored by a vet every 6-12 months going forward. Casey also had a tumor removed from his leg and our vet was able to get great margins and does not expect a recurrence. Casey has been through a lot and is very deserving of a loving adoptive home. If you're interested in meeting or adopting Casey, please fill out an application via our website scsheltierescue.com. Casey is house trained and crate trained. Fenced yard and experience with Shelties is required. Casey's adoption donation of $250 includes neuter, dental cleaning, microchip and vaccinations. FEBRUARY 2021",

He is learning to trust humans and is going through behavioral rehabilitation with one of our foster families. Jack was successfully treated for Lyme disease (non-symptomatic). Jack's adoptive family needs to have unending patience to help with his anxiety issues and a very securely fenced yard. He is an escape artist and will bolt if given the opportunity. If you're interested in meeting or adopting Jack, please fill out an application via our website scsheltierescue.com. Fenced yard and experience with fearful Shelties is required. Jack's adoption donation of $250 includes neuter, dental cleaning, microchip and vaccinations. FEBRUARY 2021",

Bossco is an enthusiastic about life in general but he gets especially excited to do nose work, a fun search and scenting sport. Since coming to the Sanctuary, Bossco has become an expert at it. Born in 2017, Bossco has some respiratory issues that limit his ability to go for walks with the leash clipped to a collar or certain harnesses, but he is currently trying a new harness that seems to help. He loves to run around in open spaces, do agility and get attention. Bossco gets very jumpy and mouthy when he gets excited, and he can jump fences. He's working on being calm for leashing, not jumping on people and staying calm while getting attention. When it comes to attention, Bossco will want to be the center of it in a home of his own. He would do best as an only pet so you can give him all your love. He will give you all his love in return.",

Some of his other favorite activities include chasing lizards, playing in the pool or creek, doing food puzzles and going on golf cart rides! Cody enjoys going for walks with other dogs, but due to some resource guarding would do best as the only pet in the home. He walks very nicely on leash and enjoys meeting new people while he's out and about. Cody loves his human friends so much that it can be a little stressful for him if he's left home alone for long periods time. He's looking for a family that's ready to give him lots of belly rubs and ear scratches. \n\nCody also has a secret admirer who has sponsored his adoption!",

            "description": "Aspen is a sweet intelligent guy with some allergies that are controlled simply by diet. Aspen was adopted in 12/17 and returned 3/19 for a behavior change. Once back with us I reviewed all of his veterinary records from while he was in the home, the reasons he was seen and the multitude of times the family had boarded him in the short period he was with them. That explained a lot\nto me about this \"behavior change\". We put him on a special diet for allergies and have provided a stable environment for him, Aspen has been nothing but wonderful here just as he was in his foster home prior to the adoption in 12/17. He's a great dog, comical, loves to play, loves water and needs a \"forever\" home with out children, female canine companion only.\n\nWe require that you have a fenced in yard, not a \"kennel\" in the yard AND we do not approve underground fencing. Depending upon the dog some exceptions are made for those who live in apartments. We also require that the adoptee will be a part of the family \"living\" within the home. Our adoption process may be found on our website at www.bitofheaven.org\n\nVisits are scheduled by appointment only via emailing request to ownedbycaninesandlovit@yahoo.com",

Sadie is a huge cuddle bug who loves to be next to her humans. She will definitely try those puppy dog eyes on you to let her get on the couch. She also loves to sunbathe whenever she gets the chance.  She can be a bit of a digger, so you have to watch her when she's outside alone for too long or you may end up with a big hole in your back yard. She loves her walks and is very great on leash. She knows basic obedience commands, has passed an obedience class with flying colors, and even knows a few special tricks. She is very excitable when humans come to visit as she loves everyone.  She likes tough toys and bones to chew on, but isn't great at playing ball.  She does have a bit of storm anxiety, but we don't coddle her during those storms and she does ok.  Sadie is housetrained and she is also crate trained, although it's not her favorite place to be.  She can be left out in the house for a few hours; however, she has occasionally been known to chew on a sock on the ground or a hat left out or anything plastic.  Sadie will do best and will be happiest with a family where she is the only pet and gets all the attention.  She deserves nothing less after all she's been through!\n\nIf you are interested in adding this pup to your family, please click here (or copy and paste https://www.dfwpuppatrol.com/info/adoption into your browser) to view our adoption info and where you will find the link to fill out our online Pre-Adoption Application.  Any questions can be directed to us at info@dfwpuppatrol.com.  All of our adoptable pups have a minimum requested adoption fee of $250 + tax    (pups 6 months and older) and $350    + tax   (pups under 6 months old), regardless of our expenses, and it includes vaccinations, spay/neuter, heartworm test for pups 8 months and older, heartworm treatment if tested positive, deworming and/or fecal test, parasite treatment if tested positive, microchipping, any immediate known health issues, and pups 4 months and older are kept current on monthly heartworm prevention.\n",

But they are no trouble together, and we can work out the best Foster/Adoption option to make this happen.\n\nTo adopt or foster, please submit a fully completed application on our website at www.nalasrescue.org/adoption-application.\nWe are located in Palm City, FL and we adopt mostly in a 50 miles radius. We always do home visit, and personalized meet and greet, to insure that your new companion will be a great match for your family.\n\n\n",

He is a sweet dog to his human friends. \n\nNoah's Arks Rescue is all about giving an Abused Animal a second chance at life and to experience what true love is. We take animals that have been tortured, abused, and neglected and supply the emergency medical care required to get them well. We then provide rehab physically and mentally to prepare them for their new home and new life. We are located in Ridgeland, SC., and are by appointment only. All of our dogs are at our Rehabilitation Center either in hospice care or being loved on by staff until we find them forever homes. Please call 843.540.6755 or email NoahsArksRescues@mac.com with any questions. If you are interested, please fill out our Adoption Application at https://www.noahs-arks.net/nar-application.

            "description": "Dannie's previous life was an unhappy one. She was left outside often longing to be near people and she began to get out of her backyard.  She was found roaming the neighborhood when our volunteer found her.  Her owners did not care to take her back and it was very obvious she didn't want to go back to her own home. She only wanted to stay with her finder as if she knew she would finally get some love and attention. Unfortunately Dannie tested positive for heartworm disease due to her neglected care but luckily for her our rescue was able to get her the treatment  she needed to make her healthy again. Dannie can be a apprehensive of some strangers but will warm up if you go slow with her.  She would be fine as an only dog or with a furry friend.  We don't know how she would be with kids but older respectful ones should be ok and a calmer home best. She likes attention and would be a good companion for someone able to devote the time and attention to her. She is approximately 7-8 years old  and deserves to enjoy the rest of her life being happy and loved.\nA visible fence is required.http://homefurever.com/online-application/",

She loves to hunt for flies in the house or in the backyard and is pretty good at catching them. Stuffed squeaky toy are her weakness and the toys tremble with fear when she is around because she will find their center and rip is out. She is kennel trained and it is recommended that she continues to be in a kennel or locked into a room/ bathroom when you aren't home. She isn't destructive but she does like to climb onto things, such as counters, tables, and if she can she might try to climb higher onto pantries or refrigerators if she can. Aside from being a toy murderer she is very sweet and has alot of energy, so she would be a great running partner. If you have a hyper dog or puppy and would like to get them a playmate, Sugar would be a great dog to have because she is very good with playful dogs. She is not good with cats, however, because she like to chase and nip them and could potentially hurt them. Sugar is very cute; however, she can ONLY go home with an experienced dog owner. She is going to have to gain the trust of her future owner which can take time but believe me when I say it is worth it.\n\nI am living in a San Antonio Pets Alive! foster home. By adopting me, you not only give me a new leash on life; you also save the life of an additional pet who can be rescued from euthanasia and placed in foster care. If you are interested in adopting me, please email adopt@sanantoniopetsalive.org with my name and ID#. Please allow up to 24 hours to respond, as all fosters work on a volunteer basis. To find out how you can get involved and help turn San Antonio into a no-kill city, please visit www.sanantoniopetsalive.org",

I have one brown eye and one blue eye, which is called heteroschromea \n\nI am current on all of my vaccines and also have a microchip and am spayed.  Am also on Heartworm meds and I am negative for HW and for tick diseases. I am  house trained and good in my crate and also in a crate in the car. I can ride for miles and miles and never make a peep. I hate being on a leash .I am reactive to seeing other dogs out in public. \n\nWhen I came into rescue it was noticed my one back leg looked different. Exrays showed that the ball that fits into the hp socked had been badly broken. The vet fixed me up with a surgery called a Femoral Head Ostomy-FHO. I am not pain free and can run like the wind.\n\nI like to play with other dogs that I know and am very, very  energetic.  I play rough and due to the herding breed will go after back legs so another dog must be able to be large enough to be able to deal with that. She can put a 90 pound dog down to the ground by grabbing back legs and has no fear doing it.\n\nBecause I was a stray and am a High flight risk I will REQUIRE a secure physical wooden fenced yard where I can run and play safely. Fence must be at least 5 feet high .The house must have an entrance right into the fenced yard \n\n.   \"\"\"Please don't apply if you don't have the fence that is required\"\"\"\n\nI like to play outside with treat toys. I roll the toy around and the treats come out for me to snack on. \n\nI have a Heeler habit of wanting to herd , so older kids will be a better match. Only because she likes to grab back of ankles while herding. she has got so much better at that with adults though since she came into rescue.Small kids when running will trigger the herding instincts. She is a fun little girl. I would love to have people come and visit me as I love people. Due to the Covid that has been hard to do so will need more of the socializing when this situation gets better.\n\nNo long distance adoptions. \n\nIf I might be the girl for you,contact  sue@crrow.org for more info  or an application. .\n\n\n\nNOTE: DUE TO THE PANDEMIC THERE ARE NO MEETS UNTIL WE DEEM IT SAFE FOR FOSTER HOMES.\n\n\n",

After two major initial surgeries, she went to the same foster home as Mookie. Even though he was only 5 months at the time, his gentleness and care for Victory melted our hearts. Victory had to undergo two additional surgeries. Mookie has been right by her side through all of her recoveries. They have a sweetness for each other that we just can\u2019t separate, and we are adoptiong these two precious puppies as a bonded pair, together. Mookie is a total cuddler and loves to sleep next to his people in bed. He will curl up by you on the couch after a busy day of playing ball and chewing on his bones. He\u2019s a confident, active, energetic pup with the most soulful puppy eyes you ever did see. Victory is also a love bug, with plenty of kisses to give. She\u2019s a sweet, happy girl who wants to please her people. She's a complete darling, and everyone seems to just fall in love with her. Victory has been diagnosed with fibrotic myopathy which is a rare, idiopathic disorder. We officially consider Mookie her emotional support animal! If you\u2019re interested in opening your heart and home to this pair of wonderful pups, we\u2019ll be happy to talk to you further about Victory\u2019s special needs.\n\nEmail gsdresq@gmail.com with your completed Adoption Application: http://tinyurl.com/gsrapp\n\nMore Photos:  https://tinyurl.com/y5u44q4w\n\nWebsite:      http://www.goodshepherdrescuetexas.com/\nFacebook:   https://www.facebook.com/GoodShepherdRescue\nApplication:  http://www.goodshepherdrescuetexas.com/#!adoption-application/cihc\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  We do not respond to Petfinder inquiries with any information about the dogs.

He is 60lbs, 5/6yrs old, neutered and is so cute it\u2019s ridiculous. He is mostly husky with a itty, bitty bit of asian breed. \n\n\u2022\n\nHartley is a boy of simple pleasures and he has the time of his life. He gets to go to the park, the beach, and friends\u2019 houses where he gets loved on by so many people. He may need a little extra care due to his medical needs (insulin & food every 12hrs, thyroid pill) but because of his easy going nature - so many other things are easy. He is a good boy about his insulin shots, in the car, at vet, in new environments, loves all humans including kiddos, and even tolerates nail clips and baths! More than getting along with other doggos, Hartley needs canine companionship to know he\u2019s not alone as he does have isolation anxiety (fear of being alone). He is sight impaired and having another doggo simply helps reassure him. \n\n\u2022\n\nHartley is so special because he loves so hard it\u2019s impossible not to fall for him. He has all the reason to be slow to trust but he is so endearing! He will whine for attention because he\u2019s figured out it\u2019s so cute that most people can\u2019t help but to give in. However, he does mellow out once ignored. We can\u2019t blame him for trying!  He is of gentle, calm energy but can be playful, too once he\u2019s settled in. \n?\n\n?\u2022\n?\nTo adopt Hartley: please visit our website to complete an adoption application: www.twodogfarms.com/adopt\n\u2022\nFor foster: www.twodogfarms.com/foster\n\u2022\n\n\n\nContact us for more information, and visit our website to complete an adoption application form:\n\nwww.twodogfarms.com/adopt\n\nAdoption fees are $350.00.\n\ninfo@twodogfarms.com",

Beaux would do better with kids 12 years or older. He loves to go for walks/runs and enjoys the outdoors (when it's not too hot, of course). \n\nHe does have some quirks so will do best with a strong handler who will provide discipline and structure.\n\nBeaux will shake for a treat, he's a really smart guy!\n\nVisit rockabullyaf.com/adopters for more information on our adoption process and to apply",

He gets along with other dogs for the most part, but should be supervised with with other dogs.\nHe is a nervous dog, and needs people to go slow with him. Once he trusts you he'll follow you around everywhere, but it takes some patience and work to get to that point.\nHe needs an experienced adopter, with a calm household. He does best in a single person home, but can be in an all female or all male household (no female/male household). Also, no kids for Charlie!\n\nHe has recently started to have bouts of aggression when people enter the home, and has been seeing a behaviorist about it. He is fine with people in public.\n\nCharlie walks great on a leash, though has occasional leash aggression, and is very treat motivated. His trainer has had success with him though positive reinforcement training.\nHe has a collapsed trachea and he coughs when hes being active. He also has dry eye, so he gets eye drops.",

She will need someone who knows how to work with a timid dog to build her confidence. She ended up at the shelter because she bit a child but we do not know the circumstances. \n\nThis beauty with the shiny black coat is a favorite of the volunteers because she walks nicely on a leash and has some training. Emma is very intelligent and is willing to learn new tricks in exchange for treats. She already knows basic commands and walks well on a leash, and she keeps her kennel very clean.\n\nEmma is hopeful her future person will be able to come in for several visits to get to know her because she can be fearful around strangers. If you think you could provide Emma with a quiet home and lots of love, consider filling out your application for this pretty girl!",

She was tied to a bumper on a truck and she was dragged behind that truck for an unspecified period of time. She was pulled out of her collar as she was being dragged, and some witnesses picked her up off the street. It took six surgeries to remove the necrotic tissue, suture her up and Save her eyelid, so she could close her eye and blink. Belle has healed physically with the possibility of som arthritis in her golden years. She has a VERY STRONG AND DOMINANT PERSONALITY. She associates with both large and small breed dogs, but does not react well to being Bullied by an ALFA. Slow intro to a more submissive companion and she will do well,",

            "description": "This is Houch (HWTH#19063A). He is a Pit mix, DOB: 3/6/17. Houch weighs approximately 50 pounds and stands 18 inches at the shoulders. Houch was found by a Halfway to Home volunteer running the streets of the Antelope Valley. The volunteer took Houch to the local animal shelter where he stayed for 2 weeks without being claimed by his owner. At the end of the 2 weeks, the volunteer went back to the animal shelter and got Houch released. He then relinquished Houch to Halfway to Home. Houch is a very friendly boy who is high-energy and strong. He loves attention and gives small kisses. It will be imperative for Houch to have a kind, active owner willing to give Houch the love, good-quality human companionship, structure and playtime he deserves as well as the amount of exercise he needs to control his rambunctious nature in a positive way. He might make a good canine running partner for the right person or perhaps having another active canine to play with would help him release his energy in a positive way. When Houch is thoroughly settled in his new Forever home, he will benefit from positive basic obedience training to help with leash training and other obedience commands as well as the bonding process. With lots of love and the right amount of exercise, Houch will make a wonderful and very loving and loyal canine companion. He is good with other dogs but probably should be introduced slowly due to his rambunctious nature. He is crate friendly. For more information on Houch, please call Sandy at tele # 661-824-4495 (this is a land-line phone).",

LoLo loves running and chasing squirrels with her other pack members when she's not enjoying her toys! She knows how to use the doggy door and sometimes will use pee pads. She's very easy to love!\nIf you're looking for a devoted best friend and companion, LoLo would be happy to fill that spot!

I don\u2019t have cats, havent seen signs of prey drive. This poor guy had a rough start and we are not sure what happened but he does have a bit of a leg deformity but despite it he doesnt have mobility trouble except flights of stairs.

She loves them and secondly she\u2019s a little insecure innately and dog friends help her feel secure. Pony has energy to burn. Especially with being a larger breed mix when not socialized properly dogs change and then people run into problems down the road and want to give up. We see this commonly with puppies specifically. Her current life is filled with socialization, adventures and a house of solid dog friends. We also have to make sure you\u2019re aware that she was born with not a fully closed skull. In affect, she has a knob on her head. We had an MRI and it showed that her brain is fully where it should be so that\u2019s safe. The knob is filled with meningeal fluid which protects the brain. The specialist gave her an A+ on everything neurological and cognitive. He did recommend surgery but that is what surgeons do. Our vet thinks she could live a long prosperous life without surgery. Think of it as a third eye where you don\u2019t want a stick going straight into (obviously). We choose to not do it. We recently did an elective surgery and almost killed the dog. That\u2019s enough of that. She\u2019s a happy, outgoing and extremely playful girl that has no idea what her size is. She\u2019s never been crated and she\u2019s fully potty trained and not destructive. She does spook more easily than not but anything aggressive doesn\u2019t exist in her even remotely. shes extremely sensitive and we think magical. We know our dogs extremely well. We are full disclosure on every detail. We look for organic connections and humans willing to put in the work in. \n\nAnimals can be viewed by appointment only. We ask that you review our adoption information AND fill out an adoption application prior to setting an appointment so we have all your information and you understand our adoption procedures - you can do so online here.     \n\nPlease feel free to email us or call us anytime for additional information on any of our animals - info@mcprescue.org or 312-388-3928. Our typical adoption fee varies based on the age of the dog at the time of rescue: Under the age of 1 years old is $500; 1-5 years old is $400; over the age of 5 is $300. Fees include vaccinations, microchip, deworming and other vetting as needed. Our adoption process includes an application, reference check and home visit.",

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN FOSTERING OR ADOPTING BEAUTIFUL CAMERON, GO TO THE MAKE A DIFFERENCE RESCUE FACEBOOK PAGE AND SEND A PRIVATE MESSAGE WITH YOUR PHONE NUMBER AND EMAIL ADDRESS.\n\nBeautiful Cameron is an 9 yr old Australian Shepherd mix. Cameron can be shy/skittish when meeting new people. Once she gets to know you, she is a sweet girl. When Cameron came to the rescue she had a bad case of bilateral cherry eye. She had surgery done and is doing fine. Cameron loves to go for walks, sun herself in the backyard or just chill. She loves to play with toys and loves peanut butter filled bones. Cameron is ok with other dogs after a proper introduction. Unfortunately, we do not know how she is with cats. Children 15 years old or older but would be best as a companion rather than a family dog. Her forever home is required to have a fenced yard. Cameron is spayed, up to date on her vaccinations, on heart worm preventative as well as house and crate trained. If you are looking for an older girl with experience to be your companion, look no further!! \n\nAll dogs we rescue stay with us until they find their forever homes. We do not do same day adoptions.  A home visit is required to ensure our dog is going to a safe environment and our dog gets along with your dog(s) and/or cat(s). We require all our dogs over the age of 1 year attend 1 obedience class (6 week session) outside the home. You must live within 1 hour of Birmingham, MI to adopt one of our dogs. No out of state or outside the U.S. adoptions or fosters. Cameron's adoption fee is $275.",

            "description": "(All notes supplied by Jack's current owner - we are listing Jack as a courtesy to him. If you are interested to find out more, please contact Brian directly at bktakagi@live.com)\n\nJack is 6 yrs, 3 months approx. old, 67lb\nLocated in Edmonds, WA, 98020\n\nNeutered\n\nRabies 2019\n\nno monthly worm/flea/tick treatments\n\nJack has epilepsy.  Takes Zonisamide, 100mg capsules: 2 orally morning, 2 orally evening (12 hr) with peanut butter.  Jack has a low threshold for seizure, meaning missing several doses will result in major tonic-clonic seizures.  They are terrible to witness.  Zonisamide runs 50 cents/pill, so $2.00/day, $60/month, $720/year.  Phenobarbitol is cheaper, but Jack has only taken Zonisamide since being diagnosed in March, 2017.  He had two seizures (03/2017, 06/2017) before treatment started, and has had three breakthrough seizures (the first breakthrough was during trial treatment- dose was doubled to current dose; the next two seizures occurred after I missed several doses).  He has not had a seizure since March, 2018. \n\nJack has a very, very high prey drive, in addition to fear/anxiety of strangers.  He will most definitely be aggressive towards dogs, even if he is riding in the car and sees a dog on the street.  He has ripped the door paneling completely off the passenger door with one bite when he gets triggered.  He appears friendly/interested in strangers, wagging his tail but will most definitely give warning bite to the hand of anyone who gets close- ie, within 3-5 feet.  EXTREME CAUTION with strangers!  NO ONE should be allowed within 6-8 feet if new to Jack.  ABSOLUTELY NO CHILDREN anywhere near this dog- he can lunge so quickly and powerfully when he is inclined.  NO EXCEPTIONS.   If he knows the person, he is affectionate .\n\nJack is used to early morning (between 5am to 7am) walks.  Morning walk M-F 40-50 minutes, with hills, suburban and park environments.  AVOID other dogs, people running/cycling- he lunges at moving people/animals- dogs, birds, rabbits, squirrels.  He lunges at slow moving cars.  20-30 minute lunch walk suburban/park.  Weekend winters one day at cross country ski trails that allow dogs 1-2 1/2 hours on trail.  Summer weekend walks 50-80 minute walks, beach walk with super low tide (at hours with minimal people).  Trail  hikes are risky if trail is narrow as little room to pull dog off to make way for other hikers/dogs.  Jack is much better with pinch collar and water spray bottle.\n\nJack  spends most of his day indoors, but has a wooden deck at home to lounge outside for hours in spring, summer.  Jack is rarely left alone, as he is accustomed to staying at my office M-F- behind a gate.  On sunny days, he can lounge outside  on leash attached to side door. He gets regular attention and treats from employees. \n\nWalking Jack is a challenge.  Much less pulling/lunging with pinch collar over last three months.  Very reactive to other dogs and any animal/insect/moving thing.  Many oppose use of pinch collar, but for control purposes, it is currently effective.  Eventually, some other collar will be fine.  He is extremely wary of guard muzzle, but must be in muzzle in public as of May, 2019.  This aversion is why I'm looking to place Jack in new home. \n\nJack is very sensitive and has numerous no-go zones: tail- beautiful and curled and fluffy and don't play with it; lower tummy by genitals- he's very private;  does not like behind getting wiped when he has soft/wet stool on long coat.  Don't try to pick him up- he will aggressively resist.  He does not enjoy bathing, does enjoy his teeth getting brushed (Petrodex with red label).\n\nJack rides in the car seven days per week.  For Vet visits, he needs multiple meds for sedation- mainly to get muzzle on.  If not sedated, Jack is aggressive in the waiting room if other dogs are present (they always are).  He is very nervous in the exam room.  He has taken Trazadone and Gabapentin and gets mildy sedated, but not enough for muzzling.  Valium, Trazadone, and Acepromazine allowed muzzling.  Needs four hours for effective sedation (Vet claims two hours, but I have not seen that work for this dog).  He will forcefully resist examination even when sedated.  Muzzle must be on very tightly.\n\nAfter five years of ownership, on May 1, 2019, Jack bit a woman on the leg that needed stitches.  In the eyes of the woman, and the Animal Control office (the local police department), it was deemed \"unprovoked\", and Jack was legally declared a \"dangerous dog\" by WA state law.  This declaration is under appeal (court date 06/05/2019), but regardless, a second bite (of person or domestic animal), is a automatic class C felony for me and euthanasia for Jack.\nI have not seen Jack act out at home by being left alone, as he is not left longer than eight hours but a handful of day per year.  If I'm out of town, I pay an employee to stay at my house so his routine and diet are uninterrupted.\n\nDue to the harsh legal consequence of a second bite offense, I am looking to place Jack in a new home that can manage a loyal, loving dog who has aggressive tendencies.",

Likes to be around people. Gets along with cats and dogs. Pulls on the leash a bit but nothing a little correction can't fix.\n\nWhile Bubba is incredibly sweet, Bubba suffers from SEVERE anxiety and seperation anxiety. He has a need to be around someone all the time. If he is left alone his anxiety kicks in and he tries to escape confinement. We have tried everything from vet prescribed sedatives to a high quality crate and nothing has worked. My parents are no longer able to care for them as both of them work",

IF YOU MEET OUR CRITERIA FOR ADOPTION OF THIS DOG, PLEASE FOLLOW THE LINK TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE PROFILE TO COMPLETE OUR APPLICATION. THANK YOU!\n\nChad is an adorable two-ish year old Pit bull mix (we think), possibly with some kind of Spaniel? His spots are SO CUTE! He is exactly as you'd imagine a 45lb puppy would be, active, happy, and needy. Hahaha. Chad is insecure and guarded with new people, but once he knows someone he is very snuggly. He is impossibly soft and loves to give kisses. \n\nThis boy is very playful and loves other dogs - but he has no social graces. So he\u2019s not a dog park kind of pup, instead he would love carefully selected and managed play dates in his backyard. He does have some jealousy/guarding issues with other dogs in his home so he should be an only pet, apart from play dates with good furry friends, of course. \n\nChad is very sensitive and needs an experienced owner who can model confidence for him, and be the strong leader and protector that he needs. Like any dog, Chad would benefit from training. He is very treat motivated and loves to learn so training will just take a commitment on the part of his people. \n\nChad will need at least two walks a day and really needs someone who is home a lot of the day. He wants to live in a house (not an apartment) with a securely fenced yard. While Chad loves kids, he doesn\u2019t understand that little people are delicate, so he\u2019d do best with older kids only. This poor pup also doesn\u2019t realize that cats and other small pets are delicate too, so he can\u2019t live with them either. \n\nAdoption Process: We are not first come first served. Indigo Rescue focuses on finding good matches between dogs and families to ensure life long adoptions. We deliver all dogs to their new homes. All of our dogs are in foster homes. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in meeting one of our dogs, please use the following link and complete our Adoption Application. You can either scan your completed application and email it to us at: info@indigorescue.org, or you can fax it to us at: 888-502-7660.\nThe link is not live, so you will need to copy and paste it into your browser: https://storage.googleapis.com/gator-users/user-680788/documents/d1742bff02e44c2ea25649cb45df5103/Pet%20Application%20Form%20December%202020.pdf\n\nIf the dog you're interested in seems compatible with your lifestyle we'll set up a time for you to meet the dog privately.\nPLEASE NOTE: Indigo Rescue only adopts to homes within 30 miles of Beaverton because our volunteers deliver all of our dogs to their adoptive homes. We work very hard to create a family of our Indigo Rescue adopters because we want to be close enough to help in case there are any problems. We want everyone to be happy and successful!\n\n**ALL of our dogs, puppies, cats, kittens and rabbits come vaccined to their age, spayed/neutered and microchipped.\n\nThank you for your interest in adopting and saving a life.",

The workers would feed him, and finally we were contacted to take him in so he is off the streets. Most workers were nice to him, but some bragged to us about stomping their feet and yelling at him to chase him away. We were upset to hear this, Hector is such a gentle soul. We were able to rescue him and gain his trust. \n\nWe are not at all sure what his breed mix is, but he has an easy going and goofy temperament once he get comfortable with people. He is initially shy with going to new places, he does take a few days to adjust to a new environment (which is understandable from what he has been through). He loves peanut butter and belly rubs. He would be best as the only animal in the house as he has not gotten comfortable around other animals yet. Hector thinks he is a lap dog, so be warned about the cuddles he will want!\n\nHector is 79 lbs, 4 years old, neutered, up to vaccinations, microchipped, and heartworm negative!\n\nAdoption or foster applications can be found at www.adorehouston.org\n\nEmail us at info@adorehouston.org with any further questions.",

She is your typical Boxer/Pit energy and would benefit from someone with an active lifestyle. She is crate trained and house trained. She has went through basic obedience classes and a very smart girl. I would say that she would be best in a home with children above the age of 10 because she wants to play and can play rough without monitoring and guidance. She has done well with other dogs while in the rescue but she does seem to react to anxious dogs or other dominant dogs by trying to be a dominant Queen Bee so she may be best as an only dog or with a submissive dog that will let Angel be the boss. \nWe think she is about 4 years old and around 50 lbs. She has been spayed and vaccinated. She is heartworm negative and microchipped.",

A concerned citizen was able to trap Sheldon and got him to a local vet for care. That is where we stepped in and agreed to take Sheldon into our organization in NJ. He is a big, goofy boy who loves to play, he is very inquisitive and silly. Sheldon can be unsure of new situations at times so he will need a home with a confident breed experienced owner who can make him feel safe in new situations.\n\n\nAre you interested in Sheldon?  Please go to our website at www.bigeastakitarescue.org and put in an online adoption application.\n\n",

I love to run.\n\nI am fun loving and loyal once I get to know you as I am pretty shy at first. My first home was on an acreage but my family had to move so I went to live with another family on an acreage but they had to move too. So I went to live in the city, but there was so much going on I couldn't stop barking so I had to leave there. So I came to live with my friends at the kennel where I used to stay when my family went away.\n\nI don't bark much anymore and I also got used to people coming and going and I love it when they play ball with me. I have always been the only dog in my home so not sure about being around too many of them at a time and not sure I want to be friends with them, but I might. I am really hoping to get my own home and family soon.\n\nI would do best in a home with no cats or young children.  His foster parents feel  Bowser needs dog savvy owner who will give him lots of walks and attention.  He is smaller and very handsome in person.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Bowser, please complete the online application for adoption at Before the Bridge Senior K9 Rescue at www.beforethebridge.ca",

She has been exposed to chickens, goats, sheep, donkeys, and longhorn cattle. She grew up with young children and other dogs, so she has been well socialized and will make a wonderful addition to your small farm, ranch or homestead. She's still young, so she will need proper introductions to your animals, and she will continue to need supervision around the livestock while she matures. At Windsong Ranch, Summer is living in the pasture under the supervision of our best LGD, Miss Rennie.\n\nSummer has been spayed, vaccinated, and microchipped, so she is ready to find her forever home.

            "description": "\"Happy\" is the perfect name for this smiling, streamlined, young guy! His affectionate nature will have you smiling, too, we promise!\nWe believe him to be a Carolina Dog (American Dingo)/Mix. Carolina Dogs can still be found living in the wild in parts of the Southern US, but they've also become beloved pets to many happy dog owners. Please look up this breed.\n\nHappy is reserved at first, but quickly forms a strong bond with humans and is loyal. He is pack oriented and loves to be by your side, regardless if you are outside doing  yard work or lying at your feet while watching TV. He is housebroken and follows willingly and easily rules inside the house. He is intelligent, very trainable and so eager to please and happily and enthusiastically follows directions.. He loves and needs rules and boundaries. \n\nHappy is a young guy, his DOB is 05/15/2018, and has energy to spare.  He would do best as an only dog.\nWhile in foster, he was doing well around a dog-savvy cat. Happy is unsure of children and would do best with teenagers and adults. Happy does have prey-drive and we think he would do best in a home without small pets and livestock.\n\nHappy is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, tested negative for heartworm and is on heartworm prevention. He weighs 57 lbs. All our animals must be indoor pets. Dogs are very social animals; there's really no such thing as a \"good outdoor dog\".\n\nIf you would like to meet Happy please schedule an appointment, and if Happy  would be the second dog in your family, give us a call and schedule a Meet and Greet under supervision at our shelter with your spayed or neutered dog. 830-980-2247 or BAHShelter@yahoo.com.\n\nDue to COVID-19 the shelter is only open for scheduled appointments at this time.",

            "description": "RayRay is a charming fellow that spews happiness and rainbows due to his positive and delightful disposition. Never meeting a stranger, RayRay loves EVERYONE. When he meets dogs he's instantly passing out kisses and wagging his tail. That goes for humans, as well! He's even fine with cats as long as they are gentle with him. He's also been known to smother kids in kisses. :)\n\nRayRay was treated for heartworms but is doing well. He's now put on weight, is crate trained, and is about 90% potty trained. He does require an inexpensive supplement for his allergies and has done extremely well since starting this - no more itching!\n\nRayRay appears to be a victim of a Traumatic Brain Injury...but don't be alarmed! He is completely unfazed by this diagnosis, as life is a bowl full of jelly beans and sunshine to RayRay! He's a very intelligent guy, albeit slightly clueless, and he's happy to please his family. He has a little trouble with depth perception (e.g. he's slower going down steps), but it's not life altering for him. He runs around the yard, plays with his toys and his friends, and lives life like any other dog. There is no treatment for TBI, and he has a perfectly fine prognosis, so there's no need to think he's a tough medical case to handle...he just spins to the left sometimes, wears a perma-grin, and sometimes needs you to lead him in the right direction...but he's very independent and handles himself well. He's not a dog that needs constant assistance. He lives a very happy and positive life with many, many years ahead of him to brighten everyone's day. Allow him to pick his favorite spot to sleep on a nice cozy doggy bed, and he's good to go. \n\nRayRay need someone that is understanding of his need for guidance with potty habits. While he knows he's supposed to go outside, he hasn't quite mastered how to tell you. You'll find him spinning and rather anxious when he needs to go potty, desperately trying to relay the message, but if you're not around he doesn't know how to find you to let you know. As a result, he does have to be understood in this regard. He's super in a crate, but he can't be left in the crate more than a few hours b/c if he gets excited it prompts him to go to the bathroom, leaving a mess. So if gone for an extended amount of time, he goes to doggy daycare...which he LOVES!!! He is a staff favorite at doggy daycare and is thrilled when he realizes he's there, jumping out of the car and dashing to the door!\n\nWith patience on training, RayRay might benefit quite well from a doggy door. Just remember that he'd need to be able to go into a securely fenced yard. Another dog would be a great support system for him with this, both as a teacher and an aide, and make him quite happy and secure since he loves dogs so very much.\n\nAgain, RayRay does need a fenced yard due to his special need. He also enjoys laying in she sunshine and relaxing. So since he can't be trusted off leash, and because it could be dangerous for him, he'll require that fence. RayRay does walk well on a leash, although sometimes he can spin to the left and sometimes walk a little slower in a new setting. He just needs to get a gist of where he's at and what's going on. However, he's always game for an adventure! He LOVES a car ride!\n\nRayRay is a super special guy that knocks the socks off of all who are blessed to meet him. If you love that smile as much as we do, let us know! We'll be happy to fill you in on how you can have this 4 legged bundle of joy in your life.",

Adopted out on 11/9/19, she was relinquished to another shelter and was transferred to us on 3/11/20. This girl is an absolute character! Sometimes Liberty's a lady, but it might take her a moment to arrive at that level. We busted a gut photographing this lively, animated girl. Liberty's a ton of fun, loaded with energy and personality. She loves to gallop, run and has the fastest crawl either of us has ever seen. It was a belly fun run that came out of nowhere. Got her to settle down for a bit and discovered Liberty not only knows how to sit on command, but is a leaner who likes to sit right on ones feet! She also knows roll over and is, of course, a sucker for treats! Liberty is a real live wire and sweetie. She's an absolute doll! Liberty's adoption fee is $150. She is spayed, dewormed, up to date on shots, microchipped and treated with monthly heart worm, flea and tick preventive. We love Liberty's freedom of expression and know there's a family who'll delight in her as much as we do!",

They are good with kids and other dogs both big and small, and are willing to travel anywhere to find their perfect home! Please share!! \n\nHank and Topaz are both big lovable babies sitting at around 85 lbs each. They are incredibly well trained. You won't need to worry about these 2 chewing or destroying anything. They listen well and are very calm quiet pups.\nThey are kennel trained, house trained, and are healthy, fixed, and fully vaccinated. \n\nWe found these guys in a very rural shelter that had plans to put all the dogs down before CHR came to the rescue. They were found on the streets together, were housed in the shelter together, and we plan on keeping them together- otherwise Hank cries and cries for his Topaz to come back. These 2 were very lucky to find a foster mom to care for them for a few months and nurse them back to health. When her time was up we had to put them in boarding where they remain today. \n\nThese guys love their boarding facility where they get to play with other dogs and get treats all day long. After a long hot day playing in the pool, they get to cuddle each other all night. Although this sounds great, they can't stay there forever. And i know they would love a couch to lounge on and a family to come home to them every day. \n\nWe've had them for 6 months now and we are dedicated to finding them the home that they've been waiting so long for. Please share this post far and wide!! \n\nApply to foster or adopt at canehavenrescue.com \n\nMessage us with any questions!! \nLocated in New Orleans, Louisiana\n (TRANSPORT AVAILABLE!)",

I\u2019m a very particular dog when it comes to who I obey and who I don\u2019t. My dad wasn\u2019t sure anyone could handle me, so he brought me to TIRR Rescue, a place known for helping unruly dogs. Well, Dad wasn\u2019t sure when he\u2019d be back home, so he asked TIRR Rescue to find me a good home.\n\nI select my dog friends very carefully. Right now, I only hang out with Boomer. I like to talk trash at the fence, but I\u2019m sweet when you get me out. I like to be loved on a little, but I don\u2019t like to be crowded, so I\u2019d do best in a home without younger children. Also, I may be getting older, but I still like to run, so a running partner would be pretty nice!\n\n\nPERSONALITY:\nLuke is a cool dog who just needs a little time to warm up to people.  He likes to bark at the fence, but is sweet when he's around people.  He can be a little intense, so he'd do best in a home without children or cats.  He chooses his dog friends carefully, so a doggie introduction is a must for any potential adopters.",

            "description": "Hey, everyone!  My name is Boomer.  I came to TIRR Rescue from Oklahoma back in 2018.\n\nI had an awesome family.  I was spoiled rotten, usually getting things my way.  Then we had a baby.  Don't get me wrong, I liked the baby.  I just didn't like certain people being around the baby.  One time, when my mom's mom was babysitting, we got into it with each other.  She was worried I was going to hurt the baby (which was dumb; I had issues with her, not the baby) and made my parents get rid of me.\n\nThey brought me to TIRR Rescue to find a new forever home.  I'm a pretty cool dog, but I don't like to feel cornered or trapped.  If you try to be pushy with me, I will snap at you.  I'm a great dog; I just need the right person to come along and adopt me!  If you think you might be that person, be sure to contact my rescue people!\n\n~~~~\n\nPERSONALITY:\nBoomer is a sweet old dog with a bit of a grumpy side.  He doesn't like to be pushed around or feel trapped; he will bite if he feels threatened.  We believe he might have been cornered and hurt at one point and learned that if he exploded, he would be left alone.  He would do best in a home without young children.  He needs adopters who understand his boundaries.  He would do great with an older couple who let him curl up on the couch with them.\n?\n~~~~\n\nTo learn more about Boomer, please visit tirrrescue.org/boomer.",

Ollie loves to be active - he'd make a great walking or running partner! (Of course, a little couch time is great after a run...) Ollie has some challenges... He's reactive to other dogs, can be a little food-aggressive, and needs slow introductions to new people. We're looking for an experienced adopter who's willing to be consistent and work with Ollie to help him become the great dog we know he can be. Are you an active dog-person looking for an independent, yet affectionate companion? Ollie just might be a good fit for you!\n\nIf you'd like to meet him, please contact info@nebraskanokill.org. To fill out an adoption form, go to https://www.nebraskanokill.org/forms/adoption.html. Suggested adoption donation: $250.00\n1/19/21 6:23 PM",

EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs.\n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details. \n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

He came in as a mostly unsocialized boy who was scared to be touched by people and afraid to leave his run.  He has come a long way and now happily goes out in the dog park with our volunteers, plays with toys and loves his walks and treats.  But he can be unpredictable so we are not willing to adopt him to a family with children.  Yoshi's ideal family lives in a quiet home with a fenced yard, has no children, shows patience and is willing to train. \n\nYoshi is a man who knows what he likes and what he doesn't. This floofy ChowChow mix has favorite toys that make him skip and hop like a fox! When he tips the scales into 'goofy' play, you'll find him rolling his face in the grass like it's the best chin scratch he's ever had in his life! \n\nYoshi does not care for being touched or handled which makes finding the right home for him very difficult. Yoshi's family will need to commit to helping him overcome some of his fears by spending the weeks it will take to get to know him here at the shelter and continuing his muzzle and behavior modification training at home.  A Certified Professional Dog Trainer has committed to work alongside Yoshi's shelter family and a Certified Behaviorist to transition Yoshi into a family willing to take on this diamond in the ruff. \n\n",

Charlie is extremely obedient and lives with 6 other Bassets but can be territorial of his owner and space. He would be best in a home as an only dog. He is fine with cats and actually likes to play with them. Charlie loves to ride in cars, go for walks, is housebroken, sits for treats and loves his human. He loves sleeping on dog beds and will move it around to find the perfect napping spot.\nCharlie is house and doggy door trained and loves going on walks.\n\nCharlie does have a slightly twisted front right leg and some shoulder tension. Xrays do not show any kind of injury so perhaps a genetic issue. He is on joint supplements for aid and will need to stay on those to continue to help him.\n\nIf you have the perfect home for Charlie, please fill out an Adoption Application. http://suncoastbassetrescue.org/AdoptionForm.aspx",

As soon as she is ready, we'll be removing her mammary tumors but for now she has a fresh mouth, a great appetite, and nice pep in her step. She was even doing a little old lady run in her foster home! She's an incredible old gal.\n\nYOU CAN SPONSOR ALICE'S CARE IN RESCUE BY CLICKING ON THE SPONSOR BUTTON ON THIS PAGE or DIRECTLY ON THE RESCUE'S WEBSITE: www.onmywayhomerescue.com.  Thank you so very much for caring and supporting our rescue mission!  \n\n\nYou can apply to adopt or foster at http://www.onmywayhomerescue.com/how-to-adopt.html.    \n\n\nQuick Dachshund Facts\nDachshunds are in the hound dog breed group.\nThey\u2019re known for their short legs and long bodies.\nCommon nicknames are: doxies, dachsies, sausage dogs, wiener dogs, and hot dogs.\nPronunciation of the word \u201cdachshund\u201d is DAK-sund and not \u201cdash hound.\u201d\nThere are four sizes: toy dachshund (smallest), miniature dachshund, tweenie, and standard dachshund.\nTheir average weight is under 11 pounds (toy dachshunds and miniature dachshunds),  11 to 16 pounds (tweenies), and 16 to 32 pounds (standard dachshunds).\nTheir average life span is 12 to 15 years.\nThere are three varieties of dachshund fur: smooth or shorthaired; longhaired; and wire-haired.\nThey come in many colors and patterns.\nThey were bred to dig and they will dig holes in your yard if you let them.\nThey have a loud, deep bark that people will assume is coming from a large dog. That makes them great guard dogs!\nThey\u2019re considered clever, intelligent, and mischievous.\nDachshunds are very affectionate. They often bond most with one person and can become clingy, in a cute way.\nThey\u2019re stubborn and notoriously hard to housebreak. Vets and trainer recommend crating them on a schedule to solve this.\nThey\u2019re not easy to train. It takes a lot of patience, and will include a lot of laughter.\nThey\u2019re brave. They show it by barking and sometimes by lunging at other dogs.\nWhen they\u2019re puppies especially, they\u2019ll chew up your shoes, book covers, and other objects.\nDachshunds are prone to becoming overweight. To keep your doxie healthy you\u2019ll need to monitor his food intake carefully and take him on daily walks.\nDachshunds love to jump on high things. But they can also develop herniated or slipped disks because of jumping down. So you need to keep an eye on them and place them on the ground.\nWhen you hold them, you need to give support to their backs with your hand.\nYou should only get a dachshund from responsible breeders and rescue organizations, which you can research in advance on the Internet.",

As soon as she is ready, we'll be removing her mammary tumors but for now she has a fresh mouth, a great appetite, and nice pep in her step. She was even doing a little old lady run in her foster home! She's an incredible old gal.\n\nwww.onmywayhomerescue.com\n\n\nQuick Dachshund Facts\nDachshunds are in the hound dog breed group.\nThey\u2019re known for their short legs and long bodies.\nCommon nicknames are: doxies, dachsies, sausage dogs, wiener dogs, and hot dogs.\nPronunciation of the word \u201cdachshund\u201d is DAK-sund and not \u201cdash hound.\u201d\nThere are four sizes: toy dachshund (smallest), miniature dachshund, tweenie, and standard dachshund.\nTheir average weight is under 11 pounds (toy dachshunds and miniature dachshunds),  11 to 16 pounds (tweenies), and 16 to 32 pounds (standard dachshunds).\nTheir average life span is 12 to 15 years.\nThere are three varieties of dachshund fur: smooth or shorthaired; longhaired; and wire-haired.\nThey come in many colors and patterns.\nThey were bred to dig and they will dig holes in your yard if you let them.\nThey have a loud, deep bark that people will assume is coming from a large dog. That makes them great guard dogs!\nThey\u2019re considered clever, intelligent, and mischievous.\nDachshunds are very affectionate. They often bond most with one person and can become clingy, in a cute way.\nThey\u2019re stubborn and notoriously hard to housebreak. Vets and trainer recommend crating them on a schedule to solve this.\nThey\u2019re not easy to train. It takes a lot of patience, and will include a lot of laughter.\nThey\u2019re brave. They show it by barking and sometimes by lunging at other dogs.\nWhen they\u2019re puppies especially, they\u2019ll chew up your shoes, book covers, and other objects.\nDachshunds are prone to becoming overweight. To keep your doxie healthy you\u2019ll need to monitor his food intake carefully and take him on daily walks.\nDachshunds love to jump on high things. But they can also develop herniated or slipped disks because of jumping down. So you need to keep an eye on them and place them on the ground.\nWhen you hold them, you need to give support to their backs with your hand.\nYou should only get a dachshund from responsible breeders and rescue organizations, which you can research in advance on the Internet.",

Sierra had a rough past and shows what we can best guess is fear problems and some dominance issues. We have worked hard with this girl and she has went through 8 months of intensive training with one of our dog trainers. Sierra is super sweet with her foster dad and loves any sort of interactive play. She loves to give kisses and  despite her size, thinks she is a big lap dog! She does not do well with all dogs so we are looking for a home where she will be an only pet.  It is not recommended that she be with children at this time.",

ALL DOGS LISTED ARE AVAILABLE.\n\n** Please read the bio in its entirety before emailing with questions or submitting an application **\n\nHey everyone! My name is Paco and I'm what foster mom calls a Chi-weenie (Chihuahua/Dachshund). I'm 4 years old and a little guy, approximately 10 lbs.\n\nFoster mom says I'm super snuggly, whatever that means. I know I really like hanging out on the couch with her and I'll lay with my neck on her shoulder when given the chance. I don't like meeting new people because they scare me, but I become really attached to my one special person. For this reason, it's best I don't go out in public places because I may not be nice to the people I meet. I can be a little bit of a resource guarder when it comes to my foster mom, but she says it's easy to manage, so I'll take her word for it.\n\nMy legs may be little but I love being outside and running to my heart's content. They say I'm very special in one way though, I love other dogs, especially the big ones! My favorite dog in my foster home is a very sweet 55 lb Pit Bull. I adore her! I sometimes run underneath her if something scares me. While I don't like being picked up, I listen well.\nI'm neutered, heartworm negative and up to date on vaccines. You can find an adoption application at www.pawprintsnky.com.\n\nIf you have specific needs that aren't addressed in the bio (children in the home, small animals, apartment/condo living, etc) please email to ask if the dog is suitable for the environment before submitting an application. Once the application is submitted, please expect someone to email you with questions and/or provide more information about the dog is we are unsure that the dog may be a good fit.\n\nMost importantly, please be honest! We have many people tell us what they think we want to read, not what's truthful. If there are discrepancies, your application will be denied. It's important for us to place dogs in a home that's suitable. You may be a stellar owner but possibly not a good fit for the dog you were first interested in adopting. We're not trying to offend anyone, we're trying to set everyone up for success. We're a best fit rescue and will verify your vet and personal references.\n\n*Chihuahua/Dachshund\n\n*4 years old\n\n*10 lbs\n\n*Good with cats and dogs (including large dogs)\n\n*Not recommended for a home with children or one where children visit\n\n* Best in a single person home but may adjust to a home with two people\n\n* No homes that share walls with neighbors\n\n* Needs a fenced in yard as he does not do well on walks\n\n*Adopters must live within 2 hours of Florence, KY\n\n*Adoption fee is $200.00",

Happy boy Harrison is eager to win your heart! Harrison was turned over to the police and was on his way to a kill facility if we didn't step up to save him. He has lower lumbar paralysis, meaning he can't use his rear legs. He is also bladder and bowel incontinent, so his bladder needs to be manually expressed 4 plus times a day. His bowel movement release on its own and you can manually speed the process most of the time. Harrison has no idea he is injured, he happily plays fetch and lives each day to the fullest. He is a wonderful companion for someone willing to keep up with his needs and in-home physical therapy. We are looking for that special person to see past his limitations and fall in love with his very deserving spirit. His previous people did get him the spinal surgery but didn't seem to do rehab. Hes been receiving Acupuncture, laser therapy, physical therapy and aqua therapy with a group of specialists who have trained us how to continue his therapy at home. He has also had I-Therm therapy which has helped and we are looking to get a machine for our rescue to continue his rehab and help our other special needs dogs. He shows signs of feeling from his paws and he has positive reactions to therapy. He sometimes uses his legs by showing strength. We are hopeful he will walk with continued home therapy. This absolutely adorable little guy is only two years old and 8 pounds. He has wheels that he can do his zoomies around the house and he travels well in the car, always ready to meet people. We are looking for a home for him who can keep up with his monthly grooming and heartworm prevention as well as daily health care and maintenance. His adoption fee is $200 to go towards his vetting (vaccines, spay/neuter, heartworm/Ehrlichia/Lyme test, fecal test, pre-op blood work, dental cleaning, microchip, and all his therapy/rehab). If you feel you can fulfill Harrison's needs he will drown you with kisses and his fantastic personality! Check his VIDEO PLAYLIST here. Please Like & Follow his FaceBook Page. If you are interested please fill out the adoption application For additional information regarding our adoption process, please check our FAQ's Page. WWW.GETALIFEPETRESCUE.COM\n\n*All dogs in the care of Get a Life Pet Rescue live in loving foster homes while waiting for their perfect match. They don't live in cages or crates (unless there is a medical reason to do so.) They are treated as family pets while in our care. *All dogs in our care are fed premium brand holistic food as well as supplements and vitamins specific to each dog's needs. We don't buy inexpensive bulk dry kibble, our rescues are fed premium wet food diets as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation program to ensure maximum health. * All of our rescues receive complete quality vetting including full dental cleaning with pre-op bloodwork, spay/neuter, vaccines, and grooming. Dogs in need of specialized medicine will be seen by specialists, such as full cardiac workups, ophthalmologist visits, all suspicious lumps, and bumps are biopsied, and every medical need is transparent to potential adopters. *Once you adopt from Get a Life Pet Rescue, you become part of our compassionate family and we are here for you if a problem with your precious dog arises.",

My favorite hobbies include sniffing and napping with my tongue sticking out! I just learned how to play! I never really had any friends before - but that\u2019s all changed since I got some human friends who I love to follow around in the kitchen (sniff sniff!)! Even though I'm deaf that doesn't mean my nose can't hear you grabbing a peanut butter kong for me! I get so happy when I get to hang out with people! My sponsor works on her computer a lot, so I nap by her feet and am perfectly content. My sponsor will pay for my food, my vet visits, and any training I may need.",

However, you would be downright lucky to have this guy as your sidekick!  Poe is a very sweet Catahoula mix, weighing in at about 50 pounds.  Poe is good with people but can sometimes be selective with other dogs.  Proper introductions are very important.  We were told he will go after chickens, he loves them....for Sunday dinner!  He is an intelligent fellow who walks great on lead, knows basic commands, is very food and praise motivated.  He would be very trainable.  It appears that Poe\u2019s previous owners were very neglectful as far as his medical care.  When he came to us, we learned he was heartworm positive.  Poe is on the slow kill method and is doing very well.  He is neutered, up to date on vaccinations and microchipped.  If Poe looks like a good fit for you, please fill out an adoption application at www.humanesocietycitrus.com and for any additional questions please call Karron at 352-586-9699.  The adoption donation for Poe is $100.00",

After being rescued during Hurricane Harvey, he's been so happy and excited about every part of life. Born in 2014, Ducky is the perfect blend of affectionate and independent. He loves spending time with people on walks, and he is a great hiking buddy. During downtime, he is totally content to play with his toys on his own. Ducky can get very excited and jumpy with people he likes, but he can also get overwhelmed and nervous with petting. Ducky has a history of guarding his food, and he has bitten in the past to protect it. He's made significant improvements with all the training he's done at the sanctuary, but his new person or family will need to keep working with him. Once the food bowl is put away, Ducky is the most happy-go-lucky character. If you're looking for a dog who knows how to be the class clown, he would love to meet you.",

After he died I had to stay in my home by myself for a couple of days while they looked for a place for me to go. Don't worry though. I was well taken care of and my human brother came and played with me all the time but I was sad without my dad. I was a spoiled spoiled boy. We did everything together and it was him and I. I would love to have a home similar to that. I would do best as an only dog where I get all of the attention but I could possibly live with another laid back dog. I would just have to meet them and sniff them out. My new humans need to be home more than gone and I must have a fenced yard. I am doggie door trained too. I am 4 1/2 years old and weigh about 40lbs.  My mom  is a Blue Heeler but I get my black and tan color from my unknown dad. If you would like to meet me send an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and they will respond as soon as they can.\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting..neuter, all vaccinations, a heartworm test, deworming, flea prevention and a wellness exam.",

The vet ended up having to amputate all but one toe on that paw.  I hardly even notice it now, though I don\u2019t like to talk about it much.\n\nI love attention and will give lots of affection once I get to know you. I love to play with large sticks, especially if someone throws them for me.  I am a bit of a fence guarder, meaning that I act real tough when someone I don't know comes too close to my fence or gate.\n\nI will need a strong, confident leader who can help me when I get nervous and can handle me when I get too excited while playing and forget how big I am.  I would love to have a yard of my own with lots of trees so I have plenty of sticks to choose from, though going to the park often would be good, too.  If you think you might be my new forever family, be sure to contact my rescue people!\n\n~~~~\n\nPERSONALITY:\nToby is a good ol' boy and is very affectionate with people he knows.  He can play a little rough and doesn't like people in his face, so he'd do best in a home without small children.  He also has a slight foot fetish, so shoes are best worn when around him!\n\n~~~~\n\nTo learn more about Toby, please visit tirrrescue.org/toby.",

I came to TIRR Rescue several years ago with my mom, back when I was teeny tiny.\n\nMom and I were found walking down the middle of the road near a school in Wise County. Mom was dragging a bike cable that she had chewed through to get free, and I was trying my darndest to keep up!\n\nI got adopted once, went home, and went to obedience school and everything. However, they returned me because I scared my German Shepherd brother so badly, he didn't even want to come in the house. It wasn't my fault, though; he was acting up, so I whipped him good. I don't put up with bad behavior...ask Bo!\n\nI\u2019m a really sweet girl, though a little aloof to strangers. While I like people, I really prefer the company of other dogs. I sure would like to be adopted again. It felt nice being in a home with my very own yard. It would be even cooler if someone took both Bo and me home together!\n\nIf you think you might be my forever family, be sure to contact my rescue people!\n\n~~~~\n\nPERSONALITY:\nRadar can be a bit aloof to strangers.  She tends to prefer the company of dogs but likes hanging out with her trusted humans, especially if she can spend some time chilling outside in the sun.  Radar is very obedient and loyal to her family.  If you win her trust, you will have a loyal companion who will have your back for life.\n\n~~~~\n\nTo learn more about Radar, please visit tirrrescue.org/radar.",

A nice lady found me and decided to help me.  She busted me out, cleaned me up, and took me home.  However, her dogs weren't too fond of me, so she brought me to TIRR Rescue, hoping they could help me find an awesome forever home.\n\nI do well with other dogs, especially if they like to play and run.  When I go to my new forever home, it would be nice to have a playful and rambunctious sibling...or a super active family!\n\nI love people - being around them, being loved on by them, and playing with them.  I never met a stranger, and I always love meeting new people!\n\nIf you think you might be my new forever family, be sure to contact my rescue people!\n\n~~~~\n\nPERSONALITY:\nOliver is a great pup who hasn't been deterred or affected by his rough start whatsoever.  He loves to run and play and will need an active family who can help him play or run off his excess energy.  Oliver will also need some basic obedience lessons but would love the extra time spent with his people.\n\n~~~~\n\nTo learn more about Oliver, please visit tirrrescue.org/oliver.",

            "description": "Hey, guys!  My name is Murphy.  I came to TIRR Rescue in the summer of 2018.\n\nI was adopted from TIRR Rescue twice before.  The first time, I got returned because the family didn't realize how high energy I would be.  They just couldn't quite keep up with me.  The second time I got adopted, I got protective of the kids and it kind of scared the parents.  It wasn't anyone's fault; I just wanted to make sure everyone who tried to get near my kids had good intentions.\n\nAnyway, I'm now back at TIRR Rescue waiting for the perfect family; the family that can keep up with my active lifestyle while also understanding and controlling my protective instincts.  I would make a great running buddy or playmate.  While I play really well with kids, I could use a little bit of training, because I sometimes play a little too rough with adults.\n\nI'm a really great guy who just needs a really great forever family!  If you think you could be that family, be sure to talk to my rescue people about meeting me!\n\n~~~~\n\nPERSONALITY:\nMurphy is an awesome dog who just wants to have fun!  He is super energetic and will need a very active family.  He loves kids (the younger, the better; the younger they are, the more energy they have to play with him!), but he can also be very protective of them.  He will need a strong leader who will give him the training he needs to control his protective instinct.  It is important to remember that Murphy will bit anyone he thinks is a threat to his kids, even if those people are family members.\n\n~~~~\n\nTo learn more about Murphy, please visit tirrrescue.org/murphy.",

I have been with TIRR Rescue since 2017.\n \nI came to TIRR Rescue when some nice people at the power plant where I was dumped saved me from being a stray. They wanted to make sure I went to a nice home, so they picked me up and sent me to a rescue to find a forever home.\n \nI\u2019m ok with other dogs, especially my pal Penny, but I just really love hanging out with people. When I get super excited around people, I do a little dance where I hold one paw in the air and wiggle my butt really fast! I will play with you, go walking with you, or just chill on the couch with you while you love on me. Honestly, chilling is a favorite pastime of mine.

            "description": "Hello, everyone! My name is Sapphire. I came to TIRR Rescue in 2014 as a little pup.\n\nI was sitting in a shelter when a nice person sent a picture of me to TIRR Rescue. They thought I was pretty awesome looking, with my bright blue eyes and pointy ears. They picked me up and brought me to the ranch as soon as they could.\n\nNow, I'm a pretty anxious dog. I like hanging out with my pack and playing with a couple of the dogs, but I get nervous and slightly withdrawn around strangers. I will need a family who will respect that and have the patience to work with me on being more confident.\n\nIf you really want to see me open up, though, you should take me jogging. I love to jog! The fastest way to become my friend is to take me for a run. I don't even care where we go running, just so long as we're moving. Speaking of which, we have plenty of space for a nice volunteer or future adopter to take me jogging around the ranch!\n\nI\u2019m sweet, beautiful girl who just wants my own family, yard, and doghouse. If you think you might be my forever family, be sure to contact my rescue people!\n\n~~~~\n\nPERSONALITY:\nSapphire is a sweet, fun girl.  She is energetic and loves to go for a run. She will do anything to please her people.  Sapphire can get scared when she is uncomfortable, so she will need a strong, confident leader she can trust.\n\n~~~~\n\nTo learn more about Sapphire, please visit tirrrescue.org/sapphire.",

Since he is a biter  he needs an experienced owner and will only be adopted to a family who understands biters. Chico loves to play with his toys, run around with his doggy friends, and go on car rides. Chico is a very passionate and emotional dog with a huge personality. \nChico has had a rough life and can get a bit crabby. When this happens he will give a warning sign that he has had enough and if he is still pushed he will growl and may bite. He needs a experienced owner that can help him through this. If you are interested in Chico please fill out a adoption application for consideration on our website. \nwww.cubbyscrusade.org\n",

She is a bit anxious around strangers in her home, but not on walks, so a calm quiet home would be perfect. Dakota is very well trained and lives to please. House trained and crate trained and ready for her forever family! Dakota is picky when it comes to dog friends but behaves well around others. A home as the only pet would be ideal.

            "description": "Through no fault of her own Jolene needs a new forever home.  The owner, a friend of DFW Collie Rescue, adopted Jolene from an animal shelter when she was around 4 months old and had been picked up as a stray, she is now around 2 years old.  She probably has cattle dog and terrier in her, but truly is a Heinz 57.\n\nJolene is a happy little dog weighing about 40 lbs.  She gets along with big and medium size dogs, but has not been around little dogs on a regular basis, but will do best as an only dog. She can show her terrier side at times. Jolene will not come in the house, but does sleep in a crate at night. She does not enjoy riding but enjoys running and exploring in the fields and pasture.  She has been around cows and equine and has no interest in them and does not chase them,\n\nIt is the owner's opinion that she was abused in some way in her young life since she does cower if a hand is raised or voice is raised in anger.  She has always been somewhat afraid of her owner but does well with females and needs a female owner.  She wants attention and likes to be petted; but she is a little shy with new people and has not been around children.\n\nJolene is spayed, current on shots, on heartworm preventive, and microchipped.  She does well with having her toenails clipped and having a bath. Jolene will be a great companion and will be happy following you around on the farm or ranch.   She will do best with a woman.\n\nDFW Collie Rescue will be adopting Jolene for the owner.  Application and terms of adoption can be found at www.dfwcollierescue.org.The application and terms of adoption are geared toward collie, but are appilcable to any breed.  A home visit is required (virtual can be arranged) and references contacted after the application and terms of adoption are received..A small adoption fee is required.  Please let Jolene entertain you.  If further info is needed email dfwcollierescue@gmail.com or call or text 214-668-5794.",

If you would rather hang out on the couch all day, she\u2019d be up for that too! Gracie is really easy going and not hard to please. \n\nThis pretty girl had multiple mast cell tumors removed while in our care. While they are always removed with clear margins and come back low grade, it\u2019s important that an adopter stay vigilant if / when new masses pop up. The key to keeping her healthy for as long as possible will be early detection and removal. You will also need to continue tending to her ongoing allergies. She currently receives Cytopoint injections and takes a daily medication to help with her itching. \n\nGracies ideal home is one with no other pets. She has attended a professional group training class and learned a lot, which her foster continues to build on at home. Her adopter will need to continue working with her overreaction and leash frustration regarding seeing other dogs while on walks. \n\nGracie is very well mannered in the home and is fully house and crate trained. She enjoys hanging out with her foster mom (she is an under the cover type of snuggle bug) and taking walks. She is quiet and is non destructive. \n\nIf you\u2019d like to open your home to this very deserving senior gal, please apply at www.mercysdoorpetrescue.org. Gracies adoption fee is $100, and she has been spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, HW- and is on monthly flea/tick/HW prevention.",

She had been confined to a small kennel for 3 days without food or water. She was emaciated and couldn\u2019t even stand due to malnutrition and dehydration. Her amazing foster mom nursed her back to health and has loved Fiona as her own while waiting for a forever home to come along. \n\nFiona is approximately 3 year old, fixed, UTD on shots, and microchipped. She would do best in a home with a male dog her size or larger or as an only dog. Fenced yard REQUIRED. Fiona would do best in a home with kids 8+ years old.\n\nFrom Fiona\u2019s foster mom:\n\"...Fiona is crate trained, house trained, knows basic obedience & loves kids. She is fearful of men but has come a long way & is a total love when she trusts you. She is dog selective. Fiona is a sweet girl that just needs a home with a little patience...\" \n\nwww.facebook.com/loxanimalrescuecomm\n",

He needs time to get comfortable in new places and with new people, but he will accept treats and warm up quickly. He is not yet comfortable being petted or handled by people, but he loves doing activities with other dogs and learning from them. Smokey absolutely adores other dogs here at the Sanctuary. He is very active and playful when he's around them, and they help him build his confidence. \nSmokey was born in 2014 and came to Best Friends from a humane society in Idaho. He can jump fences, so he is considered a flight risk. In a former foster home, he was a bit of an escape artist, so he will need a home with a secure enclosure and someone with a watchful eye. At the Sanctuary, he is working on crate training, getting into and riding in a car and getting more comfortable with new places. He already walks well on a leash.\nSmokey will need some time to adjust to a new home, but with time and patience he will make a wonderful companion.",

He is shy and fearful with strangers, but once he knows you, he will always greet you with a smile and gaze at you in a loving way. He can be a little quirky, and his caregivers say he is like a wiggly cat in a dog's body, but that's what makes him so endearing.\nBorn in 2013, Sundance came to the Sanctuary from a Best Friends Network Partner in Indiana. He is incredibly smart and knows what he wants and doesn't want. He will guard food and is not comfortable with strangers entering his room or yard if he doesn't know them so he would do better meeting them outside of his area first. He does not enjoy a lot of handling, especially by new people. He will accept occasional pets but prefers to just do a happy dance around you. \nWhen it comes to other dogs, Sundance can be picky and seems to prefer females. He is an independent spirit who does great at entertaining himself, but would make a great addition to your home if you are looking for a dog who dances to his own beat!",

He used to be very nervous and would bark at everyone who entered his room. He's made amazing progress since coming to Dogtown, and he now greets everyone with a smile and a full body wiggle. He's very mellow and low key and loves snuggling and getting attention. Born in 2015, Barat once lived in a home where he spent most of his time outside. Now that he's loved and cared for, he's thriving. He does still have anxiety, which can make him a flight risk, and he's attempted to escape from his yard at the Sanctuary by trying to chew through fences and bend gates open. He does a lot better when people he's comfortable with are around, but he'll need to find a home where he can be in a secure place when his people aren't home. Barat can be picky with his dog friends and will guard crates and food from other dogs. He's also shown aggression toward cats and can't live with them. At Dogtown, Barat continues to work on his social skills with people and on getting comfortable in new places and in the car. He would love to be in a home where he can truly be part of the family.",

He loves to play with stuffed toys and roll around in the grass. He's also content to lay on his bed or by your feet while you are hanging out. He's a bit of a comedian and will certainly make you laugh. He's a lot of fun to cuddle and pet. He loves to go on car rides and sits nicely watching the world go by. He's crate trained, housetrained and walks nicely on a leash. \n\nBuddha was born in 2010 and came to Best Friends from a shelter in Los Angeles. He has anxiety and cannot live with other animals as he has shown aggression toward them in the past. He can be very reactive to other dogs and will bark, whine, jump or potentially try to escape to get to them. He can also be reactive towards people through a barrier like a door or fence if he does not know them. At Dogtown, Buddha is working on a training plan to help him be less reactive towards dogs. He is also working on calm greetings when people enter his space. The training plan and ongoing support would be provided to his new home. Buddha is on some prescription medications that help him be calmer. He had orthopedic surgery in 2018 and still takes medication for that. Buddha would be the perfect companion for someone who wants a single pet and who is willing to keep working on his training.",

Originally rescued from Hurricane Harvey in Houston, Texas, Conan went to two other rescue organizations before coming to Best Friends for help with various medical needs. Conan really needed help getting his allergies under control, and with a lot of hard work and structure, he's finally on the upswing. He is very food motivated and ready to learn new tricks or practice nose work, a fun search and scenting sport. He does tend to shred toys and eat them, so hard toys and chews are best for him. He is crate trained, so he is fine with hanging out in a crate when he is unattended or for nap time.",

It doesn't take him long to start to recognize you and once he does, he will seek out attention and get very excited to \"see\" you. \nBorn is 2010, he has a lot of energy for a senior dog, so he would do best in a calm environment. During times of high excitement, he gets worked up around other dogs, but it is easy to get him to come back when he hears your voice. His blindness comes from being diabetic so he would need to take medication and insulin to keep it under control. \nHe has learned how to live without his vision and will memorize his environment and respond to cues from caregivers to change direction when he is about to bump into an obstacle. He has lived with other dogs in his past, but because of his age and blindness he would do better living a single life. \nPudge is a very routine-oriented dog, so if you're someone who likes to keep a regimented schedule, he'll make a great sidekick.",

She does calm down nicely in quiet environments and is very easygoing on car rides. Josie loves people and is a fan favorite for the tours visiting Dogtown.",

Never one to turn down a meandering stroll or a golf cart ride across Dogtown, Cliff truly does like to stop and smell the roses (ok, maybe sagebrush). Cliff also enjoys very sturdy toys and relishes his \"toy time\" with volunteers. Cliff has had several play dates here at the sanctuary and seems to prefer female dogs. Because Cliff is a low-energy guy, he'd be the perfect dog for someone who wouldn't mind hanging out on the couch after taking a leisurely walk. \n\nCliff has a generous sponsor who will cover his adoption costs.",

He's done well with all the dogs he's met at the Sanctuary. \nAt Dogtown, he's working on building relationships with his human friends and has come a long way toward getting comfortable with people who take the extra time with him.

Gilmore loves food, and he loves to cuddle up in bedding and blankets. Gilmore was born in 2012 and came to Best Friends from a No More Homeless Pets Network Partner shelter. At the Sanctuary, he loves clicker training and is learning hand feeding as well as how to accept human touch and handling. Gilmore has a quiet nature and would do best in a calm and quiet home. He loves sun bathing outside. He'll also need a home that has a secure yard.",

He was a little unsure of all the changes and new people at first, but has adapted well and is now more comfortable making new friends. Phantom still tends to be a bit on the independent side, so when his playful and cuddly side comes out it's extra special! \nLike many Huskies, Phantom can be quite the expressive talker when he's in the mood or when he gets excited. He likes to get all his neighbors involved in big group howl sessions. He's an athletic dog who loves to go for hikes and would be a great adventure buddy. He also enjoys car rides and exploring new places. He would benefit from continued training in a home as he can take time getting to know new people and when excited he can express some jumpy/mouthy behavior. An adult only home would be best for Phantom. One of his favorite things is to explore the big fenced in dog park where he gets to be off-leash.",

Domineo is eager to work and learn new things - especially if there's a treat reward involved. In a home, he would definitely benefit from a secure fenced-in yard, as he has a lot of extra energy to burn. He will be happy to entertain you with his antics while playing with his favorite toy, the jolly ball. He would also love to go on long walks or hikes where he can use his terrier nose to sniff and explore his surroundings. He can be very affectionate once you're one of his friends, but he does have a history of handling and guarding issues from a previous home, so we have a special process to introduce him to new people. Domineo has had some dog friends, but due to his guarding, he would likely do best as the only pet in your home. Domineo is looking for a person who will be committed to setting him up for success in a home. If you'd be willing to work with this high-spirited guy, he would love to meet you too!",

Here at the Sanctuary, she is gaining confidence daily and is making great progress in learning to trust people. She enjoys going on walks, especially if her doggie roommate comes along. She has learned that making eye contact with Dogtown volunteers means that she gets treats, so during most of her walks she will look up at you eager for treats. Clara still doesn't enjoy too much petting, but she will touch her nose to people's hands. At Dogtown, she has learned that having more dog friends is a good thing, and she does great with introductions to other dogs. She enjoys their company and really comes out of her shell with a confident canine friend around. She would do best in a home with another dog who can be a role model for her, but she cannot live with cats. Because she is still shy and fearful with people and can jump fences, she is considered a flight risk. Clara will need to find a home with a person or family who can keep her secure and keep helping her build her confidence. Born in 2015, she has a lot of potential to grow and blossom.",

He loves to do training and really enjoys doing activities where he can use his mind. Peter is perfect on a leash and loves walking with people. He also enjoys car rides and playing with toys. \nBorn in 2015, Peter is an active dog, but he doesn't have to be doing something constantly. He's a sunbather who really likes being outside and lounging around with people. He likes to remind everyone of his hound dog heritage by baying a big hello as people walk by. Peter does have some anxiety, especially when he is left alone. He's been known to climb a six-foot fence and trees to escape a yard or enclosure. He lost his previous home because he kept escaping and wandering around the neighborhood. He'll need to find a home where he can be kept safe and secure at all times.",

Ghostrider's favorite activities include hanging out in the sun with his toys or lounging around inside with his humans, being a big couch potato. He is a master at cuddling, loves car rides, walks and going out for adventures. \n\nGhostrider would do best in a home where he'll get lots of love and attention, because he tends to get a little anxious when left alone. On his leash, he'll will pull when he sees wildlife, so he'll need a strong person to walk him or live in an environment without lots of wildlife. At home, he'll need a yard with a secure fence. Although he can have doggie friends, he would do best as the king of a castle with no other animals. Once you meet him, you will only have eyes for him anyway!",

A rescue organization took them in, and they later came to Best Friends. Born in 2016, Kit has a neurological condition that causes her to struggle to walk and to maintain her balance. The cause of her neurological condition is unknown, and in many ways she is very much like a normal puppy. She is sweet and happy and has an excellent nose. \nAlthough a little feisty at first, Kit loves her dog friends. She does nose work (a fun search and scenting sport) in her room, and she loves the snow. The biggest challenge in a home will be ensuring that she can safely move around. Also, she is not housebroken and she cannot do stairs or a doggy door. \nKit will need to find a person or a family who can make accommodations for her while loving her just as she is. Kit has a generous sponsor who will cover the cost of her adoption fee.",

He is a happy, fun pup who loves other dogs, playing in the snow and taking a daily spin in his specially-designed cart. He has an excellent nose and enjoys doing nose work (a search and scenting sport). The biggest challenge in a home will be ensuring that he can safely move around. Also, he is not housetrained, and he can't do stairs or a doggy door. Caboodle will need to find a person or a family who can make accommodations for him while loving him just as he is. \n\nCaboodle has a generous sponsor who will cover his adoption fee.",

She loves to be around people and to lean in for cuddles and pets, and it doesn't take her long to get attached. She loves to play with people too. At the dog park, she would rather follow the person she's with than to explore the park on her own. \nTrinity walks great on a leash and rides nicely in the car. She responds well to positive reinforcement and is quite smart. Although she can be slightly nervous when new people enter her space, she does greet people well. \nTrinity was born in 2014. Due to a history of aggression toward other dogs, she should be a single dog in a home with no other animals, including cats. She already knows basic training cues such as 'sit' and 'down' and is doing training with Dogtown caregivers to reduce her reactivity to other dogs while on walks. She's also working on crate training and muzzle training. Currently, she eats a prescription diet and takes medication for an enlarged heart. \nTrinity will be a great companion in a home where she can someone's one and only. Trinity has a generous sponsor who has covered her adoption fee.",

She also enjoys going for walks and showing off on the agility course. On car rides Alice prefers to ride in the passenger seat and paws at the driver for petting the entire time, but she can also ride nicely in the backseat if you'd prefer. She is very food motivated and relishes solving food puzzles and working on frozen Kongs. She would love to find a gentle person who will earn her trust and build her confidence. Alice can be picky with her dog friends and would need to meet any dogs before going home with them or be the only dog in her new home. Alice has come a long way from when she first arrived in Dogtown several years ago and was nervous about meeting new people. She now meets people with confidence, although she should meet everyone in the family before she goes home. Once Alice trusts a person she's super snuggly and affectionate, and she has a generous sponsor who will pay her adoption fee.",

            "description": "Skelly came to Best Friends as a puppy mom. Over time, Skelly has made a lot of progress at the sanctuary. When she arrived she had a hard time trusting anyone to touch her, let alone leash her. Now she trusts her caregivers enough to let them leash her up and take her for walks on the trails, which she loves. She is starting to explore new places such as Dogtown's indoor agility area and the offices in Dogtown headquarters, where she can experience a more home-like environment. \nA good way to build trust with Skelly is through hand feeding her meals. She is still too nervous to ride in a car, but she is working on it. She will sometimes eat her meals near a car, which helps her to see that it's not so scary. She also is working on crate training. One of Skelly's favorite things is to visit our one acre dog park where she can run and explore in a safe way. She oftentimes runs off and explores and later comes back to follow her caregiver around and get treats. \nBecause she is still very nervous during medical handling and grooming, Skelly is trained to wear a muzzle during these appointments. She does allow her trusted people to handle her and examine her as needed. \nSkelly has play dates with other dogs at the Sanctuary, and she has been easygoing with all the dogs she's met. She's also been a good walking buddy for other dogs. She does tend to be a little sensitive and will squeal sometimes if a dog is too rough, so she should live with dogs who understand that and won't scare her. Although she can be hand fed by those she trusts, Skelly does guard food bowls from people. She has learned to trade them for other items she wants, like treats. She can also be territorial if she doesn't know a person and will protect her space, including her beds and toys. \nSkelly is looking for a person or family who will take the time to earn her trust and not rush her. A home with a friendly dog would also help her adjust.",

He can be pretty picky with his doggie friends, and it's best for him to steer clear of small dogs and cats. He is looking for an understanding person who is willing to spend lots of time with him and help him feel safe. \nIf you'd like to be there for Maxx, he would love to meet you.",

In his younger years Sherman was a bit of a bull in a china shop, but he's mellowed into a wonderful companion. \nWhoever came up with the phrase, \"You can't teach an old dog new tricks\" surely has not met Sherman. This old man LOVES learning new things! Sherman's favorite things in life include (very) leisurely strolls, figuring out new food puzzles, and getting butt scratches. He can be a little picky with his dog friends but once he has a friend, they're a friend for life. \nSherman also has something he's a bit embarrassed about...he's afraid of indoor floors! We've worked very hard on this, and he promises he'll learn to be comfortable with any type of flooring you have in your home. We hope someone sees the same specialness in Sherman that we do- he's one of a kind.",

He helps give her a lot of confidence, and she is more willing to try new things if he's with her. Cordelia was born in 2012. She is really smart and excels at training - especially when food is involved. She's become a rock star at agility at the Sanctuary. Because Cordelia is a very shy dog, she can be shutdown and extremely nervous when out of her comfort zone. She doesn't like being touched by people and probably never will be comfortable with that. Cordelia would do best in a relaxed, structured home with a very patient person or family who understands her personality and accepts her for who she is. A home without many visitors would be best. When there are visitors, she would be most comfortable staying in a quiet room so she won't be forced to socialize. She'll also need a confident dog buddy who will be a good role model for her.",

She can be apprehensive about certain things, is incredibly strong on a leash, and may try to chase large vehicles. The DogTown Caregivers recognized how smart she is and worked with her on LAT (Look At That) training and name recognition to reduce her reactivity. She also has great manners and a desire to please her person. If you think you can give Lana the love, support, and guidance she needs, she'd be thrilled to meet you.",

            "description": "It takes time to get to know him, but once you're in his inner circle, Sargeant Simon is a sweet and goofy boy. Born in 2012, he's wiggly and playful like a puppy and loves a good game of fetch or tug-of-war. Simon is also very smart. He excels at training and knows sit, down, shake, bow, pick up, fetch and touch (where he'll touch his nose to your hand on cue). He's crate and muzzle trained and has excellent leash skills. He'll walk calmly right next to you and does not pull. \nSargeant Simon has a fear of strangers. He can be reactive toward people he doesn't know, especially when he is behind a gate or other type of barrier. He needs slow introductions in order to be successful. Simon is also picky with his doggie friends, but he is able to have play dates at the Sanctuary with those he likes. \nHe is on medication for minor pain but is otherwise healthy. If you have the time and patience to show Simon you want to be his best friend, he would love to have you in his life.",

Once he is comfortable, he turns into a very loving, cuddly and playful dog. He loves training and is very motivated to learn. He also loves to wrestle and play with his squeaky toys.

He loves to snuggle, play, and receive belly rubs, and he tries really hard whenever he's learning anything new. Although he has degenerative joint disease, medications and supplements as well as hydrotherapy and chiropractic appointments keep him feeling his best. At times he can tire quickly but he's able to stay active doing agility, swimming, walks on the trails, playing with toys, and hanging out with his doggie friends. He loves car rides and bathing in the sun. Holy Moly is very smart and has learned many training cues. He is an incredibly sweet boy, and he'd love to be your companion.",

He is famous for turning everything in the world around him into a toy whether it's a stick or a rock. He loves the water and one of his favorite things is to dive to the bottom of a pool or a creek and fish out a rock to play with. He is a mature dog who never stopped being a puppy, but is old enough to appreciate his down time as well. He is full of life with a big personality and lights up when he sees people he knows, his little stubby tail wagging a mile a minute. His love of toys can lead to some guarding issues, but he will happily trade for a new one and it can be easily managed. He has learned to appreciate the simple things in life and walks like a perfect gentleman on leash. He is looking for a home with someone who knows how to have fun, but also wants an older dog who is also happy to entertain himself. Gorgeous George is definitely one of a kind and just wants a chance to share his big, silly personality with someone special.",

He would love a home where he can have the space to relax, but where his people are never too far away. \nIf you're looking for a buddy who likes to stop and sniff the flowers, then Milo might be the guy for you!",

            "description": "CB was a puppy when she arrived at the Sanctuary in 2010. She came from a rescue in Arizona. CB loves everyone, though she tends to be a bit exuberant with both people and dogs. When she gets over excited and becomes jumpy/mouth, she has learned the verbal cue \"down\". CB absolutely loves her crate and this can also be used as a training tool. While in her crate she enjoys either a Nylabone, frozen Kong or an afternoon siesta. She has a great heart and will jump through hoops to show you (yes she can literally jump through a hula hoop). CB is a sweet girl when she's calm and collected. She loves belly rubs and playing with toys. She can also be great with other dogs as long as they can tolerate her rough play style. Could you be the right match for her?",

            "description": "Kaeli is shy with strangers, and it takes some time for her to get comfortable with them. At Dogtown she has a special routine to follow when being introduced to a new person. Once she gets to know people, she absolutely loves them. Sometimes she wants to be close to you, getting lots of attention, and other times she would just prefer to hang out and do her own thing. \nShe loves walks and turns them into casual strolls, because she loves to take in all the sights and smells at her own pace. She really loves new toys and will show them off by getting the 'zoomies' and racing around her yard. Kaeli will jump fences so she'll need a home with a secure enclosure and a person who can keep her safe. \nBorn in 2010, Kaeli was born in Iran, where her beautiful dark coat was bleached blonde because of a superstition about black dogs. She is on prescription medication for joint pain and is doing hydrotherapy at the Sanctuary. Though the treatments keep her comfortable, she can be sensitive for handling, especially if she hasn't had a chance to get to know someone yet. \nKaeli will need an understanding home, because she has bitten in the past when she was pushed out of her comfort zone too quickly. She has also shown aggression toward other dogs and cannot live with them. Kaeli can be reactive towards other dogs when on leash and in the car, though she can sometimes be distracted with high value treats. She would do best in a laid back home with a consistent routine. Kaeli would love a home with a big yard to run around in, or sunbathe in, depending on her mood. \nIn the right home and with a patient and understanding person, Kaeli will make a wonderful companion.",

His favorite things in life include snuggles and belly rubs. He also loves food puzzles and chew toys. \nRoady can be picky with his doggie friends, and it takes him a while to feel comfortable even with the right ones, so it'd probably be best for him to be an only dog in a home. \nRoady was born in 2010. He was found as a stray before he came to Best Friends and is eager to find a forever home. \nRoady thrives in a home environment and is looking for somewhere to spend his golden years.

He is super smart and loves training. Thor will quickly show you his array of tricks he knows, including high five, down, shake, touch, and is always wanting to learn more! \nBorn in 2009, he still has lots of life and love to give. Thor does prefer to live with female doggie friends. Thor came to Best Friends from a shelter in New Mexico. He's been working hard with Dogtown caregivers and trainers and is ready to find a home of his own.",

She loves to play with toys and is good with most dogs.\n\nBunny is sensitive and needs someone who is patient and willing to earn her trust. She would make a great companion for someone with a reliable routine. Once she is comfortable with you, she gets very happy and excited to see you. She will even love getting pets! Since Bunny takes some time to make new friends, she does require adopters to come to the Sanctuary and meet her.\n\nWe would love for this sweet senior dog to find her forever home. Come and meet this wonderful girl, we know you will fall in love! She even has a generous sponsor who has covered her adoption fee!",

All we know is that he wandered up to a man's house one day, and since the man couldn't keep him, he's now at Best Friends.\n\nAbbott is an Australian cattle dog mix, complete with a little nubbin tail. He loves romping with other dogs, and playing with his toys. Abbott is all wags and wiggles when he hears his friends call out his name. He'll even lean in for hugs and belly rubs!

Luckily, she trekked out to Best Friends here in Kanab, Utah, where her real personality is peeking through. She can act shy at first, but once she gets to know you with treats and a walk, she's warm and inviting. \nWinter does a happy wiggle dance whenever she sees her friends. Winter loves people, and if you have other dogs, that would be wonderful. She's great with them! Winter also loves her walks and loves to play in water. \nAll Winter wants is a forever home with someone to love. Winter has a generous sponsor who will cover her adoption fee.",

Maybe it's the way he carries himself, or his sharp mind, or maybe how he makes each of his people feel so special when you're with him. \nTarlton is a super smart dude who loves to learn new things and has lots of tricks in his arsenal that he loves to show off, like \"roll over, \"twirl, or \"wave. He's a top notch cuddler and although he's quite a large dog, he sometimes forgets and thinks he's a lap dog. He'll cover you in slobbery kisses and quickly roll over for belly rubs. \nTarlton is young at heart, and he doesn't seem to let his old age bother him, so hopefully it won't bother you either! \nAs part of our \"Single & Loving It\" adoption special, Tarlton qualifies for a waived adoption fee! \"Single & Loving It\" pets do best as the only dog in their new home.",

This guy absolutely loves car rides, preferably when he gets to ride up front so you can scratch his chest as you go. His curious and inquisitive nature make him the perfect companion for any adventure, especially to places where he can smell new smells and maybe munch on some grass. Chaplin's silly, goofy side really comes out when he is comfortable, and he can be quite a ham! This sweet senior has been waiting a long time for his forever home, so don't wait, inquire today!",

He is being listed as a courtesy to get more exposure. You will need to contact his current owner if you are interested in this boy. Tank came to me as a rescue 2 & 1/2 years ago. He wasn't fixed and was in very bad shape and really wasn't trying to keep him. Well over time he quickly won my heart and I hoped that he would over come his issues with men and not being afraid of everything. Well the past 9 months it's been very difficult to walk him without him going after things people and other animals. He hadn't attack anyone or animals but I'm unable to breath and dealing with my own medical issues and it's gotten to the point where I'm feeling like I'm having a heart attack with his outbursts and pulling and dragging me and stuff. It's to much to handle.Last owner was beatibnTtank in his two door garages with boxes and junk surroundings him where he couldn't move and owner wasn't feeding him he was weighting 79lbs at the time of rescue. Doesn't care for men, for obvious reasons, Woman he picks and choose and he doesn't do will with newborns baby toddlers older children he so so.Doesn't like feet handled, but everywhere else is fine. Growls at kids when has toys/food not adults. Does not like men, other dogs or cats. Tank is very independent does well with a woman that has patience Tank enjoys walks very will behaved in the home. Tank has been through the ringer and I feel like I did him an injustice for keeping him as long as I did and I thought for sure that he would camm down but he has become more and more jumpy at other dogs and pushing myself to keeping him from biting people and animals that I can't hardly breath and I feel really guilty about all of this, as my apprehensions may be causing his behavior.If you are interested in giving this boy a home where you can help him overcome his past plesase contact:Tank is located in Everett, WASamanthaMartinez Home Phone: 2068413996 Cell Phone: 2068413996 Email: samanthamartinez01@yahoo.com",

She likes other dogs. She has a high prey drive so do not recommend cats or other small animals. Though she's still afraid of humans she wants to be called in the home so she can cuddle on the couch or bed. If you are walking around she watches but as soon as you sit/lay down she wants to be right next to you. She's potty trained and uses the pet door to go out but will not come into the house unless invited. She understands she can come through the pet door to come in but the house invite us so important to her. She's really a loving girl, just needS a family that understands she's still learning about humans. She's a real treat to have around.\n\nI am living in a San Antonio Pets Alive! foster home. By adopting me, you not only give me a new leash on life; you also save the life of an additional pet who can be rescued from euthanasia and placed in foster care. If you are interested in adopting me, please email adopt@sanantoniopetsalive.org with my name and ID#. Please allow up to 24 hours to respond, as all fosters work on a volunteer basis.

            "description": "Kaylo is a loving 60 pound 4 year old bull terrier/american bulldog mix. Poor Kaylo came to our rescue after her owner went to jail and left her and her very young puppies alone to fend for themselves. She really enjoys playing chase and with toys but she also loves to go on walks and explore. Her favorite thing is to spend time with her family. In the evening she loves to hop up on the couch and cuddle. She has learned sit, stay, and paw and has been attending training classes with her foster to help socialize and gain confidence when around other dogs. Kaylo does wonderful with kids both young and older and enjoys meeting the neighborhood kids on her walks. Kaylo loves people so much and prefers not to have to share them with other pets so a home with no other pets would make her the happiest. Don\u2019t worry, she has enough love of her own to pass around!! Kaylo is house-trained and can be left alone while her fosters are at work. We would love for her new family to have a fenced in yard. If you are interested in adopting, please apply at digsk9.org. Kaylo\u2019s adoption fee is $275.\n\nThis dog is up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, and spayed/neutered. Please note that we are unable to hold dogs for any reason including moves and vacations. Once approved for adoption we require the adopter to complete the adoption and take ownership of their new companion. \n\n**We do our best to accurately represent the breeds of each pet. However, the breeds listed have not been verified via a DNA test. They are chosen based on the appearance and characteristics of the pet at the time of listing.",

            "description": "Howie is looking for his forever home. He is an 8 year old, neutered male Shiba Inu mix. We believe Howie had a rough life at one time and because of this he is wary of strangers. He takes a while to warm up to someone before he feels comfortable with them. Once he trusts you he is an affectionate dog who craves attention. Howie needs a calm home. He is vocal so he should not go to a condo or apartment. Howie has done well with other dogs his own size but appears defensive with larger dogs. Can you give him the forever home he is looking for? \n\nIf you wish to be considered for this animal, please download an application at http://fallstonanimalrescue.org/adopt/ or email fallstonrescue@aol.com to request one. It can take up to 2 weeks to process an application; we suggest following up by email on the status if you have not received a reply within 3-5 days. We are an all-volunteer based rescue and we ask for your patience if we are slow to respond. \n\nPlease understand that we fit the dog with the home we feel is best suited and will accept multiple applications on one dog. We have strict requirements for families with children under 10 since many of our dogs are grumpy and may not do well with children. Some dogs will have fence requirements, while others may not.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment and it is our duty to do our very best to place them correctly the first time around. We do not take the adoption process lightly. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!\n",

            "description": "Roxy is a fun and spunky 9 year old pup, who is very young at heart.  She has both the energy of a younger dog, and the maturity to tone things down when needed. She is a wonderful walking and running partner, but she also is just as happy to dial things down to relax and snuggle.  \n\nShe is fully house trained with wonderful house manners.  She doesn\u2019t chew on anything nor is destructive.   She loves sleeping in her open crate during the day, and curls up in bed at night.  She is great with humans of all ages, and loves attention.  She is a kissing machine!  \nRoxy doesn\u2019t like other dogs and is leery and timid with cats. She would be happiest being the only pet. \n \nShe has lots of love to give and would love to be the queen pup of your family. \nRoxy is a smart and spunky little gal. She loves people and being outside in the sun. Roxy has a lot of good energy and is young at heart. She loves giving kisses! She does not chew up items nor is she destructive. She has been through training and has worked with a behaviorist. \n\nIf you feel your home might be the right place for such a great dog - the place to start is with the adoption application found at www.dfwrescueme.org/adopt. Once submitted, the foster will contact you promptly to tell you more and to arrange a time to meet!\n\nThe adoption fee for all of our dogs is $250.00, which includes their vaccinations and spay/neuter.\n\nRoxy is participating in the DFW Rescue Me Guest Dog Program, so ongoing care and custody are provided by their foster, not by DFWRM.",

            "description": "Binksy is a cuddly and playful senior gentleman with a lot of love left to give. He is blind from cataracts but he quickly learned his way around his foster home. He can even find his way from the back door, to the bedroom, and up the doggie steps to nap on the bed all on his own. It's adorable when he puts his little nose on the floor and moves slowly through the house. Binksy had all but 3 of his teeth pulled by SAAP's vet so he needs soft food from now on. When Binsky came to SAAP his foster noticed that his stomach was swollen and hard. He had a large cyst on one kidney so that kidney was not working and was removed. Having one kidney and being blind doesn't slow this sweet boy down much. It's obvious that someone in his past loved him and took good care of him since he's a chunky, happy little guy at 7.1 pounds. Binksy forever home should be a calm home without small children or other dogs where he can spend his golden years being someone's cherished baby boy.\n\nAll SAAP animals are vet checked, UTD on vaccines, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, and given flea and heartworm preventative as age appropriate.\n\nOur website is: http://www.adoptastray.com/\n\nTo check if this animal is still available visit our master pet list on our website at:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/adoptable-animals/\n\nHave questions:\nPlease email us at saap@adoptastray.com for more information about this animal or to answer any questions you may have. You may also contact us at (859)391-1234.\n\nCompleting the online application when you find an animal you are interested in speeds up the adoption process. We can hold your application on file for a period of time if you are still looking for that perfect new family member.\n\nTHE APPLICATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS LINK:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/dog-adoption-application/\n\nINTERESTED IN FOSTERING:\nWe welcome your interest and ask that you complete our on-line foster application:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/foster-application/",

I'm open for a meet and greet date and definitely hoping we can have a long term relationship. Here's what I am looking for in humans: highly responsible, sometimes active/sometimes cuddling on the couch, a house with a fenced yard, and lots of car rides. I'm 100% housebroken, enjoy long walks through the park, spinning in circles, cuddling on the couch, chewing on my nylabone and looking out the screen door. The real way to my heart is with treats - any kind really, frozen peaches or apples are real turn ons.  I'm 100% a people's dog, but I'd like to be your exclusive pet so please don't have other animals around me. Fill out an application and we can meet up. You never know, we just may fall in love. Love, Shirley  \nIf you are interested in this dog, please submit an application directly to our website at www.ny-petrescue.org. Only applications submitted directly to Pet Rescue will be considered.\n\n",

            "description": "Flora is a 9 year old female mixed breed. She weighs 53 pounds. Flora was surrendered because she was not getting along with the other animals in her previous home. At the shelter Flora is barrier reactive with other dogs. We have attempted to introduce Flora into doggie playgroups. Each time she has failed her gate greeting which means that at the gate into the yard she was rude to the other dogs that were already in the yard. Because she was acting inappropriately she was not allowed into the play yard. At this time we believe that Flora would do best in a home without other dogs. At the shelter and while on leash, Flora has met a dog-friendly cat and was extremely focused. At this time we believe Flora would do best in a home without cats. We have no information about how Flora behaves around children. We always recommend a meet and greet with any children in the household or children that visit often, such as grandkids. Please call for more information or to make an appointment to meet Flora. (Updated 1/30/21).",

Her breed listings are totally a guess on the rescue's part, she's an all American mutt (best kind of dog). Still learning to be comfortable on a leash and quite capable of jumping over anything shorter than 5' fencing. With all of that said, she is a wonderfully sweet dog looking for a family with patience and a whole lot of love to give.We require that you have a fenced in yard, not a \"kennel\" in the yard AND we do not approve underground fencing. Depending upon the dog some exceptions are made for those who live in apartments. We also require that the adoptee will be a part of the family \"living\" within the home. Our adoption process may be found on our website at www.bitofheaven.org\n\nVisits are scheduled by appointment only via emailing request to ownedbycaninesandlovit@yahoo.com",

The independent rescuer who has now requested our help to help Lola find her furever home!\n\nI was born approximately February 14, 2015, a legitimate sweetheart.\n\nI am approximately 70 pounds\n\nI am a Shepherd / Belgian Malinois mix. I am pretty good with house training if you are diligent. I love to go for walks and car rides with you. I am a lover, like to be around my family / people but will be protective of my family. I do okay with certain larger breed dogs but probably not so much with the little dogs and no cats for sure! I would do best with an active family who will keep me busy with a lot of exercise and attention! A tired dog is a good dog, so walks, play, etc... I will need a secure yard with a good sized fence and NOT left alone a lot because I can jump!\n\nAdoption fee includes: I have been fixed, up to date on core vaccines (5 in 1, bordetella & 3 year rabies ex. 08/2021), dewormed and microchipped.\n\nIf Interested PLEASE contact PATCH Rescue Inc. patchrescue@gmail.com or (760) 706-0728\n\nAdopt a Pet Listings =\n\nhttps://www.adoptapet.com/adoption_rescue/93645-patch-rescue-inc-victorville-california\n\nPetFinder Listings =\n\nhttps://www.petfinder.com/member/us/ca/victorville/patch-rescue-inc-ca2487/\n\nAdoption process is verbal interview to determine if we think your family is the right situation for the fur kid you are interested in, application (can be downloaded here:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9ZDmKaRLnYfbDZLbDN5Y3hYeWM?usp=sharing)\n\nOnce your application is reviewed and approved home check will be performed. Then we say you are becoming part of the PATCH family adopting one of our fur kids, so we expect follow up on our family member throughout their life, i.e. text, email, social media, pictures are our favorite for sharing with the PATCH family!\n\nPlease keep in mind we are 100% volunteer run We do not have a facility, completely foster based, so we all have our real jobs, it could take 24 to 48 hours to receive a response.\n\nThank you for considering adoption to save two lives!",

He will be a loyal and loving best friend.\n\nHe will do best in a home with an experienced dog owner who can handle his quirks and be committed to him as he gets adjusted to a new life and new routine. Comet is not a fan of felines, so should not go to a home with cats. Comet has been in play groups while at the shelter with other smaller dogs.",

They have all found homes and now it's my turn. I'm a 3-year-old, medium energy, brown-eyed, 55-pound Labrador mix (best guess).\n\nYou can't tell from the pictures, but I have the absolute softest fur-ever. You'll never want to stop petting me! I'm super sweet and love all humans. My foster mom says I have wiggle butt syndrome because of how much I wag my tail when I'm excited. My hobbies include snuggling up on the couch, chewing on squeaky toys, gnawing on bones, and sunbathing.\n\nI'm looking for a home with a nice big fenced in backyard. I've been known to climb chain-link fences, so I'll need a 6-foot privacy fence unless you want me to go squirrel chasing.\n\nYou won't want to miss out on this opportunity to become my human! Please submit an application so you can meet me. Be prepared to fall in love! I can't wait!\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.",

She loves the one on one attention and would be a great hiking dog.\n\nNOTE:  Roxy does not like men.  She would do best with in a female only home.\n\nUpdate: Roxy is all healed and running around and playing with the other dogs in her foster home.  She takes well to puppies.\n\nBack in May 2019 Roxy was found on the side of the road. She was hit by a car and had fractured hip.  The vet said she needs 4 to 6 weeks crate rest and surgery was not needed.\n\nShe is doing well in her foster home. Roxy would be great for an active family.\n\nRoxy is up-to-date on vaccinations, spayed and microchipped.",

            "description": "Topper was rescued from a South Atlanta animal shelter.  She was quite shy the first few days, so we gave her some space and she began to seek us out after about 4 days.  After a few weeks, she follows us and seeks affection.  She is very sweet and silly.  Topper is estimated to be 3-4 years old, and she weighs 16 lbs. and looks like a mini German Shepherd.  She will come inside when called for her food and bed time, but she really enjoys playing in the yard with her canine friends.  She loves her dry kibble and is not a picky eater.  She needs to learn to take treats gently though, watch those fingers!  When her foster mom is loving on other dogs, she'll yip and tug your pants leg!  She wants ALL your love, and we are working to correct that behavior.  We only crate Topper when she's eating.  However, we do baby gate her when nobody is home.  When you pick her up, she'll lay her head on your shoulder and melt your heart instantly. Topper is not suitable for apartment/condo living - she can and will get lonely and bark for extended periods when left alone.  She requires a fenced-in yard and a canine companion or two.\nAlcovy dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on all vaccines, up to date on heart-worm preventative and flea preventative and micro-chipped.

She is 12yrs old and was just dumped off at the shelter when she developed a pyometra (A uterine infection requiring emergency spay. Another reason why spaying is so important!) and became an inconvenience to her previous \"owners\". So she came to us and we are so happy she did!\n\nDiamond is wonderful with all people and generally easy-going. She even accompanied one of our volunteers on one of his trips as a truck driver and settled right in (See pictures above)! That said, she just can't turn down a good game of chasing ball. She does not get along with some dogs and she thinks cats would be fun to chase, but she is perfect in every other way!! She is leash- and crate-trained, listens well and would love a permanent person/family to happily live out the rest of her life with! Diamond is an \"easy\" dog - she doesn't demand much, but we would love to see her find her people soon!\n\nPlease let us know if you are interested in fostering or adopting Diamond by contacting us at Thefortrescue@gmail.com",

            "description": "Niles is such a sweet cuddle bug! He may only have 3 legs, but it doesn't slow him down! He is fantastic with all people! He loves kids, babies, seniors, you name it! He sleeps in the foster's 5 year old child's bed most nights. Sometimes he doesn't realize his size, so you have to watch him around really small children. He will try to get in anyone's lap! Niles LOVES going on car rides! You do have to help him in and out since he only has 3 legs. Niles has a past of being dog aggressive without any warning at all. So, we recommend he goes to a home without out dogs. We also do not think he would be very good with cats. Due to being a tripod Pittie, carpet is better for him and a home without too many stairs. He can go up and down the stairs with encouragement, but it is harder for him. Niles loves to go on short daily walks. Usually a mile is all he can do. He then will just lay down and refuse to get up! He is a velcro dog once a bond has been built and will follow you everywhere. Niles does have pretty serious separation anxiety when left alone until he adjusts. A home where someone is home often would be best for him. He is crate trained and goes in there when nobody is home in his foster's house. 5-6 hours is the max he can be left alone before you have to worry about him relieving himself in his crate. He is house trained and does great in the house! But, in the crate, he will use the bathroom sometimes. This sweet guy loves belly rubs, peanut butter, and cuddles! If you meet him, you will fall in love with him due to his goofy, sweet personality. Approximately 5 years old.",

If was clear upon her arrival at the shelter that someone had physically abused this poor baby. She tries to avoid people whenever she can to avoid conflict but when she can't avoid she tenses and cowers as if she is bracing for impact. This girl is as sweet as can be and will come and sit in front of the people she feels safe with for loves and gentle kisses. She also has gotten along wonderfully with any dog she has met, whether they be small or large. \n\nThere is a $65 fee for adopting one of our male dogs/puppies or a $75 fee for adopting one of our female dogs/puppies.

He loves meeting new people who come to the house and can be very affectionate (although he's very territorial outside). Which would make him a great companion for someone who lives alone and needs an attentive dog. He's not too great at fetch, but he loves keep-away with all of him toys around the house. He can be a very playful dog outside and inside, he loves zooming around the backyard and chasing squirrels. Extremely well potty-trained, never had an accident in the house. He can be a little timid of things he's not familiar with, especially vacuums!\n\n2/2/21 10:01 AM",

            "description": "Jake is a very sweet & loving senior Shepherd mix who weighs 55 lbs and is looking for a nurturing & kind person/family to tend to his special needs for the remainder of his life.  Jake came to BarkVille in the spring of 2019 from an extreme neglect situation where he was starved, mistreated, and left outside with the trash.  He was heartworm positive, emaciated, and had a severe case of mange that left him virtually hairless. Fortunately, BarkVille was able to get him the medical care he needed and place him in a loving foster home. He has recovered to a healthy weight, but his condition requires a raw diet, holistic medicine for his compromised immune system, and regular bathing.  If you can find it in your heart to love and care for this sweet boy, he will joyfully repay you with gratitude, affection and devotion every single day for the rest of his life!\n\nJake is crate trained, housebroken, and walks nicely on a leash.  He is fine around other dogs but is too interested in cats to live safely in a home with them. He is a low key little dog who loves to hang out with his people and get the love & attention he never knew existed before coming into Rescue. He would be great in an an adult only home or in a family with older kids.  He can be a bit stubborn so he needs a strong leader who will show him the way!\n\nFor more information about Jake, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org. If you would like to adopt sweet Jake, please submit an adoption application for him at www.barkvilledogrescue.org/adoption-application.",

This can not be stressed enough.  She is fine with people out on the street and in neutral environments.  However, in the home she guards her person even from others that live there, therefore, she can only live with one person.  \nIn addition it will take her a while before she truly trusts her new person....her new person MUST be familiar with dogs who have had a troubled past and have patience to get to know her.. If interested please complete an application on www.furfriendsinneed.,com.\nAnd we will be in touch to discuss Roxy",

You know it the minute you meet him, the tail is going full-tilt.  He's a really sweet and good-natured dog who's game for anything.  He just wants to be your buddy, he doesn't care what you're doing, he's in!\n\nJD loves attention of any kind; hugs, kisses, belly rubs, moving his lips to make him talk... anything!  He's the kind of dog that would even find a bath enjoyable, because that's attention, and any attention is good in his book!\n\nHe loves his walks, he likes being outside and he enjoys riding in the car.  There's really not much this dog doesn't like... except for one thing... other DOGS!  JD wants to be the only kid at the party.  He's not quite sure what dogs are and he doesn't seem to include himself among them.  They're just nuisance invaders as far as he's concerned... cats too!  So, if you prefer to be a one-pet household, JD is the friend for you!\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIf you would like to foster, foster-to-adopt, (in case you're not sure), or adopt JD, just fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION, which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser.

            "description": "JOHNNY is a sweet 2-year-old, 12-pound, Miniature Pinscher mix, with the most expressive face and the cutest little \"snaggletooth\" smile.\n\nFrom JOHNNY himself:\n\nHey guys, remember me? It's John John \"The Fugitive\"! But my friends call me Johnny! Anyway, I've decided to get back in the game. It's true, in the past I was a little paranoid about being too \"exposed\" if you know what I mean, but that's all behind me now - I am Mr. Confidence these days! (With the possibility of a few caveats.)\n\nIt's been a long road, and I'm a long dog... what? ...never mind, off-topic. Back to what I was saying... Hey, you're not looking at my snaggletooth, are you? I'm very self-conscious about it. Anyway... wait, there you go again, you're looking at it. I can tell. You know how? My lip gets hot. Back to what I was saying, I've come a long way (as I've said, with caveats), but nonetheless, a long way. One might go so far as to say that I'm now the \"Total Package\"!\n\nI'm lovable & sweet, and that fact remains contested by no one. I'm also relatively low-maintenance. I thoroughly enjoy receiving belly rubs, my belly is exquisitely soft and irresistible, you're going enjoy rubbing it. I'm as quiet as mouse in the home, provided there are no canine provocateurs around behaving like baboons. Also, I am undefeated at extracting treats from food challenge toys, as a matter of fact, it's a favorite pastime. Hey, are you looking at my snaggletooth again? Never mind, off-topic. Anyway... I'm also a connoisseur of toys in general, and I know how to use 'em. But I want no part of those godforsaken, obnoxious squeaky types and disapprove of their very existence. Also, I love thunderstorms, but only the quiet ones. I don't like the loud ones, they scare me. Oh, and don't get me started on little kids! I've never actually met one, but when I hear them outside carrying on like pork chops, I tend to get a little nervous. I probably need not mention anything about fireworks. I'm also perfectly crate trained... however, we're going to need the type with solid and/or hard sides. If I'm in a cage or a crate with slatted sides, those just look like a bank of urinals to me, and my aim is impeccable. I enjoy walks and walk very nicely on the leash... just don't take me down any creepy alleyways where something is likely to jump out and scare me.\n\nSo, like I said... The TOTAL PACKAGE!\n\nThey say there's a person for every dog and a dog for every person. I'm looking for that special someone who loves a clever, playful, and charmingly sweet, nervous nit. Are you out there?\n\nYours, ~ Johnny\n\n***\n\nIf you would like to meet JOHNNY, we'd like to hear from you!\n\nLet's make this happen!  You can get the process started by filling out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - just copy and paste the link into your browser. \n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you to meet our little buddy JOHN JOHN!  This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship!\n\nThank you for your interest in helping homeless animals!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption.

Leela is a six year old standard size Red Merle Australian Shepherd with a tail. Leela came into rescue after her owners choose to surrender her to a local shelter because they were having a baby. This led to anxiety and PTSD for Leela. \nLeela has worked hard in the year plus she\u2019s been with her foster to learn to trust again and learn to just be a dog. Leela does take anxiety medication and will probably always need them. Leela is in a home with other dogs and cats and does well with them. She at times likes to herd the other dogs so will need a patient doggy playmate or could be any only dog. She likes to play ball and loves the water hose and sprinkler. \nLeela is crate and house trained and will walk on leash. \nLeela has fear of new people and new situations and can become over stressed if something triggers her negative memories. \nLeela would not be good in a home with children or grandchildren. \nShe needs a somewhat quiet home that can allow her to decompress and slowly gain comfort and trust. \nLeela likes the idea of car rides and walks but becomes stressed. Her new family will need to help her continue to desensitize to her stressors. \nIt\u2019s recommended that an adopter be local to the OKC area so her foster mom and trainer can help with any transition into a new home. \nLeela knows she\u2019s asking for a very special family but she has a lot of love to give even if she needs a lot in return.",

            "description": "This amazing and handsome boy is Archie.  He is a 2 year old very tall but slim 70 lb Shepherd/lab mix.  Archie came to us about a year ago after being adopted out as a puppy. He was not socialized and was scared of everyone and everything. After a year of training and working with him, he has become one happy amazing dog. He lives with another dog and does well meeting new people now. \n\nArchie loves to play fetch and loves to play with his dog friends.  He really loves going on walks and loves attention from people.  He is such a sweet boy and has really enjoyed working with the trainer.    He can touch, sit, stay, lay, spin, and almost has bow down. Hes really smart  and he is very food motivated.\n\nArchie would like a home where he has a dog friend to play with, gets to go on walks, and gets to play fetch in the yard.  He was let down before but he is an incredibly sweet boy who deserves his forever home. He will need a stockade fence as he's very tall and could easily jump a short fence.  \n\nArchie is good with other dogs and would love one in his forever home!  He really relies on a dog for confidence and comfort so he would not do well without one.  We do not think he would do well with children.  \n\nArchie is leash trained and walks really well with a gentle leader.  Archie is also crate and house trained.  \n\nArchie is neutered, microchipped, and current on his vaccines.  His adoption fee is $175.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Archie and make him a part of your family, please contact ForeverYoursOKC@gmail.com.",

He came to us just over a year ago with a condition that causes cysts to form, which puppies outgrow once they mature. Due to this condition he was on heavy steroids and pain medication which has altered his perception of some things, leading to behaviors which make him tough to place.\n\nDuke is definitely a happy boy in his mind, extremely playful, will play fetch all day long, he loves walks, loves his toys and bones and loves having a set routine. He does however have his downsides that make him tough to place due to the medication effecting him mentally. Oh and if you have a kiddie pool he will be all over it!\n\nDuke needs a home without other dogs because he can get possessive over his \"babies\" (stuffed animals) and he does not read dogs intentions correctly and vice versa so things can escalate quickly. He also needs a home without kids, as well as one that is pretty routine without a lot of visitors. He does not have a problem with cats here and some dogs he is okay with, but he has certain behaviors that cause a lot of dogs to end up in fights with him. A fenced in yard is also a must for this guy and an adopter who will listen to our instructions with Duke on what his triggers are, who will be confident when he shows signs of barrier aggression for example and is calm enough to not escalate the situation by yelling or wanting to grab Duke. Duke does mean well and he is an amazing dog, but his aggressive behaviors do not typically match whats going on mentally so he is a challenge. Someone who understands redirection, how your body language is effecting the dog and who is patient is key.\n\nHe is fully vaccinated, microchipped, neutered, on heartworm prevention, flea prevention, dewormed and healthy minus his \"predictably unpredictable\" behaviors.\n\nIf you think you are the right fit for Duke please email us at islanddogrescue@yahoo.com and tell us why. We get a ton of people who are interested who do not fit his needs, so please do not forget to include this information or we will not respond.\n\n1/28/21 3:55 PM",

Not only do I have the personality, but I have the looks to go with it! Look at my picture again!! LOOK AT IT!! How could you not fall in love with a face like mine?! I have a huge head because I'm SO SMART and a fast learner! I'm so smart that my next human has to be pretty smart and have a big head to hold all their strong-minded dog breed knowledge! I have completed a top notch board and train program with my friends at K9 Top Performance! You will have to commit to reinforcing my training and commands by incorporating it into our daily structure and routine, so I continue to THRIVE!!  I have been doing AMAZING in my foster home (THE BEST foster guy, by the way!) and we've had lots of fun working on my commands, structure and routine! I am an active dog that hopes you will take me on lots of walks, and maybe play some of my favorite food games! Because children don't understand me and they can be unpredictable, I would do much better with no kids in the home. While I love my humans, I JUST CAN'T do other animals. AT ALL. I repeat: I DON'T DO ANIMALS. So don't even think about bringing me to any doggie birthday parties or other canine social gatherings you crazy humans force upon us. I WILL make a scene, probably go to jail, you'll regret it, I'll regret it, and it just won't be pretty. \n\nI'm taking applications for my FOREVER home! LOOK AT MY FACE, LOOK AT IT!!!\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please fill out an application at survivortails.org or email adoptions@survivortails.org with any questions.\n\n\n\n\n",
