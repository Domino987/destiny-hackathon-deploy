            "description": "Daniel is a 5 year old bully breed mix weighing 46 lbs who came in on Dec. 1, 2020 from animal control. He loves to play with toys and will chew on his hard rubber toy all day, as well as throw others around. He has a silly side. We believe he would probably do best in a house where he is the only dog and we're guessing he won't do well with cats. He comes to the front of his kennel when he has a visitor, and will lick your hand and act very interested, so he's not shy.  He's fairly quiet and well behaved, but he's a very muscular stocky dog who looks a bit intimidating. Please call (434) 374-8076 or email lakecountryspca@yahoo.com to adopt. Visit LCSPCA Mon-Sat. from 12-4 om at 11764 Hwy. 15, Clarksville, VA 23927.",

In that time he has put on a few extra pounds that the our volunteers are helping him work off with daily walks, which he loves! Tut is a very shy dog and loves to bark when he gets nervous but settles down pretty quickly once told to. He gets a little nervous around new people and other dogs (especially other alpha dogs) but does adjust quickly. Tut will need an owner that is willing to work with him on his socialization skills and behavior training moving forward, however he loves attention and positive reinforcement and will likely be stuck to his new owner like glue once he adjusts. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting Tut or have any questions about him, please call the Shelter and arrange a time to meet him.",

            "description": "COVID-19 Protocol: Adoptions will be done by appointment only. If you see a pet you are interested in please call the Franklin Township Animal Shelter at: (732)-873-2500 ext. 6255 and leave a message with your name, phone number, and the name of the pet you are interested in.\n\nYou must leave a message so that we can return your call to schedule an appointment. Listings are updated on a weekly basis.\n\nAdonis is 3 years of age and was surrendered to the Franklin Township Animal Shelter after his previous owner was unable to keep him. He is a sweet pup who absolutely loves attention (and elf costumes)! Adonis knows some basic commands, but he needs additional training on canine and leash manners. He is very smart and willing to please. Adonis has a lot of energy, is very strong, and pulls hard at the leash. Therefore, he can only go to a home with children aged 15+. Adonis cannot go to a home with cats. He may get along with other dogs, but he would have to meet them first.\n\nOur adoption fee for dogs, cats, kittens, and rabbits is $60 per pet with a discount available for adopting two animals together. Cats, dogs, rabbits and kittens from the Franklin Township Animal Shelter are spayed/neutered. Cats, dogs, and kittens are microchipped, and up-to-date on all age-appropriate shots prior to adoption. Cats have also been tested for feline leukemia and FIV and dogs have been tested for heartworm.",

            "description": "Jace is a handsome 2-1/2 year old brindle colored mix of Dane and/or perhaps a Plott Hound and does well with older respectful children. He is sweet natured, easy-going, likes car rides, and surprisingly is a bit shy. He is easily spooked by new things, he's a big dog who thinks he's the size of a Chihuahua. He just needs time to get used to the way things work. Jace is not good with cats but is good barking at the fence, always a welcome talent if you like to know when people stop by to visit. He knows commands: sit, stay, lie & track, is house trained and walks nicely on a leash. Please call 928 537-8009 to arrange a meeting as Jace is living with one of our great Foster Families.\n*****\n Pet Allies offers behavior assistance for all pets adopted from the Shelter. Please feel free to make a plan with Nikki before or after you take your pet home. Ask about more options if needed.\nPet Allies Shelter: 1181 E Thornton Road, Show Low, AZ 85901, \n 928-537-8009, open Monday-Saturday 11-5, Sunday 11-3.\nPet Allies Clinic: 4050 S White Mountain Road, Show Low, AZ 85901, \n 928-532-1602, call to verify hours, currently Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday 10-4.\nVisit www.PetAlliesAz.org for more information.",

Such a sad story for such a nice girl.\n\n\nPlease email us directly for a faster response and we will send you our questionnaire.   info@petsandpeople.com   We get many each day so please watch your spam/trash folders for our replies.\n\nAdoption fee for all dogs and puppies is $130.00 each, which includes spay/neuter, vaccinations (including all puppy boosters for puppies under 4 months), worming, flea/tick treatment if needed, microchip and collar/leash/tags.",

Still unknown how he is around cats. He's laid back but still playful. He does have some separation anxiety and will need a home with another dog.  Hawk requires at least a 4 foot fence.\n\nHawk is estimated to be 2-3 years old.  His current weight is 110 pounds.\n\nThe minimum donation for Hawk is $450.00. This includes all of his vetting. If you are interested in Hawk, please fill out an online application through our website.\n\nWe are currently only open by appointment only. Due to the recent pandemic, we are looking at the safety of our volunteers that are there to take care of the dogs. Only serious inquiries will be considered.\n\nThen meet him at the shelter during adoption hours on Saturdays and Sundays 10 - 2pm. All members of the household need to meet the dog you are interested in. Vet records for any current or previous pets need to be provided. If all goes well, a home visit will be done prior to adoption.",

Luckily, he's healing nicely and is ready start his new life. \nKringle loves people and is very cuddly. His favorite activity is sitting by the window, watching other dogs go by, and car rides! He also enjoys chew toys \u2014 even destroying the plush ones (whoops!). Kringle loves a good walk with his people and spending time in the backyard of his foster home. Above all, he just wants to be near the people who love him! He is also crate trained and potty trained!\nKringle may do well living in a home with another dog,  and probably a no-go on cats.\n\nIf you live near Austin, TX and want to meet Kringle, email adopt@love-a-bull.org or fill out our adoption application today: http://love-a-bull.org/adopt/adoption-application/\n",

My ID number is 334709\n\nI am available for adoption; however due to my breed my adoption will have to be facilitated through a rescue organization. Please see the front desk staff or contact the Shelter at (248) 858-1070 for more information.\n\nMeet Willa! What a total sweetness! Willa came to the Shelter after being found running the streets, all by herself! Poor girl...that's no way for a youngster to live! Willa is a very sweet girl, who is quite animated when people are visiting with her! She enjoys carrying her food bowl around after she's eaten it, possibly hinting for it to be refilled? :) Willa does well walking on a leash, but does become somewhat apprehensive when other dogs are reacting! This beautiful girl deserves to be in a safe and secure environment, where she will be tended to, loved and adored for her lifetime! \n\nThe following descriptions describe behaviors that were observed during testing and/or veterinary examination: Evaluated for temperament with 334973 (female), and 334954 (male). Did very well with both. When she hears another dog behaving and vocalizing aggressively, she becomes reactive. Recommend slow introductions with other dogs 10/26/2020\n\nAmerican Pit Bulls are a misunderstood breed; for this reason, we implore adopters to these beautiful dogs to be very vigilant in training and socialization. This breed is very energetic and will need daily exercise. Because of their strength and energy, apartment living may not be the best fit. This breed can be loving, loyal and very smart. \n\nThe above behaviors and personality traits have been observed while at the Shelter. If this animal was relinquished, information is gathered from the owner regarding behavior. Our wonderful volunteers spend time with these animals and give input on behaviors and traits. However, this description may not be all inclusive to how this animal will act in a loving forever home. Introduction to established family pets should be slow and monitored always. The same goes for children and other family members. Adopting a pet is a big decision and should be thoughtful. We suggest researching different breeds to match traits and personalities to your lifestyle. When adopting a pet, please know that this pet will be with you for their lifetime; patience and consistency will make for a successful adoption.\n\n**Age is estimated** Primary Color: Tan Secondary Color: White Weight: 42lbs Age: 3yrs 3mths 1wks Animal has been Spayed",

She came to PugHearts with a dental infection, but she eats regular food with a little bit of water in it. (Dental scheduled 12/16)\n\n2. She came to with a bladder infection, but her infection is now gone and she proves that she is potty trained every day, even in the rain.\n\n3. She came to with an ear infection, but her infection is now gone and she responds to us calling her and barks if she is alerted.\n\n4. She came to with a bad back, but she does not let that slow her down. Playtime is serious business to Agnes and she wants to play with you at least once a day. She has learned to play fetch and gets excited when she looks at anything sparkly-- especially Christmas ornaments!\n\n5. She came to PugHearts with an enlarged heart and she uses that to love people more and more every day.\n\nShe is the best buddy and loves to follow her person around. She is also good at being part of a grumble and will love on any brothers and sisters she might get.\n",

Some nice people found me roaming around by their home one morning; they took me in, fed me and kept me warm. They wanted to keep me but I didn't get along with their dog, so they called ARFhouse! \n\nI am the NICEST girl in the world! I'm not too keen on other dogs, but I love humans! I can't get enough attention; I love belly rubs, chasing toys and getting all the pets! I am a fun young girl and I will need some obedience training, but nothing too crazy and I will learn quickly because I'm sharp as a tack! Because I don't seem to like other dogs, I need to be in a home where I am the only pet. I wouldn't be suited for an apartment; I need a large, fenced yard where I can run and play! \n\nThe fee to adopt Libby is $200.00; this includes spay/neuter, deworming, vaccinations and a microchip. If you are interested in adopting Libby, please visit our website. www.arfhouse.org and fill out an adoption application. \n\n**Please Note: Libby is currently located at our facility in Sherman, Texas. Adoptions are by-appointment only; if you would like to meet Libby, please fill out an application on our website. Once we have your application, our Adoption Coordinator will follow up with you ASAP with any questions she may have, or to set up a meet-and-greet.",

She is sweet to everyone she meets. \n\nCocoa is 2-3 years old. She does like people and would be OK with older kids. She loves to go for walks and also likes to play with other dogs. She lives in the home with two senior beagles and is also really good and calm with them. She really should have another dog in the home.\n\nCocoa has quickly warmed up to people since we have had her. She loves to follow you around and will approach both men and women with a wagging tail. There are times if you move quickly she will duck down but she doesn\u2019t run away from you.\n\nCocoa does not really like being alone although she will go in a crate. She will bark for a few minutes if you leave the house so an apartment is not good for her. She does stop barking once you are gone for a few minutes. She loves her people so much she would prefer someone was home a lot.\n\nShe is up to date on vaccinations, micro-chipped, HW negative and spayed.\n\nIf interested in meeting Cocoa our application can be found at www.homesfurhounds.com. She is located in Williamsburg.",

She's sure hoping to get into another home in time for the holidays, and we're doing our best to make her holiday wish come true. In her former home, Blitz lived with kids ages 2 through 8 and reportedly did well. Her former owners tell us she's housetrained and loved to sleep in her dog bed. Blitz is a super playful girl, but she can get overly excited, so we recommend no dog parks and that she meet any resident dogs before going home to live with them. We also recommend Blitz leave with a dog savvy owner who is willing to work with her on her stimulus control. Blitz is a very sweet girl and we know the perfect home is out there for her. If you think you can make her holiday wish come true, make an appointment to meet her today. Ask Blitz' volunteer advocate, Gail, about her: foster070204@gmail.com BLITZ IS ENROLLED IN THE GOOD DOG PROJECT AT PACC - Read a message from her case manager here: tinyurl.com/gdpmessage - Ask her case manager about him: rachel.jones@pima.gov",

He was not properly taken care of at all, and is currently on a diet dog food to help him lose weight. He also had many teeth removed due to infection, but is healing and feeling much better! He also did not have too much human contact, and is slowly coming out of his shell to his foster Mom. He LOVES other dogs, and will need another dog in the home to help with his confidence. Elvis is a day napper. Every now and then he likes to run around in circles and initiates play with the other small dogs. He hasn\u2019t figured out toys yet but loves to snuggle his teddy. He will need a quieter home, and a patient one. Older children would be just fine, but younger may scare him.",

I was dumped out in the country one day and no one can figure out why! \n\nI am the friendliest dog you'll ever meet and I LOVE to play! I get along okay with other dogs, but will probably need to be in a home where I am the only one. I have lots of energy and love to run around and goof off. Because of my energy level, I wouldn't be suited for an apartment; I will need a large, fenced yard so that I can run and play! \n\nThe fee to adopt Tessie is $200.00; this includes spay/neuter, deworming, vaccinations and a microchip. If you are interested in adopting Tessie, please visit our website. www.arfhouse.org and fill out an adoption application. \n\n**Please Note: Tessie is currently located at our facility in Sherman, Texas. Adoptions are by-appointment only; if you would like to meet Tessie, please fill out an application on our website. Once we have your application, our Adoption Coordinator will follow up with you ASAP with any questions she may have, or to set up a meet-and-greet.",

I am a very sweet little man who would be an excellent family dog who would be great with younger children. I like to play with other dogs but I can be selective with who I choose to play with sometimes. I would be a good fit for either an experienced dog owner or a first time adopter and while I think I would enjoy having access to a large yard, I think I could also be very happy being an apartment dog without one. I think I'd prefer a quieter lifestyle to a busier one, but I do love to meet new visitors! I may even be the type of pup that you can take out and about with you in public! I would benefit from further training, particularly because I'm almost potty-trained but not quite there yet. I have been learning to love to walk on leash here at the ranch and I would love to go for a walk with you sometime soon!",

I like to play with other small dogs and even though I can be a little bit shy, I am enormously sweet at heart. I think that I'd do best in a home with older children, who can respect my space and allow me to get used to my surroundings on my own time. I'd be a good fit for an experienced owner who can help me learn that things are okay and I'm always going to be safe. While I would like to have a big yard to run around and play in, but I think I could be happy in a variety of environments, including an apartment. I am very friendly when I meet visitors but please go slow with me. I appear to have some training but I would benefit from some more, particularly as it relates to potty-training.",

They are his favorite thing in the whole world. When playing with toys, Salem knows the commands \u201cDrop it\u201d , \u201cLeave it\u201d, and \u201cWait\u201d.  He also knows \u201cSit\u201d and \u201cStay\u201d. Salem is good with other dogs. So good, in fact, that we ask him to help us when assessing new dogs! He has shown to be patient and well mannered with children. Salem pulls on a leash but that\u2019s nothing a little leash training can\u2019t fix! He does inhale toys when left unattended, so when playing with toys, he\u2019ll need some supervision. Because Salem is super active it may be best that he finds a family that goes on walks, morning runs, or even just throwing a ball back and forth a few times!  When he sees a smiling face walking towards him, his little tail goes a mile a minute and he\u2019s the happiest pup ever. The more time I spend with him. The more I love him. He\u2019s just a sweet happy go lucky little boy who loves tennis balls and wants a home of his own.is at our West Bank location while he awaits his forever home. Salem is an affectionate dog who's favorite thing is tennis balls and a field to run in. He knows sit/stay/down/leave it and he's become a staff favorite. \nFor more info about Salem, email our adoption coordinator, Tiffanie at Tstinson@jeffparish.net\n\nAdoption fee includes vaccinations, spay/neuter, heartworm test, and microchip.\n*Dogs are pending behavior and other-animal assessment unless otherwise noted here.\n\n\nAvailable for adoption, foster, or rescue at:\n\nJefferson Parish Animal Shelter - Westbank\n2701 Lapalco Blvd; Harvey, LA 70058\n504-349-5111 \n\nPlease provide ID number when visiting shelter.

Faith is extremely lovable and loves to play with other dogs. She weighs 45 pounds and is housebroken. Faith was one of the 30 dogs rescued in the last 2 weeks from Okeechobee Animal Control by Nala's New Life Rescue. She is so thankful to be at our ranch and we are happy to have this sweet girl while she waits for her forever family. She is still very much  a silly fun puppy, always ready to play, but fairly calm as well\n\nTo adopt or foster, please submit a fully completed application on our website at www.nalasrescue.org/adoption-application.\nWe are located in Palm City, FL and we adopt mostly in a 50 miles radius. We always do home visit, and personalized meet and greet, to insure that your new companion will be a great match for your family.\n\n\n",

            "description": "Prairie Pooches Rescue has sweet Harlem in our care and in search of his forever home.  Harlem came into our care from Ontario due to the provincial breed ban.  He came from a neglected home that failed to teach him how to be a dog and didn't get him any vet care.  His ears and skin were in horrible shape and he hadn't seen much of the outside world.  Thankfully he had a very loving foster home in Ontario who showed him how some love and routine can make life much more joyful.  He learnt how to play fetch, run around, snuggle on the couch and really just come out of his shell.  \n\nHarlem has come a long ways since being in our care.  He has settled to be a much more secure boy.  He is content now to chill and chew on a bone or happy to come along for a nice walk with his humans.  He has been good with the dogs his size and would do best with another playful female his size.  He walks really well with his head halti.  He's a smart eager boy and will do pretty much anything for treats.  He knows to sit and wait to have his leash put on, waits nicely for his food, and takes treats gentle too.  He adores children but does need a home with only older or no kids and he will zoom down small kids.  He deserves to find his forever home so that there can be room for more doggies to be saved.  Please consider adopting Harlem. \n\nPrairie Pooches Rescue is a volunteer and foster based rescue. All our dogs are in foster homes and approved adopters are required to meet the dogs at the foster homes.\n\nAdoption fee is $250. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinations UTD, dewormed and microchipped. Adoption applications and home visits are done for all adoptions. Please fill out an application if interested on our website www.prairiepoochesrescue.com\n\n****Due to an overwhelming amount of emails and phone calls we receive we will only respond to ones that have an application attached. Thank you****",

Her foster mom says: \u201cShe amazes me every day. She may be blind, but that doesn\u2019t stop her from exploring and enjoying her life.\u201d\n\nGinger is a very sweet, tiny dog. She loves treats and her doggie bed with a soft blanket to burrow under.  Ginger gets along well with cats and small dogs.  She hasn\u2019t been tested around large dogs.  Once she knows where you want her to go and gets comfortable with the lay of your home, Ginger does well with potty training.  She does like to eat alone because she can\u2019t see who might be coming for her food.\n\nGinger has been spayed, is current on vaccinations, has tested negative for heartworm, and has been microchipped.\n\nWe are committed to doing our part to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Until life goes back to normal, we will not be doing adoption events at PetSmart. Instead, we will be doing individual meetings by appointment and practicing social distancing at each meeting.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our online adoption application at www.uaaf.org. For more information, or to schedule an appointment, call/text Kirsty at (435) 671-0985, or email kirsty.ju@gmail.com.\n\n",

My coat is multicolored and I'm told it looks like a finely crafted needlepoint design. I think you'll agree! \n\nI'm originally from the Bahamas and moved to New York to become a Posh Pet and find my forever family. Because I'm an 'island girl' I'm a bit scared of all the strange noises and traffic here in New York but am working on that. A nice home with a fenced-in backyard in the suburbs will be best for me\n\n. I'm super playful with other dogs, and in a foster home with both DOGS and CATS  and good with older children   I'm getting used to walking on a leash but need time and patience as this is all so new. \n\nHugs and kisses await when you get to know me and give me time to acclimate as I can be a bit shy in new situations.  To know me is to love me as the saying goes.  So please fill out the application to meet me;\n\n I'm spayed, up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, and would love to become a part of your family.\n\nI\u2019m spayed, up to date on vaccinations, and microchipped. \n\nPlease fill out the application on this link \n\nhttps://poshpetsrescueny.org/dogs/",

He loves walks more than anything and will even quickly trot to the door with his tail wagging high if he knows it\u2019s time to go for a walk outside. Tuck enjoys cuddles, is as sweet as can be, and will be a wonderful companion. Being near his people is his favorite place to be. He would do best in a one-level home with someone who is home a majority of the time. He is schedule oriented but can also get used to a new schedule fairly easily. Tuck is so friendly to both people and dogs; he has never met a stranger. He is a homebody and would prefer not to travel too often.  \n\nTuck is healthy and has quite the energy for a dog his age. A couple of walks a day and love from the people around him will make him one happy dog! For a dog, a good life is important, a long one is not - they aren't counting days. Would you make the world a better place and provide a loving home for sweet Tuck?\nTuck is being fostered in Charlotte, NC. For more information on Tuck, contact his foster mom Emily at emilybrito1125@gmail.com.\n\nOur adoption application can be found at https://cbcr.org/adoptionapp/.  If you have submitted an adoption application to CBCR within the last three years and you have not moved, please contact the foster parent before submitting another application.  The foster parent will let you know if another application is required.",

He lost his doggie friend last year, she was an older and larger dog, and his behaviors changed after that. He seemed sad without his dog friend.  He can be dog reactive/aggressive when on a leash, so someone who can work with him on this will be helpful, and he needs a home with no small children or small pets, possibly as an only dog (or maybe with a larger older dog). Scotty is a big guy at about 33 lbs, but he\u2019s incredibly sweet and knows a number of commands.  \n\nScotty is neutered, up to date on all vaccines, and microchipped. He will be having an anesthesia free dental on December 15 to get his teeth all spiffed up.  His adoption fee is $275.00. You can find the adoption application (required) here: \n\nhttp://cominischnauzerrescue.com/forms/vintage-dog-rescue-adoption-application/",

            "description": "VALIUM - 2 years old, 71 pounds, friendly but may take a little time warming up to new people, pulls on the leash, good with dogs, likes to play with other dogs, may guard food from other dogs, best with older kids, no cats, very playful, hyper, can jump an 8 foot fence, very smart, can open doors, slightly food aggressive.\n\nValium is so excited to get out of that cage, he is all over the place! Trying to harness him was quite a sight I'm sure! Finally successful with the harnessing, we were off. Valium politely greeted every dog we passed in the kennel, even the ones who weren't so dog friendly. He pulled me down the hall and out the doors in what may have looked like a panic but it was only his eagerness to get out. Valium was hyper and jumpy in the yard. Going after my treat bag a few times I resorted to getting him into a sit, which he gladly did...but only for a moment so I'd grab a tennis ball and toss it. Valium is a big boy. He's strong and can also be demanding. He's looking for a new home. He'll need lots of daily exercise. He'll need lots of attention. I bet with plenty of this exercise and attention, Valium will be gladly at your side just chilling while watching your favorite baseball team knock it out of the park. Bring your dogs and kids in to meet Valium and let's see if we can all get along keeping in mind Val might guard his food or toys from other dogs so managing this behavior is vital to a successful integration. Keeping a close eye on everyone is important as Valium settles into his new home with his new family. Call the Virginia Beach Animal Care and Adoption Center (341 S Birdneck Road) at 385-4444 or go to our Facebook page to make an appointment.",

            "description": "Mr. Bean is a cute little black poodle who flew all the way from Texas to find a loving Colorado home. He was brought into the Texas shelter to be euthanized by a family that had owned him for 10 YEARS! We think he is about 12 years old and weighs in at about 12 pounds. He is an active, fun loving guy who would love a furever home with a nice big fenced-in backyard to run around in.  He likes people a lot and loves attention and getting petted. He would love a home where his people were around a lot. He can be a little bit of a resource guarder, so we are looking for a home with no young children or alpha dogs. Mr. Bean gets along with other dogs, but we would need to see how introductions go if he goes into a home with other pets.\n\nWhen Mr. Bean first came into rescue he peed very slowly and for extended periods of time. Because he is a poodle, not a schnauzer, we didn't immediately think of bladder stones but that was it! He had 3 painful stones that were blocking his urethra. He had the stones removed, and had a significant dental, and has healed very well in his foster home. He will need to eat a special prescription food for life in order to help prevent a recurrence of the stones. Mr. Bean has been wearing a belly band in his foster home to prevent pee accidents, this could be the result of the damage from the stones still healing, or he may have never received really good potty training. He does not poop inside though, so there is hope. We will send belly bands to his new home which are an easy solution to this issue. ? \n\nMr. Bean is neutered, up to date on all vaccines, and microchipped.  He also had the big dental and the bladder stones removed. His adoption fee is $225.00. You can find the adoption application (required) here: http://cominischnauzerrescue.com/forms/vintage-dog-rescue-adoption-application/",

            "description": "Enzo was born in 2013. He is bonded with Sophie and they are pretty much in separable. Enzo is a typical male chihuahua, he knows how to use a pee pad and will go outside in nice weather but he will mark if there are other male dogs in the home. For this reason he would do best in a home with just him and Sophie. He is the ultimate lapdog, and if your lap is occupied he will take a perch on your shoulder. Enzo prefers a quiet home with not a lot of visitors, he also does not prefer small children. Do you have a quiet home for Enzo and Sophie to live out their days?\n\nIncluded with adoption: Age-appropriate vaccinations, up to date heart-worm preventative, heart-worm test if over 6 months, insurance for 30 days, microchip with registration, and spayed or neutered- if not already, a voucher is provided. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry",

She is very, very sweet and would do best in a home with other dogs. We would prefer a home with older kids just because screaming may scare her. \n\nShe is 7-8 months old, good with dogs, cats and will most likely be okay with kids \nShe is potty trained, kenneled trained but is still working on walking on a leash. That has been one thing that is taking her the most time to get used to because she is scared on walks. She does have some noise phobia and will freeze on walks if she gets startled.\n\nWe are working on sit and shake.    She loves shoes and socks so she will need to be monitored for the chewing. When she gets too scared she will nervous pee and she will poop on car rides.\n\n*Because she missed her critical socialization period, it is safe to say that she will carry anxiety with her. So she may not be the dog that you take to the park or lake as she may get overwhelmed. Owners will need to be patient and continue to work on coping skills and calming skills so she can have confidence in new situations.\n\nPinkie Pie will need to go to a home with playful dogs. She functions best on a routine.",

Don\u2019t want to give me an ego I guess! \n\nChulo/ Chuey is approximately 2 years old and about 80lbs. He is a fun-loving family member! He is guessed to be a husky/Labrador retriever mix with a fluffy, adorable tail. \nHis loyalty and protection is matched by no other. He is a quick learner and highly intelligent which also means he is stubborn but submits with friendly reminders. He would love someone to help him combat his stranger danger fear once he\u2019s comfortable in a place, yet, being properly introduced totally diverts any reaction and he truly just needs a responsible owner. \nHe is house trained, loves walks, and is good in a crate alone. He loves relaxing in a kennel! \nHe gets along great with his male Shi Tzu and female Rottweiler doggie roommates. He has been amazing with all dogs who have come his way! Felines are not friends though. \nHe has been around toddlers and younger children and has been very curious but gentle.\nHe\u2019s been patiently awaiting his furever home! Chuey is such a well behaved gentle giant who has been overlooked for far too long. He has amazing manners- no jumping, mourning, or accidents. He lives for belly rubs and will give you an occasional little kiss. He is a sweet, patient boy and ready to steal someone\u2019s heart. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our dogs are healthy, spayed/neutered, vaccinated and on heartworm preventative. They live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. Many have basic obedience skills and all have been temperament tested. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, please visit our website to complete an application: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt\n(please note: app cannot be done on a mobile device)\n\nFor additional information see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

He gets excited when he goes outside and will do a little happy dance. He is friendly with everyone once he has a chance to meet them. He is housebroken, crate trained, pretty low maintenance and extremely lovable! Seniors make wonderful pets, so please consider adopting Max!",

She is about 2 1/2 years old (born in May of 2018) and weighs just over 60 pounds. She is a very sweet girl and will make a great companion for a lower traffic home. She walks very well on a leash and her favorite thing is belly rubs and getting your attention. \n\nSophie is located in our Palm City location.

See the bottom of this bio for more FAQs regarding our adoption process before emailing.****\n\nName: Bella & Nelly\n\nAge: Bella - 3 years & Nelly -1.5 years\n\nCurrent Weight: Bella - 50 pounds & Nelly - 55 pounds\n\nRescued from: Texas\n\nBella & Nelly was rescued from an area where there is an abundance of homeless dogs, and not a lot of shelter space for them to go while they wait for their forever homes. \n\nMeet Bella and Nelly, bonded pair. Nelly is Bella\u2019s daughter from her first litter. They were owned but mostly kept outside until Bella got pregnant one more time. They were surrendered to the rescue to find a better life. Bella had her babies and took great care of them and has been reunited with her daughter Nelly. They are now ready to find a new family together. They are both so loving and grateful. They are very active, playful and love to give hugs. They are medium energy and are learning house manners but may jump out of excitement. Nelly is a bit shy at first but slowly warms up and will shower you with kisses. Bella is more outgoing and will love you the moment she meets you. They love treats and they sit to take them quite gently. They are crate trained and sometimes they like to switch crates with each other. They like laying on the couch and cuddling with their humans but also love being outdoors when it\u2019s time to play, and they will go straight to the back door when they are ready to come back inside. They love benebones, bully sticks and any kinds of treats. They are both super smart and may have been cats in another life. Nelly can jump really high, so a tall fence is recommended in her new home. Bella likes to rub her body against her human\u2019s legs when she\u2019s looking for love and pets. They are great around men, women and children, and wonderful around other dogs. Bella is heartworm positive and going through slow kill heartworm treatment. Nelly is heartworm negative. Nelly and Bella are looking for an amazing family to love them forever.\n\nHealth: up to date on required vaccines\n\nAdoption fee: $700\n\nIMPORTANT: This dog has not yet been altered. For any dog or puppy that is not able to be spayed/neutered prior to adoption, SNARR requires a $125 deposit in addition to your adoption fee, as well as a signed Spay/Neuter Contract stating you will have this dog altered within 6 months of adoption. The $125 deposit will be returned once the contract has been fulfilled. \n\nTo apply to adopt Bella & Nelly, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n**Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an approved application.**\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

            "description": "Calling all Lab lovers! Meet Oliver! This 6 year old, middle-aged man has a wonderful calm demeanor and a penchant for sneaking snacks! Oliver is not a fan of cats or small dogs, but he is a loyal family dog who does great with kids. He's generally a very patient boy who enjoys pets and hugs from human kiddos and is known to keep guard sleeping right next their beds. Like all dogs, though, Oliver does have his boundaries and doesn't like to play rough. A short run or game of fetch with a Nerf football once in a while is more his speed of play. Oliver is not a big fan of being left alone in his kennel, but will gladly go with you wherever he's allowed to go - he's a great car rider! Oliver also knows how to sit, stay, come, lay down, and shake hands/paws. He's a very smart boy with great mature manners looking for the perfect home. Contact ARF with any questions or fill out an adoption application for Oliver today!\n\n-----\nIMPORTANT: To protect the health of our staff and volunteers, ARF is currently conducting adoptions by appointment only. Please see more information below.\n\n-Contact Info:\nHave questions first about the adoption process or a particular animal? Please click the Contact this Organization button.\n\n-Ready to Adopt? Please visit www.animalrescuemobile.org to submit an adoption application, or click the Adopt Me button to request one via email.\n\n-The Adoption Process:\nAn adoption application, veterinarian and/or personal reference, a home visit, and a $150 adoption fee are part of the process. All animals will be up to date on shots, microchipped, and spayed/neutered before adoption.\n\n-Please Note:\nSponsors are needed to help ARF with the cost of vet care. If you would like to sponsor an ARF rescue, please click the Sponsor Me button. A sponsor donation of $50 will help cover the cost of a spay/neuter surgery.

            "description": "Nikki is a 10-year-old Husky who came to HRA in January. Nikki was rescued from a hoarding situation and went through a rehabilitation program with the ASPCA. She was transferred after graduating to HRA. Since her time with HRA and myself, she's been a very shy gal and a bit on the skittish/jumpy side. It's necessary that you approach her slowly and quietly; therefore, she would do best in an adult only house (no apartments) that's quiet. \n\nShe'd do best with someone that can spend time with her and help her keep to standard routines such as going for walk and going to the bathroom outside. She isn't demanding at all; in fact, she is very content to sleep in her crate most of the day. She does enjoy her walks taking in all the smells and scenery. I live in a two level home but she's not shown any interest in going upstairs or down to the basement. In the time with me, I feel she's become more relaxed and is learning to trust and feel comfortable with me. She's a beautiful girl, and, underneath her gorgeous coat, is a dear, sweet dog looking for a new chapter to her senior life. We are looking for a special home for Nikki because she has cancer.\n\nAt this time she is comfortable and happy and the oncologist believes Nikki may have a year of quality life to enjoy. Nikki would love a home where she can go on walks, enjoy life, and relax. Please let this last chapter be comforting, stimulating and positive. And if you adopt Nikki you will also receive a free painting of her because of how special she is!\n\nI'd be very happy to share with you what I've learned in our time together. I can be contacted at epc31855@gmail.com.",

            "description": "Marley has a very sad past but a bright and wonderful future. He was found after a Facebook plea went out for help. The owner was in jail, other occupants in the home had moved out and left him to die. No.one could seem to get him to come out when the cops were called to try and get him help. South Georgia equine ceo was contacted for help. She quickly decided to go and try to get this dog to safety. What she found under that mobile home was nothing short of walking death. (Picture of day of rescue included in photos) she quickly got him home. Wounds addresses and vet appointment for the following morning set up. Mange, emaciated, worms and just lack of medical care had ravaged marleys young body. He is just a year old now and all healed and ready to find his new home! Marley is very active and loves to play but he is a loud, rough playing dog so a home who is familiar with the breed is a must. A fenced in yard and home ownership applies to Marleys adoption. Marley is Hw negative, fixed and up to date on everything. Please fill out the application at sger.petfinder.com to get started and email Sgequinerescue@gmail.com to prompt adoption application approval.",

            "description": "Meet our beautiful Cowgirl, Belle Starr is a beautiful female Heeler mix of 3 years old and 35 lbs. Her face has a darling mask on it, so cute! Named after a famous cowgirl of the West, Belle is sure to be your best friend and companion for many sunsets over the range!\n\nBelle is calm, quite, submissive, affectionate, friendly and easy going. She is very shy at first, but warms up quickly in the right environment. She lived in the country, on her own, for a few years, with other dogs (including her off spring), until we apprehended all of them in September. Now, she is ready to find a special place to call home.\n\nBelle is a great eater and is crate trained. She is also house trained. She has lived with other dogs. A slow and methodical introduction to other dogs went well and she is co-habitating nicely in her foster home with other dogs. We think she would also do pretty well with a cat, if introduced slowly and appropriately too.\n\nBelle has a gentle and sensitive spirit about her but as mentioned above, she is VERY shy and needs ample time with her new people to warm up to everything that will be new to her. If you aren't willing to be patient, she isn't the dog for you. If you are willing to be patient, she will be the best dog you have ever owned, trust us! She will do best in a home that is calm, without kids under the age of 12. \n\nShe enjoys some tuff toys, nyla bones and loves a Kong filled with peanut butter and kibble. She will do best when fed her meals in a crate or baby gated from other dogs.\n\nIf you are interested in this dog, please contact volunteer Amy at amyh@rescuednready.com or at 918-688-0755. You can also fill out an application at www.rescuednready.com and send it to us for our review!\n\nADOPTIONS ONLY TO PEOPLE LIVING IN THE NORTHEASTERN OKLAHOMA AREA.  \n\nThe adoption fee is $225.00 and includes all current vaccinations, negative heartworm test, worming, microchip, and spay/neuter surgery.  Go to www.rescuednready.com to learn about our adoption process and download our application.  \n\nCALL or EMAIL US TO MEET ONE OF OUR ADOPTABLE DOGS! Call Amy at 918-688-0755 or email at amyh@rescuednready.com.\n\nLIKE RESCUED 'N READY ON FACEBOOK!!",

I am around 8 years old, I was surrendered to these humans when my family had to move and couldn't take me with them. I have kind of a rough past, so I do take a minute to warm up to new people but once I do, I am fiercely loyal. I have lived with another dog in the past, however, I may require multiple meet and greets in order to gain a canine sibling. I do very well with kids but am not fond of cats. I know my basic commands and walk excellent on a leash (P.S. I LOVE to go for walks!) I am looking for a very quiet home with minimal visitors (regular visitors that he knows would be fine). I am up to date on vaccines, prevention, and am neutered, microchipped and heartworm negative!",

            "description": "Princess is a 6-7yr old mixed breed of some sort (built, looks and acts like a cattle dog mix). She is now at an ideal weight of 40# and doing wonderfully. Princess is a miracle pup as she joined us when we were picking up some kittens from the local shelter and she had been found tied to a shelter fence - emaciated and with a huge mass on her neck. She was already spayed, clean and sweet - but very much scared and sick. Legally the shelter has to hold onto stray for a certain period of time in case someone is truly looking for them. We committed to hold onto her as a fospice for the weekend as the vet there said she had an \"inoperable\" mass and should be euthanized. Over the weekend, she was not well overall but still eating, drinking, loved toys and gave lots of kisses - by Monday we could not just hand her over and not try. We scheduled her for full work up (rads, lab work, etc) and got a second opinion. Just forward a month later - Princess had surgery and masses (2) were able to be fully removed. The biopsy did show adenocarcinoma of her thyroid but margins were good and all diagnostics showed no signs of spreading. Other than the large scar from her surgery, she is now unrecognizable and prognosis is amazingly good! It is very much possible that later the cancer pops back up elsewhere but all studies say that is usually years later, if so. She is very much full of life. Very sweet, perfectly housebroken, crate and leashed trained and loves to play. She is great with dogs and cats if properly introduced and the right match.",

Requirements include; a bed for me to sleep on, snacks offered whenever I request, lots of quality time spent together, and absolutely no cats lurking around the house (have you seen their knife fingers?!). I may enjoy living with another dog the same size as me or larger, it may even help with my anxiety of being left alone! Puzzle games and training classes would be very beneficial to me as well being the smarty pants dog that I am. If you think you would like to be my new best friend, fill out an application and call for more information so we can meet! \n\nPlacement Recommendations: \nOwner Experience Level: Experienced\nCats: No Thank You\nDogs: Yes (large dogs)\nKids: Middle School +Want to know more? Please call us! We've found that back and forth via email regarding a specific animal is not always effective and quick because our email is not monitored on a regular basis. So, for specific information regarding this wonderful pet, please contact one of our adoption counselors at (715) 232-9790. They are available between the hours of 8 am and 7 pm (7 days a week, excluding holidays). Thanks for your interest!",

            "description": "This beautiful babe is still searching for a forever of her own (its hard to believe, we know!). Kai is a 1 year old pointer mix, weighing in just around 40 lbs. She is a happy, energetic, and playful girl. Kai tends to be fairly calm inside the house (loves to lounge, loves her squeaky toys, and chewing on bones, etc.) but gets more excitable and energetic once she is outdoors. Similarly, during the day, she is wide awake and full of energy...while after supper she is ready to just settle in and snuggle/keep you warm. She LOVES to run, and is lightning fast! When outdoors, Kai is very focused on her surroundings and/or movement, such as wildlife and people + dogs walking by. Her foster family feels that she would do best in a home that has experience with a high energy pup like Kai. She is such a smart cookie; she knows how to sit, shake, stay, and does a good job of minding her manners. She is crate-trained and fully potty-trained. Kai has also spent some time with our amazing trainers at Fun Fur Pets, and below outlines further the ideal home environment to ensure that Kai (in all her energy!) is successful:\n\n1 Kai needs a fenced-in yard (6ft+). \n2 Kai loves other dogs and loves to play with them, so any other dogs in the home should also love to play. She plays pretty rough, so will need dogs her size (40 lbs) or larger. She would also do just fine as an only dog! \n3 Kai needs a home with no kids (ages 16+ would be ok), as she has herding tendencies and will likely try to herd/chase them.\n4 Kai needs a home without cats, chickens, or other small animals.\n\nAll in all, Kai is truly such a fun-loving, energetic, goofy girl, who has such a zest for life! More than anything, she just needs that perfect family who understands her and her needs. If you think thats you, please reach out to us (or complete an adoption application at https://newleashdogrescue.com) to learn more about adopting this beautiful girl! \n\n**Kais $200 adoption fee includes her spay, vaccinations, heartworm test, and microchip.",

She may be nervous when she first meets new people, but then she becomes their very comfortable best friend, so grateful to have their loving attention - and their cuddles. Mama is happy to be a best friend for people and other dogs. She adores the doggie companion in her foster home, and they are so affectionate to each other. She's also a calm, kind lady who loves playing with any toy and running in the backyard. She was an excellent mother to her litter of puppies, and now that they're off to new homes, she's ready to begin her training. She can do well on her leash walking, still pulling some and trying to run toward those squirrels and rabbits she sees. And she's making progress on answering to 'sit' and 'stay.' She's also house-trained and doing well in her pen, staying there when home alone. Mama J is a curious girl who's eager to learn and will do well in a family home. She'd especially love to go on frequent walks. She is heartworm positive, but all that means is that she'll need a couple of months of rest during treatment, at APA!'s expense. Come meet this adorable girl!",

            "description": "Do you feel that there's a distinct lack of doggy kisses in your life? If so, Ella has got you covered! This energetic lady is most at home when she's climbing into your lap and showering you with kisses, and will happily follow you around the house to provide this service free of charge. Ella does understand the need for space though and will trot off to enjoy some of her other favorite pastimes if you're busy, such as chewing on squeaky toys, snoozing on the couch, or at your feet, or watching the squirrels in the backyard. Playing fetch is also a favorite of hers, and she enjoys long, quiet walks around the neighborhood. Her main goal in life, however, is definitely to be a master class snuggle buddy. And did we mention the kisses? In addition to being a nonstop love machine, Ella is house trained and does well when left home alone for short periods. She's working on her basic commands and walking skills and is proving to be a quick learner, partially due to being very treat- and affection-motivated - she already has 'sit' mostly down and is working on learning to hold the position for long amounts of time. Finding someone who is eager to help further her training would be absolutely wonderful for her! Loud noises and other dogs can still be a little much for her right now, however, so she would really flourish in a quiet home with active adults, preferably where she's the only dog while she works on her doggy socialization skills. So if you're looking for a being of pure energy and love packed into one wiggly little body, come meet Ella today!",

            "description": "Candy is a very special lady who has had a tough life, but it has not let it get her down. She has to be one of the most loving dogs that her foster has ever been around. Her eyes follow you with a look of affection everywhere you go. I almost think she would trade food (which she adores) for getting her ears scratched! Candy has a fractured vertebra near her tail with spinal cord damage. She has some use of her left hind leg and is able to hop around and very limited, if any, use of her right hind leg. She can handle a single step from the house to the yard, but not more than one. She was not a fan of using a wheelchair, preferring to hop (sometimes with a good deal of speed)! She likes to go on short trips in the front yard to sniff at things (maybe a hundred feet in any direction). Candy also likes to snooze on her bed or lay in the sun outside. She's a very easygoing companion. Despite her injuries, Candy just loves her humans. She likes to follow her foster family around the house so she can be in the same room, and she loves to have her ears scratched. She is not very needy or pushy about getting attention, and will happily settle down to wait until you are ready. Candy lives with two pups in her foster home, one large and one small, and she has tried to play with them some, but she isn't too mobile due to her paralysis. They mostly hang out on dog beds together and watch for people jogging by when in the backyard. She has also interacted very well with a 6 year old child who understands that she is special. Candy is very interested in new people, likes to sniff and let them pet her. Candy does great when her humans are away, whether she is inside or outside of the crate. She will wait patiently by the door for her people to return. Candy does not have control of her bladder or stool due to her back injury. Her foster parents keep her in diapers when inside, and usually take them off when she goes outside. Candy is a smart lady who will follow commands when told to go inside/outside. She also understands when told to go to her 'pillow' (dog bed) or 'box' (crate). An ideal home for Candy would be one with no stairs, and with someone who is around to give her lots of pets and just hang out with, and someone who is patient with her toileting needs. Do you have the ability to take care of this sweet and loving special needs pup? Then come meet Candy today!",

We would prefer to place Cinnabun in a home with no other dogs or young children under age 13.\n\nCinnabun is spayed, and up to date on shots and preventatives. All she needs is a loving Furever Home to bring out all her best qualities. Cinnabun's adoption donation is $300.\n\nCinnabun is currently in South Carolina with our Partner Rescue. We will arrange a video chat for a motivated adopter so you can see her behavior and interaction prior to adoption.\n\nTransport can be arranged at a separate fee with our experienced rescue dog transporter who provides door-to-door intro to your home at your convenience and a home-check.\n\nPlease COPY & PASTE our Adoption application LINK into your browser:\nhttps://form.jotform.com/GFS_nj/ADOPT_FOSTER_Application\n\nWe will respond immediately!",

He is part chih and part manchester terrier. He is very sweet and lovable. He is around 25 pounds. He is lanky with long legs, but technically still a small dog. He is excellent with other dogs and he loves cats. He is shy at first with new people, but he warms up. He needs time to warm up on his own terms though! Once he does he will be your best friend. He needs a home with no children. He does not like rough handling. He would be best suited for a laid back confident person. His favorite thing in the whole world is to cuddle with his person on the couch.\n\nHe is current on shots, current on de-worming and flea prevention. He is also microchipped and neutered and on heartworm prevention.\n\nWe do require a pre screen application to apply. You can get that on our main web site.",

            "description": "PLEASE NOTE:\n\n- REQUIRES A HOME WITH FENCED YARD\n- REQUIRES ANOTHER DOG IN THE HOME\n- EXPECTED TO BE A LARGE DOG (estimated adult weight 50-70lbs)\n\nNAME: CAROLE BRADSHAW\n\nLITTER: CAROLE is part of the \"TOP GUN\" litter\n\nAGE/GENDER: 6 MONTH OLD, FEMALE\n\nBREED: HUSKY MIX\n\nADOPTION DONATION: $525.00\n\nTEMPERAMENT: Playful and mischievous\nHOUSE TRAINING: Not yet. She is a baby so she'll need a consistent schedule with multiple opportunities daily to go outside while she works on it. Puppies should not be considered reliable in regard to house training until 6-12 months of age. They're a lot like toddlers, who require diapers.\nCRATE TRAINING: Good, she's young and trainable\nOTHER DOGS: Good! She will need continued socialization, like all puppies. Another dog in the home is required as Huskies are very social breeds and can often get lonely without another companion. Dog companion must be medium to large size as Huskies do have a prey drive.\nCATS: Would do best WITHOUT cats in the home.\nCHILDREN: Dog-respectful children, 8 and older\n\nHEALTH: CAROLE is healthy. She is altered, microchipped, flea treated, and dewormed. She has been given vaccination boosters in our care; however, adoptive families will be responsible for the remaining vaccinations that puppies need. Your adoption donation goes toward the cost of her vet care as well as transportation and general care costs.\n\nHISTORY: CAROLE and her siblings came to us from Mexico where they were born under a car. Fortunately, they were found and saved. Motley Zoo Animal Rescue was asked to find them a great forever family and that is exactly what we plan to do.\n\nNOTES FROM FOSTER HOME: CAROLE is a puppy so she's playful and has a lot of puppy energy. She is super cute and fun, but a lot of work. Her forever family should be committed to lots of training - obedience, house training, and socialization. This will ensure that CAROLE grows into a confident, well behaved adult. Puppies' personalities are dependent on their environment, and the structure and training they are given, in addition to socialization. Their personalities continue to grow and be shaped by their new adoptive families. Puppy daycare and socialization classes or puppy kindergarten are highly recommended for their personal development. She will more than reward you for all your hard work with lots of love, loyalty, and laughs.\n\nAll dogs adopted from Motley Zoo come with a leash and either a Martingale collar or a harness, depending on each dog's particular needs.\n\nABOUT MOTLEY ZOO\n\nWelcome to Motley Zoo Animal Rescue. We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit animal rescue organization that is run entirely by volunteers. Motley Zoo does not have a brick and mortar shelter location. Instead, all our rescue animals are cared for in private foster homes where the animals receive one-on-one care and attention in a home environment until permanent placement is found. Please email adopt@motleyzoo.org and request an adoption application and we will work toward approving you as an adopter with our rescue so that we can set a time for you to meet!\n\nFor more information, please visit www.motleyzoo.org.\n\nThank you for considering adopting a dog in need!\n\nWoof,\n\nThe Motley Zoo Crew",

H e is great with other dogs and kids. Puppies do require training and supervision.From the foster... His start in life was pretty rough. However you would not know it by his personality as he is a big lover who just wants to please his human. He gets along very well with the resident dog in the house. Dusty is around 45-50lbs and had no real training. He is housebroken and has learned to sit and is working on his down. He is a fast learner! Since he had no prior training he has a lot puppy tendencies. Dusty is going to need training and exercise. A fenced yard would be ideal for him as he still needa to learn to walk better on a leash. Because of his size he might be too much for little kids as Dusty can get really excited. Another dog in the house would be great but not needed. Dusty is going to be great addition for someone or a family! Priority will go to applicant who can bring him to a vet visit in Maple Grove, MN prior to adoption. Please put in your application on our website mattysheartandsoulanimalrescue.rescuegroups.org",

            "description": "This handsome lad is Tup!  He's a 4 year old Coonhound mix who weighs in at 52 pounds.  Tup may have been an outdoor dog for most of his life because he is much happier when he gets to go outside.  He'll need an owner with dog experience who can help him build his confidence inside the home, but also be willing to keep him active with outdoor activities.\n\nTup is a friendly, happy-go-lucky kind of guy.  He has a lot of energy and loves to play - especially with stuffed animals.  Tup carries them with him everywhere, walking proudly with his tail wagging the entire time!  He even picked out his own stuffed animal to bring with him to his first vet appointment!!\n\nHe loves car rides, but due to his energy one of his favorite volunteers recommends that he be crated for the ride.  Safety first!  Tup's friend walks him every weekend and she said his demeanor outside of the shelter is night and day from when they are inside.  Tup calms down tremendously once outside the building.  He walks calmly and then army crawls into her lap for cuddles when they stop for a break.  She said Tup is so loving and calm when he's in his element.  \n\nDue to Tup's size and energy, we are requesting a home with no children under the age of 10 years old.  He can become mouthy and jumpy when he's anxious.  Again, he needs an adopter with dog experience who can help build his confidence and help him become the best version of himself.\n\nTup can't wait to find his perfect home and a buddy to take him on lots of walks and fun outdoor adventures!  If you think you can provide Tup with a great home, apply today!  He'll be sure to give you lots of love and laughter in return!! His minimum adoption fee is $275 plus a $12 fee, if 4 months or older, for rabies registration for McLean County residents.\n\nHe has been neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm checked, dewormed, and is on flea and heartworm preventatives.\n\nFor information about this dog's breed(s), visit: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/abc.htm \n\nTo fill out our adoption application, go to: http://fs16.formsite.com/WishBoneCanineRescue/adoptionapplication/index.html",

Its hard to tell which he likes best solving puzzles, playing fetch and tug-of-war, or reclining on the couch with a chew toy. Beckham is considered special needs, behaviorally - he is very protective of his personal space, and will react if people get too close, or pet him for too long. Beckham needs a patient, devoted person who will earn his trust, and respect his boundaries. Animal Aid will provide free sessions with Beckham's certified fear free / positive reinforcement trainer to help that special person learn how to help this special dog. Potential adopter must have a securely fenced yard, and live in an adult-only household. Beckham is dog-selective; an introduction with your dog will be required. If you are interested in meeting Beckham, please contact our Training Coordinator at training@animalaidsociety.org * Will consider adopters outside of a 40 mile radius of the shelter.",

            "description": "Willow is a very sweet, smart and independent girl. She knows a handful of basic cues, loves hanging out curled up in the doggie bed with her favorite stuffy and on occasion, shell even engage in a game of fetch. Her favorite thing to do is sniff sniff sniff! Willow is a behavioral special needs dog as she is very protective of her toys and food. We recently learned she may have a food allergy and has had multiple ear infections, so she has a sensitivity to things around her head including a collar and harness. Once the relationship and trust is built Willow is very attached to her person and will always be right by your side. Willow needs a patient, devoted person who will earn his trust, and respect his boundaries. Animal Aid will provide free sessions with Willow's certified professional trainer to help that special person learn how to help this special dog. Potential adopter must have a securely fenced yard, and live in an adult-only household. If interested in meeting Willow, please contact our Training Coordinator at training@animalaidsociety.org * Will consider adopters outside of a 40 mile radius of the shelter.",

            "description": "Archie is a 2 year old GSD mix. He has a floppy ear that stands up when he is really interested in something (like a squirrel). He is quirky, funny and just a 78# love bug.\nHe is friendly with everyone he meets and generally all about the lovin and ear scratches and belly rubs. He is a  strong boy so can be a bit enthusiastic at times and needs some direction to calmly sit for attention. He does live in a foster home with 2 female GSD's. He plays rough and tumble with the younger GSD and will engage the older GSD when she lets him. He does need direction at times to not push play and he is learning this skill.  He can be picky about his \"male dog\" friends and also can be exuberant with meeting some dogs. This will need a strong leader, supervision and managing to insure he develops a positive relationship with other dogs in the home. He needs a home that will allow him time before introducing him to new dogs in the home. Archie due to size, strength and play style is not recommended for small dogs or cats. He is working on his doggy introductions skills so his future home would need to set him up for success by guidance and supervision. \nAfter a good walk and some play time he is content to lay at your feet and hang out. He is crate trained and housebroken. He has met children and been open and friendly with them but his size and strength is a consideration for very young children. Teenage children or older is recommended. He can be mouthy at times in play but very responsive to a simple \"stop\" in play and he gets the idea. He is learning good leash skills and basic sit and stay . He is strong and will test if his leader \"means it\" and so firm consistent direction is needed while on leash. He would benefit from continued training in basic obedience. He is very treat and food motivated. He loves toys of all kinds, especially  chew bones and \"stuffies\".  He truly is a pleasure to be around and a great companion. He loves to go on hikes, play in the yard and travels great in the car! This dog is the complete package!\n\n\n***** Adoption Fee: $350 \n\n ***** NOTE to those viewing this profile on Petfinder.com: Visit our website for more information about our policies.

He came to us after another rescue reached out to see if we could help after he had been passed up by adopters for years. \n\nPauly is a very strong, but also puppy-like guy! He loves exploring & is very curious about everything in the world. When he\u2019s not busy exploring, he loves curling up in one of his many different & quite humorous sleeping positions. \n\nHe would benefit from an active home with previous bully breed experience. He would prefer a feline free, adult home. While he enjoys going on walks with other dogs, he would likely do best in the home as the only dog, but may be willing to share his home with a dog permitting a successful introduction! \n\nWe would like to do a short foster-to-adopt trial for Pauly to make sure that the match is right for both him and his family.\n\nTo foster-to-adopt please fill out the form at our website - https://www.furryfriendsct.org/adoption-application\n\nPLEASE NOTE: To foster-to-adopt Pauly, you need to be a resident of Connecticut.",

This poor boy has been through so much, between living in misery for almost the whole first year of his life, this boy had emergency surgery, that ultimately saved his life shortly after coming into rescue due to previous care before coming to us. \n\nAfter all of his hurdles, this boy is finally ready to start the life he so very much deserves. Chip is initially a bit shy around new people, but warms up very quickly! Once he\u2019s comfortable this boy is fully of puppy energy! He would benefit from an active, bully breed savvy family, that can help burn off his energy.\n\nChip is a very smart boy, he knows sit, down, stay, & paw! He is also crate trained & house broken! Chip would love if his new family can continue to work on his training & exposing to him the outside world he finally getting to live in! He has a very sensitive side, so he needs a family who focuses on primarily positive reinforcement based training so he can continue to have exciting experiences! \n\nChip is working on his manners around other dogs, he does well walking with them, but for now would likely do best as the only dog in the home. He is a bit too much for feline friends or small children! Chip would make an amazing addition to a home with older children or an adult home!\n\nWe would like to do a short foster-to-adopt placement for Chip to make sure he and his new family are the right match for each other.\n\nTo foster-to-adopt please fill out the application at our website - https://www.furryfriendsct.org/adoption-application\n\nPLEASE NOTE: To foster-to-adopt Chip you need to be a resident of Connecticut.",

            "description": "NOTE: Dori is now in the adoption room at the OKC Shelter! \nDori is a special dog that needs a special kind of person. She didn't have the greatest start in life but she's ready for her restart! She may flinch if you are too quick with hand movements. Despite her past, Dori is still ready to love. Once she knows she's safe she is the sweetest, most loyal, playful little girl. She is HOUSEBROKEN, knows FETCH, walks well on a leash, and sleeps in a crate all night. She's a quiet dog. Due to her uncertainty of people at first, Dori needs a home with adults only (may be ok with older children (13+) that will respect her space and give her time to warm up to them). If you think you might be a good fit for Dori but aren't sure, ask about FLASH FOSTERING her before adopting her. You can take her home and see if she would be a good match. If you have any questions about Dori, feel free to reach out to (Karly), her former foster mom  kbootz44@aol.com\n\n\nThe dog/cat adoption fee, which is normally $60 unless we are having a special, includes spay or neuter, MICROCHIP, age-appropriate shots and health check. The shelter is at 2811 S.E. 29th St., phone # 297-3100. Use pet's ID # when inquiring. Special Adoption Fees: In the following cases, the adoption fee is $30-if more than one pet is adopted, if the pet is 4 years of age or older, if the pet has been in the adoption center more than 2 weeks, and if the pet is a 'special needs' pet.",

I enjoy playing with my foster siblings and would do well in a home with other large, energetic, playful dogs. I have not been around cats or children, but my foster parents believe I would do fine in a home with older children. I get very excited at times, so I would probably accidentally knock over the littles. When I'm not playing, I absolutely love to cuddle and will let you rub my ears for hours. I am mostly crate trained, but I can be pretty vocal when I'm ready to be let out. I can be trusted to roam free with my foster siblings, but have been caught pulling things off the coffee table. Oops. I have also chewed a hole in my foster dad's slipper. I was just trying to create some air flow, but he didn't appreciate the help. So now my foster family is teaching me what is and isn't acceptable behavior. I walk well on a leash and enjoy learning new commands. I have a beautiful brindle coat that has tendency to shed quite a bit, but that is the only mess I make inside since I am housebroken. I enjoy meeting new people, making new friends and going on adventures. I love car rides, but get nervous to actually get in the car. Hopefully with time I'll just jump right in! I am looking for a forever home with a patient family that loves to work on training, play and cuddle! I am recovering from heartworm treatment, so I won't be available until just after Thanksgiving. I am being fostered near Greensboro. If you would like to add me to your family, please contact your adoption coordinator. If you do not have an adoption coordinator, please fill out an adoption application on our website: https://freedomgermanshepherdrescue.org.",

My name is Slye and I'm the sweetest (and handsomest) eight-year-old boy you'll ever meet!\n\nI am friendly with people and small dogs and naturally prefer women. It's not that I don't like the big dogs, I do, I just prefer hanging around with the littles. I don't need to be the only man in your life, though, either. I'm good at sharing. I'm way too interested in cats and chickens so a home without them would be best.\n\nI'm very affectionate and want all of the love you can give me. I'm also learning to play. I've discovered that I love Nylabones and other chew toys. I really like the plush toys, too, but I'll shred them pretty quickly. It's just so fun!\n\nI'm crate trained and that's where I sleep when you aren't home. I'm also housebroken but still have accidents sometimes. My new foster family is diligently trying to teach me to walk appropriately on the leash. I was hit by a car in my younger days, so now I get pretty anxious when vehicles pass. I'm a work in progress, so my new family will have to continue teaching me leash manners.\n\nIf you would like to add me to your family, please contact your adoption coordinator.

My name is Patches and I\u2019m seven years old and weigh 45lbs. I am a former hunting dog and I am just loving the retirement life. I can play, lay around, and follow my sniffer outside whenever I want - life is great. \n\nLiving full time inside has me learning new manners. Who knew you were allowed to walk on living room tables? Bathroom manners are on point, though. \n\nMy favorite place to hang out is my crate. I have tons of blankets, a pillow, and my hoard of stuffed animals. I can sleep for hours BUT when it\u2019s time for the pack to go outside - count me in! I like to run and do zoomies and it\u2019s a game to see who can run back inside the house the fastest. I ALWAYS win that game because I am FAST!  I also love to roll around in the grass and leaves on my back and do squiggle wiggles. I\u2019m fun to be around and sweet as can be.\n\nA yard with a six foot fence would be nice. It would keep me safe because although I may not want to, I could jump over a lower fence easy-peasy. I also am lightning fast to bolt for the front door as soon as it opens. Until I learn you\u2019re the boss, you\u2019ll want to keep an eye on me. I correct well in the meantime. I\u2019m really a good girl, I just need to know the rules. \n\nWell, it\u2019s been real nice chatting with you. I hope you stop by to meet me sometime soon. I had a great Christmas with my foster family but I am ready to start the new year with my new family!\n\nFun fact about Patches: we use the squirt bottle to correct undesired behaviors and the first time she was squirted, she looked at the ceiling like it was raining.\n\nYou can come adopt me or even join our foster program to help the humans learn all the awesome things about new dogs like me! Learn more on our website! \n\nHope to see you soon! \n\nWhat breed am I? Mixed mutt! ODHS does not breed label (unless there\u2019s official paperwork), as studies show it is nearly impossible to tell the exact breed of each dog based off of their appearance.\n\nEducational articles:\n3/3/3 Rule;\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturday from 12-2.  On Saturday's from 2-4pm, the events are open to the public. \nOur adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience.  Currently, the average timeframe for a response to your application is 1 week.\n\nLike us on Facebook \"Old Dominion Humane Society\"\nand be a part of promoting forever homes for dogs in need.\n#Adopt #Donate #Foster #Volunteer \n\nNote: ODHS only adopts to Virginia and surrounding states (including D.C.). A $50 out of state fee applies.",

I love other dogs and attention from people and lots of snuggle time, but I also love alone time to do my life pondering and (nap). I am great in a crate and I lay quietly.  Sometimes I go in to lay down even when I don\u2019t need to be in there. \n\nI think I would be a great coffee and newspaper reading buddy. I am not too much of an eager walker. I love the backyard at my foster family\u2019s home. I enjoy exploring, running, and sniffing.' The other night I got spooked and jumped their 4 ft fence. I am home safe and sound now.  BUT because of this, IF you have a fence to let me out unleashed, ODHS would like it to be a 6ft fence to keep me safe.\n\nI am fine with short walks but not really excited about long walks. I love car rides and I am almost positive I would like to stick my nose out the window, but it\u2019s cold right now.\n\nI am a little jumpy at loud noises but don\u2019t care when the doorbell rings. I avoid furniture until I know I am invited. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a best buddy - THAT\u2019s a job I would happily do. Come meet me soon.\n\nWhat breed am I? Mixed mutt! ODHS does not breed label (unless there\u2019s official paperwork), as studies show it is nearly impossible to tell the exact breed of each dog based off of their appearance.\n\nEducational articles:\n3/3/3 Rule;\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturday from 12-2. \nOur adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience.  Currently, the average timeframe for a response to your application is 1 week.\n\nLike us on Facebook \"Old Dominion Humane Society\"\nand be a part of promoting forever homes for dogs in need.\n#Adopt #Donate #Foster #Volunteer \n\nNote: ODHS only adopts to Virginia and surrounding states (including D.C.). A $50 out of state fee applies.",

Do you want an easy walking partner? Goose walks nicely on a leash; our Junior volunteers love walking Goose, too. He's an easy going boy!! He knows SIT and is a quick learn and happy to please his people! He'd be happy to travel in the car with you as well\n\nEven though he will play a bit of tug-o-war with you; he'd be just as happy relaxing next to you; high energy he is NOT!\n\nHe is a 5-yr old GENTLEman; 60lb male Boxer mix. He loves everyone he meets and is a quick to give you a little kiss! He has been good with older children and very polite with excellent manners. Goose does need to be the only dog.\n\nAs part of Goose's $250 adoption fee, he is neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccines, and current on his monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventatives. If you have questions about this sweet boy, email Dogteam@pawsforlifenc.org. If you wish to adopt Goose, you can fill in an online application for him under the Adopt a Pet Tab on our website: www.pawsforlifenc.org\n\nPlease note that Goose is a courtesy post and is available for adoption with Paws for Life NC.",

Note: Only those with a responsible dog ownership history and excellent vet reference need apply.\n\n(For more pics, visit nr2r.petfinder.com or www.RoadtoRescueLA.org)\n\nINSTRUCTIONS TO APPLY:\n\nPLEASE read profile thoroughly BEFORE applying:\n\nDOG APPLICATION LINK: http://www.roadtorescuela.org/dog-application\n\nMakayla (female)\n\nOriginal intake date: 6/9/2020\n\nAdopted: 9/30/2020\n\nReturned: 11/24/2020\n\nMaltese/ Poodle mix\n\nApprox 13 years old\n\n6.10 pounds\n\nAdoption fee: $waived to RESPONSIBLE pet owner\n\nGood with other dogs: yes\n\nCats: yes\n\nVetting: altered (spayed/neutered), UTD on shots, heartworm negative, fecal negative, dental performed in June, groom done after she was returned (because she came back matted and unkept), on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention, microchipped\n\nHealth issues: blind and deaf; seizures (from when she was adopted - skull fracture - read profile - on Phenobarbital)\n\nTemperament: quiet, can get panicky if unfamiliar situations; when she's comfortable she will relax\n\nEnergy level: low once she's comfortable\n\nGroom needs: High; requires regular professional grooming, along with intermittent brushing to avoid matting\n\nBiography: Where do we start? We will start with when Makayla came to us. She came to us in June with a large infected injury on her back. She was found as a stray and we posted trying to find the owner but no one ever came forward. We had her vetted and the wound treated. Once the scabbing from the wound fell off we saw three puncture wounds which led us to believe that she was picked up by a likely a hawk or owl but she won that battle. She was with us for three months until what we thought was the perfect application came in. The applicant had been in rescue and also worked at a vet clinic. We felt confident Makayla would be cared for a loved for the rest of her life. About a month into the adoption we received a message from the adopter that Makayla had a seizure and was rushed to the ER (the adopter is not local). She messaged us asking if we'd ever seen her have a seizure before and we had not and advised her as such. We asked her to keep us posted and she did and Makayla was placed on seizure medication. Not more than a week later, we get a message she's having to move. Makayla gets returned and that is when we find out that Makayla didn't just start having seizures she fell off the bed and fractured her skull! We have ER vet records indicating as such. We understand that accidents happen but to give the impression that the seizures just started happening out of the blue is just wrong and especially for someone who works at a vet clinic and who was supposedly in rescue and then to return her is just plain cruel. We feel we failed her but we won't fail her again. Makayla is a sweet girl. If you watch her video you will see that she does bump into things. The video was taken in a place where she's not accustomed but she will learn her surroundings given time. She does use potty pads. She needs an understanding, caring and loving home who is willing to continue to manage her seizures with Phenobarbital and vet checkups as necessary. We realize she's elderly and now with a skull fracture and seizures, she may not live a long time but she has surprised us time and time again. PLEASE do not apply if you are not prepared for a blind and deaf dog. They take special care and time. We plan to make sure that this time her adoptive home will be her furever home.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES**\n\n*We do adopt out of state provided the adopter is willing and able to travel to us once approved. We do not ship or transport our animals and there is no exception to this rule.\n\n*All of our adoptable dogs are small, and they are never to be left outside alone, ever! We only rehome our dogs to adopters that plan to have them as inside dogs and part of the family! We do allow adopters with doggie doors, provided there is SECURE fencing. There is no exception to this rule!\n\n*NO SMALL CHILDREN!! As with almost all the dogs at NR2R, young children or a very active household is not recommended. Many of our dogs come to us BECAUSE of small children, thus we do not rehome our dogs to homes with babies or young children. KEEP THIS IN MIND IF YOU HAVE VISITING GRANDCHILDREN AS WELL! Even if the children are older, it would depend on the child AND the parent or parents.\n\n*HOUSETRAINING: We do NOT guarantee that any of our adoptable dogs are housetrained. While most should be easily trained, keep in mind that they live in a rescue where they have access to the outdoors all day and are inside at night. Even if they were surrendered to us as housetrained, it doesn't mean they will automatically be housetrained in your home. Housetraining them should be easy in the right home with time, patience, and consistency.\n\n*We do not guarantee the age, health or temperament of any of the dogs we rehome. Many of the dogs we take in come from animal control and rarely do we have histories and even when we do, many times the histories are inaccurate.\n\n*Only adopters with a responsible dog ownership history and excellent vet reference need apply. If you bring this pet into your heart and home, you will receive in return many years of love, companionship, and loyalty. That's our guarantee.\n\nOther notes: This pet is available for adoption through Ninna's Road to Rescue, Benton, La. We are 501c3 non-profit organization. Our mission is to rescue small-breed dogs and a handful of cats and to re-home them into RESPONSIBLE and CARING forever homes. DOG APPLICATION LINK: http://www.roadtorescuela.org/dog-application\n\nTime may be of the essence if you are looking to adopt a specific animal. We do not reserve animals, unless and until we have approved your application, provided the animal is still available at the time we receive your application. The first APPROVED application we receive will be considered. We are NOT a first come, first serve rescue!! We adopt our rescues out to the RIGHT home, not just A home. Only responsible pet owners need apply.\n\nApplying to adopt does NOT commit you to the adoption NOR does it guarantee the adoption.\n\nCONTACT: Our adoptable pets are updated regularly, but if you want to check the availability of a pet... OR still have questions AFTER reading this profile, message us via our Facebook page. Please indicate the name when communicating with us.\n\nwww.RoadtoRescueLA.org\n\n2/2/21 10:31 AM",

My foster siblings are teaching me how to play ball. We have lots of fun running around in the backyard. I love the fence, because I can roam and sniff as much as I want! I get along great with other dogs, so siblings would be great.\n\nI was with my original person for 13 years, and it's easy to see I was well cared for. I love my foster mom and follow her everywhere. It's pretty clear I also really \"dig\" (get it - dog humor!!) couches and chairs. Did you say you want a lap dog? Heck, pick me...even though I may have a few extra pounds on me, I am great at snuggling. I am about 68 pounds of love!\n\nI'm up to date on vaccines, dewormed and current on flea/tick prevention. My adoption fee is a bargain at $250! So please fill out the adoption form at http://pawsforlifenc.org/pet-adoptions/dog-adoptions/!\n\nPlease note that Rosco is a courtesy post and is available for adoption with Paws for Life NC.",

            "description": "Straight out of the pages of a comic book, this guy is sure to make you laugh!  if ever a dog was made up of spare parts, it would be Bongo. His head is waaay to o big for his body, his legs are too short, and he;s perhaps, a bit bowl- legged but you can;t help but love him.  Those eyes will just melt your heart!  He's all about people and food, and if they come together that's even better! He came us as a stray from another shelter where he had arrived with a nasty skin infection and was very skinny. His hair is slowly growing back in and he is now at  a good weight, but these things take time. \n\nHe really does enjoy his walks and would love a fenced yard to play ball in!\n\nHe loves large KONG Squeezz dumbbell, balls or ropes and will entertain himself for a good long time.  He would do well in a home with adults or older kids.  is fine on a leash when he sees other dogs on the street, but should be your only canine companion.  He really isn't into sharing his home with others. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting him please call the Humane Society of Schuyler County 607-594-2255 ext. 201\n\nAdoption Fee: $175  (dogs over 1 year) or $225 (dogs under 1 year) includes spay/neuter rabies, DHLPP and kennel cough vaccinations, worming, flea treatment, heartworm testing, heartworm preventative, microchipping and microchip registration fee. \n\nDue to Covid, we do not have open adoption hours. We are requesting that people fill out an adoption application first; then you can be pre-approved before your appointment. It does not obligate you to taking a dog. Details and applications can be found here: http://schuylerhumane.org/dog-adoption/\n\nVisit us on line at www.schuylerhumane.org for additional information, an adoption application, to see more adoptable dogs and cats or for directions to our shelter.",

She has raised many litters and kept them safe. She was finally caught by somebody who gained her trust. She was placed into a foster home with her puppies. Her puppies have now all been weaned and Heidi is ready for her own home.\n\n She will bond closely with her human, has learned to love having pets and affection and wants to please her people . She will take treats very gently, give you her paw, hunt moles in the field and has figured out what a walk is and really enjoys those. she would do best in a home with somebody who truly wants a rescue dog in the truest sense . A quiet home with love and patience and not a lot of other animals or chaos would be best for her. It\u2019s not that she\u2019s bad it\u2019s just that she still needs time to adjust to home life. She would do best with a fenced yard (must be over 4 ft so she can\u2019t jump it. )\n\n.

My name is Pretty Girl, and I am a special lady who needs a special person that will help me overcome my past and find my happy. Could that be you? I previously lived in a hoarding situation with 12 other dogs; I was bred and dumped at a shelter once I had my babies. As you can imagine, I am very shy and confused so I need a calm home where I will be given my own quiet space (maybe an extra bedroom?) to decompress and patient humans who will go slow with me so I can settle in and feel safe. I've learned in my foster home that I love lounging on the couch receiving as many cuddles as I can get, but still get overwhelmed by too much excitement so I think an adult-only home or home with older children who understand my shyness would be best for me. I am dog friendly, and would prefer any doggie pals in my forever home be calm and low energy like me. I'm potty and crate trained - I consider my crate my safe space and like having it as a place I can relax if I need a break - and would thrive with a family that will commit to signing me up for training so I can keep working on my confidence and blossom. I think training will be a great opportunity for us to strengthen our bond together, too!  If you think you could be the person to help me find my happily ever after, please fill out an application soon!\u00a0\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS, NO EXCEPTIONS:\n*ADOPTION FEE: $300\n*Be at least 21 years of age\n*Live in a 50-mile radius of Itasca, within the Illinois border\n*Have the knowledge and agreement of all adults living in the household\n*Have approval from owner of residence (written in lease)\n*Have a valid ID with current address (please provide proof of address if ID address is not up-to-date)\n*Be approved as a suitable adoptive home by Fetching Tails Foundation\n*Be prepared to make a lifetime commitment\n\nIf interested please fill out an application on our website at www.fetchingtailsfoundation.org; please make sure you fill in every required field/question or your submission will not go through. Please note that we take time to learn as much as we can about each dog in our care and our bios are our current observations; we are unable to make any guarantees on the future health or temperament of your adopted dog. Most dogs in our care come with unknown pre-rescue history and as such breed and age estimates are an educated guess.\n",

He was found in an empty field and it took several weeks to catch him.\n\nHe has trust issues and takes a while to warm up to people. Once he is used to you he loves snuggles and lots of attention. He is not a fan of hyper kids running around him because that makes him very nervous. \n\nHe cannot be around other dogs and would likely not be a good fit with cats, either. \n\nRiver is pretty low energy and will sleep most of the day right by your side. He does have a playful side and will play with toys. He is leash trained but when he is finished he will just plop down. He will cry when he needs to go outside and loves being outdoors.\n  \nRiver will take a while to decompress and will need a safe space in the house. \n\nOnce he warms up he will transform into a squishy lovable beast.\n\nYou can apply to meet/adopt River at www.muttmisfits.com/adoption-application.\n",

It has taken her some time to learn to trust people again and inside this beautiful creature we have found a loving, kind, silly and playful being. Several meetings with Peggy will be necessary for her to get to know and trust you. When she does, you will have a devoted friend for life! She will need a quiet home with adults only where she can concentrate on building her own confidence. A family with an understanding of pack leadership and obedience training would be great for her. Peggy has a lot of love to give.Call the shelter for more details and availability of this pet. 207 743-8679.

He does great with our lady dogs and with our altered males (we have a female in heat right now so the unaltered boys are a little on edge). Jannero walks great on leash, does well in his crate and kennel. He is house-trained and is not an indoor marker. Jannero\u2019s  handler loves him and wants Jannero to find his FOREVER home. \nTo get more information on a Pups On Parole dog, please contact a representative of the Lassen Humane Society at 530 251-7247 or e-mail ilovepopdogs@yahoo.com.  The Pups On Parole Program started in June of 2007 to help give homeless dogs a second chance at finding an adoptive family.  All dogs in the program spent time in our local county shelter, surrendered by their owners or picked up as strays and waiting for their owners to redeem them or to be adopted by new families.   The selected dogs are brought current on vaccinations, spayed/neutered if necessary, micro chipped, and heart worm tested.  They then are taken to the California Correctional Center Firehouse where they are assigned to a trainer/ inmate fire fighter.  These trainers groom and work with each dog and give them the extra time and attention they need to become wonderful family companions.   Most graduates are house trained and know basic obedience commands.  As of December 2018, 535 dogs have been adopted through this program.  To meet any of the Pups On Parole dogs, arrangements must be made in advance.",

She is GREAT with kids - loves them and thrives in a home with kiddos, but needs to be an only dog. \n\nWe aren\u2019t sure about Poe\u2019s background, but she has a lot of fear based reactivity when she sees other dogs. She will do best in a home as an only dog with a family that, with the help from our advice, will guide her towards being a well balanced dog. \n\nShe prefers a yard of her own, but it\u2019s not a requirement. \n\nPoe is crate trained, house broken, and loves to cuddle.\n\nIf you are looking for a dog to love you unconditionally, please visit our website and fill out an application to meet Poe\n\nCabullyrescue.org/adopt",

She wags all over when she sees children coming and has been very gentle with them. Her herding instincts make her less of a candidate for homes with cats, birds, or livestock. Evie gets along with other dogs and has been meeting some of her neighbors at the shelter. She is an active player and can hold her own with the big boys! Evie currently weighs in at 60 lbs.",

I am young so I have a large amount of puppy energy. I am looking for a special family that is very active and can give me the proper training I need because I unfortunately lack manners. I am very jumpy and I can get very mouthy so I am searching for a family that does not have young children, or cats. I am a great dog! I just need someone to devote proper time in training me and getting me on a consistent schedule. I love people and I want nothing more than to spend time with everybody! *Please apply on our website at indy.gov/activity/adopt-a-pet. Go to the website, click on the adoption application link, enter the information and hit submit. After the application is submitted a staff member will contact you within 48 hours. Thank you for your interest in adopting one of our FABULOUS PETS! We hope to see you soon, The IACS Adoptions Team.",

            "description": "Dasher came into our care as a young puppy with his mother and siblings, and was adopted out almost one year ago. At some point during his puppyhood he developed a sense of \"stranger danger,\" and he was returned to us as his adopter didn't feel equipped to handle this. \n\nDasher has a heart as big as his derpy head and that long tongue of his! He loves his friends immensely. When you are in his \"circle of trust,\" it's a great place to be! Dasher has lots of human friends. Making new friends takes time though, which slows down Dasher's adoption options. The company of other dogs, slow introductions with new humans, and pack walks have been great confidence boosters for Dasher, and he's enjoying the perks of hot dogs that come along with his training, when meeting new people. \n\nThe perfect foster or adoptive home for Dasher would be outside of the hustle and bustle of city life. A yard where he can stretch his long legs, a canine sibling or two, and dog savvy humans who understand patience and positive reinforcement training are all things on Dasher's wish list, this holiday season.\n\nDasher is fully potty trained, neutered, and up to date on his vaccines. If Dasher sounds like a match for your pack apply today at http://www.aliverescue.org/adoption-application",

            "description": "Hi my name is Jade and did you know that my name symbolizes harmony and balance? I am a 5 year old female Pointer mix who weighs about 70 pounds. I am unsure of new people, so it takes me time to warm up, but once I do I will give you kisses, cuddle and give you paw. I take treats gently and am very food motivated. I know the sit command and the paw command and will reach out my paw in friendship. I would do best in a home with no other dogs or young children. You can also watch for stories, pictures and videos about me on our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/groups/40103261297/ Ask to meet me today!!\n \nAdoption fee: $375\n \nAdoption fees for all dogs/puppies include a $50 refundable training deposit. Complete your basic training program and provide a copy of the certificate within 4 months (120 days) of adoption and we will refund $50 of the original adoption fee.\n \nAll dogs/puppies have been fully vetted including spay/neuter, micro-chipping, worming, heartworm testing and preventative treatment, flea/tick preventative, and all required age appropriate vaccinations. As required by Wisconsin Act 90, all dogs will have received a veterinarian exam (CVI) within the past 30 days.\n \nOur adoption process requires the submission of an application. Applications and Adoption Rules can be found on our website, on the \"HOW TO ADOPT\" tab at JRsPupsNStuff.org. Upon receipt of the completed application, we will process the application including: contact with your veterinarian and completion of a home visit. Please be sure to include the contact information for your vet as we will call. If your vet requires an information release, please be sure to contact them as soon as you submit your application. We are a group of volunteers with families and jobs, so please be patient and allow a few days for our response.\n \nJR's Pups-N-Stuff Dog Sellers License 270089-DS",

            "description": "Sierra is a typical hound dog. She LOVES to play fetch with a tennis ball. She loves to run so definitely needs an active owner and a fenced in yard. We had her outside with Felix and they did great together. She was adopted and returned for not being so great with cats. She also is a resource guarder with items. In the home she resource guarded the adult from the kids. So at this time we will say no cats and no kids. She is also protective of her toys/bowls, but as long as her human is aware of that it shouldn't be a problem. For instance with Felix, she did not want to share the tennis ball. She was not aggressive about it, but she was very vocal and let him know with body language she wasn't sharing that. We would also suggest that if in a home with other dogs, to feed them in separate rooms. it really is very easy to work around. And she can be trained as she loves to watch/listen to humans. She is 4 years old and around 50 lbs. Sierra is spayed and up to date on vaccines & dewormer and microchipped. She will be $125 to adopt. Meet and greets by appointment only with an approved application. http://www.hshcwv.org/wanting-to-adopt.html",

            "description": "Ruby is an 8 year old pocket pittie who is one of the most sweet and loving dogs you'll ever meet. She can be a little shy when approaching new people, but she loves everyone she meets and is always looking for pets! Her favorite things to do are cuddling up next to you for a nap, getting belly rubs, and giving kisses. She is also great with other dogs and loves to play, wrestle, and chase. She would love to be in a home with another playful dog because she really came out of her shell after playing with another dog in her foster home. She gets overly excited around cats, so she may be good for a home with a young, playful cat that likes dogs or no cats at all. She is house trained, food motivated, walks great on a harness, and has great manners. She loves to follow her humans around like a shadow so she would be best for someone who is home more than not.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Ruby, please fill out an application at:\nhttps://www.dogsaredeservingrescue.com/adoptable-dogs/adoption-application/",

I know the right family is out there for me, and hopefully, they're reading this right now. \n\nI'm a very lovable guy and I promise I'll keep you safe and give your love back a thousandfold. I enjoy getting attention from my people, and I also like to stay active. I do best with a nice routine as I tend to get bored easily. I think kids are great and I know we would have a blast playing together. However, I would like to be the only pet in the home; I want to be your one and only fur-baby. \n\nMy one Christmas wish is for my forever family to find me... I hope it happens soon.

She has a half size tail that is the cutest when it wags, which is essentially all the time! \n\nAthena\u2019s adoption fee is $200. This fee helps to cover the cost of her vetting. Which includes: DA2PPv, bordetella, and rabies vaccinations, deworming, started on heartworm and flea/tick preventions, heartworm treatment, microchip and spay. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in Athena becoming a part of your family the adoption application can be found on our website:\nhalfwayhomeanimalrescue.org\n\nWe do require a vet reference and home visit to ensure that our babies get the best forever home possible.  \n\nThank you for taking a look!!",

I don't play with other dogs but don't mind their company, so I either can be an only dog or live with another. I haven't actually been cat tested, but based on my personality I'd probably be fine with one. I enjoy going for walks...so many great things to smell out there! I also enjoy a good nap :)\n\nIf you think I'd be a good fit for you, please fill out an application at Emmaswishsdr.org/adoption-application. DFW area only.",

He would really love to find a good home that is willing to work through his separation issues.  \n\nOriginal Post - We think Sam is a Staffordshire Bull Terrier/Heeler cross. He has been with us since September 27, 2020. We believe he is around 3 1/2 years old.  Sam has been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, and kept on prevention. He loves to sun himself in the play yard. Sam needs to be the only pet in the home because he does not like most other dogs and does not like cats.  He also has separation anxiety and will need a patient family while he gets comfortable in his new surroundings. He absolutely loves people and wants to just have someone he can hang out with.",

            "description": "Anna is being fostered in WI. \n\nHere is what Anna's foster mom has to say about her:\nAnna is a survivor! She was on death\u2019s door at a shelter in Louisiana when Blind Dog Rescue Alliance stepped up to rescue her. She was found as a stray, shut down, emaciated, blind, and thought to be deaf (see attached photo of her at the shelter). When she arrived at her foster home she was quickly seen by a vet, and diagnosed with advanced Diabetes, which probably took her sight. She was started on Insulin, and has gone from 9lbs to 13lbs in two months. She is good about getting her injections, but because it has been painful for her on occasion, I slip a muzzle on her just before giving her injection. Her teeth are good, and other than her diabetes, she is in good health, so my vet estimated her to be eight years of age at most, probably younger. Anna is now a sassy, delightful, happy little girl with excellent hearing!\nAnna loves her meals and her treats, wagging her tail like crazy in anticipation, and she always follows me around, in case it\u2019s time to eat. She is quiet unless she hears someone entering her home, or when another dog barks. With a slow introduction she is good with other small dogs, although can be bossy. She would be fine as an only dog, although has been fine left alone with my other small dogs, I just have to tell her \u201cNO\u201d when she thinks it\u2019s time to boss them around. She sleeps in bed with me and my other dogs. Anna gets around just fine as soon as she acclimates to her surroundings.\nBecause of her diabetes, she needs to pee more often, although that is getting better and better. She knows that she should potty outside, but if she doesn\u2019t have a chance to get out, she is very good about peeing on potty pads, so I haven\u2019t used diapers with her.\nShe will need to continue to have her diabetes monitored, but has been pretty stable on the insulin dose she is currently receiving twice per day. Her weight is good at 13 lbs, although another pound would be fine.\nAnna is an unusual looking, pretty girl. She is petite with long legs, and her coat has become quite shiny. The only breed that I think of when I look at her is a Min-Pin, mixed with who knows what else.\nBDRA has voted against the use of electrical fencing effective immediately.",

I have been tested with other dogs and I would prefer to be the only dog in your home or with another dog that is older and calm. I feel the same way about cats too; calm cats would work best if you have them. If you would like to open your heart and home to this old man I would love to meet you.\n",

We rescued him from the Downey shelter where he had been surrendered because his former owners were moving. He was a shelter favorite and was even approved to meet a troupe of Girl Scouts who he did great with. He walks well (and slow) on leash and does well around calm dogs. \n\nWe think Fender is about 9-10 years old. He moves slowly and has arthritis and hip dysplasia that is being managed with pain medication. He enjoys getting human attention and taking naps and we would love nothing more than to see him adopted into a forever home where he can hang out, sleep, and get lots of love. \n\nFender is house-trained, crate-trained, neutered, microchipped and current on vaccinations. If you are in the Los Angeles area and would like to meet FENDER please fill out an application at www.downtowndogrescue.org/adoption-questionnaire",

            "description": "Hadley is a sweet little girl that had a rough start in life. She wants so much to be loved but is very afraid of touch. Hadley is good with females but afraid of males. She lives with both in her current foster home and did warm up to the male in the house after a couple of weeks. Until then she barked as ferociously as a 15 pound dog can, pretending she would bite but never did. Hadley gets very excited when her foster mom comes home and wiggles like crazy. She will run over and lick fingers and allow brief scratching under the chin, but petting is still too much for her. Hadley loves to play with the other dogs in her foster home, even the 100 pounder. She needs a home with another dog to help her be brave and a securely fenced yard to keep her safe. A quiet home without a lot of comings and goings is essential and an adult home would be best. Hadley lives with cats and doesn\u2019t bother them if they don\u2019t react to her. No shared walls as she will bark at noises. Hadley is crated overnight but would probably do well sleeping on a dog bed in the bedroom, and at some point might like to share the bed with her person. She does need to be crated when alone as she will chew if left unattended for long periods of time. What Hadley needs most is someone patient enough to wait for her to share all of the love she has to give. Please email Katie @ kladams4545@gmail.com to check availability, but be prepared to complete the adoption application on Homeward Bound Dog Rescue MN website, Dogs Available for Adoption as well.\nRequirements: Physically fenced yard, another dog, patient adopter willing to give time and space for a shy dog\n",

            "description": "Liv is an active, intelligent, attention seeking and outgoing Frenchie who can also be timid and nervous around new people in her home. When Liv isn\u2019t chewing on her favorite buffalo horn or nylabone you can find her requesting some chill time and a good snuggle with her beloved humans.  After a cuddle session, Liv slowly searches for a bouncy ball to gently play with.  Liv loves plush toys but unfortunately cannot have them as she decides the inside stuffing is more enjoyable than the actual toy.  Oh Liv!  Even if she is closely watched, she still finds a way to ingest the stuffing. Her playtime is limited as she has been recently diagnosed with IVDD.  Liv often has one speed and can turn a gentle play session into one that is too active for her back issues therefore her playtime should be closely monitored and limited (more info can be found in the medical part of the BIO).  One minute she is super playful and the next she is ready to chill.  During her chill time, you can find Liv being extra lazy (typical frenchie) and will grab a comfy spot on one of her many beds to take a much desired snooze.  \nLiv resource guards her humans and her home but not her food/food bowls or toys.  She attended formal training to help with her resource guarding but it is a constant work in progress.  Liv is currently living as an only dog and will need to remain as an only dog.  She was unable to play \"nice\" in her previous home. As mentioned, she guards her humans and has a bite history.  She has two bites on record both because Liv was guarding her home and her space.  She shows aggression only in her home and around her people (she views this as high value).  She is not fond of children. From observing her behavior, we believe it\u2019s because they are too quick with their movements for her. Although her aggression seems to only be in her home, for Liv\u2019s safety and the safety of others in the home we suggest she is the only animal in the home.  \nBecause Liv loves positive attention, can be lovable and responsive to her favorite treats we believe with the proper structure, a family that can offer firm leadership, be consistent in their efforts, patient and willing to work on proper dog behaviors we believe Liv\u2019s behavioral issues can be worked through if her triggers are kept at a minimum.  In addition, being the only pet will help remove the triggers Liv has with resource guarding.  Liv gets timid and nervous around new people in her home as she is protecting her space.  Her foster family believes she would be best in a home with dog-savvy, gentle, teenage children or older AND in a home as the ONLY pet.  As with all of our dogs, we recommend slow introductions AND supervision around children when introducing a new dog in your home to make sure both she and they are kept safe. \n",

Liv also has IBD (Irritable bowel disease). Liv is on a joint supplement to and should remain on Phyto-flex to help with her joints (which can be found on smile.amazon.com or chewy.com).

Thanks to good food and a warm place to stay, Fullerton has gained weight and loves to be loved on. He is an active guy who loves to run and play.  Fullerton is very treat motivated. Fullerton is good with other dogs after an proper introduction. Unfortunately, we do not know how he feels about cats. Children 12 years old and older. His forever home is required to have a fenced yard where he can safely run and play. Fullerton is neutered, up to date on his vaccinations, on monthly heartworm preventative as well as house and crate trained. Fullerton is searching for an active family who wants to have fun, go on adventures and love him for the rest of his life!!!\n\nAll dogs we rescue stay with us until they find their forever homes. We do not do same day adoptions. A home visit is required to ensure our dog is going to a safe environment and our dog gets along with your dog(s) and/or cat(s). We require all our dogs over the age of 1 year attend 1 obedience class (6 week session) outside the home. You must live within 1 hour of Birmingham, MI to adopt one of our dogs. No out of state or outside the U.S. adoptions or fosters. Fullerton's adoption fee is $275.",

            "description": "Ducky came to The Animal Care Society after being transferred from a rural shelter. She had a pretty severe case of mange, but that has all been treated, we are just waiting for her hair to fully grow back in. Luckily, she is spending her time having fun in foster care until she can find her forever home. According to her foster mom, Ducky would thrive being in the home with another dog, particularly a male dog, so we are requiring her to be adopted into a home with another canine friend. She also does not mind cats. She is still working on housebreaking and isn't a huge fan of the crate yet. She can get a little nippy when she's excited, so she shouldn't go to a home with small children. Ducky would benefit from an owner that is willing to work with her on basic obedience training. She is also a very active girl, possibly even part herding breed. She would do well with someone who has a large fenced yard or goes on frequent walks. She would not be a good fit for an apartment.\nIf you are interested in meeting Ducky, head over to our website at www.animalcaresociety.org to fill out an application! \\\\\\ DUCKY IS SPONSORED BY OUR FRIENDS AT OLDFATHER LAW FIRM THRU APRIL 2021! /// DUCKY IS SPONSORED BY OUR FRIEND LAURA EDELEN THRU DECEMBER 2021!\n Primary Color: White Secondary Color: Black Age: 0yrs 10mths 4wks Animal has been Spayed I am available for adoption at the Animal Care Society.",

Our boy Dexter is also a genius - so smart and full of energy (and also super adorable too). Dexter's previous family said he was an inside dog with access to outside, is housebroken and slept on his own dog bed. He was described as an adventure-loving guy who is also very affectionate. At PACC volunteers describe Dexter as a strong boy with a huge heart and desire to please. In his dog evaluation he played a bit awkwardly, was social and tolerant, and possibly selective. Dexter should meet any other dogs before going home; gotta make sure they aren't going to steal his inventions.",

The conditions the dogs were staying in were not ideal for long-term care, so we decided to step in and take the dogs into our care!! Miles is the last one left of the 6 dogs, and really wants to find his forever home!\n\nMiles is a sweetheart!! He absolutely loves cuddles, attention, and affection!! He is playful but also knows how to wine-down! Miles is a very quick learner, he learned sit in 30 seconds, and would love to learn more. The vet estimates him to be about 3 years old; he is up-to-date on all vaccines and shots and he is also neutered! \n\nMiles gets along with other dogs!  Miles' gorgeous face will steal your heart, and his great personality will make you fall in love!  Please consider Miles as you look for your next companion and family member!",

She knows \"sit\", \"shake\", and \"down\" when treats are involved (of course!). She would do best in a home with older children and with no cats/dogs. Lana came in to us as a stray, so her history is a mystery. She will be spayed, utd on vaccinations, rabies vaccinated, flea treated, dewormed, heart worm tested, and microchipped prior to adoption. If she seems like she'd be a good addition to your family, please stop in and visit with her. For any questions, call us at 419-562-9149.",

            "description": "Obie is a great dog who is happy, loving, and playful.  Of course, he is a Bulldog so he also enjoys lounging and being lazy too! Obie loves attention from his trusted humans and enjoys playing with his beloved Jollyballs when he is in a playful mood. \n When he plays (and while he doesn't mean it in an aggressive way when he is playing) he does sound a little ferocious and loves to growl quite loudly while he (literally) prances around and tosses his ball around the room. He has an adorable little prance that he does when he is happy and/or excited.  For him, \"a tired dog is a happy dog\" would likely be his best course of action for success in his adoptive home.  \nWhen he isn't playing, he is content to lay on his dog bed next to the couch and suckle on a stuffed toy and snooze. He is not allowed up on furniture in his foster home and should never be allowed to be in an elevated position (up on a couch, bed, chair, ottoman, etc.).  Obie is likely not a dog that one will be able to snuggle on the couch or in bed with. However, he is just as happy being near his people, getting head scratches and hanging out with them. \nHe will occasionally resource guard his ball a bit around other dogs if they are attempting to steal it away but overall plays \"keep away\" pretty well with the other dogs in his foster home for the most part.  They are always monitored to ensure one isn't stealing the others toys and are being respectful of each other during playtime.  \nWhile Obie doesn't mind the company of other dogs and playing with them from time to time, he does best with easy going dogs who will not try to bully him or start fights with him.  He typically does not ever start a fight, but he *will* retaliate and stand up for himself if another dog tries to pick on him and/or bully him.  \nObie does have aggressive outbursts from time to time and those are likely linked to neurological issue that he has had since puppyhood.  He was attacked by another dog and shaken when he was very young so while he gets around just fine and can walk and run just like any other normal dog, he does walk slightly off kilter with a sort of \"swagger\".  His \"swagger\" is sometimes more prominent than other times, but it is especially noticeable when he is upset and/or his excitement level is too high.  \nObie is ultimately an insecure dog that needs to find a home that is quiet and easy going with a family that will provide calm, firm, and consistent leadership for him.  He absolutely needs a family who is very dog experienced, can be diligent and consistent in paying attention to and reading his body language and who is able and willing to deal with any issues as they arise. He does best with calm, firm and consistent leadership because he can then trust and rely on his people to provide him with a safe and secure environment.  It did take Obie time to learn to trust his foster family and, initially, he was quite leery and standoffish with them. This should also be expected in his adoptive home until he has been given time to be able to build a relationship with his new family members and has learned that he can trust them.  \nObie sometimes zones out and \"sees red\" and displays aggression toward the humans in his home when something occurs that upsets him, most typically when he is asked to do something he does not want to do or if something occurs that makes him feel insecure.  \nObie has bitten and has drawn blood in the past. It should be noted that if he is able to make contact, he bites with a determined bite each and every time.  After he calms down a bit, he does seem to have learned his aggressive behaviors are not acceptable in his current foster home and he typically will put himself in a time out in his kennel as his foster family has trained him to do.  If he doesn't start heading toward his kennel on his own, his foster family will firmly tell him to \"go to bed\" (and point toward his kennel) in which he will then typically go to his kennel.  He should never be given additional attention in these situations and should be largely ignored while being kenneled in a separate area (with the kennel door secured) for a time out/cool off period of at *least* 30-45 mins.  \nWhile he does not enjoy it, Obie is muzzled when he is given a bath and/or his ears are cleaned and/or his nails are trimmed.  Obie is very food/treat motivated and will allow his muzzle to be put on him with the bribe of yummy treats.  When placing his muzzle, diligence and caution must be taken.  Any type of grooming interaction that makes him uncomfortable and insecure feeling (which, to date, we have experienced is all of them), he will begin displaying aggressive tendencies.  The muzzle will protect his people so that he can have necessary care routines accomplished without the danger of being bitten.  Again, if he is given the opportunity, he WILL bite when he is feeling insecure, scared or uncomfortable if precautions are not taken in advance to avoid such instances.  \nObie is always fed in his kennel to avoid food aggression issues.  He is asked to sit and and wait calmly in his kennel and then his food can be placed inside of his kennel without issue. His food bowl is not removed from his kennel until he is out of his kennel.  Again, he MUST have a calm, firm and consistent leadership in his adoptive home, just as he does with his foster family.  \nWith calm, firm and consistent leadership he seems to do very well and his outbursts are only occasional (and now that they know him well, can usually be expected and predicted) with with his foster family.  Due to his bite history, Obie will not be able to be adopted to any home with children under the age of 16 years old.",

I can just see myself in one of Bonds sports cars, cant you? You or maybe a four legged friend by my side, wind blowing our hair and ears. Yes, we could be living the dream, but in the meantime, Im enjoying life in the play yard with Lucy where we run and wrestle together. Im very social though, and would do the same with any of the pups here. As a side note, Im also big on attention from people and give kisses as a reward.",

She is doing well with the foster dogs and learning to social and fit right in.  We have discovered though that she is a best fit for larger dog siblings.  She plays rough with her buddies and she doesn't understand boundaries with smaller dogs.  She loves the husky and lab foster siblings.  She would do best also to have a fenced yard to play in. She would love to sleep in your bed because she is a snuggle bunny. She thinks that she is a lap dog and will bond with the one who lets her lay in your lap.   She is about a year old.  We expect her to be a large dog when full grown.  She has been spayed, up to date on all her vaccinations and ready to go to her forever home. Heart worm negative!

            "description": "YOU MUST BE 21 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER TO ADOPT \n\nABOUT ME: My name is Copper and I am ready for my forever home. I am up to date on my vaccines and I have been neutered. I also have a micro chip. My family no longer wanted me so I am looking again for a nice family.  I like to bark when I meet people, but warm up really, really fast. I am confident and would make a great companion.  If you would like to meet me please go to www.mobilespca.org and complete an online application and someone from the office will give you a call to set up an appointment to come meet me.  \n\nADOPTION FEE: $150\nHeart Worm Negative\n39 Pounds\n2 Years Old\n\n\nABOUT OUR PETS: All of our pets available for adoption have been spayed/neutered, tested for heartworms, given age-appropriate vaccinations, microchipped and are on flea and heartworm preventative medication.\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS: To give each dog the best possible home we require a completed Adoption Application.  Screening and approval by our Adoption Coordinators and a home visit  may be required to make sure  this pet fits into your home and the home fits our pet.\n\nCONTACT US:If you would like  to give this dog a good home please call the Mobile SPCA office at 251-633-3531 or drop by our Adoption Center located at 620 Zeigler Circle W, Mobile, AL 36608 - Tuesday through Friday from 9 a.m.  to 5:30 p.m. and Thursday and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.\n\nCAN'T ADOPT?  SPONSOR OR DONATE!</strong> </strong>This wonderful animal is just one of many in our care right now.

            "description": "Hootie was born on October 2nd. He is a Border Collie and Catalouhla Leperard Hound mix that comes to us all the way from Dallas, TX. He has a rare skin condition and someone was trying to give him away in a Wal-Mart parking lot. Luckily, a good samaritan stepped in before he ended up in the wrong hands and he can now get the care and love he deserves. \n\nHootie has a rare form of Epidermolysis bullosa acquista. This is an autoimmune disease that affects the skin, causing it to blister and scab over. He has been responding well to his treatments. He will require daily steroids, a weekly bath, and monitoring to keep an eye for flare-ups or need for medication adjustments. He will need to be seen by a dermatologist as a primary care vet cannot treat this condition. \n\nThe adoption fee includes spay/neuter, age-appropriate vaccinations, and micro-chipping. If you are interested in adopting any of the sweet babies please complete our adoption application at www.erinregananimalsanctuary.com",

            "description": "If youre looking for the perfect sweet, lazy, cuddle-up-on-the-couch-with-you dog: youve found him! Dewey is a 2 year old Double Merle Aussie mix. He is completely deaf and partially blind, but he doesnt let that bring him down. He is extremely smart and picks up new training cues quickly. He is such a sweetheart and will sit in your lap for hours and get love if you let him. Dewey definitely has some separation anxiety (we get it, its scary when you cant hear anything!), so he would do best in a home with someone who is home often. Dewey likes to play every once in a while, but is pretty lazy and sleepy overall. He would do well in a home with another doggy friend to show him the ropes, but probably wouldnt do too well with high-energy dogs because he startles easily. He does also try to herd his foster sister a lot. Dewey really seems to be afraid of leashes for some reason - hell let you put it on, but will just pancake and not walk anywhere - so he would also do best in a home with a fenced in area (even a small one) for him to go potty. He is crate trained, but has never showed interest in any destructive behaviors at his foster moms house, so he could likely be given free reign of the house if you prefer. Overall, Dewey is a happy camper if he has love, hot dogs, and a comfy bed to lay on. He cant wait to meet you!\n\n Apply at www.lolasrescue.com",

            "description": "This cuddly dog has the most expressive face you've ever seen.\n\nShe excels at snuggles - all she's never wanted in life is to sit on the couch curled up next to her humans. She'll often plop herself into your lap, even if she doesn't quite fit - or at least scoot her butt right next to you.\n\nGaby is a six-year-old pittie who loves people (but not other dogs). She's calm, smart, and picks up tricks quickly once she understands what you want her to do - she knows sit, touch, shake, high five, nod, shake head, stay, and has good table manners. She's also crate-trained and housebroken, though she sometimes has accidents. When she's met kids in passing, she's been very patient.\n\nGaby is comfortable and relaxed in the house, but does not love walks - she'd be happiest in a private yard where she doesn't have to process constant changes in her environment. She's also a great dog for night owls - she naturally wants to sleep until around 2pm!\n\nGaby has cancer, but she's vibrant and has a lot of life in her. Give this good girl a home!\n\nIf you are interested in Gaby, please fill out an application at: https://www.dogsaredeservingrescue.com/adoptable-dogs/adoption-application/",

Willow loves to walk on her leash and doesn\u2019t pull unless she sees something running. Willow has, in the past, been able to use the bathroom wherever she wanted in the house.

            "description": "Meet Woody and Jessy!! The bonded pair, Woody and Jessy, were rescued by a local lady who also kept their mom for 7 years. Sadly, their owners relocated and could not take the 2 younger dogs with them. Woody and Jessy weigh about 60lbs and are now 8.5 yrs young and have calm and gentle temperaments. They are house trained, and enjoy being around their people, but would do best with older children around 10 and up. They get along with other dogs, but young and/or rambunctious ones are too much for them. The city life and noises are overwhelming to these country gals, and they need soft guidance while on walks. Jessy is still a little unsure of the car rides but slowly getting used to it. Woody doesn\u2019t mind being in a at all. An ideal home for Woody and Jessy would be a quieter household where their people are around more often than not, has a secure fenced yard, and if any kids or animals are present, they need to be respectful and give them the time and space they need as they settle into their new normal. They would do better in a home located in a quiet town/neighborhood removed from the hustle and bustle of urban life. Woody and Jessy were rescued from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and are being fostered in Portland, OR. Will you be their hero?\nIf you are interested in adopting Woody and Jessy, first step is to fill out the adoption application at www.streetdoghero.org/forms",

He has melted the hearts of everyone he has met and has made quite a few four-legged girlfriends with his handsome looks and undeniable personality. Nothing makes Lowen happier than being with his one-and-only person (single occupancy household or experienced adult couple). While he takes some time to warm up to new people, once he's decided that you're his person, prepare yourself for endless love, laughs, and licks. Lowen is proud to be a stage-five clinger (bonus points if you know the movie reference) and will gladly join his human for outdoor adventures or use you as his personal pillow for a Netflix marathon. No apartments, please.\n\nFor Lowen, the world can still be a scary place as he discovers all of its sights, sounds, and smells so he would love to find an active and dog-savvy single adult (not a first time dog owner as an adult) who can give him an extra boost of confidence to really come out of his shell. Despite his shyness, he is also quite the ladies man and would do well with a calm and confident female dog sibling to race around with in the yard and show him the ropes from a dog's point of view. When he's not outside, Lowen is happy to lay by your side for all the belly rubs you have to offer. He also loves any and all treats and will politely sit for them and take them gently from your hand. \n\nSo if you're looking for a pawtner in crime for daytime adventures and evening show binging, then Lowen is your man!\n\nEstimated DOB: 6/22/2018\n\nSponsored by Leonard Gentile",

He is still a bit shy when meeting new people, but given a little time and patience he becomes sweet and affectionate. . His one ear up, one ear down look is precious. Kiernan will love being part of an active family that will take him along on fun adventures, but will also let him take things at his own pace as he adjusts to family life.\n\nVisit Kiernan at www.hua.org!",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Den. People also know me as Sir Wiggle Butt because my whole body wags when I get to hang out with the humans. I absolutely love them all so much! I am a young dog, I am not too big, and I have oodles of the very desirable personality trait of being extremely attentive to my humans. That means I look to them for guidance, I learn quickly and I just want to please. Oh, how happy I would be to find the home that has the time to give me all the love and training that a young boy like me will thrive on. I have already started with learning good dog manners. I walk well on a leash, and I even like to heal beside you when walking off leash. Thats because my favourite pastime is to be close to my humans. Because I have not been socialised with other dogs, I act a little silly around them and I am not welcoming. However, I am still just a young boy and it is most likely that I could learn to accept and enjoy canine friends if you know how to teach me how. Or maybe I could just be your one and only?\nApplications are open for a lucky family to adopt this sweet bundle of love. Den is a good boy with a lot of love to give and is eager to find his forever family that have all that love to give back in return, as well as the time and commitment to provide both the physical and mental exercise that a young dog like Den needs.",

He wants to be right next to his humans. He loves playing fetch, going for walks (although he needs a bit more leash training), playing with tough rope and squeaker toys, and snuggling under the blankets. He's an incredibly smart dog and picks up on training quickly.\n\nKevin is potty-trained but sometimes has accidents when he's really scared. He's a bit fearful of cars and strangers (which makes sense since he lived on the streets for a bit before landing in a shelter) but distracting him with treats usually keeps him calm. He's picked up on a lot of new tricks including sit, down, wait, watch, leave it, and come. He has a lot of potential for more training because he's so smart.\n\nHe doesn't like cats and would do best in a home where he's the only dog. (Ok with larger/active dogs.?) He should be in a home with no small kids, as he doesn't have patience for the noise and chaos kids bring, and he's not very aware of his surroundings and can easily knock little ones over. He does well with older kids!\n\nTo apply for him please go to www.tothemoonandbackrescue.com and fill out the adoption application. Fee is 250.00 and includes Neuter, current on vaccines, dewormer, heartworm preventative, flea and tick preventative and microchipped",

He has already had his first booster and will receive his next one the second week of December then after that another DA2PP, rabies, health check, neuter, and microchip.\nHis foster is diligent with house training and teaching puppy manners and he is crate trained.  He has a very pleasant personality and of course play play and play are his number one favorite thing to do next to snuggling.\nHis new adopter will be updated with photos and videos often until he is ready to go home with them! \nWe take the safety and health of our dogs very seriously so we will ensure that Harris is ready before he leaves rescue.\n",

He loves playing with his foster siblings so a younger, playful, female dog would be good for him. Familiarity or comfort with herding breeds would be nice as his natural instincts come out at times but is not necessary. \n\nPACA is a foster based rescue with no shelter to view our dogs.  We have temporarily stopped all our public adoption events due to COVID-19, however we are still placing dog into loving homes by private appointment with approved applications.  \n\nCompleted applications will be given to the foster to coordinate meetings as everyone feels comfortable.  This application helps us get to know you and your family a little better so we can find the perfect match! Application are found here:\nhttp://nmpaca.org/images/pdf_files/PACA_Adoption_Application.pdf\nPlease email completed applications to pacadogs@aol.com \n\nAll our animals are spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for tic born illness and heartworm prior to adoption.  Our fee is $175.\n\n",

SPECIAL NEEDS !!!!!!\n\n\nFrankie was initially found as a stray and impounded at a kill shelter. He was in rough shape. Hair loss, goopy eyes, skinny... not a good look for an older little guy.\nWe think Frankie is about 8nyears old.\nHe got adopted but with heavy heart FRANKY got returned to us after 10 days with his potential family. 95% of the time Franky was the perfect little dog but he randomly snapped at hands often unprovoked and with having children and their friends come to visit often this was just not the right home for Franky. \nHe is again looking for a home with no kids and someone able to handle is attitude moments.\n\nFrankie has a heart murmur grade 3 and is now on medication. \nIt doesn't slow him down and he most likely will have plenty of years left but medication is required.\n\nFrankie would love to have a safe home where he can lay his head and go for fun walks\nThis little guy is the sweet and so funny and playful still.\n\nIf you would like to meet Frankie please send us a message in order to receive an application.\n\nHis adoption fee is $ 250 which includes all vaccines, heartworm test, neuter, micro chip and a full refill of his medication",

            "description": "So, so, sweet is this gentle old man.  Maxx was found as a stray, wandering aimlessly in the streets of Phoenix.  He ended up at or county shelter and  his prognosis of being rescued had timed out.  It was at that time when we became aware of Maxx and we took him under our wings.   We knew Maxx was an old man but were were taken aback by just how much he was sufferings medically.   Maxx had two GIGANTIC tumors on his penis.  They were infected and bleed often.  He also had a bronchitis and tested positive for tick fever.....oh.....and his eyes.  He is virtually blind in one eye and has partial vision out of the other.  Words can not express how wonderful it is to see Maxx feel better and finally beginning to live his life.  The bronchitis and tick fever is in the past and he has recovered beautifully from his surgery.  Maxx is a new kid!!  We are able to walk him (his favorite thing to do) about 40 minutes a day.  He loves all people he meets and is totally indifferent to other dogs, however he will need to go to cat-free home.  It is as though Maxx lived on a concrete slab his whole life, outside alone.  He is so grateful for what he has now.   Maxx loves tennis ball too!  He will walk around with one in his mouth and chase one down! Just feeling well has brought him back to life.  We love Maxx and are really to find him a home that will tend to his needs and let him live out his remaining time so, so spoiled.  If you are interested in adoption Maxx ($100 donation), please take a moment to fill out an application.  All adoptions start with an application, https://www.povertyspets.org/adoption-form.  Once received, you will be contacted within 48-72 hours.  Thank you!\n",

While at the shelter they both were very frightened with all the new smells, sounds and sights. Unfortunately they didn't flourish under those conditions. Fortunately for us, we were able to pull them and start working with them right away. With the help of our patient volunteers these boys now go for walks on leash, ask for pets from us, play with other dogs, eat and take treats! Such an amazing transformation.\n\nAll that's left now is a forever home for them. They are not a bonded pair and can be adopted out individually.",

We are both couch potatoes extraordinaire but also enjoy leisurely walks around the neighborhood.  We've been together thru thick and thin, so we really need to stay together - I'm Ralphie's eyes and ears.  We're dog friendly.  No cats please.  We haven't been tested around kids, but would probably do fine with less active kids who enjoy our slow, leisurely pace.  We're doing fine with our house training.  We are crate trained but are not using a crate since we love to lay together on our dog bed - there just isn't a need for a crate.  Our foster says we are really a pair of sweethearts looking for someone to snuggle with and who enjoys stopping to smell the flowers along the way.  If you are interested in us, please send an email to scpdogworld@gmail.com to get more information on how to fill out an application and have a great meet and greet to see if we are a match made in heaven.\n\nAdopter for this dog must reside in the immediate Houston/Galveston area and be at least 25 years old.  A home visit may be required prior to this dog going to any home. The adoption fee for this duo is $190 (two for the price of one) which includes State of Texas sales tax. All dogs are microchipped, on heartworm protection, spayed/neutered, vaccinated, de-wormed and treated for fleas.",

We are both couch potatoes extraordinaire but also enjoy leisurely walks around the neighborhood.  We've been together thru thick and thin, so we really need to stay together - Ruffles is my eyes and ears.  We're dog friendly.  No cats please.  We haven't been tested around kids, but would probably do fine with less active kids who enjoy our slow, leisurely pace and understand my disability.  We're doing fine with our house training at our foster's now.  I did mark at first, but once I settled in I was fine.  We are crate trained but are not using a crate since we love to lay together on our dog bed - there just isn't a need for a crate.  Our foster says we are really a pair of sweethearts looking for someone to snuggle with and who enjoys stopping to smell the flowers along the way.  If you are interested in us, please send an email to scpdogworld@gmail.com to get more information on how to fill out an application and have a great meet and greet to see if we are a match made in heaven.\n\nAdopter for this dog must reside in the immediate Houston/Galveston area and be at least 25 years old.  A home visit may be required prior to this dog going to any home. The adoption fee for this duo is $190 (two for the price of one) which includes State of Texas sales tax. All dogs are microchipped, on heartworm protection, spayed/neutered, vaccinated, de-wormed and treated for fleas.",

Her foster is going to continue with what trainer has done, and adopter will also need to continue with the process, as this will help this girl understand that she is loved, safe and wanted! Most of all, this is giving her confidence! UPDATE 12-16-20: Sweet Nellie J is beginning to come out of her shell. While this is a slow process for her, she has shown that she CAN and WILL be a great family member, given the time. She does love her crate--her safe place, and always has a clean, dry crate! She is working on her house manners. She will go out and do her business, but we are still working on doing both while outside consistently. She is a playful girl, but is scared very easily, which will we will work on. Learning to trust is a work in progress! Due to her being extremely scared, we are strongly suggesting this sweet girl have a FENCED IN YARD, if not, she can not be off leash at any time. After 3 weeks, she no longer tries to climb the fence, and we can let her go out with her foster gang with no worries that she will try to escape! 12-3-20: Nellie J is a beautiful, but very scared girl. Taken to Animal Control with 2 other dogs, unwanted, she found herself among dogs and strangers she didn't know. She APPEARS to be an Australian Kelpie/Terrier mix, around 2 years old, is 26 pounds, spayed, micro chipped and current on her vaccines, but sadly, like so many dogs in our area, Heartworm +. Nellie has begun her treatment. She does well with other dogs, but cats and children are unknown at this time. Since just getting to her foster home today, we have found that she is really scared and timid, and will try to jump a 4ft fence. She just couldn't get her body all the way over, which is a good thing, lol. She has short legs, but is extremely fast on those little legs! Hopefully, she will come out of her shell and not be so scared in the coming days. Due to her behavior at this time, we highly suggest a fenced yard, as if she gets away from you, you will not catch her. Once again, just a sweet, scared girl trying to figure out what is going on in her life. She will be a wonderful companion, given the chance! We will update once we learn more about her and her house/crate manners.\nPLEASE, NO FIRST TIME DOG OWNERS OR RENTERS and MUST HAVE A VERIFIABLE, PAST 5 YEARS VET REFERENCE.\n\n**GOOD VET REFERENCE IS REQUIRED**",

            "description": "Meet Wyatt, the stunning 2 year old, white, Harlequin Great Dane. This boy has clearly had a rough start with a lot of transitions and simply needs an experienced home who can help him navigate his special needs. You see, Wyatt is deaf and appears to have some vision issues as he is startled easily in low light/evenings. Wyatt was originally a part of a cruelty case which landed him in a different rescue group. Unfortunately, there were not any fosters experienced in handling his special needs, so BDHP stepped in to ensure this boy is fostered by someone who can manage him properly. Wyatt is house trained, crate trained, and leash trained though he requires a gentle leader due to pulling. He does not appear interested in toys, but with love and trust may open up a bit to new experiences. Wyatt is good with cats and kids, though we suggest older children only who can appreciate and respect his needs and a more quiet household. He is a bit insecure around other dogs and there has been an unprovoked aggressive incident in a prior home which BDHP will try to get to the bottom of while he is in foster care. Wyatt truly needs an adopter who can give him the time and space to decompress and settle into his forever home. With limited senses, this poor boy has to be so lost! He truly loves his humans and wants to be close to them at all times. He also loves the outdoors, so some adventures would certainly help build his confidence and bond! Do you feel you could be Wyatt's final destination?\n\nGiant Breed Experienced Homes Only.\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

She is such a SWEET girl once she gets comfortable with you. Dagny loves running and playing with the huskies. Dagny Is about 40 pounds. We are working on some basic commands. She would benefit from some rules, boundaries, structure and lots of love but what Puppy wouldn't?\n\nDagny is the most lovable hot mess ever!\n\nShe LOVES toys! Squeaky toys, chewy toys stuffed toys that need to have their squeakers removed. She loves them all.\n\nShe also loves other dogs! Unless they get near her toys, her food, her bed or her person.\n\nShe would love to have a sibling, but some boundaries will have to be established and feeding MUST be in her crate. She lacks impulse control but we are working on that.\n\nShe is also super loving and cuddly. She LOVES belly rubs and any other pets! She will sit for hours as long as she's being loved on. She also likes to sleep on the bed.\n\nDagny has anxiety when left in her crate. She hates being away from her human. This is a work in progress, and will take some time and patience. A lot of patience.",

            "description": "Auggie loves having fun! This sweet 2-year-old boy looks to be a Boxer and Shepherd mix. He gets along great with other dogs and loves to play. He has been around young children and is very gentle. Auggie walks well on leash and enjoys going on adventures in the car. He does need to refine his manners, such as learning he doesn't need to jump up and give hugs to everyone, but he has mastered his housetraining! Auggie is very smart and knows his basic commands. He loves to play with his foster dog siblings and would be happiest with a dog sibling in his forever home that likes to play as much as he does; romping around outside with a furry friend sounds like the perfect life to Mr. Auggie! If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting Auggie, then fill out an adoption application on our website today!

            "description": "All Jimmy wants is to live a simple life. He's a simple guy who enjoys simple pleasures. Jimmy is a sweet soul who has been through a lot. He can be super shy at first but once he gets to know you he is a very active and playful pup. Jimmy is still learning exactly how to be a dog, and he is not too keen on pets and eye contact, but hey, who does like being touched or stared at by a stranger? Jimmy is looking for someone who is going to take the time to earn his trust, so he knows that they will be a worthwhile lifelong companion. But don't worry, Jimmy is not above being bribed with some yummy snacks. Throw some carrots his way and he just might crumble! Jimmy would love to have a nice safe place that is solely his space. When he is in one of his braver moods, he likes to come out to play and explore. However, he needs a safe zone where he can retreat to when he gets startled. He will soon 'recharge and emerge once again. As Jimmy starts to get more comfortable, he wants to spend more time with you, but he doesn't want you to know it. He'll follow you around the house, but he likes to play hide and seek - if you turn and look at him he'll duck behind the table or the kitchen island. He will also sniff your elbows and toes when you're sitting down but jump out of the way if you try to sneak in a pet. Jimmy is constantly discovering new things about this world and is becoming more confident every day. He is sure to make your heart melt as you watch him grow into the best version of himself. Come meet this precious boy!",

            "description": "Hi,  my name is Sylvia (HWTH#20234A).  I am a Shepherd mix, born 1/23/20 and I weigh 60 lbs.   My \"sister\" Perla (adopted) and  I were relinquished to Halfway to Home by my owners because they had too many dogs for which to care. I am still a puppy and I was overwhelmed by my new surroundings at first so I pretty much kept to myself.  With lots of TLC from the rescue folks I am now much more outgoing and I enjoy playing in my yard with my buddy Bruno (HWTH#20125).   I am ready to find a permanent place to call home where I can live inside and be part of a family.  I walk well on a leash, but would require a patient owner to house-train me because I have spent most of my life outside. An experienced handler and obedience training will help me understand what is expected of me. I get along great with other big dogs but I don\u2019t know about smaller dogs or cats.  I would not do well in a household with children.  In order to ensure I get enough exercise, I need long walks and a big fenced yard for play.  I also enjoy other outdoor activities and going on car rides!  I do shed so I require regular brushing to keep my coat healthy.  Need to know anything else about me?  Would you like to make an appointment to meet me?  If so, please call Sandy at tele#661-824-4495 (this is a landline).  Thank you for checking in and I hope you will come see me soon.",

AS A YOUNG DOG THAT JUST CAME INTO OUR RESCUE HE IS NOT COMPLETELY HOUSEBROKEN AND IS STILL LEARNING TO WALK ON A LEASH. HE WOULD DO BEST IN A HOME WITHOUT CHILDREN AND THAT HAS AN EXISTING PLAYFUL DOG HIS SIZE (NO LARGE BREEDS).\n\nMy name is Bean and I'm an 11 month old Chihuahua/Dachshund mix. I'm currently being fostered with one of my littermates. We were owner surrenders but The Rescue Train has taken us aboard and is giving us a ride to our forever home!\n\nI am sweet and snuggly, but being a young adult, I have an adventurous side too. I can be very curious, fearless, and have boundless energy! I need a savvy adopter that will provide plenty of structure and training to help me become a good canine citizen. \n\n---\nIf you are interested in adopting BEAN please fill out our adoption application on www.therescuetrain.org. Applications are required PRIOR to meeting one of our animals and are used to set up a safe and successful adoption. Please don't be shy and answer the questions thoroughly.

AS A YOUNG DOG THAT JUST CAME INTO OUR RESCUE SHE IS NOT COMPLETELY HOUSEBROKEN AND IS STILL LEARNING TO WALK ON A LEASH. SHE WOULD DO BEST IN A HOME WITHOUT CHILDREN AND THAT HAS AN EXISTING PLAYFUL MALE DOG HER SIZE (NO LARGE BREEDS).\n\nMy name is Pumpkin and I'm an 11 month old Chihuahua/Dachshund mix. I'm currently being fostered with one of my littermates. We were owner surrenders but The Rescue Train has taken us aboard and is giving us a ride to our forever home!\n\nI am sweet and snuggly, but being a young adult, I have an adventurous side too. I can be very curious, fearless, and have boundless energy! I need a savvy adopter that will provide plenty of structure and training to help me become a good canine citizen. \n\n---\nIf you are interested in adopting PUMPKIN please fill out our adoption application on www.therescuetrain.org.

I love to be with my foster family and get all the attention that I can get. However, there is one thing that I love more than snuggles and that is food! It is my most favorite thing ever and I cannot wait for the next meal. I could use some training to work on my basic commands and I hear that they give you treats so you know I am all for that!\n\nI love being outside and my nose takes me on a lot of adventures. I would love to find an active family that would take me lots of places to explore new things. I enjoy playing with my foster siblings and my 11 beautiful puppies. My foster family also has cats and I love to chase them so I will do better in a home that does not have cats. I am a professional kisser and will give you kisses whenever you want. I enjoy being on the couch and snuggling with my foster family.\n\nI have raised 11 puppies and I am exhausted! I can't wait to be settled in my forever home with you!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nAll our Warrior Dogs will have all age appropriate medical care and vaccines, a microchip, and spay/neuter before adoption unless age is a factor with a puppy younger than 6-12 months at the time of adoption. If that is the case, the spay/neuter will be covered in the adoption fee and the owner will be responsible to have the procedure completed at a Warrior Dog Rescue Veterinarian at the appropriate time.\n\nPlease note that the majority of our dogs in rescue are from shelters where they have been found as strays or abandoned. Their breed description is based on our very best educated guess based on physical characteristics and their dispositions. If they came to our rescue as an owner surrender, the breed description will be listed as provided by the previous owner.\n\nAdoption Fee - $450\n\nTo apply for this pup, please submit an Adoption Application at http://warriordogrescue.com/adopt/adoption-application/",

            "description": "Dory is about 9 months and weighs around 40 pounds currently.  According to the person who surrendered her to animal control she is a lab/husky mix.  She is a little shy when she first meets you mainly because she is not sure what you want from her but she warms up quickly once she knows she can trust you.  She is a happy playful girl overall and loves other dogs.   Because she is nervous in new situations we would not recommend her with young active children.  She is not aggressive but their quick movements could scare her and make her run away.  She would do best in a home with another dog to follow and a fenced yard.  If you have room for two, she and Mimosa are buddies and would be great together.\n\nThe next step is to fill out an online application. Once we have reviewed your application we will get back to you as soon as possible. We have the right to decline an application if it is not a good fit for that particular animal. \n\nNot yet ready to adopt?  You can sponsor a pet now to help pay for medical expenses, special diets, toys and treats, emergency medical care, etc., to provide for him or her during foster care.  Our adoption fee rarely covers our expenses, so any size donation is appreciated!   You can donate by check or Paypal by visiting our website at www.cofas.org \n\n\n********************************************\nAll of our dogs are fostered in our homes so we know their temperaments.  They are spayed or neutered, up to date on shots, de-wormed, heartworm tested (and treated if necessary), and on flea and heartworm prevention. Our adoption fee begins at $195.00 for all of our dogs and puppies. Our goal is to match our animals to the best home possible.  Please email info@cofas.org for more information.

            "description": "Annie is a 5-6 year old blood hound and she has a super duper sad story, she was used by a back yard breeder her entire life and when her body started failing her they dumped her at a rural shelter. Annie was 46 pounds- literally nothing but skin and bones, heart worm positive, and she wasn\u2019t expected to live and so was put on the euthanasia list.  fortunately for her the shelter allowed us to tag her and save her life! It\u2019s devastating to think of how her life was for so many years, but dogs are amazing and she still loves humans and does well with other large male dogs. We haven\u2019t had many extremely reliable female dogs to test her with over the last year but the few that we did were really scared of her size- so I can\u2019t say that she does well with females to be on the safe side.\nAnnie has been at our kennel facility for 14 months now and has had some interest throughout the year but people either have cats, smaller dogs, or female dogs which rules them out for adopting Annie. She is potty trained, fully vetted, and on her last round of heart worm treatment to be negative. She would do best in a home as an only pet or with another large friendly male dog, she also does well with children 2 years and over. \n\nALL children should be at least AGE 5 to be approved for adoption!\n\nFill out an application at our website below to be considered for adoption.  This dog is available in the NJ Area.  We will contact you if we need further information.  We cannot directly reply to all applications.  \n\nPlease apply directly at WWW.BIGDOGRESCUEPROJECT.ORG/Adopt.\n\nOur adoption fee of $425 includes  age appropriate vaccinations, microchipping and transport expenses. Spay/Neuter at 6 months of age is provided at select vets to NJ residents for $20. Details provided upon adoption. \n\nApplication will be accepted and an adopter chosen based on the needs of the dog.  We will contact you if you are chosen to adopt.  \n\nApplications can be made at bigdogrescueproject.org/adopt.  Please use the NJ Application. Thank you for considering Big Dog Rescue Project.",

Kiki is learning to walk on leash - she is a puller, ever exuberant to just keep moving forward. She does seem to have a prey drive, so we don't suggest a home with small animals. She enjoys walking with calm dogs, and she is not reactive to the dogs in the kennel where she is currently staying. She is very food motivated, and we are working on her manners when it comes to taking treats, so we would say no small children -- she hasn't shown guarding, but she gets very excited by high value treats... Kiki is about 6 years old and has obviously had puppies in her past. She will be spayed soon and would LOVE to find a calm, loving home with large dog experience where she can decompress and live a great life. She will make a wonderful and loving companion.",

Wink\u2019s routine vet exam and bloodwork that all our seniors get on arrival revealed that he has kidney disease, high blood pressure, dry eye, and an ear infection and he\u2019s on a special diet to help slow down progression of his kidney disease and medication for the other conditions.  We intercepted him before he was going to be surrendered to a local county shelter where with his medical issues and fearful personality he would have had a tough time.  \nWink is in foster care and doing well, and looking for a forever home where he will continue to get proper medical care and grooming for life.  He gets along with other dogs and is looking for a calmer low-traffic adult home without a lot of people coming and going and someone who will give him time to settle in.  Email njwoof@cs.com for an appointment to meet him.  \n\nDue to COVID-19, we will not be holding our Sunday adoption events until further notice, but we can schedule socially distant appointments with a specific dog outdoors at our vet\u2019s office:\nVCA Morris Plains Animal Hospital \n3009 Rt 10 East \nMorris Plains (Denville on GPS) NJ 07950\nNow is the perfect time to open your home to a needy dog!  Submit an application from our website www.secondchance.petfinder.com to speed up the adoption process\nAll our dogs reside in foster care in Northern NJ until adoption. We are a small all-volunteer organization focused on rescuing local dogs from area shelters, as well as accepting some surrenders and puppy mill rescues. \n",

She will need an adopter willing to continue working on her socialization and basic training.\nShe has had inconsistent intros with other dogs, so we are unsure whether she is dog friendly and would need proper intros-- (the notes from the shelter indicated she did a bit of fence-fighting, but that could simply be due to the stressful environment of the shelter).\n\nIf you are interested in Bobis, please visit our website for our application www.underdogaz.com",

Diego spent most of his life outside and for this reason would not be a match for an apartment and would benefit from a large, fenced in yard. Diego still need to learn to take treats and toys gently making a home with older children or only adults the most appropriate match. Diego is strong and can be reactive towards other dogs through a fence or on a leash, attending a positive reward based training session would help him work on this and will help him bond to his new owner.",

She loves to cuddle, too, and will snooze by your side while you read or watch TV. \nSadie would be best as an only pet; she has lived (relatively) peacefully with two small schnauzers, but she has a high prey drive and may not be as patient with new little guys in her life. She is NOT good with kitties. Sadie has also had a pretty rambunctious 9-year-old living with her for a while, and she is great with her. \nSadie is up to date with her shots, and has recently gotten her teeth cleaned and had a small benign growth removed from her toe. She?s ready for you! Can you give this sweet girl a chance at her forever home? \nHer adoption fee is $60.00 which includes her spay, vaccines, & microchip. She qualifies for the Senior for Senior adoption fee of $30.00 to individuals 60+. \nPlease contact us for private meeting with this sweet girl.",

            "description": "If you're looking for a big, sweet, and loving boy, than Rocko is the dog for you! Whether it's lounging on the couch or splashing around in the kiddie pool, his favorite activity, Rocko loves spending quality time with his people and any dogs he gets to call brother or sister. His favorite toys are tennis balls and plushes, but he knows how valuable they are to you and him so he does a great job of keeping them in one piece. Treats are really the way to his heart, though, and he'll do anything to earn a tasty snack. No one's ever called Rocko a shy boy, and his friendly personality is immediately open to anyone who meets him. Also, Rocko is both house and crate trained so there's no need to worry about any accidental messes in the house. All Rocko needs is a place to settle in, be himself, and for someone to return all the love he has to give, and he'll be the best companion you've ever seen! To learn more about adopting Rocko from foster care, email asoanimaladoption@austintexas.gov! I weigh approximately 72 lbs. Click here to view my paperwork.",

            "description": "Please read our adoption requirements at http://gsrne.org/requirements-for-adopting-from-gsrne before contacting us about this dog.\nKoda is an active boy with lots of energy. He loves to go on any adventure, be it a walk, car ride or just playing in the fenced yard.  He absolutely LOVES playing fetch and being chased by the female German Shepherd in his foster home.\nBecause Koda missed out on being socialized when he was a puppy, he needs a gradual introduction to new people and does best with people who know how to give him time to get comfortable. Koda has become a real cuddler, loves to be petted, and his tail starts to wag any time his foster Mom or Dad walk by him.\nKoda came into GSRNE because his lack of exposure to new situations had led to his being nervous and dog-reactive.  In his original home, he had run through the electric fence in his yard, grabbed a small dog being walked past the property, and his owners were told they needed to rehome him.  He had lived with another dog though, so we decided to give him a chance to get comfortable with the GSD in his foster home.  By taking the introduction gradually and walking the dogs together, it worked out nicely. He can still be reactive when he sees another dog while he\u2019s out for a walk, but he\u2019s learning to look to his person for direction.  He will need continued training, patience, and lots of new experiences, to continue helping him to learn to be comfortable in most situations.\nDuring the first weeks in his foster home, Koda would submissively urinate when he felt uncomfortable or pressured in many situations; as when attaching a leash, removing or putting on his collar, or being examined. Creating positive association, and teaching him new behaviors have helped him gain confidence and learn to trust the people in his foster home. He is learning that these things that previously made him nervous, can be positive rewarding experiences.\nThe ideal home for Koda will be with people who have experience with the breed, have the time, knowledge, and patience to continue working with him in the ways we\u2019ve found to be successful.  Koda would also enjoy the company of a friendly, playful female dog to play the chase games he really enjoys in the yard, and help burn off some of his energy.  \nMore photos: https://gsrne.org/gsrne-live/our-available-dogs/\n",

I am 3 years old and may not be able to write my own papers, but I'm happy to lay under your desk while you work.  I like a quiet life of snuggling, chewing my toys, and playing games with my people. I love learning, and I already know the basics like sit, down, \"hup\" to jump on something, and \"off\" to hop off of something.  I am working on my leash skills, and they are pretty good, but sometimes I get distracted by things around me. I know where my kennel is, how to go in, and I can hang out in it if you need me to. I can be a little nervous about new places, things, and sometimes people so I will need someone that understands and is willing to learn how to help me through that. I have epilepsy and am currently on medication, but I love snacks, so I have no problem taking my meds. I am a private fellow so would like a privacy fenced yard and a home without other pets or kids. I love the weather and such here so please local applications only! I can't wait to tell the story about how you walked in and my heart went 'BOOM!'\n\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

His history is that he's done well with other dogs. A confident female seems to be the best match for him to live with or be the only dog.Good with cats? NoGood with children? NoActivity Preference: Go with the flow, professional napper, likes a walkIQ: Pretty smartJax's favorite things: Lots of belly rubs and his humansJax is good at: meeting people, staying in a crate, riding in a carIdeal home: a fenced yard, no children or cats\nMEET JAX\nJax is a very sweet, sensitive boy who enjoys low-key, together time with is favorite human. He seems much younger than his estimated age of 6-7 years. He's a really good boy totally house trained, crate trained, good on a leash, and well-behaved. He's a mostly quiet boy, he will occasionally bark to 'scare away' people walking by or coming to the door. But we think he's all talk (don't tell him that though) we let him think he's super scary! LOL. He's just adorable with those pouty lips and soul-searching eyes. He will melt your heart! Jax is very friendly and does well meeting company. He loves spending his days with his foster family either working from home, going for a walk, or just relaxing. Jax is the perfect best friend for a lucky adopter out there.\n\nPLEASE READ: Adopters will not be considered without completing an application. Please visit www.AmericanBulldogRescue.org to apply!

Nova is a playgroup all-star and has gotten along with our rowdy shelter boys with gusto! She really enjoys her walks along the trail and playing with staff members out in the yard. Nova needs someone who is patient and gentle with her while she builds her confidence and sees that there is nothing to be afraid of. A quiet home would be best for her. They say that novas are the sudden appearance of a bright, apparently \"new\" star, that slowly fades over time; but something tells us you don't want this Nova to fade.

Torrie is house-trained and crate trained! She is very calm and quiet. She enjoys playing with tennis balls ?? and squeaky toys - she knows how to entertain herself! She is non-destructive and has wonderful house manners. She loves cuddles, going for walks, ice cubes, the occasional puppuccino and giving sloppy wets kisses. She does NOT like car rides as she gets very car sick. Torrie would make the perfect companion for someone without young children. I'm told she is not cat friendly and needs to be a single dog only. Aside from the fact she needs to be an only dog with no cats or children....she really is quite PERFECT! Would do better in a quiet home with adult(s). Needs slow introductions to new situations House trained Crate trained Timid around other dogs. Slow intros required. Not good with children. Not good with fast movements. No good with cats. Gets car sick Calm, sweet, quiet",

I'm 50 lbs and 5 1/2 years old so I'm well past the puppy stage but I still love to play tug of war and fetch. Foster Mom says I'm part reindeer because of the way I like to jump and prance.I am very good with other dogs. If they don't want to talk to me, I just go on about my business. Their loss! Haven't met any cats but don't care about squirrels and deer so I reckon cats won't bother me either.\n\nI know basic obedience but will pull on a leash to get to all the yummy smells! I am house broken and crate trained.\n\nSudden noises startle me a little and I need people to give me a moment to warm up to them, but then it's all good and I'm jumping all over the place.I sure would love a home with another dog to keep me company and build my self confidence. And I would love to go on long walks with you. I think it's best if your kids are a little older as I'm spooked a little easily. Although I'm getting more confident and comfortable as I spend time with my foster family.So if you're looking for a nice handsome fella who is quietly playful, come meet me.\n\nOptimus Prime is up-to-date, microchipped, and his adoption fee is $350.",

            "description": "In Foster/Available To Adopt \n\n***Only accepting applications with other dogs***\n\nDona is about 6 years old and from the Dog Meat Trade (Yulin Dog Meat Festival) in China. \n\nNotes from her foster:\n\n\"She loves my boyfriend. She idolizes him, and is more apt to approach men over women. She did have a bit of separation anxiety when he left the room in the beginning.\n\nShe lets me pet her and feed her kibble out of my hand but she\u2019s definitely more hesitant of me. I think she\u2019s more partial towards men and she\u2019ll do best with one in the equation over a single female adopter.\n\nShe\u2019s not a fan of sleeping in a crate, but loves sleeping on blankets in the living room with her. \n\nShe loves walks! She\u2019s the most outgoing and energetic when she\u2019s on them. When you pick up her leash she goes crazy! It\u2019s very cute to see.\n\nShe loves bunched up blankets and fluffy beds! She snuggles right into them and it\u2019s the most relaxed I see her. \n\nSudden movements and noises scare her so a house without children is probably best. She likes our 5-year-old dog more so than our puppy but she\u2019s content with both and seems to fit right into the pact. I think a home with other dogs would be good for her, but she would do well with a perfect home without dogs as well. \n\nOverall she is the sweetest, timid little thing, and she\u2019ll need a home that has a lot of patience. She\u2019s just had such a tough hand over the years, but despite all of it she wants to love and trust. We can tell it\u2019s just gonna take some time!\n\n\nApply to foster at: \nhttps://www.animalhopeandwellness.org/fosterprocessandapplication\n\nApply to adopt at: \nhttps://www.animalhopeandwellness.org/adoptionprocessandapplication\n\nWe are by appointment only. You must submit and have an approved application before meeting AHWF animals.\n\nFor General Adopt/Foster Inquiries: adopt@animalhopeandwellness.org",

Huck is good with one walk a day and a game of fetch in a fenced yard later on.  He also loves his big tennis ball and treats.  Huck needs to be in a home with no other dogs and no young children.

She might be best in an adult only home as too much activity seems to make her nervous.\n\nADOPTION FEES Dogs & Puppies.....$100.00 . This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more.\nThe first step to do an adoption is to do our Adoption Application here: https://www.elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html\nIMPORTANT - we respond to your emailed applications and queries via email back to you. Please make sure you have either added our email (hselco@bellsouth.net) to your contact list or that you routinely check your SPAM folder for our response just to be safe. If we do not receive a timely response we simply move on to another applicant.\nYes, there are sometimes exceptions to our normal fee for older dogs or special cases. Some of our pets have also been lovingly sponsored by caring people and we will let the approved adopter know about that at the point of adoption. Visit our Website at: http://www.elmorehumane.org The staff would also like to remind you that for faster response to inquiries about adoptable animals to have the animals ID#, name & description. This way your questions will be answered in a timely manner.\nAll pet adoption websites & our shelter management software require that we choose a primary and/or secondary breed for our dogs. While our staff is quite breed knowledgeable, in many cases we are truly making our best guesses as to their breed(s) based on many factors but cannot promise that what we have said is accurate. So taking into account your own parameters for things such as size, coat care, activity level, etc please come and get to know our dog(s) as individuals to see if their personalities and yours are a forever match.\nPhone: (334) 567-3377 Fax: (334) 567-8774 E-mail: hselco@bellsouth.net",

She is current on her vaccines, heartworm negative, house trained, microchipped and spayed. Micaela (nicknamed Kiki) has settled in quickly at her foster home. She is living with other dogs and does well with them but is still trying to establish how she ranks in the group. She should be okay with other dogs with a proper introduction and \u2018adult\u2019 supervision. Older dog savvy children only. \n\nAdoption fee: (Cash/Check) $200 (Credit/Debit) $205. This includes vet care and vaccines up until adoption, spaying/neutering, and microchip. If you have questions about an animal, please complete an adoption application at sqrescueinc.org  FIRST.  Someone will reach out to you once you are approved and be able to answer all your questions. Your application must be approved prior to meeting our dogs. Missing or incomplete information will delay processing of applications.  For questions about the application process, you may call 803.223.9729 and leave a message.",

            "description": "Reggie is an 8 year old black lab that spends most of his time laying at your feet. He is a sweet sweet boy that we have never heard bark, potentially because he can't, but also because he typically doesn't have a care in the world. We have had him for 3 months after he was found dehydrated, potentially having a heat stroke, and appeared to have been hit by a car. He doesn't move around too much but with a little encouraging he has started to go on walks and to dog parks this month (September). His pelvis was fractured before we got him but that has mostly resolved, although his legs give out from time to time. He also has laryngeal paralysis and pants pretty much 100% of the time. \n\nHe would make a great companion for a less active family or individual that still moves around some but also like to spend days lounging at home. Please reach out if you think this might be your boy, he is seriously the easiest dog we have ever cared for and is enjoying his golden years happily.\n\nTo set up a meet and greet or inquire about a dog, please first fill out an application at https://savinghoperescue.org/contact. It doesn't obligate you, but it is the first step. We don't get to all of the inquiries but respond to all applications. Thank you for choosing to rescue!",

By the looks of her we thought she was an old senior dog... so we named her MeMaw.\n\nWe found she had a mammary tumor that had abscessed, along with many other issues. We also discover the cat loves her, and she loves cats too!\n\nSurprisingly, Memaw is not 100 years old. She is only around 5 years old. This is what years of neglect did to this poor girl. Living in a crate and dumped like trash.\n\nAfter arriving at Good Dog Headquarters, Misty said \"girl, we can get you all fixed up!\"\n\nSo we got on the phone with the plastic surgeon, raised a little money and got a mommy makeover. Only bad news was that during surgery the vet realized they needed to remove 3 of her breasts due to tumors. We are not going to stop until this girl gets the AMAZING home she so deserves! She is the sweetest girl and didn't know what love was till now.\n\nA little nip and tuck does a body good.\n\nOut with the old, in with the new! She went from MeMaw to \"Glam Maw\" and now she is bringing sexy back! She is so sweet and easy. Please think about opening your home up to Glam Maw. Thank you to all who helped with her care and continue to support her journey.\nFor more info call or text 903-235-0383, email agdadoptions@gmail.com or click the link below to fill out an adoption application!\n\nhttp://plus.allforms.mailjol.net/u/b16bad72.php\n\nFilling out your application is the first step of the process. Once we receive your application, it will be reviewed, then someone will get back to you within the next few days!",

Please, Please, understand he needs training, he needs exercise, he needs a home where he is the only dog and preferably older children (16+), he is the sweetest, goofiest dog, who just needs a human who will be patient and has time for training.\n\nMeatball is a 4yr old, neutered male, Pitbull. I am going to tell you what we know about him and what he needs as this sweet baby needs the right forever home!!! What we know, he is eager to please, he loves to play, chase tennis balls, he is a goof, he has energy to burn, he loves to go on walks, he learns quickly. He loves loves loves food, very food motivated, this will help with training. He doesn't like big dogs or male dogs and no alpha dogs. He would make a great hiking, camping, walking buddy with training. He needs a fenced yard, no exceptions, he is not an apartment dog. \n\nMy adoption fee is $200\n\n1. Do you own or rent? \n2. If you rent can you get a letter form landlord stating you can have a Pit bull?\n3. Do you have a nice size yard for him to run off energy? \n4. Do you have a securely fenced yard? \n5. How many people live in the home? Age groups? \n6. How many animals and types live in your home? \n7. Meatball needs training, do you have the time for this? \n Primary Color: Grey Secondary Color: White Weight: 51lbs Age: 4yrs 5mths 0wks Animal has been Neutered",

Tiny Tim does have some mobility issues that occasionally makes it hard to walk. He may have come from a \"not-so-great\" home before ending up at the shelter as he is terrified of many things. He is slowly but surely learning to trust new people. We hope this little guy will have a happy forever home for the holidays. \n\nTiny Tim is looking for an adult-only home and one that has experience with anxious or frightened dogs is great. A patient, dog savvy person is what Tiny Tim needs to help him come around to understanding. He is not cuddly or affectionate at this time, but with familiarity and love shown him, he will grow to be a great addition to his future person's home. Tiny Tim is loving when he is not stressed but he is bitey when he is. He wags his tail in desire to be picked up. He becomes really happy when comfortable and gets along great with other dogs. He will ask his people to go up or down stairs and loves being able to get out in a yard. \n\nHis mobility issues stem from significant arthritis and some disc narrowing along his lumbar spine -- it almost appears as if he may have had a previous spinal injury which has since healed. Both his patellas are medially luxated and will not return to their normal position, causing significant gait abnormalities and weakness in his back legs. There is also some mild arthritis in both knees as well. POMDR is consulting with an orthopedic specialist to find the best way to help his mobility. \n\nTiny Tim joined us from the Santa Cruz County Animal Shelter after being found as a stray.",

Absolutely no young childrenTeddy is a cutie for sure. He is very strong willed and will require a firm, experienced hand. He spent 2 months with our certified trainer.\nOlder children only and no other dogs. Teddy is randomly selective.\nTeddy was found running frantically around a Spring, Texas neighborhood. AARF Houston was called in to help. After scanning for a microchip, and none found, Teddy was placed in boarding while we searched for his owner. Teddy has been neutered, is up to date on all vaccinations and has been microchipped.\nTeddy needs his own family to love him. Teddy needs a secure yard, and a family with older children (over 8) to help him become the boy he is supposed to be.\nIs that famly you? =========================================================\nPlease contact app@aarfhouston.org for more information about this dog. You can apply online by clicking on Application .\nPuppies that are under 4 months old cannot be adopted outside of our Veterinary Service area. Please call for specific locations. Children under 8 years old often are not a good match for our puppies and dogs. In order to protect both, your child and our rescued dogs/puppies from harm, we seldom if ever adopt to families with young children.\nOnce your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events. Thank you for considering a rescue! The adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you.",

I probably have some Lab, some Poodle, and some Irish Wolfhound in my DNA pool (I DO SHED - so if hypo allergenic is your vibe, I'm not a match).   l'd love a life where I get to take walks, get great care and lots of love in a stable low key household.\u00a0  I may like to be the only spoiled child so I get all of the attention even though I like playing with other good natured dogs.  Did I mention that I would love a big tempurpedic dog bed?\n\nWhere can you meet me? (First fill out an application and then after it is reviewed and you are a potential match, you'll be contacted to set a meet and greet appointment time.)\n\nOPERATION ADOPT\n706 Kiser Station Road\nFriendsville, TN  37737\n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY\n\nAll animals are spayed/neutered, current on age appropriate vaccinations and microchipped before they go to new homes because that's the responsible way to keep them all safe.\n\nTo adopt one of our animals, the first step is filling out an adoption application at www.tapsusa.org Please make sure you get a confirmation that your application has been submitted. \n\nWe only adopt to local homes  in the immediate vicinity because we utilize our volunteer force to process home visits.  Photos of your home, letters of reference are not acceptable which is why we only adopt locally. Only in very rare circumstances do we adopt out of area.  Examples of this would be finding the perfect home for a senior animal or one that has other special needs that we have not been able to place locally for an extended period of time.",

He can be a bit aggressive with some other dogs, so should be the only dog in the home.  He is great with people, and has nice inside manners.  He is crate trained and house trained.  His prior owner said he lived with cats but he seems much too curious about the cats at his new foster home, so that could be a question if you have cats. \n\nRojo is looking for a forever family to call his own. His adoption fee is $200, which includes neuter surgery and vaccinations (parvo/distemper and rabies.) If you would like to meet this dog, please email us: scfourpaws@hotmail.com or leave a message @ 435-764-3534. Please be patient with us getting back to you as we are all volunteers with full-time jobs. Thanks for your interest in this wonderful dog!!",

He was found still guarding the property and being 'rude' to anyone that approached. He has made great strides at trust and friendship with his people, but is weary of strangers. Once you are accepted, get ready to play! Toys are his favorite thing in the world and he treasures toys from his favorite people. To be honest, we're not sure of his breed. He has a long fluffy coat that sheds like a northern breed, but a smaller face than the other dogs at the farm. If you are willing to forge a lifelong friendship, Rudy might be the guy for you! \nRudy will need 6 foot fencing with dig guards, and to live in a legal area just to be safe.",

            "description": "Leonard\n\nArrives in Castle Rock tomorrow\nBassett Hound/Lab/Staffordshire Terrier fusion is out best guess \n1-3 years old\nDog friendly (would do best with another dog in the home)\nNo cats\nGood with the kids he's met but he does get excited and jump \nHouse trained\nWorking on crate training and very eager to please so will be easily motivated \nLoves to play \nHeavy chewer\nLoves to cuddle \nVery affectionate\nFully vetted beyond needing to be neutered\n39lbs\n\nInformation from Leonard's Temp Foster\n\nLeo is a true character....just watching him trot around the house with those short legs and turned out feet just makes me smile.\n\nLeo was a bit skittish of me the first night, but he bonded immediately with the other dogs, especially my older German Shepherd. He was game to play with any of the dogs here, including my pittiie and a pit mix foster. He does not back away from a good wrestling match:)\n\nLeo is NOT cat friendly.\n\nHe hasn't had any accidents in the house or crate ( including while I'm at work), other than marking his territory. I don't think he has ever met an object he didn't want to pee \non:). He has a good appetite- I've been giving him 1.5 cups of dog chow, twice a day. \n\nHe is not a huge fan of the crate, but has gotten a lot better about going in there, especially since I feed him in there. He may not want to go in the crate, but once in he doesn't whine or cry. \n\nCold weather and snow don't seem to bug him.\n\nLeo is an EXTREME power chewer- keep an eye on him! He seemed to like nylabones. \nHe will also jump up on you- he might not be great with small children. \n\nWhile I think he would adjust fine to an only dog home, I think he would really thrive in a home with a slightly older dog who could mentor him. Once he saw my dogs interacting with me he warmed right up and now he loves me. He enjoys snuggling, licking arms and giving wet sloppy kisses. He always seems happy and ready to go with the flow. He was great with my two quirky females and he LOVES belly rubs. \n\nLeo is a pretty active dog. He's not super obedient, but he is smart and wants his people to love him, so I think he can be trained fairly easily.\n\nWe will miss this little guy, but he leaves us with lots of love and positive thoughts!\n\nIf you're interested in helping this amazing boy please contact us!\n\nTo Contact Us\n\nMessage us through our website http://www.highplainspaw.org\n\nMessage the Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/HighPlainsPAW\n\nFill out our Adoption Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/adoption-application\n\nFill out our Foster Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/foster-application\n\nEmail us at highplainspaw@gmail.com\n\nCall our voicemail at (402)957-1578\n\n $200.00 Adoption Fee \n(Which is considered a non refundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible. The fee itself is not negotiable, our vets don't negotiate and thus neither do we.) \n\nWE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY ALL OUR DOGS ARE LOCATED IN FOSTER HOMES. This means there is no place for you to go in person to view our dogs. We ask that an application be filled out and we will go from there!\n\n by Sybil",

            "description": "Meet Rupert! He is a handsome pooch who currently weighs about 62 pounds. He came to the shelter as a stray. He is about 4 years old which is a great age to be a couch potato or go on long walks! An ideal day for Rupert would include a lovely long walk with his favorite person and lots of treats! Here at the shelter he has been a sweet boy that would love to learn some tricks. Rupert is very treat motiviated and is full of happiness. As always, if you have another dog at home you're more than welcome to bring them in for a Meet n' Greet. Rupert's adoption fee is $130. He has been neutered, microchipped, has age appropriate vaccinations and comes with 30 days of complimentary pet insurance! Come in and meet him today. We're excited to announce that our training classes have become virtual and are facilitated through Zoom meetings. See https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/group-training-classes/ for more information about schedules and registration for online training classes. We are also offering support for recent adopters through our Trainer Talks also through Zoom meetings, prior registration is required.

            "description": "Bubba is in a foster home, and is currently not at the shelter. Please find info below on how to adopt him, thanks.\n\n\n\nMeet Bubba, a fan favorite amongst our dog behavior team volunteers! An easy-going boy at home, Bubba is an affectionate dog who enjoys leaning in for some good pets and prancing around with his toys. You can see him playing with one of his volunteer friends in his video below. \n\n\n\nOn walks, Bubba feels conflicted about passing moving cars or people in close proximity and displays this with barking and pulling hard (\"reactivity\") so living in an apartment building or other densely populated areas can be very overwhelming for him. He would enjoy a home that has a fenced in area where he can feel comfortable outside and show off his great prance that he has! \n\n\n\nBubba is looking for an adult only home that can continue the training he has been learning while here at Seattle Animal Shelter! Bubba would thrive with a family who is ready to give him the time and extra training to help him feel more comfortable while out on walks. \n\n\n\nBubba likes to romp with toys and will always be happy to settle on a chew. He would like to be the center of your world and not share his home with other dogs or cats. He is very smart and active and will need a family where everyone is on the same page with his training and ready to establish a predictable routine full of physical and mental activities.\n\n\n\nHOW TO ADOPT - Please fill out a Dog Adoption Application, available at http://www.seattle.gov/animalshelter/forms.htm and email it to the Seattle Animal Shelter Foster Dog Program at adoptionreview@gmail.com.\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Many of our dogs will receive numerous applications, and the Seattle Animal Shelter asks for your patience during the process of finding the very best match. If you have questions about this dog that have not been answered above, please contact us at sasfosterdogs@gmail.com. If you would like to arrange to meet this dog, you must submit an adoption application. Thank you!",

He is a little protective of his food due to his not having food before being rescued, and he REALLY loves to eat.  He was abandoned and in very bad shape when we found him.  He was treated by a vet and received all of his vaccines and has been neutered.  He suffered a lot before he was rescued and was very fortunate to have survived since sadly, some of his siblings died.  He is a sweet boy and deserves the very best.  He would love a grassy yard and does well with other dogs so a home with another dog would be a big plus for him.  He needs someone who is patient and loving and will take good care of him.",

Mostly because they found I was heartworm positive so now I\u2019m in a treatment that will get rid of those nasty things in my heart and after that\u2019s done, I can go to my new home! But until then, I am in my foster home for another couple of months. I could use a blanket and bed of my own, and I just love those bones with peanut butter filling! I hide them in my bed so no one else finds them!

I am a 2 year old, 30 lbs, male Blue Heeler mix. I am a social, confident, and loving guy! \u00a0Sometimes it takes me a few moments to feel comfortable in new environments, but with a confident leader at the end of my leash, I'll be relaxed in no time. \u00a0I am a sweet, sensitive\u00a0boy who would love to have a happy, calm human bestie. \u00a0I am a sweetest boy this side of the Mississippi. \u00a0I am already a professional at both house and crate training. I am great with other dogs and would adore having some canine siblings. I am also friendly to cats and would do fine with older kids in the house. I\u2019ll need a chain link fence in my forever home so no apartment or big rig life for me, please. I am currently in prison (known as Pups for Parole) and am learning so much cool stuff and all about how to be an amazing pup. I will be back shortly. For me, finding my happy place is easy, it is with you. So fill out that application for me, Zinn.\u00a0\n\nI am currently enrolled in the Pups 4 Parole training program, learning all of the things I need to know to make me a great family member. I need someone willing to keep up my training so that I don't forget everything I am learning.\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

He will go in a crate, leash up, sit, but could use some polish/training on his skills. No cats, no small children, must live in a legal area, and needs 6ft fencing with dig guards.

We are a specialized rescue and our animals may not be legal in your area**\nwww.fullmoonfarm.org\n\nDo you like sitting quietly with dogs? Then you'll love D'Artagnan and Tallah! This nephew/aunt pair would be adoptable to the right, understanding home. You see, they don't like walkies. Maybe you could change their minds with hard work and dedication, but right now they just want to play on their own. If you've ever visited the farm, one of your first memories was probably D'Artagnan's striking blue eyes watching your arrival. Tallah is more timid, but she will let you know when she wants affection. \nD'Artagnan and Tallah are not 'add collar = instant pet' kind of dogs. They would be happy in a large enclosure with daily visits from their people. They would need 6 foot fencing and dig guards. They are excellent diggers and Tallah likes to keep a multi room den in the middle of her enclosure. They must live in a legal area. Any potential owners would need the means to do house calls with their local vet. \nWe know they wouldn't be the traditional dog experience, but they are so calm and sweet that they would make someone excellent backyard companions. \nFor more information or an adoption application, please email nancy@fullmoonfarm.org",

He was rescued from PBACC and is eager to find his very own furever home. He is very athletic and will enjoy a large fenced yard (although make sure its a high one!) and maybe even a doggie pool of his very own. Jackson weighs about 37 pounds and was born in October of 2018.\n\nHe is good with other dogs, rides very well in the car and on our golf cart, and just happens to have stunning good looks. Jackson is high energy and would benefit from obedience training to make him an A plus canine pal. He is best suited for a home without young children. \n\nJackson is at our Palm City location and is eager to meet you! Please call the ranch at 561-972-1194 to make an appointment to meet Jackson. I guarantee you will fall in love with this special boy!\n\nAdopt Don't Shop",

We are a specialized rescue and our animals may not be legal in your area**\nwww.fullmoonfarm.org\n\nDo you like sitting quietly with dogs? Then you'll love D'Artagnan and Tallah! This nephew/aunt pair would be adoptable to the right, understanding home. You see, they don't like walkies. Maybe you could change their minds with hard work and dedication, but right now they just want to play on their own. If you've ever visited the farm, one of your first memories was probably D'Artagnan's striking blue eyes watching your arrival. Tallah is more timid, but she will let you know when she wants affection. \nD'Artagnan and Tallah are not 'add collar = instant pet' kind of dogs. They would be happy in a large enclosure with daily visits from their people. They would need 6 foot fencing and dig guards. They are excellent diggers and Tallah likes to keep a multi room den in the middle of her enclosure. They must live in a legal area. Any potential owners would need the means to do house calls with their local vet. \nWe know they wouldn't be the traditional dog experience, but they are so calm and sweet that they would make someone excellent backyard companions. \nFor more information or an adoption application, please email nancy@fullmoonfarm.org",

She was taken away from her fur mom at 12 years old  (due to breed restrictions)  and found her way to an organization we work with frequently. They reached out to us for help.   \n\nHer fur mom did not want her life to end in a public shelter, which would have been so unfair for this GREAT dog!  \n\nKeiny has an awesome temperament. She is good with all humans, young and old, and other dogs. Keiny would prefer to live her life out without cat friends.  Our vet could not believe she was 12. She is extremely healthy and still pretty spunky! \n\nShe likes a good toy and running all over the yard - an amazing dog.\nShe would make a great addition to any family who has big heart for seniors who still have lots of life and love to give.",

We are a specialized rescue and our animals may not be legal in your area**\nwww.fullmoonfarm.org\n\nBree was rescued in a litter of 5 puppies. She was quickly adopted but returned due to no fault of her own. She lived with William (a GSD) and loves the company of older male dogs. Bree takes awhile to warm up to people but will thrive with an outgoing dog companion. Bree loves water and loves to play with toys!\nBree will need 6 foot fencing with dig guards. She must live in a legal area. Do you have the time and patience to win this girl's heart?",

            "description": "This handsome man is Rocky! Rocky is a special fellow that needs a special home. Rocky was severely abused in his Puerto Rican home and when they got sick of him, they brought him to get euthanized. Thankfully the vet refused to do it and sent him to us instead. Rocky has some lasting effects from the abuse and he needs an owner that is understanding of that and will work through it with him. Rocky is a loyal companion. He will love his human unconditionally and protect them at all costs. He is super smart and extremely quick at learning new tricks. He is house and crate trained. He loves other dogs and even does fine with cats. \n\nRocky's biggest issue is that he is scared to strangers (rightfully so), but it to the point that he feels he needs to be aggressive to protect himself from being hurt again. Rocky won't go looking for trouble, but if a stranger stands over him or puts their face in his face, he will stand up for himself. After knowing someone for a few hours, he is completely fine with them and will accept pets and love. He just needs to know that he can trust you first. Rocky does not like men and can not go to a home with a man or children. His abuser was a man, so of course he is extra scared around men. He doesn't dislike children, but children often don't understand that they can't put their face in his face, so we don't think it's safe to send him to a home with kids. When Rocky is comfortable with a person, they can do whatever they want to him and he won't care. We can run his belly, kiss his nose and pick him up. He just needs an owner that is willing to give him time to adjust. Once you give Rocky a chance, you won't regret it. He is so loving and playful. He will cuddle with you all day. He always looks at you with the biggest smile and follows you wherever you go! He is truly a wonderful dog. \n\nPlease only apply for Rocky if you are understanding of his needs and are willing to continue with his training. You can apply for Rocky here: www.whenthegoinggetsruff.org/adopt",

            "description": "If you are looking for the nicest and happiest dog in Maryland then Bear is for you! He wakes each day with a positive attitude and has never met a human he does not like. That includes kids. He has plenty of energy and is up for any adventure you can think of. Bear loves walks, hikes, watching movies, exploring the yard, and taking naps. His absolute favorite activity, though, is Tug of War. He lives for this game and will take on anyone. Bear is completely house trained and is working on crate training. When left alone, he doesn't get into things or chew things that don't belong to him. He is a perfect gentleman! His foster family thinks he is perfectly behaved and he couldn't be any cuter! Bear is not really interested in other dogs. When sharing his home with another dog, he can become angry if the dog gets near his things or his people. Because of this, Bear must be the only dog. He is very interested in the cats, but because they run, no one is sure how introductions would go or if he would also guard his belongings. Bear's only Christmas wish is to have a home of his own to hang his stocking and wait for Santa to spoil him. \n\nBear is currently undergoing Chemotherapy for Mast Cell Cancer.  He currently is cancer free but because his cancer was aggressive he is being treated in an aggressive manner in hopes that his cancer does not return.  Bear's medication is an oral pill and he will need monthly checkups with his oncologist until he completes his treatment.  Don't let Bear's cancer diagnosis deter you from adopting this guy.

Literally just the mere presence (she'd prefer within 6 inches or less) of her people. But, because she loves her people so much, she tends to get anxious when they leave, can be unsure of how to respond sometimes, and always feels the need to protect - even when there's no need for protection. All that assumed responsibility and confusion she takes on can be stressful, which has at times led to aggression.\n\nThat's why she needs a family willing to work with her to show her what's okay to do, what's not, and that they're in charge and can handle things themselves. All she has to do is relax and be the cute, sweet pup she is. Kirstyn's current fosters have been working with a trainer to help show her that they're the ones who do the protecting. She's already catching on and doing very well. We're looking for experienced adopters who will be able to keep that kind of structure up and continue to advocate for her.\n\nWe'll require that Kirstyn's adopters continue to work with the trainer to keep her on the road to success and #nostress. She may take a little extra effort at first. But just look at that face and think of all the cuddles! This sweet girl is so, so worth it!",

She's 1 year old, friendly, social, and cute as can be. She has lived with a pen mate and would do best with a large male dog with a good temperament. She needs work on her manners and leash skills, but she's smart and food motivated. She must live in a legal area, needs 6'+ fencing (she can climb 6' chainlink), will need dig guards, and has too much energy for cats and small children. With work and patience, Lady has what it takes to be a really good dog. \nIf you have what it takes, email nancy@fullmoonfarm.org for an adoption application.",

Winter is 6 years old and spayed. She loves people, loves to play, loves to pose for treats, and is good on a leash. She is perfect except for 2 things: she gets rambunctious in her enclosure and doesn't like other dogs. \nWinter will need 6 foot fencing, dig guards, and to live in a legal area. She will need to be an only dog or have a full time secure space to herself. No cats and no small children.\nIf you're able to give our luck dragon the single life she deserves, please email nancy@fullmoonfarm.org for an adoption application.",

Her foster mom says: Rosalie is housebroken, not destructive, and very calm and relaxed in the home! She is cuddly and loves belly rubs. She has learned sit, stay & come. She is such a loyal girl to her people! Great leash walker when there aren't too many distractions around. She is a wonderful dog who still needs some training to get used to strangers and seeing other dogs outside. She will be the most loyal friend to whoever adopts her!\" \n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Rosalie and/or setting up a meeting, please email foster@lifelineanimal.org for more information!",

We are a specialized rescue and our animals may not be legal in your area**\nwww.fullmoonfarm.org\n\nOur very own captain of cute, Bosco. Bosco is adoptable! He came to the farm as a stray in South Carolina so we don't know his history. We have an embark test available to prospective adopters. He's probably around a year old, loves squeaky toys, zoomies, scent rolling, and playing in his pool. He would very much like a well mannered friend around the same size. He takes awhile to warm up to new people but is a sweetheart to his regulars. He will need work on his leash skills but has good manners in his enclosure. \nBosco will need 6' fencing, dig guards, and to live in a legal area. We haven't tested him around kids and, like most northern breeds, he shouldn't be around cats. \nIf you're looking for a cute buddy with round ears, please email nancy@fullmoonfarm.org for an adoption application.",

            "description": "Betsy is a sweet, loving girl rescued from a high intake shelter in Memphis, TN. She is living in a foster home waiting for her forever family.\n\nBetsy is one of the most happy, go lucky dogs in our home. She has played the companion dog to many of her foster brothers and sisters. She is our go to girl when introducing majority of the dogs, especially ones that are scared & uncertain. We believe Retriever can be found in Betsy's DNA because she loves water. She jumps in and out of the kiddie pool sometimes emerging her face in the water. She loves running and playing. \n\nBetsy is a special needs dog. Due to digestive problems, her preferred food is Pro Plan EN. We like to think of it as special food for a special girl.\n\n\nIf you are interested in one of our animals, please complete an application. The application link can be found on our Petfinder homepage under the picture. You may also find our application on our website at www.teammemphis.org under the Our Rescue page. If they are listed on our website, their adoptions have not been finalized yet. That does not mean that we have not received several applications, already. Please complete an application if you are interested and we will keep you apprised of their current status. We are all volunteers who work full-time jobs and have animals of our own, so please be patient with us. We will get back with you as quickly as possible.",

Val is a young, handsome Pyr boy who was severely neglected before coming to NGPR. As a result of his previous situation, he suffered a break in his rear right foot that never healed properly. This hasn\u2019t stopped Val from doing what he loves and being the sweetest boy ever. Val manages his pain by regulating his play and going to lay down when he gets sore. Meds will be needed for pain management as well. Val\u2019s new family must be committed to monitoring this old injury and seeking appropriate care if needed. Val loves other dogs and will play for 10 minute intervals. He\u2019s lived with cats, horses, and chickens and does well with all his animal friends. Val loves nothing more than to snuggle with his humans or curl up with a good bone. Val will quickly find a way into your heart with his beautiful loving eyes. He aims to please and listens extremely well. He is calm, gentle and promises to stay on the nice list! Apply for this sweet boy today and make his Christmas wish come true!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

We are a specialized rescue and our animals may not be legal in your area**\nwww.fullmoonfarm.org\n\nLuna is the sweetest girl and is adoptable! Luna was part of the big Washington rescue two years ago. She found a home but recently came back to the farm due to no fault of her own. We put her with Bosco for a while, but she's just too big and bossy for the little guy (She sat on him. There, I said it). She would probably be ok with a well mannered male her own size. She walks on a leash but pulls when excited. Luna has an amazing howl, long red fur, and a pink stripe down the front if her nose: what's not to love!\nLuna will need to live in a legal area, 6 foot fencing, and dig guards. No small children or cats. \nFor an adoption application, email nancy@fullmoonfarm.org",

We are a specialized rescue and our animals may not be legal in your area**\nwww.fullmoonfarm.org\n\nHercules is looking for a home!\nWe've gotten to know this guy a lot better since he was first rescued. He is pure fun! He needs some work on his manners, but that's because he never stops playing! He'll play with anything, be it a specialized enrichment toy or an old spool. He loves water. In fact he's the only dog at the farm to keep his swimming pool through the cold months because he NEEDS to splash! He is 2 years old, fixed, and has clear hip and knee x-rays. According to his embark DNA test, he may have degenerative myelopathy. If you have the energy and love to give this silly boy, email nancy@fullmoonfarm.org \n\nHercules will need 6 foot fencing and dig guards. Due to his age and energy, no small children and no cats. He hasn't had a penmate but with his playful attitude, we expect him to do well with a gentle, tolerant dog friend. Must live in a legal area.",

Company is fine he is very social.  \n\n-Beagle Experience\n\nArgos is fully trained in off leash obedience by our good friends at Allied Dog Training.\n\nHe is a super social beagle- good with all animals and people.\n\n\nArgos is a sensitive and emotional dog that thrives pleasing one human. Two humans can be hard for him as he loves rules and structure- he feels safe- two humans usually do not interact with a dog in the same manner.\n\nHe needs to have confidence and a single human home in the country would be ideal.\n\nHe needs a gentle leader to thrive and provide rules and structure .\n\nHe is great with all other animals. He even went to doggy daycare in the past.\n\nHe is a typical beagle and a leader or someone with breed experience should look no further!\n\nCall or text Christine if you MEET the requirements 914-772-0649\n\nApplications www.townandcountryk9resq.org under contact us.\n\nAdopters will receive handling lessons from our trainers in Dutchess County NY",

I am a friendly, fun little guy who enjoys spending time with people and some other dogs (I am dog selective). I do resource guard my food, so if there are other pets at home I will need to be fed in a separate area from them. I would do best in a home with older children or adults and with someone who could keep an eye on me while I am outside (I am very clever and have jumped a fence before). If you'd like to give me the loving home I deserve, please click the link below and make sure to ask for Morty! \nhttps://www.picktime.com/61eb69c2-2e72-47ff-bcf0-01e8ce01f1c5",

She is a beautiful dog that needs an active home and someone that will be her best friend.\n\nShe is very friendly to people. Very smart. She is an escape artist and if bored she will get out of a fenced yard. She can go over a six foot fence. The foster believes she would enjoy trick school.\n\nVery loyal. She has spent a lot of time with Bret (foster) and she loves him. \n\nIf she does get out all you have to do is drive to where she is even if it is next door and she is happy to jump in and go home. \n\nIt took her a little more time to like being with the pack but she doesn\u2019t mind now. She gets along with everyone but she would prefer to be the only dog or maybe just one other dog.\n\nCannot be left alone outside for one minute. She will either jump the fence or watch the gate for a chance. \n\nNeeds to eat with no other dogs close. She was a stray and had to fend for herself so she should eat in her crate \n\n\nBaby needs someone that is very active. Take her to the park often and out in public. Really the person needs to be someone who their best friend is Baby and they do everything together. \n\nShe is not a loud dog. Will bark some but basically pretty quiet. \n\nWhen left in the kennel it does need to be very secure. She gets in the kennel with no problem but if she sees a small chance to escape she will take it. I think maybe it just a challenge for her. \n\nBaby is spayed and up to date on vaccinations.",

            "description": "Meet Louie! This handsome young pit bull terrier mix boy is one year old. He is neutered, up to date on all his vaccines and heartworm/flea/tick prevention. Louie is a sweet boy and is good with older school aged kids (no young children because of his size) and other friendly dogs. He is a little too interested in cats so a home without them is recommended. He is not a high energy dog. He loves getting his exercise outside and relaxing on the couch. Louie is crate trained and is doing great with house-training with no accidents at his foster home. He will be a wonderful addition to your family with his very sweet and loving personality. Home ownership, a fenced yard and experience with the breed are requirements for adoption. Please make sure your local ordinance allows this breed. \n.WANT TO MEET THIS DOG?  CLICK ON  \"More About Us' and choose APPLICATION LINK. \nCurrent on all vaccinations, heartworm negative on monthly preventative, microchipped \n\nLouie is in the Paws in Prison program where dogs receive obedience training. This dog is expected to graduate from Paws in Prison on1/5/21 . The dogs in this program are trained under the AKC Canine Good Citizen standards and are specifically selected to be family and companion dogs. They spend 24 hours a day with their trainers. For that reason, they will do best in homes where they are primarily inside dogs and spend lots of time with their families. The adoptive family will receive their training journal. This journal documents everything from entering the facility, daily training progress, and interactions with trainers.  \n",

We had no idea she was pregnant so she really surprised us when she gave birth 1 week after entering the shelter, she birthed 2 pups but only Sara survived.  Cleo is @ 18 months old and scheduled for her spay and vetting on January 7, 2021.  She is a gorgeous bronze color and has a beautiful face.  She is still playful, does well on a leash and warms up to strangers quickly.  Cleo will make someone a great family dog.  She does like to dig, it doesn't appear she is trying to escape but digging for something she thinks is underground.",

            "description": "Miss Pittie is a 3 year old female pitbull who weighs 56 lbs. She is spayed, heartworm negative, and shots are up to date. She is a very loving dog who also needs a family who will help with her skin issues. She needs to be with active people who are experienced with high energy dogs. She likes to play with other dogs but due to her energetic nature, she is not fit for a home  with small or older dogs. She would be best in a home as the only dog or with another dog whose personality is compatible with her. It is important she is lives in a community that is supportive of the pitbull breed.\nApply here:\nhttps://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/LCA/Dog\n\nMiss Pittie is in the Paws in Prison program where dogs receive obedience training. This dog is expected to graduate from Paws in Prison on 1/19. The dogs in this program are trained under the AKC Canine Good Citizen standards and are specifically selected to be family and companion dogs. They spend 24 hours a day with their trainers. For that reason, they will do best in homes where they are primarily inside dogs and spend lots of time with their families. The adoptive family will receive their training journal. This journal documents everything from entering the facility, daily training progress, and interactions with trainers.  \n",

Housetrained and crate trained. LOVES tennis balls- chewing and chasing them. Will test his owners- doesnt like to go in his kennel at night if hes made himself comfortable on the bed- will grumble, but instantly goes in his kennel for a treat. Knows basic commands but will need training to come when called and leash walking. Duke does have diabetes and EPI (enzymatic pancreatic insufficiency). Diabetes is regulated with insulin shots twice daily and regulated meals and treats. EPI is regulated with a powder food additive twice daily (every meal). Adopters will need to be committed to the financial responsibility of regular veterinary visits, annual bloodwork and medication costs to keep his diabetes regulated. He does GREAT with his meals and medications. He gets VERY excited for food.",

The biggest issue I have is because I can't see what is approaching me, I will act aggressive in order to protect myself. Once I know your scent I am very sweet and love to cuddle, but if a human or other animal startles me i may nip. For this reason, I need to be in a home without young children. I do like other dogs, as long as they are patient and willing to show me the ropes. I will need to find a very special adopter who understands my special needs and will help me learn the tools to have a happy, fulfilled life. Experience with blind dogs is a plus.\n\nI am available through SOCA-FBC, https://soca-fbc.org/adoptables/ My adoption fee will be $350, which includes vaccines, spay, and microchip.",

The way to Banksy\u2019s heart is through his stomach \u2013 with treats! Toys are good, too. He loves squeaky toys and it pretty gentle with them. Banksy is selective about his doggy friends; like many dogs, he prefers those who give him space and don\u2019t get all up in his face. Banksy would probably do best with a calm female. \n\nYou can't tell from the photos, but Banksy's a little guy, for a pittie, just around 40 pounds or so.

I have the cutest, floppiest ears! I have very white, short fur, but as I get older, brown and black spots are starting to show up.\n\nI am up to date on my shots, I'm chipped and spayed. I am a puppy, so I'm still learning how to potty outside. I love to learn so I feel like I'm getting really close! I love to play and chew on bones. I live with my foster brother who is a 4 year old boxer. He is very patient with me and we get a long great. I also live with 2 human sisters age 11 and 12. I am super sweet and love to cuddle! I sometimes get a little feisty, but my foster mom is learning it's usually when I'm hungry, tired or overstimulated.\n\nBecause I'm a puppy, I don't like to be left alone for too long. I sleep in a dog bed next to my foster parents at night and if they go anywhere, they put me in a play pen.\n\nI would love to meet you!

It used to be Gnome, when I was at Austin Pets Alive, and before that it was Max, and some of my friends still call me that.\n\nThat's one of the things about living a shelter/rescue life, you don't even get a name to call your own forever. And you sure don't get things of your very own, like toys and bones and treats that are still there when you come back if you didn't finish them right away. It's enough to make a guy kind of protective when he gets a hold of something good.\n\nI am a wise, loving, kind old man, unless you try to take something away from me when I want to keep it. That's really pretty easy to manage, though. Just understand where that need is coming from, and you will want me to feel safe with my stuff.\n\nI like meeting new people, and I could possibly live with another dog, and I am generally easygoing and cuddly and loving. I've had a very hard life. I still have a big scar on my leg from when I was shot, and for a long time I lived pretty much on my own, and then I lived in a kennel for a while. I've always had a few loyal friends, but I haven't been able to live with them. Now I live with this nice lady who understands me and wants me to have a comfy home where I will be safe and loved for the rest of my life.\n\nI'm available for foster or adoption in the Austin, TX area.\n\nAdoption application:\nhttps://tinyurl.com/ffrp-adoptions\n\nFoster application:\nhttps://tinyurl.com/ffrp-foster",

We're learning a lot about him and it's all good stuff!\n\nHe's completely potty trained and has never had one accident! He follows his foster mom everywhere, like a shadow. He's also amazing on walks, he never ever pulls. \n\nGrizzle loves the dog park. He's quite popular with the other dogs and has human friends too! When he plays with other pups, he's really gentle. His signature move is to lick their face and give kisses constantly. He's absolutely amazing around new people and will cuddle/give kisses to any new person he meets.\n\nOther favorite pastimes include: a good bone to chew on or a stuffed toy that he can rip the stuffing out of! Nothing gets him more excited than a Puppacino from Starbucks. \nHe also loves a good afternoon nap and will let you know when he's recharged and really wants to play!\n\n\nOne thing we know for sure he doesn't like: his crate. He managed to escape it while leaving the doors still locked. So he's truly a Houdini. \n\nGrizzle is the perfect combo of energy and chill. He would be amazing in any home setting! Whether it's a quieter area or a loud one, nothing phases him. He would also be fine being the only dog but of course would love having another dog friend around. \n\nEst. Date of Birth: 12/23/2019\n\nIf it looks like love at first sight, head over to our website and complete an application! https://www.aliverescue.org/adoption-application",

            "description": "Emmett was surrendered by a breeder to West Memphis Animal Shelter at 12 weeks of age. Emmett has a malformation of the spine, and his \"look\" didn't quite fit with this breeder's standards, so Emmett was passed off to the shelter. Fortunately, WMAS is a small shelter that treats their animals like family and seeks out the best for them. They contacted ALIVE Rescue, as they knew we've worked with special needs pups before. We took one look at Emmett and knew he needed to join the ALIVE Rescue family. \n\nEmmett was assessed at the University of Wisconsin, shortly after arriving with us. They felt Emmett's condition was congenital, and not related to trauma. They did not feel that an MRI would be appropriate at his age, and recommended if we were going to pursue that, to wait until he was done growing. They do not feel Emmett is in any pain. Emmett walks with ataxia and mild paresis of his hind limbs (left hind more then right hind), but guess what, NOTHING SLOWS EMMETT DOWN!\n\nWhat we now know about Emmett is that he is a fully functional puppy, who has no idea that he has any limitations. Because he doesn't think he has limitations, we really don't either! He can go on walks and is excellent on a leash. He can urinate and defecate without assistance (but needs help with his schedule and potty training; he also wears a belly band because he has excited dribbles). He can chase a tennis ball. He can do exercises for his physical therapy. He can entertain himself hours upon hours with a stuffy. He can make friends with any human ages 1-100. He can make friends with any dog or cat that he meets. Emmett CAN DO anything he wants!\n\nNow, what Emmett needs to do is find a foster or forever home to help him continue to shine. Emmett's ideal home will be a foster or a adopter that will do simple home exercises, daily, to continue to strengthen Emmett's hind limbs. Don't worry, we taught these to our volunteers and can teach them to you too! Emmett would enjoy joining a home with another pup, because he loves to play and have company (not a requirement but Emmett would count this as a bonus). \n\nEst. Birthdate: 01/03/2020\n\nIf Elvis were around today, he might look at Emmett and say, he \"Ain't Nothin' but a Hound Dog,\" but he would be so very wrong. Emmett is so much more then just a hound dog, and he might just be one of the happiest pups we know! If you \"Can't Stop Falling in Love\" with Emmett, apply today to FOSTER or ADOPT him at http://www.aliverescue.org/adoption-application .",

Some of his favorite activities is rolling around in the grass and giving his humans hugs! \n\nWhile he enjoys life with his foster family, he can\u2019t wait to find himself his own fur-ever home. He\u2019s a bit shy when he first meets new people, but has been warming up to the idea of new people more and more! \n\nNorman is doing well with his obedience training, building up his confidence, and enjoys playtime. \n\nHe is moderately active and would do well in a home that can give him a daily walk and play. He enjoys having a dog playmate but would also do well as the only pet. His ideal doggy playmate would be a female dog of any size or a male dog that is smaller than him. Norman is a bit overexcited around cats so would do best in a home without them. Young children are stressful for Norman so we will looking for a home for him without them. \n\nCheckout the video at the link below to see him socializing with other dogs. \nhttps://fb.watch/2d_huT2j05/\n\nNorman is being fostered in Elgin, Illinois. He is 68 lbs. He is up to date on vaccines, neutered, on preventatives, and microchipped. His adoption fee is $150. \n\nIf you think Norman is a good match for you and your family, please consider applying to adopt him. \n\nMore about our adoption process:\nhttps://www.manneredmuttsrescue.org/adopt\n\nApply at:\nhttps://forms.gle/Jeu9sNZ8dx9FTA2v8",

Im Mr. Snuggles because I like to lay my head in her lap and snuggle under blankets. Ive only been living with my foster mom for just barely two weeks ,but she has already showed me what love is but, sometimes my foster kids calls me Aladin.\n\nShe found me roaming around a church parking lot near the woods. I was so itchy, starved,and tired. I was covered in fleas and ticks. She says she could barely see my fur. She took me to the vet to find out my collar was embedded into my neck and it had to be cut off. Im also heartworm positive. I actually just recently went back to the vet because i have a skin infection, and a terrible cough/gag. The vet said that its my heartworms and im breathing heavy. So im going to need an xray, and im starting the first round of heartworm treatment. My foster mom says its ok because there are people who care about me and theyre going to help me get better.\n\nWhen I'm not spending my time at the vet or cuddling with my foster mom, I like to play with toys. I love toys! I also love getting my head rubbed and sitting for treats. I am really scared of the big black thing she calls the crate so i sleep on my bed next to her bed at night. I like to potty outside and do pretty well on a leash. Theres a lot of kids and kittens running around where im living and I just pay them no attention. Except the little girl, whos two, i like to bring her my toys to play. Shes never really interested though. I am so happy to see when my foster mom comes home I do the boxer wiggle and get very excited. I just can't help my self I've never felt this thing called love and it feels soo good! All I want is a chance at life to play and be loved!\n\nCould you be my fur-ever home? If not can you donate to help me get better?\n\nLove,\n\nMr. Snuggles\n\nAka Aladin\n\nYou can submit an application to adopt at\nwww.obbrescue.org\n.

I am the perfect adventure partner and road trip companion, but I'm also someone you can sit and talk with since I'm a really good listener. I like to run with race team, and cuddle with my favorite volunteers, and I've got mad leash skills! I love playing with balls-tennis balls, soccer balls, basketballs, really any kind of ball will do-and I'm great at fetch! Did I mention, I also like car rides?! The volunteers call me \"the whole package\" and I'm game for showing you they're right. Come on by the SPCA or call and ask to meet me.",

Jake is a sweetheart that really wants to get out of the shelter and into a forever home!!! Jake is a special guy who needs to be the only pet in an all adult home. Jake is an easy-going boy that LOVES to go on long walks. Jake would benefit from some obedience training to help him become the best dog he can be!!! He would be a great companion for someone looking for a dog that isn't destructive and takes care of his toys & bed. Jake also seems to be completely housebroken. If you feel that your home is missing something, see if Jake is what you're missing!!!Please read the animal bios completely before requesting additional information as we do our best to answer the most frequently ask questions in these bios. \n\nIn order to adopt one of our animals an application must be submitted and approved. You can find these applications by going to http://humanemorgan.org/index.php?page=adoption \n\nABOUT ADOPTING FROM THE HSMC: \nThe shelter address is 1170 Fairground Rd. Madison, GA 30650. For more information on any of our pets, please feel free to email us at INFO@HUMANEMORGAN.ORG give us a call at 706-343-9977. \nAll dogs are heartworm negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nAll cats are FeLv/FIV negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nWe are open 10am-5pm Monday-Saturday, we schedule our last adoption at 4pm everyday to allow our staff enough time to feed and walk dogs. \nWe are an animal shelter and therefore are not able to individually potty train our residents. Many adult dogs do arrive \"\"house broken\"\" however due to animal behavior any change in environment will make an emotional impact on the animals and therefore initiate unwanted behaviors during the acclamation period. Please keep this in mind. Puppies do not have the biological maturity to maintain absolute bladder or bowel control and will require a certain degree of potty training and house breaking. Please consider the time and commitment it takes to provide the necessary building blocks for these special babies, prior to submitting your application. \nIf you have any questions please email us at info@humanemorgan.org and provide name of the animal you are interested in, in the subject line. \nThank you, HSMC Staff \n\nADOPTION FEES Adoption Fees may change without notice. Always verify the fee when finalizing the adoption. \n~ Cats and Kittens ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $100 \n* 1-5 Years = $75 \n* Over 5 Years = $50 \n** Purebred cats and kittens may be subject to special pricing \n\n~ Mix Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $200 \n* 1 -3 Years = $175 \n* 4-8 Years = $150 \n* Over 8 Years = $100\n\n~ Purebred and Designer Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $375 \n* 1-3 Years = $350 \n* 4-8 Years = $275 \n* Over 8 Years = $150 \n\n~ Medical and Special Needs ~ \nWe have rescued dogs and cats which require additional medical care or that have special needs which are not life threatening. In these cases we may require a higher fee to help recoup the costs of their care while at our rescue.",

She wants to interact with and play with other dogs when not napping or sniffing around outside. She is very crate trained. She will go into her crate on her own for nap time, when it's time for bed, and even to enjoy a good chew treat. It's her version of a she-shed. She isn't much of a cuddler, but does enjoy pets. She is more likely to lay on a dog bed at your feet rather than jump up on the couch with you. She gets along with dogs and people, although she can be a little shy with people in the beginning.\n\nIf you are interested in this animal please start by filling out an adoption application at <a href=\"\"http://www.cfp-nc.org/adopt\"\">CFP-NC.org/adopt</a> and we will get in touch with you.",

            "description": "Miss Ellie is a retired hunting hound that was surrendered to us a few months ago VERY pregnant. Ellie had one beautiful, healthy pup who has since been adopted. Ellie is a sweet old lady hound that enjoys the simple things in life - like long walks, snoozes in the sun, and cuddling on the couch. Ellie would prefer to be the only animal in the home soaking up attention and would not be a good candidate for living with smaller animals (as she has hunted previously). She could potentially live with another dog her size if they were on the more submissive side. She does live with three other dogs her size, but likes to control the fun level. She will let them know when the fun is over. Ellie loves people and is looking for some to call her own. She is around 8 years old, spayed, up-to-date on vaccines and heartworm negative. She is available for adoption with an approved application.",

She is still learning her house training and crate training skills, but she is eager to learn. She is great at home when people are around, but is still learning that her humans will come home. Jenny can be a little timid with being petted on the head. She is a fun, sweet, young girl that will need training. She can be strong on the leash, especially when other fun pup pals are around. She also loves plenty of bones and toys to keep her occupied! Jenny loves lots and lots of walks - the more the merrier! She is a great snuggling companion! She is a very loving and a happy dog that will make a great family member for someone who loves spending time and training their dog. She would also prefer to be the solo animal in the house because she's much happier when she can have all the attention. Come meet sweet Jenny, she's waiting for her furever home!",

Shorty was attacked by 2 large dogs and is scared of big dogs now. They walk great on a leash. They are crate trained and will snuggle up with each other at night in their crate. They actually prefer to be in a crate at night. Their only issue is they MUST be separated when they are eating. Shorty will punk his mom for her food. So I feed him in the crate and let her eat outside of crate. Cookie is Pomeranian and Chihuahua mix and Shorty's dad was a Chihuahua as to why he looks more Chihuahua.

He would do best in a single story home as he has not tried to use the stairs and does best when he can be around people.  He came to us with only 8 teeth, so his kibble needs to be moistened with a little water, other than that he has no special dietary needs or health issues. Uli gets along with other small dogs.  He does not like people messing with his face, but once he warms up, he will let you scratch his chin. Uli is not a fan of the crate so no crating for him. \n\nPlease apply at tzuzoorescue.com if you are interested in adopting from Tzu Zoo Rescue.  More information available by contacting tzradopt@gmail.com.\n\n[NOTE: We are a rescue NOT a shelter, meaning WE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY THAT OPENS TO THE PUBLIC. Typically, an application and home visit (both of which are required for adoption) MUST be completed, BEFORE a potential adopter will be introduced to one of our pets, in order to first determine that our basic adoption requirements are met, prior to introductions being made. We also utilize personal reference and vet checks (to ensure that any pets already in the potential adoptive home are current on vaccines, heart worm prevention and sterilized) in our adoption process, all of which is intended to ensure that the best match, between pet and people, is made. The adoption fee is based on on the dog's age.",

I do good with most dogs but I do okay with myself too, as long as I have my toys. I also love finding my humans and sitting next to them to tell them I love them. I do have an enlarged heart but don\u2019t let that stop you from giving me a home! I can still roam in the backyard and have some sunbathing time ( just no long walks). I would like a family with no children as when I am grumpy sometimes, I may nip . I love treats and will taste test them for you anytime- however my foster mom is making me go on a diet because she calls me chunky, so green beans it is. I would love a family who can help me with my medications, I need multiple pills and eye drops a day due to my cough and heart!\n\nPlease apply at tzuzoorescue.com if you are interested in adopting from Tzu Zoo Rescue.  More information available by contacting tzradopt@gmail.com.\n\n[NOTE: We are a rescue NOT a shelter, meaning WE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY THAT OPENS TO THE PUBLIC. Typically, an application and home visit (both of which are required for adoption) MUST be completed, BEFORE a potential adopter will be introduced to one of our pets, in order to first determine that our basic adoption requirements are met, prior to introductions being made. We also utilize personal reference and vet checks (to ensure that any pets already in the potential adoptive home are current on vaccines, heart worm prevention and sterilized) in our adoption process, all of which is intended to ensure that the best match, between pet and people, is made. The adoption fee is based on on the dog's age.",

            "description": "Born June 10, 2020, Sanka is a female purebred German Shorthair Pointer. Here is a little bit about her: Sanka is a goofy and loving pup who can\u2019t seem to get enough snuggles. She was cleft but it does not impact her at all and her foster mom describes her as a happy and playful pup! She may have a slight vision impairment that makes meeting new people and dogs a little scary at first but she warms up in no time. Although she's a little hesitant with new dogs, once she knows them they are the best pals. She is almost completely house broken and has free access to the yard through a dog door. When she isn't playing, she can be found on the nearest lap for some snuggles. She loves to carry around toys and flip them in the air. Sanka's forever home will require a securely fenced yard and if there's children in the home, over 5 years old would be best. Applications can be accessed at www.mikeyschance.com\n\nAll large and/or active dogs will require a full fenced (6ft) secure yard. \nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter. Applications can take up to 3 weeks to process. Application submission DOES NOT guarantee approval for adoption.",

He is super playful and loves long walks around the neighborhood, super social with everyone he meets! He doesn't like to be pet or held too much, but once he gets comfortable with you he loves to hang out and will give the most adorable little kisses and nibbles.\nHe needs an experienced and patient adopter who can work with him on learning to trust people and help him with some bad habits like resource guarding and some barking. He has anxiety and is on medication. He can bite sometimes when stressed. He is also scared of loud noises and will bark when he hears unexplained and very loud noises, like vacuums, blenders, and people walking in and out of an apartment. He would do best in a larger apartment or a house where he is not able to hear every noise! He is 4 years old and 11 pounds.\n\nDo you have room in your heart and home for little Macho?

Applications can be accessed at www.mikeyschance.com\n\nAll large and/or active dogs will require a full fenced (6ft) secure yard. \nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter.

I am approximately two years old and I weigh 75 pounds.  My vet thinks I may be a Labrador Retriever Mix.  \n\nI am a friendly girl and currently in a foster home.  I absolutely adore my humans.  I am working on my leash training and doing quite well with that.  I am house and crate trained.  I am a smart, friendly, beautiful girl.  My foster mom says I have kind, soulful eyes. I get along well with other dogs.  I have never been cat tested so my people are going to say no to a home with furry felines.  I would make the perfect hiking dog and would love to go adventuring.  If you want to relax, you should know I love to cuddle and have big dreams of being a lap dog.  I am a big girl so my people are going to insist on a home with a yard.  No apartments for this girl! \n    \nI am spayed, microchipped and up to date on vaccines.  \n      \n",

Cas needs to be rehomed as she and the alpha female in the home are not getting along, although Cas is just fine with the other resident dogs.  Her best friend is a male lab/dane mix and they play for hours without incident, so a home with an energetic male dog would be best for Cas.\n\nCas is great with all people, although she is pretty energetic and would do best with older kids.  Cas loves to be outdoors, so a fenced in yard or a runner/hiker/active person and are must haves for this girl to be happy.  \n\nNo kittens or other small critters for Cas please, she has a strong prey drive and although she has never hurt a small animal, she is way too interested in them.  Dog savvy older cats have not been a problem for Cas, she just likes to chase the younger ones too much.\n\nCas' adoption fee is $350.  She is fully vetted and ready for her new home, please consider this sweet beauty!\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING, PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n- The first step towards adoption is to complete an adoption application, which can be found online at our website www.roadtriprescues.com, under the \u201cADOPT\u201d tab.\n\n- Do not use the Petfinder links or email to ask us about our adoptable dog listings - we do not always receive these messages and will not respond to them.\n\n- Please do not ask if a dog is still available - we do our best to update their status as quickly as possible.  If a dog is listed for adoption, it means we have not yet approved an adopter and are still accepting applications.\n\n- PLEASE NOTE THAT ONLY APPROVED ADOPTERS WILL BE PERMITTED TO MEET OUR RESCUES - WE ARE A FOSTER BASED RESCUE AND ALL OF OUR DOGS LIVE WITH US AS FAMILY. \n\nThanks for considering a rescue pup!",

I\u2019m a 5-7 year old chihuahua. I was a feral(wild) chi before being rescued by Canine Pawsabilities.\nI came to stay at Chimama\u2019s Bed and Breakfast in August where the beds are soft and breakfast is delicious.\nChimama says I\u2019ve come a long way but still have not completed my journey. I still have trust issues that will need work with. I need someone to be kind,loving, understanding and patient. I will come when called, give kisses, cuddle with you on the couch and be your loyal friend when we build a trusting bond.\nI\u2019m only in a crate for night time and when Chimama runs errands. I over heard her say she was going to try to take me to bed to see if I would be compatible bed mate. I potty outside but I have been known to sneak a pee or poop in the house. It happens sometimes. So I need a home with a fenced in yard to do my business. I am not leash trained. So I\u2019ll need lot of help with that. I will occasionally play with a toy but I\u2019d rather sit with you.\nSo if you have love, patience and time I have the licky kisses.Dog and cat friendly children over 12 \n\nAdoption fee of $250 includes:\n-yearly dhpp vaccine \n-bortadella vaccine \n-rabies vaccine \n-spayed\n-heartworm negative status\n-wormed several times and fecal tested negative\n-heartworm prevention up to date\n-flea and tick prevention up to date\n-microchipped\n-dental \n-health exam completed \n\nApplications accepted at the following link: \nhttps://form.jotform.com/201418465695159",

See the bottom of this bio for more FAQs regarding our adoption process before emailing.****\n\nName: Olive\n\nAge: 3 years\n\nCurrent Weight: 40 pounds\n\nRescued from:  Texas\n\nOlive was rescued from an area where there is an abundance of homeless dogs, and not a lot of shelter space for them to go while they wait for their forever homes. She will be arriving at SNARR's Adoption Center in Brewster, NY on December 30th  ready for adoption!\n\nHealth: up to date on required vaccines\n\nHi, my name is Olive. I didn\u2019t have a good life living on the streets of Houston until I was rescued. I had to have surgery so I\u2019m a tripod and have one eye. I am very friendly but some mean human shot me and that caused me to have permanent incontinence. But that doesn\u2019t stop me. I adore being outdoors. I really enjoy people watching when my humans let me out in the gated front yard. I love to play fetch, tough of war and hide and seek with my human foster sisters and I absolutely love toys. They say I have a great personality. I have to wear diapers and my foster mommy got me some cute ones in different bright colors. I love other dogs and humans of all sizes, and I am especially amazing with the smaller ones. I am crate trained, ride well in the car and I take treats gently. I am spayed, heartworm positive and going through slow kill heartworm treatment. I would prefer a home with little humans and at least another dog to play with me but I wouldn\u2019t mind being an only dog to get all the attention. If you are looking for a petite girl with lots of love to give, I am your match.\n\nAdoption fee: $300\n\nIMPORTANT: This dog has not yet been altered. For any dog or puppy that is not able to be spayed/neutered prior to adoption, SNARR requires a $125 deposit in addition to your adoption fee, as well as a signed Spay/Neuter Contract stating you will have this dog altered within 6 months of adoption. The $125 deposit will be returned once the contract has been fulfilled. \n\nTo apply to adopt Olive, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n**Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an approved application.**\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",
