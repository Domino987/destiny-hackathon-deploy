She never let her illness, or the surgery dull her shine - and continues right on - learning manners, loving other pups, and loving kids! She really likes going for rides in the car. If you enjoy a smart, fun, energetic young pup - here she is!!!!\n\nCFR has a APBT/Boxer mix that needs a foster/adopter; she is 2 years old, 30 pounds, likes activity. Needs a yard to run in :) She had an injury to a salivary duct probably from being on a chain for a very long time; it was surgically repaired though it took a long time to heal and required that she be kenneled for weeks while infection resolved and salivary glands began working normally; she has been given a clean bill of health. She is friendly to adults and kids and dogs, with proper introduction. and just wants LOVE!!! She would di best with another dog so she can play!\n\nHer vet bills were substantial but her adoption donation is still only $270.63 if you are interested in adopting.\n\nShe is very smart, loves to learn, 100% potty trained. She's bell trained for going outside. Knows basic commands - sit, come, and working on stay and walking away. Chooses love and pets and hugs over eating. Absolutely non-resource guarding, willing to share. She can be intrusively excited to meet other dogs so needs calm, controlled introductions. This behavior is not aggressive but rather like an animal who has had little experience with other animals. At the vet she roamed the back offices around a variety of species including other dogs, cats, horses, etc. and there was no aggression or reactivity.\n\nShe is a happy soul and appreciative of your time and attention. We think decompression time is important with this pretty little girl.\n\n \n\nApplications are at https://bit.ly/codys_adoption_application.",

He would do well with another dog or two, having been a member of a pack for most, if not all of his life. Being alone is still a little tough for him, and he's very happy to see his family members return from their errands, so someone to snuggle with would be ideal. \n\nInterested?\n\n \n\nApplications are at https://bit.ly/codys_adoption_application.",

She loves praise and treats, and we are having a ball watching her learn and grow. She just wrapped up a 4-year stay with a family and did great with her dog, cat and human siblings. While she's not a huge fan of stranger dogs - especially little ones, she is great on leash, she can be left home alone, and she is fully house trained to boot! All this gal needs to succeed is a secure fenced-in backyard and your love. Flora can binge-watch with the best of them and just wants a couch cushion of her own.

He has an issue with one eye, I will assess with a specialist shortly.  He is 175lbs or so and his current mom and dad simply cannot keep him any longer.  I have explored options with them over the past month, but they feel surrender is in his best interest. He really is super sweet.  Can get the zoomies and excited.  Still very much a puppy at heart.  Housebroken.  I am going to ask that we keep our comments kind please.  \nFamily mentioned possible allergy to grass, but only bothers him a few months out of the year.  He has been on Apoquel and Cytopoint at one point.  We will get him on the right track before going to his new home.  Ozone, fecal transplant, better diet.\nHe really needs proper training as well.  Love isn't enough.  He needs to have boundaries so he doesn't end up in this situation again.  \n\nMale Great Dane deaf and vision impaired in one eye.\n3 years old\nGoes home neutered, dewormed, microchipped, heartworm tested, tick borne disease screen, blood and chemistry, vaccinated. \nMaybe female Great Dane or other female companion \nNo small children.\nCats unknown, other species unknown\n\nFor more information, please contact us at Deethenetworker@gmail.com",

I know basic commands and some really cute tricks You can see that in the short video of me...I am typical of my breed though in that when I feel threatened or stubborn and you try to mess with me I will let you know that I am not in the mood for that.. I will get grumbly but that about as far as it goes. I am crate trained and house broken. I would be good with older kids that know how to leave me alone when I don't want to be bothered. I know what \"no\" means and I listen really well. I like walks and car rides and I am also good with just hanging out. \n\nIf you would like to meet Billie send an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back with you as quick as we can.\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting....neuter, all vaccinations, a heart worm test, deworming, flea prevention and a wellness exam.",

And adult home or a home with parents and teenagers would be a good fit.  She is 3-4 years old and around 100lbs.  Training will make Dory an even better companion. \n\nShe loves to tear up her toys.  Will bark at strangers when in the yard.  \n\nContact Deethenetwowker@gmail.com for further information.",

            "description": "Hi I'm Minnie! I'm about 5 [to 6] yr old beagle hound mix [weighing it at about 40 pounds]. I know I'm a cutie! I'm in foster care now and I have made so much progress since being with my foster mom. I have gotten off antidepressants and my anxiety level has lowered significantly. Every day I'm becoming more and more balanced dog. \nMy foster mom says that I'm excitable, loving, sweet, stubborn at times but who isn't ?. I'm am house trained and walk well on a lease and I'm crate trained. I know basic commands like sit, stay and come. I also am highly food motivated, which is great for training! \nI need a home with other dogs to show me the house rules. I love other dogs and want playmates. I can't be with cats or chickens since I have a high prey drive. \nSince I've been returned once by potential adopters we are making it mandatory that you work with my trainer for a couple free sessions at your home to get me adjusted to my new forever home. \nAs amazing as I am and would be a fantastic addition to your family, I need time, patience, structured living, and understanding that at I still get a little nervous but it's workable. Please consider adding me to your family.  If interested, please contact my rescuer Bev at trampsrescue @yahoo.com or 804-248-3042.",

            "description": "Hi everyone! Meet Janie! This sweet 1 yr old, small Black Lab mix is looking for her forever home! In her short life, Janie has experienced some trauma and hard times, but this little survivor has turned out to be a very sweet, playful young girl. Because of her background, she is sometimes afraid when meeting new people, but once she bonds with her person, she loves to cuddle and give kisses. Janie is a \"dog's dog\" and has loved and done well with the dogs in her foster homes. She has a lot of youthful energy and likes to play exuberantly (so she would do best in a home with another dog with similar energy). Although Janie would do best with another well-matched dog, she also plays well by herself. Janie is spayed, is Heartworm negative,current in vaccines,is around 35 lbs, and is housetrained. She is also crate trained, walks well on leash, and loves to play with toys. She is treat-motivated and knows \"sit.\" Janie will do best in a quiet home with no children and with a pet-parent who has patience and can spend time helping Janie become a more socialized, comfortable and confident dog. She is adorable and such a good girl - she just needs a home where she can feel safe and where her human will commit to her ongoing training and growth. If you are interested in adopting Janie, please complete an application at lastdaydogs.com",

Rocky is currently in WI.\n\nRocky's temporary foster mom has this to say about him: \nRocky loves to play with balls. He will bring them to you to be thrown and we throws them for himself. If the ball goes behind the couch he has no problem moving furniture to get them. He can be a bit of a clown. Rocky loves belly rubs and butt scratches. He is not much of a licker, but gets very excited when we come home and will lick our hands. Rocky does love spending time outside in our fenced yard exploring and running around.\n\nRocky is very smart. He does know sit, stay, drop and no. He does not go on the furniture and has never tried. He does take treats gently and shows no signs of food aggression. We did have one incident where he was resource guarding a bone (growled and snarled), so we distracted him and picked it up and have not allowed him to have any bones since. When we tell him to kennel he will go right in. He enjoys sleeping and resting in his kennel. He is house trained, and only tried to mark in our house once. He did let us bathe him and did very well.\n\nRocky is a good watch dog. He is very aware of his surroundings and will let out a howl bark when someone is on our property. When he sees the neighbors in their window from our backyard he does wag his tail, so we believe he does like people. \n\nRocky did see a cat outside and was very excited. He was barking, play bowing and wagging his tail. But the cat ran away so there was no interaction besides that. He does show interest in my dogs, but I will start to do slow interactions to see how they do like through a gate. \n\nRocky will make someone a great pet. You can tell he was well loved in his other home. He is such a fun boy.",

My name is Webby and I am a sweet, sassy senior lady who would love a comfy, cozy home to call my own. I would do best in a quiet home with calm humans who understand to go slow with me: I love head and belly rubs, but if you move too quickly I might grumble in surprise; once you start petting me, though, expect to spend some time giving me a massage as I will nudge your hand to encourage you to keep going! Because I can be hand-shy, I prefer older children who understand I like to give permission to be pet. I did fine when I previously met dogs, but no kitty cats for me, please. I'm a pretty mellow lady who enjoys to snooze and lounge in luxury. I'm potty and crate trained, and am ready to relax in my forever home so hurry up and fill out that application!\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS, NO EXCEPTIONS:\n*ADOPTION FEE: $125\n*Be at least 21 years of age\n*Live in a 50-mile radius of Itasca, within the Illinois border\n*Have the knowledge and agreement of all adults living in the household\n*Have approval from owner of residence (written in lease)\n*Have a valid ID with current address (please provide proof of address if ID address is not up-to-date)\n*Be approved as a suitable adoptive home by Fetching Tails Foundation\n*Be prepared to make a lifetime commitment\n\nIf interested please fill out an application on our website at www.fetchingtailsfoundation.org; please make sure you fill in every required field/question or your submission will not go through. Please note that we take time to learn as much as we can about each dog in our care and our bios are our current observations; we are unable to make any guarantees on the future health or temperament of your adopted dog. Most dogs in our care come with unknown pre-rescue history and as such breed and age estimates are an educated guess.",

If interested, please complete an application on our website at www.pawswapofgreaterlafayette.com/adopting. If their ad is still viewable, we are still accepting applications. These boys need a fence! Read more below to find out if these 2 could complete your family. \n\nMeet Razz and Tazz. These handsome boys turned 1 year old on Thanksgiving. They are Yellow Lab / Rottweiler mixes and weigh 66 pounds. They are littermates and have always been together. We would love to try and find them a home together. We would consider separating them, but would like to try the together route first.\n\nRazz and Tazz are very sweet, friendly pups. Razz is a bit more laid-back than his goofy brother. Razz is also a bit more confident. Tazz is fun and willing to drop everything and play! We met this duo recently when their owner has run into some devastating losses that includes family members and ultimately her housing. Their deadline was quickly approaching. We met them and instantly fell in love. Thanks to Pooch at Play, these boys are safe until we can place them in a home.\n\nRazz and Tazz are used to being crated when unsupervised and alone. They would very much enjoy a fenced yard. They have not had experience with cats and really haven't been around other dogs except each other. We are still getting to know their preferences, but they have very sweet personalities and have no aggressive tendencies about them. They did great with their initial vetting and easily handled by the vet staff.\n\nRazz and Tazz are now up to date on vaccines, microchipped, and heartworm negative. They are now on preventatives and awaiting their neuter appointment in early January. We would love to find them a foster or adoptive home in the meantime! Please send us a message if you are interested. Their adoption fee is $150 each. and includes all the vetting. If interested, please complete an application on our website at www.pawswapofgreaterlafayette.com/adopting. If interested in fostering, we provide supplies, you provide the love!",

If you read further and find that you meet those requirements, then please complete an application on our website at www.pawswapofgreaterlafayette.com/adopting. If his ad is still viewable, we are still accepting applications. \n\nMeet Riley. This drop dead gorgeous pup is around 3 years old and around 50 pounds. He was originally found as a stray. We did locate his owner, but they never came for him. Riley spent his life living in a home without a fenced yard, so during his potty time he was tied out. He ended up becoming an escape artist and was spotted in the area frequently running loose which is how he ended up at the kennel. \n\nRiley has very typical husky behavior and will need a securely fenced yard and an owner who is experienced with huskies. Riley took some time to warm up to the staff at the kennel and that was one issue his owner spoke about. Riley is sometimes not the best with strangers and especially doesn't like his collar grabbed. Riley has never bitten any one and we would like to keep it that way. There are some easy precautions that can be put in place in a new home to ensure he safely interacts with guests in the home. Riley is a great car rider and really adores the volunteers now. He took a trip recently and went on a walk around campus and was spoiled with a pup cup and loved every second of it. \n\nRiley lived with kids and is said to be good with other dogs. We would recommend 12+ for Riley and would be happy to set up a meet with any other potential dogs in the home. We are unsure how he does with cats. Riley is neutered, up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative, and microchipped.

            "description": "Hello my name is Butch. I am about 1.5 years old and I am quite the Lady's Man. I love to snuggle, hug and kiss. Right now I am living with my foster Mom, Dad & teenage brother. I really love my foster mom and I am slowly starting to warm up to my foster dad & brother. They are trying so hard to win my love and trust but I may never truly give it to them! Because of this, I would like to live in a home without any men so I don't have to share the attention!\n\nMy foster mama loves the fact that I am completely potty trained and haven't had one accident in the house. I do love my kennel and sleep all night there and enjoy being in there as it is my safe space. My favorite treat is cheese and I will drool just thinking about getting a piece. I take my treats very gently and wait patiently for my reward. I am very well mannered when it comes to food. I don't steal anything off the counter, table or garbage. I have been venturing out on some walks and I am enjoying Minnesota. My foster mom loves that I don't pull when I walk and stick close by her. I don't bark too much only when I am really scared. I am building confidence and learning so much while I am decompressing from the last month of changes. I really would like to have a strong leader who can be confident in me and teach me to be confident myself. \n\nWhich leads me to tell you a sad story. My owner whom I loved very much unexpectedly passed away last month. This has left me completely heart broken. You can see it in my eyes from time to time. The last month has had so many changes for me. I am working on figuring out a whole new world without my person. I am looking for a new family or person that will let me grieve my loss and heal my broken heart. I am a gentle boy with a giant loyal heart just waiting to find the perfect new family to call my own. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nAll our Warrior Dogs will have all age appropriate medical care and vaccines, a microchip, and spay/neuter before adoption unless age is a factor with a puppy younger than 6-12 months at the time of adoption. If that is the case, the spay/neuter will be covered in the adoption fee and the owner will be responsible to have the procedure completed at a Warrior Dog Rescue Veterinarian at the appropriate time.\n\nPlease note that the majority of our dogs in rescue are from shelters where they have been found as strays or abandoned. Their breed description is based on our very best educated guess based on physical characteristics and their dispositions. If they came to our rescue as an owner surrender, the breed description will be listed as provided by the previous owner.\n\nAdoption Fee - $450\n\nTo apply for this pup, please submit an Adoption Application at http://warriordogrescue.com/adopt/adoption-application/",

He could be part Deerhound, but his location of origin had only those two breeds on the property.  This is a busy, happy dog and will need exercise daily.  \n\nCharlie Myles is not good with strangers entering the yard or home without you being in attendance.  He is not a Rottweiler, but he is a smart, observant, protector of his home.  \n\nCharlie Myles has had a comprehensive physical.  Two tiny fatty cysts were aspirated and sent to cytology to confirm fat cells.  All records, including blood and chemistry, heartworm and tick borne disease screen, SDMA, vaccinations, neuter and deworm notes all provided .  He has also just had a much needed dental.  Our Charlie Myles is developing cataracts however.  They are not yet opaque but visible.  Please be familiar with the breed.\n\nWe are in love with our Charlie Myles.  And we think you will be too.  \n\nFor more information, please contact us at Deethenetworker@gmail.com.",

            "description": "Blaze is a gorgeous senior, about 8-9 years old, about 60 lbs, that has been in the shelter for a couple of years. He was being boarded by a rescue that dissolved and abandoned him! He is a strong boy, but walks very well on the leash. He is a bit picky with new people, but if he likes you, he likes you right away. If he loves you, he loves you completely and unconditionally. He will wait for you at the door, and will only have eyes for you. He is as loyal as they come. He\u2019s got a bit of a stubborn streak, so he requires an experienced dog owner that knows how to handle a strong personality. But really what he wants the most is a good butt scratch from his people. Seriously, he can be doing anything and if you scratch his butt it\u2019s almost like he is hypnotized! He loves being petted and giving his people kisses too. He really is a loving, playful, silly boy. You may have to come visit this big boy a few times for you both to be comfortable, but once he loves you he will look at you with those sad, soulful eyes and he will have your heart. He must go to an adult only home (18+), where he can be the only pet. A yard would be awesome as he LOVES to roll around in leaves. Even on walks\u2026 if he sees a nice pile of leaves, he is all over it\u2026 belly up and rolling! He is quite amusing. Please inquire about him today and give this loving senior a chance. After everything he\u2019s been through, he deserves a home for his golden years!!",

He can come across as intimidating and sadly no one has looked beyond that, invested some time in visiting him to win him over and given him a chance.  He is an absolute love with the people he knows and loves, and that understand his boundaries. He loves playing ball, will run around with zoomies when he sees his people, and will shower you with tons of sloppy kisses. We would love to find him a forever home, where he can live out his golden years. He needs a quiet, adult only home, where he can be the only pet. A yard for him to run in and play would be amazing. We know that\u2019s a tall order but you can change his life\u2026 and he will change yours with limitless love! You must be willing to visit him multiple times at the shelter.

            "description": "Meet Benny!\n\nHi, my name is Benny. I'm just a year old, 50 pounds, and I'm looking for an active and energetic family that can keep up with my playful personality. I have some issues with my vision and possibly my hearing, but it doesn't slow me a down a bit and I only run in to the occasional door or table corner when I get really excited. Depth perception is hard with only the one good eye after all! I'm super affectionate, my foster mom says I'm a cat-dog because I try to rub myself against her and press my side in to her legs like a cat. I play really well with the other dogs here and get along great with just everybody, although my age and energy means the other dogs sometimes give me reminders to calm down, but I listen when they do! I'm not so great at listening to the cats, but they're just so neat and interesting and all I want to do is sniff them and say hi, but apparently they don't like that so much so they usually run away from me. But my absolute favorite thing to do is spend time with my humans. As much as possible! I'm happy to nap in my crate while they're at work, but I get pretty sad if they're home and I don't get to be out with them. I'm working on understanding that sometime it's just relax time and that means resting in my crate and not crying to be let out, but GOSH that's hard because I just want to be out WITH them! When I do get sad I can be kinda loud... I might not actually be able to hear exactly how loud I'm being. I CAN hear. My foster mom can tell me to sit and go lay down and I can hear the words and do what she says, but she definitely thinks there's SOMETHING funny about my hearing because of how loud I can be sometimes, and she says my pitch is a little funny too. But I'm learning to be calm in my crate when they're home. I know how to go lay down when I'm told, and you don't even have to TELL me to go to my crate when it's dinner time, I'm already there! I'll sit and wait politely until it's ok to eat my food though because I know good manners are important. I'm still working on my leash manners. I can be a puller, but I'm working on it. There's just so many interesting things out there for me to go investigate, but I'm super smart and want to learn so it will just take some time and patience. Basically, I would love an active family that has the time and energy to work with me and knows how to meet the needs of an energetic and smart boy like me, I'm a hearder, with lots of exercise, both physical and mental. I sure hope I get to meet my new family soon! Is it you?\n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $275.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

I am a sweet and playful girl who enjoys romping around with other dogs, going for walkies (I have lovely leash manners especially when using a harness), and chewing all the toys I can get my pretty paws on. I would do best in a home without cats, though. I am potty trained and do not have any accidents when home alone for long hours. I'm smart and would love to see how much more I can learn by your side: I already know sit and am eager to earn treats so I think it might be fun if we take some training classes together. Hurry up and fill out that adoption application so we can get our happily ever after started!\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS, NO EXCEPTIONS:\n*ADOPTION FEE: $300\n*Be at least 21 years of age\n*Live in a 50-mile radius of Itasca, within the Illinois border\n*Have the knowledge and agreement of all adults living in the household\n*Have approval from owner of residence (written in lease)\n*Have a valid ID with current address (please provide proof of address if ID address is not up-to-date)\n*Be approved as a suitable adoptive home by Fetching Tails Foundation\n*Be prepared to make a lifetime commitment\n\nIf interested please fill out an application on our website at www.fetchingtailsfoundation.org; please make sure you fill in every required field/question or your submission will not go through. Please note that we take time to learn as much as we can about each dog in our care and our bios are our current observations; we are unable to make any guarantees on the future health or temperament of your adopted dog. Most dogs in our care come with unknown pre-rescue history and as such breed and age estimates are an educated guess.",

We have an adoption process that tries to ensure that our LLR animals have found their forever home. Adopting from LLR isn\u2019t the fastest process. We do not have a paid staff and rely on volunteers-for everything. From animal care, and veterinary appointments to checking emails, answering phone calls and scheduling all meet n greets! Please be patient with us, animals come first around here. We are not in a rush to place any of the animals in LLR. All of our animals live in foster homes comfortably which means that we can take our time to find the best possible home for each animal in our care. \n\nTo learn more about the Little Lotus adoption process, please go to:\nhttps://littlelotusrescueandsanctuary.org/adoption-process/\n\nFor an application to meet this pet, please go to:https://littlelotusrescueandsanctuary.org/adoption-application/\n\nBeing fostered in Sierra Vista, AZ.

My name is Drax, and my best furry friend Yondo (a Great Pyrenees mix) and I are looking for a forever family who will give us the fun-filled life we have always dreamed about. We are high-energy dudes who love to run around and play outside so we need a fenced yard at our new home. We are very affectionate, too, and love to give hugs; because of our size and energy we would do better in a home without young children that we might accidentally knock over in our excitement. We get along with other dogs, but no cats or small critters for us, please, since we have prey drives. We are crate trained and are working hard to perfect our potty training - we hope for some patience while we figure out our new schedule. Fetching Tails encourages all adopters to sign their new dogs up for training, and Yondo and I think this could be a fun first adventure for us to do with our new family. We're very smart and like to work and look forward to finding a family that is eager for a lifetime of fun!\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS, NO EXCEPTIONS:\n*ADOPTION FEE: $300\n*Be at least 21 years of age\n*Live in a 50-mile radius of Itasca, within the Illinois border\n*Have the knowledge and agreement of all adults living in the household\n*Have approval from owner of residence (written in lease)\n*Have a valid ID with current address (please provide proof of address if ID address is not up-to-date)\n*Be approved as a suitable adoptive home by Fetching Tails Foundation\n*Be prepared to make a lifetime commitment\n\nIf interested please fill out an application on our website at www.fetchingtailsfoundation.org; please make sure you fill in every required field/question or your submission will not go through.

My name is Trip, and I am ready for a lifetime of adventure with you! I am a playful, fun-loving fella who gets along great with other dogs of all sizes, cats, and would love an active family who will help me work out my energy in fun ways. As an Australian Cattle Dog mix, I have some tendencies to herd so I would do best in a home without young children. I would also love a fenced yard at my forever home where I can romp and run free in a safe space. I'm very smart and eager to learn even more: I'm crate trained and am working hard on perfecting potty training. My forever family should be committed to signing us up for some training classes so we can learn fun tricks and commands together. It will be the first of our many adventures, and I cannot wait to get started! So hurry up and fill out that adoption application - we have happy times ahead!\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS, NO EXCEPTIONS:\n*ADOPTION FEE: $300\n*Be at least 21 years of age\n*Live in a 50-mile radius of Itasca, within the Illinois border\n*Have the knowledge and agreement of all adults living in the household\n*Have approval from owner of residence (written in lease)\n*Have a valid ID with current address (please provide proof of address if ID address is not up-to-date)\n*Be approved as a suitable adoptive home by Fetching Tails Foundation\n*Be prepared to make a lifetime commitment\n\nIf interested please fill out an application on our website at www.fetchingtailsfoundation.org; please make sure you fill in every required field/question or your submission will not go through. Please note that we take time to learn as much as we can about each dog in our care and our bios are our current observations; we are unable to make any guarantees on the future health or temperament of your adopted dog. Most dogs in our care come with unknown pre-rescue history and as such breed and age estimates are an educated guess.",

            "description": "Bosley is a 1 year-old tri-color pit/lab who is looking to be somebody\u2019s best friend.  He is the friendliest and happiest dog in the world.  Bosley currently has a great home and used to go to work with his human mom every day, but unfortunately there are now new rules in place that prevent him from coming to work with her.  It is a difficult decision for her to make, but would prefer that Bosley be with someone that can provide him a more suitable lifestyle than being home alone all day, which is not fair to any dog, especially a puppy.   \n\nBosley is a wonderful dog, loves every single human he meets, loves kids and would like to find a new human that lives an active lifestyle that Bosley could join.  When it comes to humans, he has never met a human he doesn't like.\n\nBosley needs to be the only dog in the home, so he will not be placed in a home with other dogs.  While he is not reactive and doesn\u2019t lunge at other dogs on the leash, he has displayed signs of not always playing well with others and has shown signs of aggression with his older doggy sibling.  Therefore, he will do best as an only dog.  Although he loves cats, he plays rough as he is still young and most cats tend to not favor his style of playing.  \n\nHe is e-collar trained, loves swimming, going for jogs, knows how to sit, stay, come, down, etc ... Bosley is still a puppy, so he is high energy.  If you are looking for a slow, calm, minimal energy dog, Bosley is not the right match for you.  If you are looking for a dog that loves to go for jogs, will play fetch as long as you let him, will go on road trips, camping, etc, Bosley would be perfect, since he has done all of these things with his mom!  While he wouldn\u2019t make the best guard dog (he\u2019s kind of a wimp), he has made his home feel very safe by barking when necessary and doing his best to play the part. \n\n\nPlease help us get sweet Bosley into a safe, loving forever home!  If you're unable to help by adopting, sharing this post or donating is always appreciated.  Don't forget, Passion for Pitties is a 501(c)(3), so all donations are tax-deductible!\u2026every little bit helps!\n \nIf you would like to adopt loving Bosley, please fill out an application at www.passionforpitties.com under the \u201cAdorable Adoptables\u201d heading.\n",

Eugene has a very loving nature which makes up for the fact that he hasn't had a lot of training as yet - but he is very eager to learn through positive reinforcement with yummy treats! A real sweetheart, this lovely young boy will flourish with love and a bit of training.\nTo learn more about Eugene send us an email at adoptycas@gmail.com\nAll animals are up-to-date on vaccinations (including rabies if over 4 months old), microchipped, and spayed or neutered. All dogs have been been vaccinated with DHPP and Bordatella (kennel cough) and heartworm tested negative (if over 6 months).\n\nAll cats have been vaccinated with FVRCP and current on flea control.

IF THEY ARE POSTED, THEY ARE AVAILABLE \u2014 PLEASE MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO APPLY TO ADOPT AT THE END OF DOGS BIO]\n\nKITTY MUST GO TO A HOME WITH ANOTHER FRIENDLY DOG** \n\nWhy hewo der! My name is Kitty. I am a 2-year-old, spayed female, Lab/Corgi/Pittie Mix weighing around 25 lbs. I am here because The Cantu Foundation helped rescue me when my owner surrendered me in Mexico. I am house trained and I\u2019m working on my leash etiquette, I need a strong leader when I\u2019m walking! When it comes to crate training, I am not all the way trained on that, but I will hang out in there. I am fully vaccinated.\n\nI am very sweet! I love to cuddle and be in your lap, but also, I have a spunky side! I will play for hours if you give me another pup and I will hold my weight while playing, even with my foster\u2019s 70 lbs. doggo. I have a very loyal and calm demeanor and I bring happiness to any room and anyone that meets me (so my foster says). While I have these amazing qualities, I am is working on my anxiety when leaving the house. I often get nervous when going on walkies and when there are loud noises (just so scary!). This is just outside, I am totally fine indoors where I feel like I\u2019m the queen of the house. My favorite thing to do is to cuddle up into my hoomans arms and watch a movie. I will not leave your side! I am dog friendly, but I need to have a nice introduction with the other doggo. I\u2019ve seen kitties on the street and I am not a fan. I can\u2019t wait to find my furever home, will you be my hooman?\nMy perfect furever home would be one with love and affection as I just want to spoil you with all of mine! A home with a Furr sibling is a MUST , since I can sometimes be nervous a Furr siblings can bring me comfort. The only thing my foster could see me having anxiety over would possibly be a very loud exterior environment. My adoption fee is $400 and that includes spaying/neutering and vetting care. If you want to take me home, please fill out the form on the website here http://www.thecantufoundation.org/adopt.html",

He's confident, fun, sweet, energetic, and outgoing and social with people and dogs alike! Draco is about 4 years old. Due to Draco not knowing his own size, he would be better suited for families with older children. He would be the perfect pal for someone with an active lifestyle - preferably someone who enjoys running, playing and exploring new places on the weekend. Draco is eager to adventure with you!\nTo learn more about this handsome guy, send us an email at adoptycas@gmail.com\nAll animals are up-to-date on vaccinations (including rabies if over 4 months old), microchipped, and spayed or neutered. All dogs have been been vaccinated with DHPP and Bordatella (kennel cough) and heartworm tested negative (if over 6 months).\n\nAll cats have been vaccinated with FVRCP and current on flea control.

Applications, Email correspondence, Telephone Interviews and Reference Checks are still being conducted, but MEET & GREETS and ADOPTIONS are being postponed until Feb 25, 2021 or later in accordance with the province's enhanced enforcement.\u00a0\n\nSpecifics:\n~Available through Canine Haven Rescue at www.caninehavenrescue.com\n~2 year old Canaan/Malinois boy from Saudi Arabia\n~Healthy with medium-high energy, around 45 lbs, neutered, vaccinated and UTD with parasite prevention\n~House trained, crate trained and non-destructive\n~Walks well on leash with good recall\n~A little shy upon first meetings with new people and other dogs, but warms up quickly\n~Walks and runs with a sideways gait due to a previous injury in Saudi Arabia, but isn't negatively affected by it at present\n\nFavourite things:\n~Biskit enjoys playtime with humans and other dogs, as well as adventurous walks and tons of treats\n~Biskit loves to eat and thoroughly enjoys a dreamy nap after a yummy meal\n~Listening to classical music is one of Biskit's favourite hobbies\n~Biskit delights in receiving lots of praise (and often treats) for mastering new tasks\n~Since being handsome is important to Biskit, he's quite fond of being brushed and receiving compliments\n~Squirrel problem? Not anymore says Biskit! He'll alert you immediately to a squirrel or other critter coming to dine and dash from the bird feeder!\n\nDreamhome Wishlist:\n~ A home in a rural or suburban setting which isn't too noisy or busy.\n~ A home with a fully fenced yard.\n~ A family without young children (older teens okay).\n~ A family who's work schedule would ensure that Biskit isn't left unattended for more than 3-4 hours per day. A reputable dog walker could also be an option if work hours are long.\n~ A home with or without another balanced dog to play with and to keep him company while the humans are out.\n~ A family willing to ensure that Biskit would get at least 3 good walks per day and plenty of physical and mental stimulation.\n~ Someone with previous dog experience, dedicated to continuing Biskit's education and providing consistent rules and boundaries, utilizing force-free methods.\n~ Ideally, a family willing to feed either a Raw Diet or provide a kibble such as Acana, which has less fillers and uses natural preservatives, and add veggies to Biskit's diet (i.e. Doggytime Smoothie - recipe will be shared with adopter).\n~A family aware that Biskit has had an injury in the past which contributes to his odd gait, and that this injury could potentially cause arthritis or other concerns as the dog ages, which would need to be\naddressed with the help of a veterinarian.\n\nAdoption Application:\nTo apply for Biskit,visit www.caninehavenrescue.com",

My foster mom says I\u2019m needy and cry when my person goes out of my eye line, but hey, I just like to be held! I love to play with my sister, but I get a little rowdy. My favorite things to do are climb all over my person and up and down the three steps it takes to get on the couch. I\u2019m small in stature (though mighty in personality) so a house with young children is not for me. Spud is neutered, up to date on all vaccines, on heartworm preventative, and microchipped. Spud\u2019s adoption fee is $400.00. For our adoption application please go to our website at aaprescue.org.",

Maverick loves running and playing with his foster fur-brothers and sisters in their backyard so we think he would enjoy a home with another active dog or dogs that visit. Maverick is approximately 1 and is tall and a bit lanky. He already weighs 60lbs and could still grow or at least fill out. He is neutered, microchipped, crate trained, and is just an all-around happy boy. His coat is mostly black but has the cutest white paws (like socks) which make him look very regal when he runs. With some leash training, he will make a terrific hiking, walking, running buddy. He knows sit, shake and down hes a super smart boy who wants to please.

She was with another dog when she attacked the older dog and they were competing for treats and toys. She may need a home where she is the only dog but she may also do fine with a good introduction and with supervision around treats and toys. \n\nBailey is very loveable and loves to be by your side. She will make a loyal companion and would love to hike or run with you. \n\nShe is a chewer, so lots of toys and bones recommended. \n\nShe is social and likes to talk to you. She loves to sleep in bed with you and give kisses.\n\nBailey is a well-behaved girl! She is house trained, crate trained, and uses a doggy door\n\nBailey is currently being fostered in Johnstown, CO. She is current on all shots and medical treatment. \n\nPlease apply at www.denkaisanctuary.org if you are interested.",

He is housetrained and crate trained. He knows sit, stay, lay down and shake. He is food motivated and eager to learn. Midnight is good on a leash but gets excited when he sees other dogs. He was with another dog in his foster home and in our daycare prior to that. He is also good with kids that are older.

He is a very loving boy who loves to sit on a lap and rubbed, yet loves and needs a fenced yard for him to get all his energy out and RUN. His favorite thing is chasing and chewing on tennis balls. Would be best as an only dog or maybe one other. Not sure around cats or children. Perfect for an active couple or single who can keep up with his energy!!\n\nThe adoption fee is $250 which includes their age appropriate vaccinations(DA2PP and Bordetella), Dewormer, spay/neuter, microchip, heartworm test as well as the registration of their microchip information to you.\n\nThe first step to adopting is to fill out an application for adoption. Once approved we will arrange a time for you to meet the animal you are interested in. If it is a match the adoption can then be completed and you can take home your new furry family member. If it is not a match we will file your approved application and you can wait till you find the perfect match.",

She was brought to safety and welcomed into the ARF pack where she has received a lot of TLC and is now able to fully use her back legs and is as fast as can be! Due to her injury Shasta needs to be expressed to use the bathroom. The process is fairly quick and easy once you get the hang of it, usually taking less than a few minutes. Shasta is a typical youngster learning the ropes. She is active, playful, curious and is getting better about leash walking every day. She is an amazing snuggler and prefers to sleep under the covers with you. \n\nShasta is almost 2 years old and a fun-sized 25 pounds.\n\nIf you think you are the right fit for Shasta, please fill out an application today or contact us with any questions about her care. https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/4362/generic",

Addie is approximately 5 years old and 28 pounds. She is good with familiar dogs and older kids.\nEven though Addie had her hind limbs taken by an awful human and was dumped in the desert, she did not allow it to break her spirit. She has been through so much yet she doesn't look back and is so loving and gentle. Addie craves to be loved/petted and seeks out the nearest hand.\n\nAddie is happiest when she is making new human friends or sun bathing in the yard. She has an adorable howl for every occasion and will make you smile with her resilient way of doing things Addie style. She is truly an inspiration and magical!\n***Addie will need long term diaper changes (around every 5 hours or so) but with some tricks from her foster family it is manageable. She has vision loss in her left eye but it doesn't slow her down!\nIf you think you might be a match for this special girl or have questions about her care please fill out an application or send us an email at arfadopt@angelsofrawley.org.",

He is such a Dude.. however.... he is a night owl and decides to party every night at 9!\n\nRambo today...he's a fun guy that LOVES other dogs... any size or type of dog. He's cat friendly, and very very smart. Total lovebug! He will need a special adopter who is willing to continue working with him on learning to trust humans. Rambo will need a home with a fenced yard in order to live his best life.\n\nJust a puppy found at 10 weeks old living under an abandoned house. It took a few days to get this guy. Just a baby, not familiar with human touch but so sweet and innocent. His story begins now...his name is Rambo and he got checked out by our vets like all young pups should and now he is on to a safe, comfortable foster home to gain some confidence and get ready to find his forever home.\n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption. The standard minimum donation for puppies is $325 + 8.25% tax = $351.81, for dogs over 12 months the adoption fee is $225 + 8.25% tax = $243.66 and for our senior dogs 8 years and up is $100 + 8.25% tax = $108.25; this increase includes sales tax recently required by the State of Texas to collect. You can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallasdogrrr.org. \n\nFor more information, you can email adopt@dallasdogrrr.org. Upon receiving your application please allow us 2-3 business days to review and process.",

My foster mom says I am the family dream dog. I love playing with my foster siblings, five years old and one year old, as well as the other large dogs in the home. I am both potty trained and kennel trained, as well as walk nicely on a leash. I generally do okay with cats, but I like to be a bit bossy so \"dog-savvy\" is a bit of a need. I enjoy spending my day playing tug of war or cuddling on the couch. The ticket to my heart is plenty of scratches and kisses. A fenced yard would be ideal for me, as I can run without you having to worry about me listening to you. At night I sleep quietly in my kennel or will sleep in bed with you if you let me.\n\n.\n\nAdoption fee includes: Full veterinary exam, spay, prepaid microchip, dewormed, Rabies vaccine, DAPP vaccine, Bordetella vaccine, 4DX\n\n, dental, flea/tick and heartworm preventative while in rescue.

You see, I need you as much as you need me. I know I can't promise to fix all of your problems, but with me by your side you won't have to face them alone. I need lots of exercise and a strong handler. Chester is looking for a forever home WITHOUT CATS OR CHILDREN and thinks he has found one with you.

I originally came to the rescue just a day away from a bad fate - I'd ended up at a rural county shelter...no longer wanted by my previous owner...a bully breed, pregnant and an owner surrender - that is not a recipe for success in getting out of a shelter. But, thankfully this rescue heard about me and had a foster home available for getting a sweet girl like myself safe and sound. \n\nWhile in rescue I gave birth to 9 gorgeous puppies (they get it from me) and I was a good mommie. All of my puppies have been adopted and now its my turn to find my happily ever after. \n\nI'm a gorgeous girl but I enjoy being active and would like an owner who is regimented and enjoys being active too. Im still working on my leash walking and I get overly excited when I see another dog so I could use some positive reinforcement training and a confident handler owner to help teach me this. \n\nA fenced yard would be great - of course dogs need to burn off energy going on walks but while getting my training situated, a fenced yard would be great for me to run and play. Don't get me wrong as much as I love to be active what i really love more is to snuggle with my person. \n\nI'm a great medium sized pup to have by your side and will loyally love you forever. I like some dogs but there are some that I am unsure about so I would need to be properly introduced. With love, patience, and a consistent owner, I'm going to be a great addition to your family!\n\nIf you are interested in Anna please make a note in your adoption application\u2026.\n\nwww.wherethewildthingsarerescue.com\n\nAdoption Fee $300",

Although each facility tried their best to care for his needs, Sparty does have breed-specific maintenance that could have been better tended to. With small changes in grooming, nutrition, and a transition into a comfortable foster home, he has made huge improvements in his health and appearance. Spartacus would be best in an adult only home with no pets, since true to his breed, he tends to get a little jealous of others getting the love that he needs (after all, he's a big dude! so he SHOULD get more love than everyone else, right?). He is happiest getting fold scratches, smush rubs, and bear hugs from his humans and will let you know with a boof or two if he's waiting on you. He also requires pretty much the same grooming as bulldogs (fold cleaning, foot soaks, nose butter, etc) just on a larger scale.",

She goes bananas for her chewy time (with her own toys, not people stuff), peanut butter, and ice cubes.

But he\u2019ll need a very special home who can provide for his everyday needs and keep and eye on him:? ? ? Quaid will need to be handfed several small meals of special canned food throughout the day? ? ? So, needless to say, his family has to be able to be with him most of the day for feeding and to monitor any changes ? ? ? He\u2019ll need to be watched like a hawk. Quaid would LOVE to (and will) steal your sandwich and try to swallow it in one bite like a snake, but this is a really bad thing for a fragile boi ? ? ??Because of his genetic issues that went untreated up until now, he\u2019ll always be a special boy. His family needs to be able to commit financially to his lifelong vet visits, pricey diet, and potential emergencies ? ? ?? With that said, Quaid is equal parts spunk and snug and is worth the extra time and love. ? If you think your home might be right for our special little guy, please visit our site to fill out an adoption app. Please also make sure to let us know in your app if you\u2019re willing and able to take on his needs.\n",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Buddy and that is exactly what I want us to be, buddies. I want you to know a bit about my history. I had a family but when they could no longer care for me so they brought me to a shelter. I was rescued from that shelter but then instead of working on finding me a home, the rescue kept me in a small crate for over a year. There was no attention, no doggie friends or ways to get out and have fun, no exercise, it was terrible. Finally I was put in a foster home but now that I had freedom I wanted to go out and explore so I found a way over the fence. Well, that got me in a lot of trouble so I ended up back at the bad place with the small crate. Finally someone convinced them to send me BACK to the original shelter where all of this started so that at least I would have more room and might finally get a home with people who would love me and take good care of me.\n\nNext, a big group of people heard about my story and they got together and rescued me (for real this time) because they felt I was worth saving. I went to some really great people who have been working with me on being a well-behaved boy. Being confined in such a small place for so long, and isolated as well, would make anyone a little insecure. Either I was not taught basic obedience or I forgot so when I get excited. I can sometimes jump, but now that I am getting regular attention and exercise I am getting better every day. At this point I walk best on a leash when a head collar / halti is used but I have only been out of the shelter for a couple of weeks. I am also learning to be around other dogs again because I have not had friends in so long. Now I do well with other canines as long as things don't get overly excited (this also means no unaltered doggie companions) and squeaky high-pitched talk is too exciting too. The good people continue to work with me and they are teaching me to avoid or ignore. I play with other doggies sometimes (male and female) and seek out some on my own, I even have a girlfriend. Overall, I am somewhat selective with other dogs so definitely no unaltered males. I come with free trainer consultation.I really am a good boy and I look to my human for proper guidance and I take correction well and quickly. Right now (while in training) I am in a very active household with four teenagers with all kinds of crazy animals on the farm. I do wonderfully with kids but could accidentally knock a smaller child down. I am good with cats, have been around chickens and other animals while on leash but they were pretty boring. If you are interested in learning more about me, or to meet me, please email Virginia at; virginiaz3@gmail.com\n\nAge: 4 years\nWeight: 45 lbs\nVetting: neutered , up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative\nTemperament: Selective with dogs, ok with kids, ok with cats\nTraining: crate trained, house trained, knows commands\n\nEmail for questions: virginiaz3@gmail.com\n\nTo ensure we're meeting both pet and adopters' needs, we ask potential adopters to complete an Adoption Application ( www.bit.ly/DH-Adoption ) for caretakers to review.

Well, Tackleberry was a bit of an intense character in the movie- totally unlike our handsome Tackleberry! Here is what some PACC volunteers have said about Tackleberry: He's a real sweetheart! Friendly, great loose leash walker, easy to handle and takes treats gently! Oh Boy! What a happy dog! Tackleberry came out smiling with his tail wagging and ready for fun!!! What a sweet guy! Very friendly, easy to leash and walk, gently takes treats. Very nice boy! Tackleberry was playful, zoomy and bouncy when meeting other dogs in PACC playgroup. He enjoyed goofing around with the other dogs, loves to play in the pool, and was affectionate with the handlers. Don't miss out on Tackleberry! PUPDATE: Tackleberry was adopted for a brief period and we learned that he did well with kids in the household.",

Well, in addition to being adorable and fun, it also means that I've exhibited some behaviors in the shelter that require some extra training. Lucky for me, I have a whole crew of staff and volunteers dedicated to working with me to address them. Hooray! As the adopter of a dog having specific training needs, the Austin Animal Center will provide you with some extra resources just for choosing me to be a part of your family. How awesome is that?! This includes a training voucher and post-adoption support from our Behavior Team. The behavior team will be happy to answer any questions you have about your new family member and provide support when needed. I weigh approximately 60 lbs. Click here to view my paperwork.",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Snowflake is 3 years old at the time of intake in December 2020. Snowflake is good with people, other dogs and cats. Snowflake found herself homeless and in a kill shelter with a large tumor on her shoulder. If the shelter ran out of space, Snowflake would have been the first to go to make room. Fortunately, the shelter reached out to Rescue Dogs Rock NYC and asked if we would take Snowflake into our rescue, and of course we said YES! Snowflake will now receive all the medical care she requires, including surgery to remove the tumor. Snowflake is a stunning pup with one brown and one blue eye. She knows basic commands, comes when she is called and is housetrained. Snowflake takes treats like a perfect lady. If you have room in your heart and home for Snowflake, please apply online to adopt Snowflake (NC) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

Her back legs are a little wobbly but that doesn\u2019t slow her down at all. When she is in the house she wears a diaper. When we are outside or on a walk she doesn\u2019t wear one. She tries to potty on her own but she can\u2019t always control her body. She hardly ever messes in the house but during the night when she is asleep she usually has a bit of a mess in her crate. She is the sweetest dog. She loves to go for walks and has not meet a person or dog she didn\u2019t like. She likes to chase cats but never to hurt them. She needs a special home who doesn\u2019t mind that she needs to wear diapers or may leave a mess. She will be spayed the end of January before she goes to her new home.

He loves toys and is very treat motivated. He is good with other dogs and enjoys playing tug with his foster brother, though he can be very vocal while he plays. Kip has a lot of puppy energy in him and will need his forever family to commit to professional training, as he is mouthy and tends to jump for attention. Because of this, he would do best in a home without small children and with a fenced yard.\n\nOur adoption fee is $260 for dogs over 5 months of age and includes all vaccinations, spay/neuter, micro chip implantation and registration/transfer, heartworm test and much more. Puppies up to 5 months of age are $275 and this includes all sets of puppy vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip implantation and registration and more. To adopt, go to www.fosterpetoutreach.org to complete an application.\nPlease note: Foster Pet Outreach tries to limit our adoptions to an area within approximately 60 miles of Peoria, Illinois.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Bobbie\n\nis a sweet but cautious 5-pound senior chihuahua boy who was rescued from a hoarding situation with 4 other dogs. he has become quite healthy since arriving and now looks forward to being held though still shy. Bobbie will do well with a small breed savvy person who works from home or is retired and has the time to help him come out of his shell and feel safe. He does need other dog-friendly dogs as he has only ever been a part of a large pack, and he likes to have a pack to feel safe. if you do not already have a dog and are open to adopting two, we have other seniors he came with and a 4-year-old he is buddies with.\n\nBobbie is pee pad trained and will go outdoors if accompanied. he is not used to the cold and wet and must be bundled up before going out to potty.\n\nBobbie is being fed a Human grade-Canine diet for his health and longevity. we educate all adopters on canine-specific feeding and care.\n\nPLEASE do not write and ask if this dog is available. If she is listed, he is available. We are 1.25 people who are volunteers and we work 20 hour days and have dozens of applications to review on top of the hundred other things necessary to run a rescue and adoption operation. To fill out an application to adopt Please use this link, You will need a computer to complete as cell phones will drop the application\n\nhttp://rompinpawsrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms/\n\nThe site will ask you to create a password and will send you an email. For ease of use, just use the password they create for you and save that password. This will ensure you have access and can fill out the application.",

Filling out an application does not obligate you to adopt, but merely begins the process. SEPR DOES adopt out of state!\n\nAdoption fees: All SEPR adoptions are $300 for adults and $400 for puppies 1 year and under.  This includes: adoption fee (spay/neuter, utd vaccinations, micro-chipping), microchip registration, Gentle Leader, and two tie downs for use in your home. \n\nSEPR requires all adopted dogs attend a training class with their adoptive family within 90 days of their adoption. If an adoptive family completes this training class, they will be refunded $100 of their adoption fee with proof of licensed certificate. SEPR even offers an obedience class called Train-A-Bull to alumni over 1 year of age on a seasonal basis.  These classes are currently free!\n\n*All other pets in the residence must be spayed or neutered and all pets up to date on vaccinations.\n\n*SEPR requires all applicants must be 21 years of age.\n\n*SEPR dogs are adopted to be inside the home, \u201cpart of the family\u201d dogs only.\n\n*Families with children 5 years of age and under wanting to adopt puppies will be reviewed on a case by case basis. Raising a puppy properly takes a lot of time, and we understand that in families with small children, time can be a limited commodity.",

            "description": "Meet King! This handsome young Beagle mix was recently surrendered to Worthy Dog by his family. The family was moving and said they could not take him. We think not keeping King is their loss and will be some lucky family's gain. King is a confident, social, and snuggly pup who will make a great family dog. He's lived with kids and LOVES other dogs.\n\nKing is currently fostered in SC with a mom, a dad, a teenage boy, two dogs, and a cat. He LOVES both of the dogs and is always trying to get them to play with him. He's more energetic than they are, so we think a young, active dog playmate would be the best fit for him. NO cats, however! He is overly interested in the cat and wants to chase it. We could see King as an only dog, too, as long as his family makes sure he gets regular doggie play dates and has doggie friends. He really enjoys other dogs and wants to play and have fun.\n\nHis foster mom describes King as a moderate-to-active energy dog. He settles down if he gets enough exercise and can be chill inside the home. He definitely needs a fun, active family to entertain him. He's also a champion snuggler and will always choose to be curled up next to you on the couch and under a blanket, enjoying the added warmth if given the option. King is both house trained and crate trained, and he does well meeting new people. He has decent leash walking skills and listens well to verbal commands. He has learned to sit on command and will, most of the time, stay when asked.\n\nKing has been happy and welcoming to everyone he's met. He came from a home with kids, and his foster family has seen him around young kids as well. We think he'll be a great addition to most families - preference will be given to active families with another young dog playmate in the home.\n\nApply today!\n\nBREED ESTIMATE: Beagle Mix (low rider)\nGENDER: Male\nAPPROXIMATE WEIGHT: 27 lbs\nAPPROXIMATE AGE: ~ 2 years\nCOAT TYPE: short\nADOPTION FEE: $400\nOTHER INFO: utd on shots/neutered/microchipped\nLOCATION: Alexandria, VA\n\nFOR MORE INFO OR TO ADOPT: Please go to https://adopt.worthydog.org and complete the application.\n\nYou can also help save dogs like this one by becoming a foster, providing a rescue dog with a temporary home and giving them the love and care they need until they are permanently adopted. Every person who fosters is directly responsible for saving the life of a dog, because we can only save as many dogs as we have foster families available to welcome them into their homes. If you think you might be interested in becoming a foster and want to learn more, please go to https://foster.worthydog.org and fill out an application.\n\nWorthy Dog Rescue is an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue that primarily adopts to families in the DC Metro area.",

This tiny, senior cattle dog's main job is to enthusiastically find you and be petted and give kisses. While people are at the top of her list when it comes to things to love, she also loves going outside, car rides, walks, food, and life in general. She can be a bundle of energy but will settle down when told. Although she is blind, she can use her nose and paws to get around. When she is determined to find something, she keeps going until she does so. Nox is heartworm positive and has begun treatment. If you are looking for a dog to love, this is the girl for you. As a senior, Nox's standard adoption donation is $250, but $150 for an adopter 65+ through our Seniors for Seniors program.",

Filling out an application does not obligate you to adopt, but merely begins the process. SEPR DOES adopt out of state!\n\nAdoption fees: All SEPR adoptions are $300 for adults and $400 for puppies 1 year and under.  This includes: adoption fee (spay/neuter, utd vaccinations, micro-chipping), microchip registration, Gentle Leader, and two tie downs for use in your home. \n\nSEPR requires all adopted dogs attend a training class with their adoptive family within 90 days of their adoption. If an adoptive family completes this training class, they will be refunded $100 of their adoption fee with proof of licensed certificate. SEPR even offers an obedience class called Train-A-Bull to alumni over 1 year of age on a seasonal basis.  These classes are currently free!\n\n*All other pets in the residence must be spayed or neutered and all pets up to date on vaccinations.\n\n*SEPR requires all applicants must be 21 years of age.\n\n*SEPR dogs are adopted to be inside the home, \u201cpart of the family\u201d dogs only.\n\n*Families with children 5 years of age and under wanting to adopt puppies will be reviewed on a case by case basis. Raising a puppy properly takes a lot of time, and we understand that in families with small children, time can be a limited commodity.",

I was able to finally break out and although my family has dogs I am able to safely be separated so I can enjoy my life outside of the shelter. I would love a non dog/cat home where I can be the only pet. I love kids and everything people wise. I am a big girl and lost a few pounds already. I like walks when it\u2019s not cold out. I love to chew my bones and cuddle too. I would really hope I don\u2019t have to wait much longer for a home as I really deserve my own.

Filling out an application does not obligate you to adopt, but merely begins the process. SEPR DOES adopt out of state!\n\nAdoption fees: All SEPR adoptions are $300 for adults and $400 for puppies 1 year and under.  This includes: adoption fee (spay/neuter, utd vaccinations, micro-chipping), microchip registration, Gentle Leader, and two tie downs for use in your home. \n\nSEPR requires all adopted dogs attend a training class with their adoptive family within 90 days of their adoption. If an adoptive family completes this training class, they will be refunded $100 of their adoption fee with proof of licensed certificate. SEPR even offers an obedience class called Train-A-Bull to alumni over 1 year of age on a seasonal basis.  These classes are currently free!\n\n*All other pets in the residence must be spayed or neutered and all pets up to date on vaccinations.\n\n*SEPR requires all applicants must be 21 years of age.\n\n*SEPR dogs are adopted to be inside the home, \u201cpart of the family\u201d dogs only.\n\n*Families with children 5 years of age and under wanting to adopt puppies will be reviewed on a case by case basis. Raising a puppy properly takes a lot of time, and we understand that in families with small children, time can be a limited commodity.",

He will also do best in a home without small children.  \n\nMcKnight is neutered and up to date on vaccines. He weighs about 45 lbs and is very curious about other dogs. After appropriate introductions he wants to be friends!

I still tinkle when scared and some accidents but other than that I\u2019m a good girl. I love other dogs and open up more when I\u2019m around them. Ideally would love to have a dog friend in my new home. I don\u2019t share my food with other doggies though. If you have any questions other than what is said above please email angela@forgetmenotrescue.com",

Filling out an application does not obligate you to adopt, but merely begins the process. SEPR DOES adopt out of state!\n\nAdoption fees: All SEPR adoptions are $300 for adults and $400 for puppies 1 year and under.  This includes: adoption fee (spay/neuter, utd vaccinations, micro-chipping), microchip registration, Gentle Leader, and two tie downs for use in your home. \n\nSEPR requires all adopted dogs attend a training class with their adoptive family within 90 days of their adoption. If an adoptive family completes this training class, they will be refunded $100 of their adoption fee with proof of licensed certificate. SEPR even offers an obedience class called Train-A-Bull to alumni over 1 year of age on a seasonal basis.  These classes are currently free!\n\n*All other pets in the residence must be spayed or neutered and all pets up to date on vaccinations.\n\n*SEPR requires all applicants must be 21 years of age.\n\n*SEPR dogs are adopted to be inside the home, \u201cpart of the family\u201d dogs only.\n\n*Families with children 5 years of age and under wanting to adopt puppies will be reviewed on a case by case basis. Raising a puppy properly takes a lot of time, and we understand that in families with small children, time can be a limited commodity.",

            "description": "My name is Jax. My family was unable to keep me and asked JR's to find me a good home. When I first arrived, I was sweet with everyone, but then I realized my family left and I become very scared and nervous. I didn't want anyone to touch me. I was sad and depressed and a bit scary. One day a foster came to the facility and said \"I am taking him home tonight and we're going to figure it out\". We had a great car ride home! I sat nicely in the back seat. When we got home, I met \"the pak\". She had a Doberman (foster) and a bunch of Rottweilers and 2 little old scruffy dogs. They were all quite welcoming and we playing in the yard. Then I met the kitties. They are interesting and fun to chase...but that's about it. I would do best in an adult-only home, and because my temperament is very true-to-breed, my family will have had ChowChow experience before. \n\nI am completely house trained and trustworthy in the house. I do not chew things up. I do not jump on furniture or counter surf (there's a sassy Rottweiler here that does that!). I love my people and I love to be pet. I've been here for over 2 weeks now and I know I can be a good boy in a home. I was just groomed and feel SOOO good!\n\nI am hoping my furever family finds me soon. This place is great, but I know I have a furever to find of my own! \n\n\nAdoption fee: $350\n \nAdoption fees for all dogs/puppies include a $50 refundable training deposit. Complete your basic training program and provide a copy of the certificate within 4 months (120 days) of adoption and we will refund $50 of the original adoption fee.\n \nAll dogs/puppies have been fully vetted including spay/neuter, micro-chipping, worming, heartworm testing and preventative treatment, flea/tick preventative, and all required age appropriate vaccinations. As required by Wisconsin Act 90, all dogs will have received a veterinarian exam (CVI) within the past 30 days.\n \nOur adoption process requires the submission of an application. Applications and Adoption Rules can be found on our website, on the \"HOW TO ADOPT\" tab at JRsPupsNStuff.org. Upon receipt of the completed application, we will process the application including: contact with your veterinarian and completion of a home visit. Please be sure to include the contact information for your vet as we will call. If your vet requires an information release, please be sure to contact them as soon as you submit your application. We are a group of volunteers with families and jobs, so please be patient and allow a few days for our response.\n \nJR's Pups-N-Stuff Dog Sellers License 270089-DS",

            "description": "Maisy       2-year-old female black Lab      50-lb     Not yet spayed\n \nBackground:  Maisy is a purebred AKC-registered Lab, originally from Montana.   Trained as a field trial dog, she is full of spirit and energetic.  She cannot sit still.  Her \u201cplay\u201d switch is ON all the time.  \n \nMaisy retrieving the dummies -- https://youtu.be/iQaPyQiD_4E \nMaisy and the squeaky chicken -- https://youtu.be/2q6SBB1vs3Y \nMaisy and Rookie loving the rope-tug -- https://youtu.be/8IzozncPNcc \n \nWhat Maisy\u2019s owner says:  \nWe purchased her when she was six-months-old and planned to cross breed her with one of our own Labs.  We produce one litter of Lab pups every few years.  But Maisy\u2019s anxieties have caused us to rethink breeding her.  She shows some OCD-like behavior when in her outside kennel and garage crate\u2026 by spinning in circles.  She does not sit still long enough to allow you to touch her \u2013 always in motion.  In addition, she has demonstrated some snarkiness (growling) at our other female Labs.  \n\nMaisy is fine with our male Labs and spends hours running around with them and playing rope pull.  While we have not used Maisy for hunting, she is able to retrieve bumpers/dummies per field trial standards.  Maisy has never been around children or cats, but she has spent time with horses.  We had her try out as a police detection canine but she was too anxious around motorcycles and that was a non-starter.  Given her over-the-top high-energy we have not allowed her to roam freely inside our home \u2013 so she is likely not house-trained.  \n \nWhat Maisy\u2019s Rescue Rep says:  \nMaisy will do best in a home with lots of room to run and exercise.  Definitely not a city dog.  May not even be a suburbia dog.  Maisy\u2019s ideal adopter is an outdoors-person who loves to hunt and fish, who snowshoes in the winter, who hikes in the mountains in the summer, and who needs a devoted four-legged side-kick.  Ranch life would be wonderful for Maisy.  Not for the timid at heart; not for the couch-potato doggie-snuggler; not for those inexperienced with energized American field labs.  \n \nMedical:  Maisy is in great shape.  She received an excellent grade for her OFA hip radiograph.  Maisy is current on distemper vax and microchipped, but due for a Rabies vax and needs to be spayed.  \n \nMaisy is located in:  Sebastopol.\n \nIf you are interested in Maisy, please contact Rescue Rep Dave at 415-686-4248 or david.c.ely@sbcglobal.net",

Now that I've \"retired\" from that life, I'd love to have a warm and cuddly home of my own! Things I love: treats - especially human foods - sniffing all the sniffs on walks, and exploring new spaces. And lots and LOTS of pets, kisses, and cuddles from my humans. If you stop petting me, even for even a second, I may climb on your lap for more attention. I like to follow my people around the house like a little shadow, but I also love a good nap in a comfy spot on the couch. Things I DO NOT like:  the other pups in my foster home. You see, I'd really like to have the human attention all to myself. I also dislike toys that squeak. Foster mom says that I'm a very smart girl and already know how to come when called, but my forever family will need to continue to work on formal commands like sit/stay/off and how to use stairs (I'm a bit of a klutz going up and down stairs - I mean, who would blame me - I never knew what they were until a few weeks ago!). I am currently being fostered in Milwaukee, WI. If you live in the midwest and think you might have the perfect lap for me to sit on, visit www.savingshibas.com/adopt to download an application to become an approved SIRA adopter.",

Filling out an application does not obligate you to adopt, but merely begins the process. SEPR DOES adopt out of state!\n\nAdoption fees: All SEPR adoptions are $300 for adults and $400 for puppies 1 year and under.  This includes: adoption fee (spay/neuter, utd vaccinations, micro-chipping), microchip registration, Gentle Leader, and two tie downs for use in your home. \n\nSEPR requires all adopted dogs attend a training class with their adoptive family within 90 days of their adoption. If an adoptive family completes this training class, they will be refunded $100 of their adoption fee with proof of licensed certificate. SEPR even offers an obedience class called Train-A-Bull to alumni over 1 year of age on a seasonal basis.  These classes are currently free!\n\n*All other pets in the residence must be spayed or neutered and all pets up to date on vaccinations.\n\n*SEPR requires all applicants must be 21 years of age.\n\n*SEPR dogs are adopted to be inside the home, \u201cpart of the family\u201d dogs only.\n\n*Families with children 5 years of age and under wanting to adopt puppies will be reviewed on a case by case basis. Raising a puppy properly takes a lot of time, and we understand that in families with small children, time can be a limited commodity.",

            "description": "Christmas #7432 AKA Chrissy is an adorable 6-year-old female Hound/Shepherd mix. Chrissy loves to know what you are up to and wants to help! She absolutely loves playtime. Her favorite toys are stuffed animals, tennis balls and squeaky toys. Chrissy loves to snuggle as well, but given the choice, she loves to be outdoors. She is very eager to learn and is treat-motivated. Chrissy should be fed separately from other animals in the home. She is crate trained, although it takes a bit of coaxing to get her inside. She is house trained. Chrissy can get up to mischief if left to her own devices, so be sure to crate her when you are not home! This beautiful momma came to us with 11 adorable pups in tow. While she is a great mom, Christmas is ready for some much-needed R&R and a home of her own. She weighs 50 pounds and is full grown. This pup is microchipped. We believe you can always teach an \u2018old\u2019 dog new tricks, so we highly recommend continued obedience training for this smart pup; it stimulates the dog's mind and establishes a good dog/adopter relationship. This pup, like all pups, should be on heartworm preventative; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If you are interested in adopting this dog, and are already approved to adopt through our organization, please contact dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with the pup\u2019s name and ID number in the subject line. OTHERWISE, please submit an adoption application online: http://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.org/adoptus.html E-mail dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with questions.

Applicants must live within a 2 hour radius from Sparta/Andover (07871/07821).\n\nPlease understand that we are an animal shelter and thus unable to say whether the dogs are housebroken as they are not in homes.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, we encourage you to please submit an application on our website today so that we can try and process and pre-approve any potential adopters prior to our next adoption event.\n\nPLEASE USE THIS LINK TO SUBMIT AN ADOPTION APPLICATION.

Please email 1-2 days before the event, as some animals are placed during the week and our list is constantly changing.\nFor a list of upcoming pet adoption events go to: www.OscarAnimalRescue.org\n\nOne Step Closer Animal Rescue is a 501c3 non-profit organization.

Rip is a Aussie/Heeler mix born in 2017. He is required to go into a home where his primary caregiver will be a male. Due to being deaf, Rip has to learn everything a bit differently but is one of the smartest pups you'll ever meet. Rip is going to need a dog savvy owner willing to implement leadership and understanding to help him build confidence in the home. He would do well with children and other animals after a slow introduction as well.\nIf you are interested in adopting, please call us at 309-787-6830 ex 10 to speak to an adoption counselor.",

I have a thick, soft coat and have one brown eye and one blue eye.\n\nI have a confident and somewhat aloof demeanor. I like to take my time to get to know new friends. Once we\u2019ve spent some time together I will happily approach for pets\n\nI have nice easy energy and will make a terrific addition to a moderately active home; I like to get out and about and I do great on leash. I ride nicely in the car too. Walks, beach time and camping trips are some of my favorite activities.\n\nI like other \u201cregular-sized\u201d dogs but have an energetic play style that may be too much for dogs that don\u2019t like to play or for older dogs. True to my breeds, I have a tendency to nip at the feet of other dogs. Some dogs may not appreciate that. I also like to chase and catch things so no small critters or cats for me please.  \n\nI will be fine with respectful older children but prefer not to live with small kids as they make me nervous.\n\nI will need a patient family who will allow me to settle in at my own pace. I also don\u2019t appreciate being smothered, poked or prodded by people I don\u2019t know; that\u2019s just not my thing.\n\nI have had quite a bit of training and will make a wonderful companion for someone who likes fun activities.\n\nThis is a courtesy post. I\u2019ll be waiting with my family in Santa Rosa.\n\nhttps://www.bayareagsr.org/available-dogs/1440-sarah-cp\n\n\nIF YOU ARE interested in SARAH, Please go to the webpage above and contact us directly using the forms there.\n\n\nFind us on Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/Bay-Area-German-Shepherd-Rescue-184324951742737/\n\nFollow us on Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/bayarea.gsr/\n\nBay Area German Shepherd Rescue normally has 20 dogs all over the Bay Area.

            "description": "Nina is a senior dog looking for a forever home. She is human friendly and said to be dog friendly by the sending shelter. Potty training and crate training unknown.\n\nUPDATE: Nina is a super sweet, American pit bull mix who is 8 years old. Nina came to TAPS in mid-December from PAWS and is quiet, friendly and 61 pounds of pure sweetness! Although Nina arrived at PAWS as a stray, it is apparent that Nina is familiar with car rides and a home. In my car, Nina simply rode quietly and if she was not sleeping, she was quietly looking out the window. In my home, she was surprisingly active for her age and did not want to nap because she wanted to soak in all the attention she could possibly get in her short outing away from the shelter. Nina was not interested in ropes or bones (but she recently had dental work), yet she had fun destroying a stuffed dog toy. She also does not like hardwood floors and at times, appeared to walk gingerly which leads me to believe that she may be showing signs of the onset of arthritis. Nina preferred to stay on the carpet areas of my home and, although I coaxed her onto my couch, it was apparent that being on furniture is not something she is comfortable doing. Overall, Nina is an incredibly happy, loving dog who simply wants to lay on your carpeted floor, be petted and is extremely treat motivated. Unfortunately, Nina has no background information, so her potty training and crate training is an unknown, but outside of one accident in my house, she does seem familiar with going outside to potty. PAWS also reports that she is dog friendly so if you are looking for a loving, calm, sweet middle-aged dog, then Nina will be perfect!",

She always wants to be close to you and loves attention - the more pets and belly rubs the better! She likes her crate and is very food motivated. Although always in the mood for a smaller treat, the occasional bone is her absolute favorite, and she will happily chew on it for most of the day.\nZeel is still getting used to car rides but loves being outdoors and exploring. When inside, she can be a real couch potato and fall asleep pretty much anywhere! \nShe is trusting and loving, and needs a home that can give her lots of love back!",

I love food so much, I'm not one to share it. I do also enjoys human love and affection. I'm the type of dog that needs a job to stay busy. An experienced owner that will work on my mental stimulation as well as giving me an ample amount of exercise is my dream situation. Since I am food motivated, I would absolutely look forward to training classes. Getting me in that working brain and having me work for treats. Since I love food, I would need a home with no exposure to children. I don't seem to like other dogs, so I would need to be your only pet. We will keep each other busy though, so you won't even feel like you're missing out!",

            "description": "(Nashville, TN) Supra is ready for his \"Foster to Adopt\" home. Supra is 5 years old and was diagnosed with Discospondylitis in October that caused him to be paralyzed in his back end. This was caused by pure neglect. After medication and therapy he is now able to walk, even run. However, he still requires medication every 8 hours due to the intensity of the infection in his back. Supra is also on a slow kill HW method as he can't have the immiticide injections. He has his follow up with UTK on Feb 19th and should be released in regards to his Discospondylitis! He is doing AMAZING! He is also neutered and vaccinations and preventatives are UTD. \n\nAll food and medical, including supplements and preventatives, will be paid by the rescue until he is 100% at which point adoption will take place. We would like him to settle down with his forever family as soon as possible as the longer they are with their foster, the harder the transition. We just simply will not finalize adoption until he is 100% with his Discospondylitis and HW Negative. \n\nSupra is the the most LOVING boy you will ever meet! His tail wags with so much appreciation at times I think he is going to take off like a helicopter. Supra has been inro'ed to dogs on leashes ONLY and done very well. Both dogs he met were low energy, very balanced with excellent social skills. Supra wouldn't do well with a high energy dog. He will need to go to a home with a small or medium dog with fair energy due to the sensitivity of his back (or no dogs; NOT because of behavior but due to his back). Supra LOVES car rides, walks, toys and especially chin scratches. This boy LOVES life regardless of what he has gone through. I've never had a happier foster in my home despite what he has suffered. \n\nHe will need a home with mostly carpet to avoid the slip and sliding. I've had to place rugs on the wood and tile floor to help him. I know this is a lot to take on for an adoptive animal but the love you will get in return is multiplied by infinity. He just wants a human to love and be with; he needs to be with his human. And these medical issues will not be forever! Please give him a chance to love you! \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Supra, please visit our website for the FAQs and application. If you do not meet requirements your application will not be processed. Website link below:\n\nhttps://www.battleforthebully.org/",

            "description": "Hi I'm Kimber. I was found left alone with my brother and sister in a house. I'm a somewhat shy and cautious girl, but can you blame me? I am looking for a home with people who will be kind and patient with me while I come out of my shell and get used to my surroundings. I also get along well with other dogs, so having a furry sibling would be amazing. Once I'm comfortable in my home, I'm sure to blossom and be a perfect companion.\n\nFrom my foster family: I love squeaky toys, treats, tummy rubs, and long walks. I may be a bit shy at first, but once you have my trust, I will be a loyal companion. I have learned to sit, lie down, and how to go into my crate, where I now sleep all night. I love to sniff but am not a chewer, jumper or destructive. I have lived with other dogs previously and now get very excited seeing dogs on walks. My foster family is working with me on this. Ideally, I would love someone to exercise with, but a couple walks a day and playtime will suffice. Despite my size, I am quite gentle and a good walker (unless I see a dog friend). I am attentive, affectionate, and playful, but also love just to relax in a comfy spot. I promise I will do my best to make you happy and always greet you with a wagging tail and huge grin. Will you help me find my forever home?",

Nutcracker is one heck of a name, so we'll just call him Nutty for now Nutty is the braver of the two boys, as his friend is actually spending some time in PACC's decompression program for shy and fearful dogs. Nutty is a friendly and affectionate dog who is a little bit nervous in the shelter environment and would much prefer a cozy home. In addition to sharing his kennel with Walnut, Nutty did well when meeting other PACC dogs in playgroup. He was mostly interested in staying near the handlers in the yard, but was tolerant and friendly with the other pups. He would like to meet any resident pets before heading home, and is looking for a home without small dogs. Ask about this sweet Nutty buddy today!",

They're sweet, playful, cuddly puppies and will need training to become the kind of dog you want them to be.  They're working on house manners in their foster homes, but please keep in mind how young they are and understand it will be up to their adoptive homes to fully teach them potty training, etc.  We never saw their parents so their breeds are just a guess based on looks.\n\nIf interested in adopting one of them please apply on our website: shelterfriends.org  (we do not allow puppies from the same litter to be adopted together due to littermate syndrome)  Their adoption fee is $175 and includes spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccines, deworming and microchip.\n\n**WE DELETE ALL INQUIRIES AND EMAILS AS WE ARE RAN BY VOLUNTEERS.  IF INTERESTED PLEASE FILL OUT THE APPLICATION ON OUR WEBSITE AND WE'LL BE IN TOUCH VIA PHONE OR EMAIL.  THANKS!**",

Turns out that was not the truth according to several rescues in the area that she had tried to surrender her to. Seems that Nala wasnt getting along with their other dog (which often is the OTHER dog), so no other rescue would take her. Many times, the issue is not with the dogs, but owner error and we have proven that over and over again when our trainers bring them in and work them into our pack. Many times, as ended up being true with Nala, its lack of socialization and the dog just needs a proper introduction and needs to know that the other dogs are not going to hurt her. The previous owner said that she was good in the house and with her kids. If you would like to foster to adopt Nala, please go to www.atlantalabrescue.com to fill out an application.",

            "description": "Venus is a 3 year old Black Mouth Cur mix that was on the euthanasia list in an overcrowded Tulsa shelter. She is a playful and silly girl who thinks she is a lap dog. She knows commands such as sit, down and shake. She is not distructive and seldom barks. Although she is slow to warm up to men, Venus is super sweet and loves to give kisses. Venus LOVES water and will happily get in the shower with you unless there is a barrier. Venus gave birth to 9 puppies on 1/10/21 and won't be available until she is finished raising her puppies. We are, however, accepting applications for pre-approval.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Venus is $350. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

            "description": "***AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION AT OUR FLORIDA LOCATION***\n\nMiley is a female Black Mouth Cur mix. She is approximately 4 years old and weighs around 60 lbs. \n\nFrom her foster home:  Miley is a calm sweet girl that loves to snooze on the couch. She is a bit shy as she is getting acclimated to her new surroundings. She is fully house trained and has good manners. She has a medium energy level.\n\nWhen allowed time and patience, she comes out of her shell. She loves to play, tug, and wrestle, but sometimes doesn't realize how big her paws are that she swings around. \n\nShe is good with kids. She is good with other dogs, but has shown a strong prey drive towards small animals. She is not a good match for homes with cats, chickens, rabbits, or other small animals. \n\nMiley strongly dislikes loud noises such as gun shots and fireworks \nShe has overcome her previous fear of thunder. \nHer adopter will probably need to pursue calming methods/products to manage her noise anxiety if and when needed. \n\nShe travels well in a car. She responds to commands such as off, up, leave it and load up (into truck) as well as other verbal cues. She has been working on leash training. \n\nMiley, like so many of our adults and mommas that come in, is heartworm positive. This is NOT contagious and is not a death sentence! We have started her on Heartgard which will keep new worms from growing and allow the ones already present to die off slowly. This is the safest way to do it in the group home setting.  It is a very manageable treatment plan. Included in her adoption is a year supply of Heartgard. \n\nMiley is available in Bonifay, Florida through the rescue efforts of The Lucky Puppy Rescue. The minimum $250 adoption fee includes spay/neuter surgery, vaccinations, de-worm, flea prevention, heartworm prevention and martingale safety collar.   Adoption fee payment methods accepted are credit, debit, Paypal and bank checks. No personal checks or cash. Applications must be submitted through our website - theluckypuppy.org - thank you! You may copy and paste the following link to apply: http://www.theluckypuppy.org/adoption-application.\n",

            "description": "So sweet!Buster was born around December 12, 2013, and weighs about 15 pounds. Somehow Buster found himself sitting in a high kill shelter in Kentucky. The shelter reached out to us knowing we have a soft spot for older dogs and Joyful happily agreed to bring him to safety. Buster rode well in the car and does fine with the other dogs however he can be rather bossy. (Update: He can be around other dogs just fine, but needs to live as an only dog as he will protect his human from other dogs - great with people!) He was around older children and did fine. He is a happy go lucky type and not nippy with us at all. Buster walks nicely on a leash and is ready to find his forever home!\nThe Adoption Fee for this dog is $350.00 Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general, our fees include spay/neuter, all age-appropriate vaccines, Home Again microchipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY. Joyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility. YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES We keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list. If a pet is still showing, it is still available for adoption. Can't Adopt Me? SPONSOR ME Look for the Link 'Special Instructions to Seller' if you want to note a particular pet\nBefore you seek to adopt a pet from Joyful Rescues, please read our Pet Adoption page http://www.joyfulrescues.org/pet_adoption.html.\n\nOnline Application",

Clinic staff have found Bronx to be friendly and tolerant of all their poking and prodding. When meeting another dog at PACC, Bronx was tolerant of the other pups greetings, and generally kept to himself and explored the yard. Bronx is in need of a committed foster or adopter who can give him a quiet lace to continue to heal, and willing to work with the PACC clinic to continue his treatment as needed.

            "description": "Maui arrived from a family that couldn't take care of her properly.  She's enjoying time with her boxer friends and the cats in her foster home.\n\nWith a guesstimated birthday in July 2020, Maui weighs about 30 lb.  We've included a picture of her sharing a meal with one of the boxers to give an idea of her size right now.\n\nMaui is affectionate and ready to play.  She's comfy in a 42\" crate and does well on a leash with some pulling.  Her house-training is going well when kept on a regular schedule of every hour to reinforce waiting.\n\nApril 2020:  We are not holding public adoption events at this time.  Qualified families are being invited to appointments to meet specific dogs.  There are currently no opportunities to view multiple dogs and adoption events aren't being held at Tractor Supply in Lenoir.\n\nWhether dogs / puppies come in as strays or owner surrenders, we usually have to make our best guess as to birthdate and breed.   \n\nIf adopted into a home with other animals, particularly cats, your new pet should be crated or secured when you're not available to supervise to insure a harmonious relationship.  \n\nA vet reference is required to confirm responsible pet ownership.  We suggest first time pet owners look for an adult dog for companionship and to gain experience through another rescue or your local government-run animal control..\n\nAdoption fee covers two vaccinations plus spay / neuter if using our local low-cost spay/neuter clinic (overnight stay required) and surgery occurs as agreed upon in the adoption contract.  Convenience fee equal to refundable spay/neuter deposit may be added if using our veterinarian.  Additional fees for 3rd puppy vaccination, refundable spay/neuter deposit, etc. may apply.  \n\nWe are an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue.  We receive no funding from agencies.  Available animals can be seen most Saturdays at Tractor Supply in Lenoir from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  We recommend interested parties contact us to pre-qualify for adoption so their new furry family can go home once paperwork is complete.  Fees are required in cash.  For more information on our organization, our website is www.petpartnersrescue.org.",

            "description": "Meet Rhonda! Rhonda is a healthy Boxer girl who is about 8 years old and weighs around 45lbs. Sadly, her previous family left her behind when they moved away, and she was left to fend for herself for a few weeks before she was found. She was very thin, too weak to walk, and had a leg injury as well as an eye infection. She has recovered nicely, but considering this recent experience and her age, Rhonda may not be a type of dog that goes on long hikes on weekends. She is affectionate and loves giving hugs to her humans, and more than anything, she misses being part of a family. Rhonda gets along with other dogs, but young rambunctious ones are too much for her, so a mellow dog would be a better sibling for her than a puppy or a high energy dog. She cannot live peacefully with cats. She walks well on leash, and knows some commands like \u201csit\u201d, and \u201cpaw\u201d in Spanish. She hopes that her next companion will be as faithful as she is, and she can live out her golden years with them. Rhonda was rescued from Becerias, Mexico, and is being fostered in Bend, OR. Will you be her hero?\nIf you are interested in Rhonda, please fill out an application at www.streetdoghero.org/forms",

She's very affectionate and loves snuggles and cuddles, but knows when she's ready for some \"me time\" in her own space.\n\nShe's a quick study, excited to learn new things and very obedient. Eveey does really well on a leash and is a great running partner, and can easily do 5 miles at a medium pace run with no issues.\n\nEveey prides herself as the sole provider of love, companionship, and joy to you. She can get very assertive when she encounters cats, squirrels, or other dogs and needs time to calm down.\n\nFor that reason, she's looking for an experienced family who's willing to help her with training, and her fosters report that she's making good progress already. Eveey would do best as the only dog in the home, and with older children.\n\nAre you the forever home Eveey has been looking for?\n\nIf you are interested in adding this pup to your family, please submit an application at www.petrescuealliance.com. All questions will be answered and meet and greets set up following a review of application. If the dog is listed on our website or Petfinder, they are still available! Pet Rescue Alliance does our best to provide accurate information about the dogs we have available for adoption. We cannot make any guarantees about age, breed or temperament.",

She does really well with positive reinforcement and loves treats. After a good walk, her favorite thing to do is cuddle up next to you on the couch with all the blankets you can find. She's a good listener, loves people, and prefers to be an only child as while she loves to play with her fellow dogs, she doesn't really like it when they hang around too often. She doesn't bark at the door, but she will love any guest that comes in -- and she's sure to show it with plenty of kisses and tail wags. Her favorite place to be pet is on her head and under her chin.\n\nWhile she has no problem being a lazy, indoor dog, she's an outside girl at heart as her real passion is getting out her amazing energy with a good run, swim, or walk. She is 100% crate trained, potty trained, and knows all of her basic commands (sit, stay, wait, take, down, heel, & come) without needing treats. She loves to play and is excellent at tug-of-war and fetch (both on land and in the water). She has an abundant amount of energy that is easily expelled through walks and play time.\n\nAutumn should go to a home with no other dogs so that she can be the queen of the castle! Autumn would also do best in a single family home or townhouse outside of the city.\n\nInterested in adding Autumn to your family?

            "description": "***AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION AT OUR FLORIDA LOCATION***\n\nLulu is a 2 year old female Hound/Shepherd mix. She weighs approximately 40 lbs. From her foster home:  Lulu can be timid and submissive at first but give her time to open up and she is the sweetest dog.  After some patience and time, she loves to snuggle on the couch or your lap. She is good with kids. She is wary of men. \n\nLulu is house trained and has started crate training. She is very well mannered. She has mastered commands such as sit, down, leave it, up, off and load up in addition to verbal cues. \n\nShe has a medium/high energy level and LOVES to run and chase sticks and balls. She fetches well inside the house and knows the command to drop it. Outdoors, she is learning to return the ball/stick. She loves playing with other dogs and listens so well that her foster parents let her play off leash outside, though she walks great on a leash. She also travels well in a vehicle. \n\nLulu, like so many of our adults and mommas that come in, is heartworm positive. This is NOT contagious and is not a death sentence! We have started her on Heartgard which will keep new worms from growing and allow the ones already present to die off slowly. This is the safest way to do it in the group home setting.  It is a very manageable treatment plan. Included in her adoption is a year supply of Heartgard. \n\nShe gave birth and raised her puppies at our rescue and now it is her time to be a cherished pet as well. \n\nLulu is available in Bonifay, Florida through the rescue efforts of The Lucky Puppy Rescue. The minimum $250 adoption fee includes spay/neuter surgery, vaccinations, de-worm, flea prevention, heartworm prevention and martingale safety collar. Adoption fee payment methods accepted are credit, debit, Paypal and bank checks. No personal checks or cash. Applications must be submitted through our website - theluckypuppy.org - thank you! You may copy and paste the following link to apply: http://www.theluckypuppy.org/adoption-application.\n",

He is a very gentle and sweet boy that enjoys calm walks in the neighborhood. Skipper gets really excited when he sees other dogs so needs to have another dog in the home. He does bond quickly with his person so his adopter should be able to continue to work with him on his confidence to prevent him from having separation anxiety. He will do well in a home with cats, but he will try to play so he would do best with a cat that has lived with dogs before.\n\nSkipper does get overwhelmed with hyperactive puppies. The dog in the home needs to be well adjusted and a role model for him.\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give. We rely on the generosity of others to make rescuing dogs possible.\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS DOG, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE READ THE DOG'S INFORMATION CAREFULLY.  ONCE YOU HAVE DONE SO, PLEASE DO THE FOLLOWING:\n1.       Visit www.dogswithoutborders.org\n2.      Then fill out an online ADOPTION APPLICATION -  http://dogswithoutborders.org/adopt-a-dog/adoption-application/\n3.

In hopes of finding this deserving girl her forever home, we are reducing her adoption fees to $375.**\n\nMeet Sky! Our educated guess is that she is an American Bulldog/Pit mix, approximately 3 years and approximately 50 pounds.\n\nSky is doing really well in her foster home! She enjoys going on long walks and really likes car rides. Overall, Sky is a calm dog although she does get her zoomies occasionally! Sky will always greet you with much love (belly rubs are her favorite!) She does very well with new people, including older kids.\n\nSky is house trained, crate trained and knows some basic commands!\n\nShe's still learning and overcoming anxiety, but she\n\nis eager to please and would love a patient family who wants to help her learn and grow! Sky can be reactive to other dogs and would do best as the only animal in the house.\n\nInterested in making this sweet girl your new best friend? Apply online today!\n\nIf you are interested in adding this pup to your family, please submit an application at www.petrescuealliance.com. All questions will be answered and meet and greets set up following a review of application. If the dog is listed on our website or Petfinder, they are still available! Pet Rescue Alliance does our best to provide accurate information about the dogs we have available for adoption. We cannot make any guarantees about age, breed or temperament.

Casey\nis heartworm positive and currently being treated with medication. It is important to note that activity restriction is needed during treatment process.\n\nCasey is a sweetheart and very affectionate! She has a cute and quirky personality. Casey loves to cuddle on the couch and watch Netflix while you rub her belly. She's also perfectly content to entertain herself with her toys while her human works and enjoys puzzle toys and squeaky toys!\n\nCasey is great with other dogs and likes to play once she's warmed up to them.

Unfortunately she prefers to be the only 4 legged kid in the home so with heavy heart her owners want to do what is best for her and allow her to enjoy the rest of her life in a home where she is the center of attention.\nShe is nervous around small children but doesn't have a problem with older kids - teenagers.\nShe is reserved when she meets new people until she knows they are safe. Then she is all about humans.\nShe is trained in the Koehler method and she is very proficient. She is housebroken and walks well on a leash. She is a strong girl and will need a strong leader to help her continue to be the best she can be.\nPlease feel free to fill out an ADOPTION APPLICATION by clicking on the button below.\nThank You!\n\nor\n\nPETFINDER VIEWERS: Find our applications at www.midwestanimalrescue.org\n\n*The pet you are viewing is a rescued pet which is most often from an animal control facility and does not come with a pedigree. The breed(s) listed are our best guess and are in no way guaranteed. Sometimes the pets appear to be a particular breed(s) in the pictures we receive from our rescue partners and when they arrive we are surprised to see an entirely different breed(s) in person! If you choose to DNA test your adopted pet, test results may vary from company to company and our breed guess may not be reflected in those results as it is just that, our best guess. It is with deep longing that we wish there was a breed called \"cute\" as we believe all of our dogs would fall under this new breed classification!\n\n//",

I was neglected by my former owners who surrendered me to a county animal control where Orphan Annie took me in from. Because of this neglect, I don't see or hear as well as I used to but I certainly try my best. I am incredibly sweet and food motivated. I am doing very well with house-training. I love to sleep in bed next to her head and get lots of attention. I enjoy being pet and being near you. I do well with other dogs but definitely prefer the calmer ones, though do fine with them all. I am pretty quiet, too.\n\n\nMy adoption fee is $150, which includes my spay, shots, heartworm testing, and microchipping. You can find the adoption application and process on our website www.orphanannierescue.org. \n\nYou must live in metro Atlanta to adopt me.",

He is super loyal, sweet, doesn't play with toys much here would prefer to be with a person and get pets, love and snuggle all day. Is crate trained, knows how to sit and take treats nicely. Since he gets zoomies and excited so a slower introduction to dogs is suggested. Jerry prefers calmer dogs and great with kids! \n\nTo set up a meet and greet or inquire about a dog, please first fill out an application at https://savinghoperescue.org/contact.

            "description": "MEET CHET!!\n\nI was given the name Chet at the shelter, but my foster family has been calling me Blue. I enjoy being with you all of the time being touched and played with. I am learning to not bark if I am not being attended, but this is a slow process. Additionally, I am learning how to be gentle all of the time when I am playing. I enjoy being mouthy. However, I accidentally broke my teeth while in the shelter. So, if I accidentally play too hard it rarely results in my person being hurt. I respond well to redirection with a bone or a pull toy. Since my teeth are sensitive I do not particulate like hard ropes to tug with. But I do enjoy a nice soft rope. I will play fetch intermittently, but do love chasing and chewing on a nice squeaky ball. I have been living with another dog. There have been no issues. A few growls here and there but I immediately stop when told to. I have met a cat a few times. I am generally respectful. I did try and chase once but not only stopped but laid down immediately when told to stop. I understand basic commands but it some times takes me a few seconds to respond. I love meeting new people. When I meet other dogs it is best if I go on a walk with them until I calm down. After that, I get along just fine. I am crate trained and split time between sleeping in my crate and a bed. When I am in my crate over night I do not cry and cuddle nicely in bed when I am allowed. The only time I bark in my crate is if I am in time out in it and see that you are there ignoring me. I do need to have my meals portioned out. I will continue eating until the food is gone. I still have a little more weight to gain for my spine to be covered but am getting there quickly. I really do love people and hope that I can find a forever home in which I will be played with and cuddled every day.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Chet, please visit our website for our online application www.underdogaz.com",

I was just rescued by Second City Canine Rescue  and I'm now in a loving foster home waiting for my forever family to find me! Please come soon... I can't wait to meet you!\n\nInterested in adopting this dog? Visit our website (http://www.SecondCityCanineRescue.org) to fill out an application and to find out where this dog may be shown this weekend.\n\nWe love our dogs. We want happy lives for all of them and are looking for the home that provides the best fit for each dog\u2019s individual needs. Please understand that there may be multiple families interested in this dog. Come to the show to find out if this dog is the right fit for you \u2014 it's helpful to bring all family members and current dogs. \n\nAlso, please know that the breed mix listed is simply a guess. In most cases, we don\u2019t know their background. We encourage you to base your decision on individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on our guess.\n\nPlease understand, we only adopt our animals out near the Chicagoland area. Questions? Email us at adoptions@sccrescue.org. Hope to see you become part of the SCCR family!",

Because of family circumstances, Cletus is coming back to the rescue. While he was with his family he learned to get along with cats and was buddies with the other dog there. He loved the two kids in his family too. Cletus is looking for an active family to be part of. He still needs some work on his manners, like not helping himself to things on the counter or in the trash, but will reward you with lots of love and laughs at his coon hound antics. Even though he is 9 yrs old, he still has lots of energy and will need daily walks.\nHello my name is Cletus. Everyone tells me just what a good looking fella I am. I was found as a stray and ended up at the dog pound. No one came to claim me. I am a happy energetic guy, good with other dogs and people. I could use a little work on my manners because I become bored easily and just try to find things to do. I also see cats as fun things to chase so shouldn't go to a home with a kitty. I am house trained, up to date with vaccines, neutered, and heartworm negative. If you are a hound lover, well here I am, just waiting for you. If you would like to meet me, please fill out an application below. We will make a date! Love Cletus\nYou can easily fill out an adoption application by clicking here: adoption application\nFor anyone viewing this on Petfinder, if you are interested in adopting this animal you will need to go to our website www.rosesrescue.net to fill out the online adoption application. You can usually find more pictures of the animals there too. Click on our name 'Roses Rescue' in blue above to be taken directly to our website.",

            "description": "Buddy! This handsome boy is a 4 year old pit mix and about 60 pounds. He is house trained and crate trained. Buddy is dog friendly, cat friendly and kid friendly, but would love to find a quiet forever home where he can enjoy a life of leisure and relax by himself.\n\nWhile Buddy is heartworm positive, this can easily be managed with medication.\n\nBuddy's personality has really started to shine! He adores belly rubs and going outside to sniff and explore. If you show him love, he will follow you around like a shadow. He lets you pick him up, rub his face, lift his paws, and even wrestle. He's been great company while working from home and is clumsy when he gets excited which is extremely cute. Even though he had a rough past, somehow he still trusts and loves people.\n\nHe would be a great addition to any family willing to give him the second chance he deserves. It doesn't get much better than his temperament!\n\nApply online at petrescuealliance.com to give this boy a loving home!\n\nIf you are interested in adding this pup to your family, please submit an application at www.petrescuealliance.com. All questions will be answered and meet and greets set up following a review of application. If the dog is listed on our website or Petfinder, they are still available! Pet Rescue Alliance does our best to provide accurate information about the dogs we have available for adoption. We cannot make any guarantees about age, breed or temperament.",

Date: Kringle aka Hans Had Surgery Today!!\n\nOur sweet boy out of the Ramona Humane Society had his surgery today and it went very well. Kringle had to have a plate put into secure his pelvis and and Femoral Head Ostectomy to make sure he will be able to walk again. The surgeon and his treating Dr. at @Camino Veterinary Hospital in Irvine were very pleased with the outcome. Kringle is resting comfortably and will be ready to head to a foster home in a day or so. Kringle is such a love, everyone who meets him adores him. We are grateful we were able to help him. If you would like to donate towards his medical care, we are still about $2k short, you can do so in the following ways:\n\nFacebook: Via the button on the post\n\nVenmo: @\nlabradorsandfriends.org\n\nPay Pal: labradorsandfriends@yahoo.com\n\nWebsite: www.Labradors and\nfriends.org\n\nCash/Check: Labradors and Friends - 2307 Fenton Parkway #107-160, San Diego, CA 92108\n\nTax ID# 32-0195297\n\nThank you everyone for your support!! If you are interested in fostering or eventually adopting Kringle please fill out our online application at\nwww.labradorsandfriends.org\n\nPreviously:\n\nURGENT: KRINGLE NEEDS OUR HELP!!\n\nA few days before Christmas a sweet, young shepherd mix, found himself at the Ramona Humane Society after having been hit by a car. He was taking to CVS for immediate medical care/stabilization and x-rays showing a bad pelvic break. Sadly, he then spent the holiday at the shelter. Kringle, who was also known as Hans, couldn't stand, wasn't eating, but had to complete his stray hold, which was up Saturday. At 9 am we were told there was ZERO rescue interest in helping him. We just couldn't let him sit there any longer, we knew from the x-rays that his break was surgical, but 6 days was long enough to wait. We immediately put a plan in place to get him out and to our vet. Kringle will need surgery, a plate to hold his pelvis together so his leg can be stabilized. Kringle is so sweet and thankfully, there wasn't any damage to his spinal cord or femoral head. The bad news is we are looking at a $4,000 surgery. Please consider making a 100% Tax Deductible Donation towards his surgery and medical care.\n\nWays to donate:\n\nFacebook via the button on the post\n\nVenmo: @labradorsandfriends\n\nPayPal: labradorsandfriends@yahoo.com\n\nWebsite:\nwww.labradorsandfriends.org\n\nCash/Check in the mail: Labradors and Friends - 2307 Fenton Parkway #107-160, San Diego, CA 92108\n\nTax ID#32-0195297\n\nThank You Everyone!

He loves kids, but has a lot of energy so older kids would be best. Other favorite things to do is cuddling with his people, squeaky balls, nylabones and walks. He will melt your heart when he stares into your eyes. Sebastian needs an adopter that will set the expectations for him. He corrects well with a water bottle. Sebastian was having an issue with the other male in his previous home. They recommend a home without dogs or a submissive female.",

I might look tough, but I'm just a big loving goofball. And I'm pretty smart, too. I know sit, down, shake, stay, and come, and I'm currently working on roll over and heel! If you want to continue my training after adoption, the sky is the limit on what I can learn. And training at the shelter is half price with my adoption! Because I sometimes don't realize how big I am, I will need a home where any children are closer to their teens. I need to meet any children and resident dogs to make sure it's a perfect match! I am able to jump a 4 foot fence and would prefer a home with a 6 foot fence and will need to be supervised at all times when outside. Hercules will be shown by appointment only. If you are interested in learning more about this animal, please fill out an application by clicking here . Be sure to include Hercules A1200057 when filling out the survey. After reviewing your application, we will only be reaching out to you if the animal is a good fit for your home.",

He is doing his best to adjust to the new environment but he would do much better in a loving home. Rocky needs a home where he can take his time to decompress and let his true colors shine through. While Rocky is shy at first, it doesn't take long for him to trust. He needs a patient family that will focus on his needs while providing unconditional love and a calm home. While Rocky has lived with older children due to his touch sensitivity and shy nature we are recommending a home with all members 12 years and over. That is not too much to ask to help this sweet and loving boy bounce back. He will need a confident dog in the home to build reassurance and guide him. Rocky is crate and potty trained. Rocky's face says it all..... Please take a chance on him, he deserves to find his family now.",

            "description": "Tilly was born on a property south of San Antonio. She was not socialized with people at all so it takes her some time to come around. She is very, very sweet and would do best in a home with other dogs. We would prefer a home with older kids just because screaming may scare her. \n\nShe is 7-8 months old, good with dogs and will most likely be okay with cats and  kids.  She is potty trained, kenneled trained but is still working on walking on a leash. That has been one thing that is taking her the most time to get used to because she is scared to go on walks or have the leash attached. An adopter needs to be aware that she is not going to be comfortable walking on leash or being loaded into a car right away. An adopter will need to consider a mobile vet or further training to help her adjust and overcome her fear.\n\n*Because she missed her critical socialization period, it is safe to say that she will carry anxiety with her. So she may not be the dog that you take to the park or lake as she may get overwhelmed. Owners will need to be patient and continue to work on coping skills and calming skills so she can have confidence in new situations.\n\nTilly will need to go to a home with playful dogs. She functions best on a routine, and needs to be kenneled at night to avoid chewing. \n\nTilly has a $100 adoption fee and interested parties must complete an adoption application via www.pawsa.org under the adoptables tab. Her foster is happy to schedule meet and greets.\n\nAgain, She is very, very sweet and would do best in a home with other playful dogs.",

He is such a good dog, we can't say enough good things about him. He is well rounded, sweet, playful and gets along with everyone. This boy just wants love and comfort from here on out. \n\nHis progress from a bleeding, scratchy, uncomfortable dog to a fully feathered out beauty, really puts a lump in your throat and a skip in your step and makes you want to yell at the top of your lungs \"WE DID IT!!\n\nGoliath is recovering from his early days of neglect. He is getting more playful everyday; he tries to keep up with the other dogs and is learning how to play and have fun. We call him the gentle giant. He is a good boy and is looking for a home to learn all the comforts and good things for boys like him. Goliath relies on other confident dogs to help bring him out of his shell so we are looking for a home with another confident dog for this big boy. He gets along great with female dogs and most likely would do well with a male but would need proper intros.\n\nThis poor boy had been living under a house for months with no care. His face was swollen so much he could not open his eyes. His fur was missing. He needed help.\n\nWe had the neighbors set a trap and after 3 weeks they trapped him and we brought him straight to the ER.",

            "description": "Hello, my name is Pike (but you can call me anything you like since I can't hear you).  I'm a handsome 2.5 year old boy weighing in at around 70 lbs.  I'm obviously a mix of all the most handsome breeds around.  Not only am I sweet and loving, my mom thinks that I am the smartest boy around.  I'm deaf so I communicate with sign language and already know commands for sit, down, come, potty, no and most importantly, good boy.  If you give me a thumbs-up, I know I've been good and give the biggest smile around!  I have picked up on my signs so quickly and will easily learn more (stay gives me trouble because of my wiggly butt).  I love to snuggle and be with my people but I also love to run in the yard and chase the ball and squirrels.  I'm looking for a calm home with someone who will be patient when things get scary and give me all the love and belly rubs I can get.  Tiny humans can be unpredictable and they make me nervous so I need a home without them.  I do well with cats and have done well with dogs in the past.  My adoption fee is $250.00.\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

            "description": "Updated: 1/21/2021\nHello, I'm Hildy and I am looking for a family who loves light blue eyes and very soft fur. I am approximately 18 months and weigh 40 pounds. With my breed mix, I am full of life with lots of spunk and high energy and need lots of room to run and play! A home with lots of yard to run in and perhaps a fence would be ideal. I am not the kind of doggy that would do well in an apartment, as it is too confined. I would be great with a family that loves outdoor activities such as running and hiking. I am early on in my training for leash walking, so I am still pulling on my leash.\nI obey a few commands and am learning a few more, but need a patient owner as I am young and still pushing limits. I am house-broken and crate-trained. I take treats nicely, but am still learning to eat slowly and calmly, especially when other dogs are with me eating in the same room. I did well when they gave me a bath even though it wasn't one of my favorite things to do. I love to play with all sorts of toys-from soft cuddly ones to semi-hard rubbery ones to hard bones. I will bring all of them to you so that you can play with me. I also like to play 'ring around the island'/peek-a-boo. When introduced to other dogs, a slow introduction is best. I like to play with other dogs, but I get very excited when playing and I am quite intense and need continued direction on proper play etiquette. The other dogs don't understand that I just want to have fun. So, I will require continued training on learning to respect boundaries. I like kids and have been around ones as young as two years old, but I should always be supervised with littles as I rough house when playing and don't wish to knock them down. I will occasionally watch tv when something on it intrigues me. I enjoy looking out the window in search of squirrels and bunnies.\nI am the best doggy if you allow me plenty of exercise including walks and the chance to run several times daily. If you are interested in a finding a friendly, fun loving, and energetic girl, look no further. Hope to meet you soon!\nAdoption Fee: $475.00\nWe are a Wisconsin state licensed dog rescue -WI# 402433\n\n***We do not have a central adoption center at this time. All our dogs are in private foster homes within WI. At this time we only place our dogs in areas of WI. The breed of our dogs is our best guess with the help of our veterinarians.\nOur Weight Classes are as follows:\n0- 25lbs - Small\n26- 45lbs - Medium\n46-89 - Large\n90+ X-large\nIf you are adopting an adult dog, which we consider 6 months of age or older, your adoption fee includes the following:\nSpay/Neuter, Rabies and Distemper shots, dewormed, flea & tick preventative, heartworm tested and microchipped.\nIf you are adopting a dog younger than 6 months of age, the dog will be up to date on the shots as per the dogs age. The dog will be dewormed, flea/tick preventative and microchipped. We only spay/neuter our dogs by 6 months of age. If you decide to adopt a younger dog than 6 months of age, they will need to be spayed/neutered at one of our preferred clinics. This will be determined by your contract along with the month they should have their surgery. This is included in your adoption fee.\nOnce you are approved with our rescue, you can meet any one of our dogs within the fosters home. If you are interested in the dog you met, you can take the dog home under our mandatory foster to adopt program. You receive 5 days to see if the dog is the right fit for your home.\nIf it is, we will conduct the home visit and finalize adoption. If it is not, it is returned to the foster. We are happy to find you another dog that meets your needs in your home.\nIf a dog is listed as PENDING, a family has met the dog and planning on adopting the dog after the home visit has been conducted. We always suggest sending in an application for a dog because there are times where the dogs are given back to us under the foster to adopt program. There are many reasons dogs are returned but normally it just was not the right fit for all.Please go to WWW.TAILWAGGERS911.COM under HOW TO ADOPT . We have an online application that is very easy to fill out.",

He is a happy, playful, social boy who loves other dogs, loves every person he meets, loves car rides, and has good leash manners.  He was picked up as an emaciated stray in Barrow County with a broken leg after being hit by a car.  Sadly he sat at the shelter for 2 weeks until BarkVille heard about him, arranged to have him treated by our partner vet, and placed him in a wonderful foster home where he has been putting on weight & regaining his health daily.  He is on crate restrictions right now as his leg continues to heal, but his foster mom describes him as a fun, loving, medium energy boy who loves to run and would thrive in a home with a fenced yard, possibly another a dog or 2, and some kids that he can call his own.  Levi is housebroken, crate trained, neutered, fully vaccinated & microchipped.  \n\nFor more information about Levi, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org. If you would like to adopt this sweet boy, please submit an application for him at https://www.barkvilledogrescue.org/applications",

Ideally his new home will have someone home most of the time and won\u2019t have very young or hyper two- or four-legged friends. He will need arthritis medication.\n\u00a0\nChico is looking forward to living in the lap of love and luxury for his golden days. He adores affection and is the perfect lap buddy. Can you be Chico\u2019s guardian angel?\n\nInterested in adopting this dog? Visit our website (http://www.SecondCityCanineRescue.org) to fill out an application and to find out where this dog may be shown this weekend.\n\nWe love our dogs. We want happy lives for all of them and are looking for the home that provides the best fit for each dog\u2019s individual needs. Please understand that there may be multiple families interested in this dog. Come to the show to find out if this dog is the right fit for you \u2014 it's helpful to bring all family members and current dogs. \n\nAlso, please know that the breed mix listed is simply a guess. In most cases, we don\u2019t know their background. We encourage you to base your decision on individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on our guess.\n\nPlease understand, we only adopt our animals out near the Chicagoland area. Questions? Email us at adoptions@sccrescue.org. Hope to see you become part of the SCCR family!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.wagoninn.rescuegroups.org\nLexi is a beautiful hound mix who was found in a rural shelter in Kansas by one of our rescue partners. She liked Lexi and her dog-mate Lucky so much that she brought them back home to Louisiana so they could head up to Wag On Inn Rescue.\nLexi is a sweet senior 9-year-old girl who sometimes acts half her age. She loves to be around people who supply her with pets, ear scratches, and tummy rubs. A pleasure to foster, Lexi quickly adapted well to her foster home and is fun to be around. She loves squishy toys and the tennis ball, and is just a happy-go-lucky pup. This good girl does not counter-surf (although she can due to her height), does not get into trash, or chew or destroy anything in the house. She also is housetrained. She has 24/7 run of the house and has not been crated. She does tend to pull on a leash at first and then relaxes. She LOVES her walks!\nLexi is adventurous, and her foster parents would not trust her off leash unless in a fenced area. She is not adept at coming back when called. She is smart, though, and loving towards her people, and she is also treat-motivated, so her family can work on training. She is an escape artist too, so her family should work on \"wait\" with her.\nLexi is super sweet and will be your constant companion. She LOVES car rides. She could be fine as an only dog or with male canine companions but no small dogs. No cats for Lexi.\nLexi had very itchy skin upon arriving in NJ and her foster mom is working on this with an antihistamine, gentle baths, and a special grain free diet. Miss Lexi will be a wonderful companion to her new family.\nLexi is fully vetted - spayed, up to date on vaccines and microchipped. She is heartworm negative. Lexi's adoption fee is $300.\n\nHow to Adopt Me!\nIf you are interested in learning more about me, and possibly making me part of your family, please go to wagoninn.rescuegroups.org . Click on the orange Online Adoption Application button to fill out an application. A Wag On Inn volunteer will be in touch soon!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nName: Greta\nDOB: 10/15/15\n\nWeight: 69 lbs\n\n- Potty trained\n- Has all basic training; sit, knows name, lay down, shake, etc\n- Loves kids and people\n- Is vocal, likes to howl, bark, and coo\n- Does NOT do well in kennel but is trustworthy outside of kennel\n- Would do best with fenced in yard\n- Would do best as only animal in home\n\nDid those big brown eyes draw you in? Was it the goofy floppy ears? Maybe you saw the picture of her cuddling with a cat and thought man.. Greta could be my dog! She could be the one! Please read this little paragraph before applying. This old girl is looking for her forever family, not someone who loves just her cute very smushable face.\n\nGreta found herself homeless after getting into a dispute with a neighbor dog a few months back and is on the lookout for a family who is willing to let her be the center of attention. Greta can be defensive around other animals so she would be best as an only pet in the home.\n\nGreta loves people, toys, treats, and playing ball. Her favorite activities include cuddling, napping, chasing balls, and playing with her stuffy toys. She walks okay on a leash but does tend to pull as she is a hound mix who is lead by her nose. A fenced in yard to play and romp in would be perfect for her!\n\nShe is not an overly active girl, she also has very good house manners assuming there is nothing tasty she can reach on your counters. She tells you when she needs to go outside along with chatting about daily events, the weather, and her overall mood. Greta is a hound mix, she tends to be vocal and loves to talk to you about all manner of affairs.\n\nThis amazing, sweet, soft adorable old gal has been let down by folks too many times have anyone else not love her with their whole hearts. When applying for Greta, please read the bullets and info above and understand that she is truly looking for a retirement home to settle down in and be comfortable with.\n\nHer foster parents love her very much and want what's best for her but after having her returned twice due to folks feeling as though she is \"too much dog\", we feel it is important to be transparent in her needs. If you don't plan to let her sleep in bed with you, steal your blankets, share your snacks with her, and get hound hair all over your clothes, this gal isn't for you.\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal. Please check out our website, www.ruffstartrescue.org for more details and additional pictures on any of our animals! All Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs). Ruff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue. Animals are located in homes throughout Minnesota. We do not have a facility where animals are kept.

Her skin and spay scar are looking great! Car rides are her favorite. Ruth knows boundaries and does really well with listening. She loves my 9 and 11 year olds and is so gentle with them and their friends. \nAs of yet, Ruth hasn't had any formal intros to other doggos. She's been chased down by a loose neighbor dog a few times, and she is a rock star at sitting beside us and looking to her people for guidance of what to do. She doesn't pull toward other dogs or bark. \nRuth loves meeting new people when we're in neutral territory. She's not shown any aggression. We're so impressed with this sweet girl and love her company!",

You can see in my pictures that I am a sweet little girl.\nI am single and ready to mingle! Well.. I still have some of my litter mates but looking for my own furever family that is!\nMy name may be different, but it means \"the road is good\" and I know that I am one lucky puppy and the road I am on to find my furever family is a great one for sure.\nLikes: Being around my family, food, snuggles, kisses, toys to chew on, and all that fun cute puppy stuff.\nDislikes: Not having food, shelters, no loving home and being cold. Baths aren't my favorite hobby either but I know I need to stay fresh and clean for those snuggles!\nSeeking: Family to love me forever, keep me warm and fed. Long walks and possible doggie parks in the future - my older foster brothers say it's a lot of fun. I am very well socialized with humans and other dogs.\nMy furever family will need to continue to work on my training since I am so young. When I play with other dogs I can be very vocal and hold my own even with dogs much bigger than me. With submissive dogs I can get a little carried away when I play but can take direction from other dogs and humans when given the command to calm down.\nI have started giving cues to go outside to do my business but still have a few accidents here and there.\nBeing with my foster family has been awesome. I know I am loved and well cared for as I wait patiently. There are 3 little girls here too that just love me to pieces. I have 2 furry older foster brothers that I really enjoy playing with. There are cats here, and I just try to play with them but they don't really like dogs so they stay away.\nI have a lot of unconditional love to give so please put in your application to meet me \nAdoption Fee: $500.00\nWe are a Wisconsin state licensed dog rescue -WI# 402433\n\n***We do not have a central adoption center at this time. All our dogs are in private foster homes within WI. At this time we only place our dogs in areas of WI. The breed of our dogs is our best guess with the help of our veterinarians.\nOur Weight Classes are as follows:\n0- 25lbs - Small\n26- 45lbs - Medium\n46-89 - Large\n90+ X-large\nIf you are adopting an adult dog, which we consider 6 months of age or older, your adoption fee includes the following:\nSpay/Neuter, Rabies and Distemper shots, dewormed, flea & tick preventative, heartworm tested and microchipped.\nIf you are adopting a dog younger than 6 months of age, the dog will be up to date on the shots as per the dogs age. The dog will be dewormed, flea/tick preventative and microchipped. We only spay/neuter our dogs by 6 months of age. If you decide to adopt a younger dog than 6 months of age, they will need to be spayed/neutered at one of our preferred clinics. This will be determined by your contract along with the month they should have their surgery. This is included in your adoption fee.\nOnce you are approved with our rescue, you can meet any one of our dogs within the fosters home. If you are interested in the dog you met, you can take the dog home under our mandatory foster to adopt program. You receive 5 days to see if the dog is the right fit for your home.\nIf it is, we will conduct the home visit and finalize adoption. If it is not, it is returned to the foster. We are happy to find you another dog that meets your needs in your home.\nIf a dog is listed as PENDING, a family has met the dog and planning on adopting the dog after the home visit has been conducted. We always suggest sending in an application for a dog because there are times where the dogs are given back to us under the foster to adopt program. There are many reasons dogs are returned but normally it just was not the right fit for all.Please go to WWW.TAILWAGGERS911.COM under HOW TO ADOPT . We have an online application that is very easy to fill out.",

BUT please read before applying so you understand that he will need training.\n\nEbe is a 5 year old that has a long way to go to be the perfect lil' guy that he will definitely be one day. With love, understanding, patience, and mostly time he will be the best dog.  We already love him with all of his naughtiness. He just needs help adjusting to indoor life. He is literally learning every single thing right now.\n\nEbe still has accidents in the house, but is getting better maybe 60/40 right now. He is not neutered so the first week he was busy marking the place up. \nBelly bands and crating result in some unrelenting howling whining tortured noises and suffering that we are not willing to put him through. Since he was tied outside to a crate maybe it brings up bad memories for him.\nEbe is the sweetest most snuggly lil' guy. He loves to snuggle and cuddle.  He talks and has a lot to say whenever he comes in from outside or when you get home. He is a hilarious dog. \nEbe does well with other dogs that do not mind his poor manners. Especially with food. Side note, never leave your plate unattended.\n\nHe also is learning about toys. He loves toys so much ... he chews a lot. He is still learning that shoes and sofas and cell phone chargers are not for chewing. Miniblinds?! Leave them open so he can see out, or he will fix 'em for ya.\n\nWhen we first got him he was pretty nippy and growly, so we are not sure about little kids.\n\nHe does try to door dash so you have to be alert when opening doors.\n\n\nAdoption Fee is $350\nHe is up to date on vaccines and has had a wellness exam, heartworm tested and micro-chipped.\n\n In order to meet any of our dogs, please fill out an application. To fill out an application \ngo to http://caninehumane.org/adoption-application/ \n\nIF THE DOG IS ON PETFINDER THEN IT IS STILL AVAILABLE\n\nwww.caninehumane.org \n\n***BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR SPAM/PROMOTION EMAIL FOLDER FOR CHN RESPONSE TO YOUR APPLICATION***",

She would love nothing more than to sit with you and watch the world around her. Pretty sure she would love to play too!! We spent almost an hour with her today. She knows how to sit, shake, and is learning \"touch\" very quickly. She walks amazingly on a leash, super gentle when she takes treats too!! She seems to enjoy \"booping\" the camera for a selfie Come and meet this sweet little girl !\nVolunteer\nKristy and Parker Verant\n1/19/21\nIn summary, she is a scared dog at the shelter. She bit because her dad tried to pull her away from another dog that was attacking Stella. This bite instance is very circumstantial. Anthony and I witnessed no aggression from her today. Special adoption will be to no dog home OR to a home with a dog that compliments Stella with a dog savvy handler.\n\nSee below for involved notes about this. \n\n\nStella was taken out of her kennel and walked to a playgroup. She struggled walking from her run to a play group. She pancaked to the floor in fear. She had her tail tucked for awhile in the playgroup. After 70 seconds passed, she made her first social interaction with Anthony and I. She loosened up from there. We took her out for a walk and she did very well. Maintained her sociability etc. Over the course of 30 min, she really blossomed in confidence. To see Stella with Anthony and I go to this link: https://youtu.be/ECvcikiMAMs\n\n\nPrevious owner said their 90 lb female lab jumped Stella when dad came home. Dad got bit while he was trying to free Stella from the hold his other dog had on Stella's back legs. Stella bit him in fear/frenzy. Dogs started to fight because of one of two things 1: resource guarding of the space around dad 2: the arousing situation made the lab snap and Stella. Previous owners state the lab would growl at Stella when Stella was next to her mom. Stella would block the lab from getting on the bed with mom. Lab was already not a fan of Stella. Stella lived well with 2 other male dogs. Stella did well with their grandkids aged 1 thru 4 years old. Stella did well greeting guests in the home.",

            "description": "****Please do not message the rescue asking if this dog is still available; if a dog/puppy is still listed on Petfinder, we are still accepting applications for them. PLEASE READ ENTIRE BIO BEFORE EMAILING****\n\n*Name: Austria\n\n*Age: approximately 3 years old\n\n*Current Weight: 65-70 lbs.\n\n*Adoption fee: $375 (plus $125 spay/neuter deposit, which is refundable when spay/neuter agreement is fulfilled)\n\n*Health: up to date on required vaccines, & microchipped\n\n*Requirements: Another dog in the home, a home with a fully fenced-in yard (physical fences only - no electric fences) due to her skittish nature. \n\nABOUT AUSTRIA:\nAustria is a very sweet girl who did not have a very good life before she came to SNARR Northeast. She came to us pregnant with a litter of puppies and quickly went into labor soon after arriving in her foster home. She has been an amazing mom to her babies, and now that she has fulfilled her mama duties, she is ready for a forever home of her own! \n\nAustria is shy when she first meets new people, but she is also very intelligent and once she figures out that you are safe and kind, she will seek out love and affection from you :) She loves to be pet and have her chin scratched, and she will lay down and roll on her back for belly rubs too! Even once she warms up to her people, she is still a bit of a skittish pup. Loud/sudden noises startle her so she should go to a more quiet home without young children. She also does have some separation anxiety and does not do well in a crate. Because of this, we also will require she goes to a home with another friendly, calm dog to keep her company. She has had a troubled past, but we cannot stress enough what a good dog Austria is. She has loved everyone she has met since being in her foster home, and everyone has loved her as well. \n\nIMPORTANT: This Dog has not yet been altered. For any dog or puppy that is not able to be spayed/neutered prior to adoption, SNARR requires a $125 deposit in addition to your adoption fee, as well as a strictly-enforced signed Spay/Neuter Contract stating you will have this dog altered within 6 months of adoption. The $125 deposit will be returned once the contract has been fulfilled.\n\n To apply to adopt Austria, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n\n**Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an approved application.**\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

            "description": "Titus came to me after his owner, his person that he trusted more than anyone in the world, picked him up and Threw him against a wall breaking his femur!  This sweet boy has been with me ever since.  He had surgery to put a pin in his leg and had to be confined for 8 long weeks.  This poor boy has been thru more than any animal should.  But even after all he has suffered, he is the sweetest, most loving dog you could ever imagine.  \nNow Titus is looking for his Real forever home. I am searching for the perfect home for Titus.  I owe him the best life possible.  Titus is not a big boy.  He only weighed 25 lbs on his last checkup and is approximately 18 inches tall from the shoulder.  He is house broken, crate trained, vaccinated and neutered. Titus is approximately 1 \u00bd years old.  He suffered a terrible injury, but seems unaffected now that he is healed.  No limp, no favoring the leg.  He runs, jumps, wrestles and plays with no issues.  He has no food aggression or resource guarding. However, he is an aggressive chewer with his toys.  He will chew up the toughest toy and has chewed thru a leash or two.  But he doesn\u2019t want to go anywhere, he just wants to play freely.   He is a complete and total lovebug!  He only wants to be where his person is.  He loves to curl up in your lap and cuddle.  Yes, he is small enough to be a lap dog.  Titus also Loves to go for walks and car rides.  \nI know the Basenji is a bark less dog, but Titus does bark, probably the Border Collie in him.  Of Course, it is unknown for sure without a dna test, but he has all the wonderful characteristics of a Basenji and is definitely a Border Collie. Titus will be Very responsive to proper training.  He is very smart and an excellent problem solver.  He played with a lot of puzzle toys while healing in confinement.  I had to get him an expert level puzzle and he still mastered it within minutes.  He is friendly and gets along with other dogs very well.  He is ok with cats; he won\u2019t try to kill Anything.  But if they run, the game is on he will definitely chase. But to him its all-in fun.  Titus would make a great agility dog.  He is small, fast and smart.  I would like to see Titus in a family setting, but he would also thrive as a single buddy too as long as he can be by your side.  \nI will be taking applications for Titus until the perfect home comes along.  So, if you should apply to adopt him, be prepared for it to be awhile before a decision is made.  All applicants Must provide verifiable vet reference, a video home check and residential stability, meaning no renters.  I know that sounds harsh but too many pets have been rehomed because the owner had to move and \u201ccouldn\u2019t take my pet with me\u201d. Titus will Never be discarded or shuffled around again.  Pets are family and should Never be separated from their people because they were not valued as a family member.  \nTitus\u2019s perfect home will have a secure yard to play in, Some Fur Siblings, lots of toys to destroy and above all, warmth and security.  His person/family will be warm, friendly, stable and understand that he has been through so much and deserves a happy and loving forever home.   If you are looking for your Forever companion and can provide Titus with these things, please email me and I will send you an application.  It is hard to let him go, he's a special boy.  But it is time for him to find his special someone.  \n\n*The Aurora Dog Pound only adopts out new family members.  Dogs are pack animals and must be included in the home.  This means No pens, No Chains, NO exceptions!\n",

I gave birth to 7 puppies here on the ranch. I am a very sweet girl and I love to meet new people. I am an excellent mama to my puppies and I absolutely adore my babies. I play well with other big dogs but appear to have a prey drive and would probably not be happiest in a home with cats. I'd be an excellent pick for a first time adopter and I would be the happiest in a home with a big yard for me to run around and play in. Nothing makes me happier than meeting new people; I love everyone! I would be an excellent dog to bring out and about in public with you because I am so friendly. I am well-trained, even potty-trained, and I love to go on long walks on my leash here at the ranch. My most favorite activity though is going to be snuggling up on the couch next to you!",

When rescued, she had a single puppy and not producing milk; she was severely underweight; she was heartworm positive, and she had horrible ear infections. She is gaining weight, but very slowly. She survived years of neglect but she truly loves people. She has limited hearing and because she was starved in the past, she is very protective of her food or treats from other animals. Vivian has been fostering at a doggy daycare. She does good with other dogs as long as there is no food/treats involved. We are not sure if she would be possessive over toys as she doesn't have much interest in them other than to have a stuffy in her bed with her. We believe she would do best with children 7 or older who are respectful of dogs. She would thrive in a home where she could be the center of someone's hearts and live the rest of her life with all the love she has missed in the past.",

I am a tall and long boy weighing about 70lbs. I am a very good, sweet boy. I love attention and getting pets. If you stop, I'll be really cute and paw at you to remind you that I still want all of the pets. I LOVE playing fetch with balls, squeaky toys, or really anything you will throw. I am excellent at dropping it and will even go find the ball when I accidentally lose it! If it were up to me, I would fetch all day. Being outside is my favorite. Even though I'm from Arkansas, I LOVE the snow! I also love going for walks, even though I zig-zag and pull a lot. I will pull and whine when I see other dogs or people because I love them!\n\nAt night I sleep in the kennel, but the kennel is not my favorite. My foster parents are trying to kennel train me, otherwise I would totally sleep in their bed at night! I don't like being alone, so I whine when I'm in my kennel. I'll need my furever home to continue helping me with learning that my kennel is good! That means no shared walls for me. I go for walks with my foster dog brother Bruno, and we love it. My foster parents say I need slow intros to dogs, because I get too excited and don't take cues when other dogs are not wanting to play. For this reason, I am not a dog park dog and would do great as an only dog so I can get all of the attention. I am NOT good with cats as I have a high prey drive. I would do best without small animals because of my prey drive. I have a lot of energy, so I would love a fenced in yard to run around and play fetch. My foster parents have a 5ft. fence, but I have never tried to jump it or escape. If you're looking for a big, sweet boy and adventure or exercise buddy, please apply so we can meet and I can go to my furever home!\n\nInterested in adopting this lovable animal? Please go to our website www.wagsmn.org and fill out an Adoption Application. Once the application is processed, a Wags representative will contact you, answer any questions you may have, and set up a time/location for a meet and greet! A home visit is required prior to adoption.\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt!\n\nBreed and temperament determination: Wags & Whiskers Animal Rescue attempts to determine breed and temperament using a combination of looks, information provided to us at intake, and our experience with the animal while in our Rescue. We do not guarantee this determination.",

His person could not have a dog like him where she lives. She was informed of this after having Cooper for over a year. Cooper is a short and squishy pit bull type guy. He is stocky and compact. Cooper has a delightful and happy personality and is always ready for action and fun. He has been neutered and chipped but we will get him vet checked before adoption. His fee is $125.\n\nCooper is looking for either an adult only home or one with kids over 10. He does need a little basic obedience training but is pretty in tune to his person and is eager to please. Cooper does need to be the only dog in the home. We're erring on the side of caution regarding cats.\n\nNOTE: We are closed to the public but are doing adoptions via private appointment once an application has been submitted and approved. Applications can be submitted right at our website, mchs.rescuegroups.org.\n\nWe are located at 101 22nd St. SE in Austin, right next to the airport. It's exit 180B off of I-90, right off of 218 South.\n\nWe do require that potential adopters be at least 21 years old and that any resident dogs be up to date on vaccinations, heartworm testing/preventative, and spayed or neutered.",

We expect his adopters to continue to train him using positive reinforcement. \n\nIf you are looking for new a best friend with spunky puppy energy and lots of tricks to learn, Nash is your boy!",

I will be depending on your voice quite a bit in the first few days that im with you. I will follow it to learn my surroundings, and once I know them I do quite well getting around on my own. I will also depend on your voice to let me know how to feel until I get used to noises. If I hear something unfamiliar, I might bark, so your calm, reassuring voice will help me to know everything is okay. I get along with dogs who are my size or larger, but the smaller ones, well, I happen to think they are toys. This also means I might not get along with cats since they are smaller than me, although I've not been around any in my foster home. I prefer to eat by myself since I can't tell if someone will try to steal my food, and I really like my food. I don't have any kids in my foster home either, but I bet older kids who are calm and quiet would be okay for me to live with. I'm a really good girl about going potty outside, and I even know how to use a doggy door if you have one! I'm a pretty laid back lady and will be more than happy to snuggle up on my blanket next to you for a movie night. You watch, I'll listen. If you'd rather read a book, I'm happy to take a nap next to you. I sure 'hope' my new family finds me soon so we can start our forevers together! \n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $275.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

He is very smart, eager to please and also learn new things. His food motivation is to his handlers advantage, adding encouragement to learning new tricks and mannerisms. He loves to go for walks and adventures. He has lived with other dogs before. With an experienced dog savvy owner, Lucky would likely thrive in a home with other dogs with appropriate and slow introductions. He would not do well in a home with cats, or small children due to his energy level. \n\nTo adopt Lucky, click below for an application \nhttps://www.thegratefuldogrescue.org/adopt-a-grateful-dog",

            "description": "Storm ACCT-A-81617\n\nBio: Storm enjoys hiking and running (even though she likes to stop for sniffs) she does well in car rides and is always excited to go on adventures. She gets excited (sometimes reactive) and pulls towards other dogs and cats on walks so might be best as an only pet. She is also jumpy with people and still working on her manners so potentially needs a home without small children.\n\nShe is house broken and sleeps in her crate. \n\nWe will work with trainers on anxiety and mouthiness so hopefully those behaviors will resolve soon! \n\nIntake Type: Stray\nSex: Female\nAltered: Yes\nAge: 3Y\n\nMedical Observation: (12/27) Normal, eyes red\n\nBehavior Observation:\n(12/28) Per Lifesaving -- Kennel Presentation - Nervous. Difficult to remove from kennel. Fearful and avoids leash. Would approach kennel door to sniff treats and my hand, but would not take treats and dodged leash. After many attempts she came to the kennel door for some ham and I was able to leash her. Walking through the kennels she is fearful and zigzags a bit. On return, she entered the kennel easily and let me remove the leash.\nLeash Skills - Pulls Minimally On Leash.\nHandleability - Loose/Allows all handling. Initially after removing her from the kennel Storm was nervous and tense with ears back and tail tucked. We placed her in the foster office and after she sniffed the perimeter of the room she relaxed and had her ears perked and tail wagging, and would approach us to solicit attention, get pets and give kisses. Allows pets all over.\nTag - No interest. Toys - No interest. Evaluated Gold - just needs high value treats to encourage her to exit kennel.\n(12/27) Per Vet Staff -- Fearful; QAR\n(12/27) Per Finder -- calm and loving with people but aggressive with dogs (nipped at another dog), does not like other dogs, good on leash - does not pull.\n\nThis animal is currently available from foster care through ACCT Philly's Adoptions Programs. This animal is not onsite. If the foster has not listed a personal email, contact foster@acctphilly.org to be put in touch with the foster. \n\nWe encourage you to visit our shelter during our adoption hours to view our complete selection of available animals. In preparation for your visit, please make sure to visit http://www.acctphilly.org/adopt/ to review our adoption requirements, hours of operation, upcoming events, and more! \n\nIs this your missing pet? If you believe so, please make sure to follow the instructions listed at http://www.acctphilly.org/lostpet/ so that we can make sure that you are reunited as soon as possible!",

            "description": "This is Belle. She is a very sweet girl who has lots of energy as a nine month old puppy would.  She and my golden play and wrestle out in the back yard.  He is 13 so he gets worn out much faster than she does.  He lets her know when he has had enough.  She also gets along with my 9 year old 9 lb little terrier mix  as well.    \n\n \nShe loves her toys.  Anything with stuffing though will be dead in about 5 seconds but toys with no stuffing have worked much better.  She loves to chase a ball. We have glow in the dark ones for nighttime.   She also loves her flat duck that looks like a frisbee.  A good \u201ckong\u201d with the stuffings she loves and it keeps her busy in the crate.  Just the regular kong is about the right level for her.  Also a wobbler she likes too.  Very entertaining for her mind.    She doesn\u2019t mind sharing toys with my boys (dogs) but things that are much smellier like a bully stick or knuckle bone, not as well, but I have to separate my boys (dogs) when we get the good stuff out.    For a nine month old puppy she really has been so good.  Only two things have really been chewed on and no accidents in the house at all. \n\nShe is crate trained.  She is so so smart.  She can sit, shake (very close almost working on it still) , lay down, go get on her bed when asked.  I think with additional training she could do anything.   She walks pretty good on a leash.  We use a harness and with just a little practice and a warmer day I know without a doubt she would improve immediately. \n\nShe has not been scared of thunder or storms, but loud noises sometimes scare her.   She will improve over time once she is with her forever family.  She also loves looking out my front glass door and watching the world go by.  If she sees people and or dog or cat she will speak about it and let you know but nothing to crazy. \n\nShe can jump right high so a 6 ft privacy fence would be best for her.\n\nShe would love to be snuggled on the couch and in bed with you so she feels really safe and close to you.  She does become very interested in the TV as you can see in a few of the pics and also the fish tank. \n\n\u201cBelle\u201d  has LOTS OF LOVE  to give to a family.    She would do well with a family that is active and will take her walking and play with her. \n\nPlease let us know if you are interested in her.  Would love to talk to you more about her.  Look soon for more updates. \n\nAfter reading this pet's info, if you are still interested in adopting, please fill out the online adoption application found at www.realgooddogrescue.com \n\nThe ideal home for this Real Good Dog will have a secure fenced yard.  A solid history of excellent vet care for current or previous pets is required.  Preference will be given to applicants who have specific breed experience.  \n\nPlease visit www.realgooddogrescue.com to submit an electronic application if you are interested in adopting this or any other Real Good Dog.",

We can't believe someone didn't go to the pound to reclaim him!  He's so incredibly sweet and a great size at right around 50 pounds.  \n\nAlpine seems to like other dogs just fine.  He is good on a leash and would love to be your next partner for adventure!  Alpine isn't currently living in a foster home, so we are unsure of his level of housetraining.  \n\nAlpine is very outgoing and just a sweetie!  He certainly deserves a home, and soon!\n\n\nAlpine's adoption fee is $450 which includes his neuter, current vaccinations, negative heartworm test, registered microchip, and transport costs.\n\nHe is available through Paw Pals of Hale Center in Hale Center, TX through Project Freedom Ride. He would be transported on one of the PFR transports (next transport is Mar 4) to either Seattle, WA, Mt Vernon, WA, or Portland, OR.  For more information on how a Direct Adoption with Project Freedom Ride works or to meet this guy via video call, email pawpalshc@gmail.com.\n\n\n\nAs a Project Freedom Ride direct adoption, the adoption interview/meet and greet would take place on video call (FB Messenger Call, Whats App, or Google Duo). The adoption application and fee would be finalized prior to transport.\n\nAdoption application can be accessed at the link below.\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/83483621192155\n\n\nCheck out Project Freedom Ride and see what this amazing group is all about!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ProjectFreedomRide/\n\nhttp://projectfreedomride.org/\n\n\n",

We can't believe someone didn't go to the pound to reclaim him!  He's so incredibly sweet and a great size at right around 50 pounds.  \n\nAlpine seems to like other dogs just fine.  He is good on a leash and would love to be your next partner for adventure!  Alpine isn't currently living in a foster home, so we are unsure of his level of housetraining.  \n\nAlpine is very outgoing and just a sweetie!  He certainly deserves a home, and soon!\n\n\nAlpine's adoption fee is $450 which includes his neuter, current vaccinations, negative heartworm test, registered microchip, and transport costs.\n\nHe is available through Paw Pals of Hale Center in Hale Center, TX through Project Freedom Ride. He would be transported on one of the PFR transports (next transport is March 4) to either Seattle, WA, Mt Vernon, WA, or Portland, OR.  For more information on how a Direct Adoption with Project Freedom Ride works or to meet this guy via video call, email pawpalshc@gmail.com.\n\n\n\nAs a Project Freedom Ride direct adoption, the adoption interview/meet and greet would take place on video call (FB Messenger Call, Whats App, or Google Duo). The adoption application and fee would be finalized prior to transport.\n\nAdoption application can be accessed at the link below.\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/83483621192155\n\n\nCheck out Project Freedom Ride and see what this amazing group is all about!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ProjectFreedomRide/\n\nhttp://projectfreedomride.org/\n\n\n",

Though good natured, he is stubborn and strong and will benefit from training. He already knows \"sit\", \"shake\", and \"play dead\" (which he learned at the shelter!). Harlan LOVES to be petted, it is very calming for him. He would do best with an experienced dog owner.\n\nAll adoptions are by appointment only. If you are interested in a meeting or adoption, please request an application via a Petfinder inquiry. An application will be emailed to you to complete and return. After that, an officer will contact you.  \n\nAll adoptions are $10. There is a $50 spay/neuter deposit for dogs, which is fully refundable upon proof of spay/neuter. Spaying/neutering of shelter animals is required by California law; it is not optional. In California, dogs are required to have current rabies vaccinations and must be licensed in their county of residence.\n",

She tends to be a bit bossy but loves to be with other dogs. Zara enjoys the company of other dogs but can play independently at times. She finds leaves fascinating and enjoys a good tug of war match. Zara has a major case of the zoomies when she is outside and loves to chase leaves. She is crate training overnight and when no one is home. Potty training is going well but not perfect. We highly recommend a companion dog is Zara's forever home. She will not do well with children under he age of 10. A fenced yard is required. She is available for adoption Jan 15th. Applications online at ruffredemption.org.\nVisit ruffredemption.org to complete an application. All Ruff Redemption Dogs are spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. They also receive a minimum of two distemper/parvo vaccines, medication for the treatment and prevention of intestinal worms, and monthly heart worm/flea prevention while in our care. Rabies vaccines are given if the dog is 16 weeks of age or older.",

I came to Mostly Mutts from animal control and they could tell I had puppies in the past, but I\u2019ve now been spayed \u2013 putting my puppy raising days behind me.  Now, I am ready to become a loved family member. I\u2019m currently in the prison foster/training program offsite and learning so much! \n\n\u2022 OTHER DOGS/CATS/KIDS:  Let\u2019s meet. I came in with another dog and I play well with two of the other Mutts in the prison program, but I can play vocally at times which not all dogs like.  I also met a couple of dogs in my short break foster home and \u2013 while we played well together outside, I tried to dominate them when we were inside. If you have a dog let\u2019s meet to make sure we can be friends. / Cats unknown / I\u2019ve met some kids while at Mostly Mutts (age 10+), so children around that age or older may be nice in my new home and \u2013 of course, let\u2019s meet!  I was not fond of kids riding bikes in the parking lot near me, just so you are aware of that.\n\n\u2022 PERSONALITY/ENERGY LEVEL:  I am a very sweet, energetic, and playful young girl with lots of love to offer my new family.  I have a fun, friendly and confident demeanor, which is sure to make for some great memories in my new home. I am also very social and am happiest when spending time with my people and being very active with them. I\u2019m curious and interested in everything! / My energy level is 7-9, so I am looking for a family that wants to include their dog in on all the fun and exercise with them.\n\n\u2022 SKILLS/CRATE/POTTY: As a student in the Mostly Mutts University training program, I\u2019ve proven to be smart and very trainable, and I\u2019ve quickly learned the following commands: \u2018sit\u2019, \u2018down\u2019, \u2018stay\u2019, \u2018come\u2019, \u2018drop it\u2019, and \u2018leave it\u2019 as well as proper door etiquette and accepting friendly stranger without jumping. I bet you can teach me even more \u2013 including polishing my leash skills, as I tend to jump, pull, and lunge at cars while on my leash right now, so please keep a good hold / I don\u2019t love the crate, but I don\u2019t make a fuss once I am in it.  I\u2019d just rather be with you / My potty manners have been good on the prison program schedule.\n\n\u2022 LIKES/DISLIKES:  I love to play - especially with my people. I can become mouthy during playtime due to my enthusiasm, but I\u2019m working on this with my trainer. I also love treats so my continued training should be lots of fun.  In the short break foster home I visited, I really loved running around in the fenced back yard while they looked on and spent time with me outside / Sudden noises startle me and \u2013 aside from the issue with some other dogs and bike riders mentioned above, I can\u2019t think of any other dislikes right now, though I am sure I would not be happy if I did not get the love, exercise, training and attention on which I thrive!     \n\n\u2022 MEDICAL:   I'm current on vaccinations, micro-chipped and spayed.\n\nI am looking for an active family to have lots of adventures with and who will love me furever!  My adoption fee is $299.00, and I\u2019m located in Kennesaw, Ga.",

Though he spent over 500 days in a southern shelter being constantly over looked, in a few months he has acclimated to home life. He is house broken, crate trained, and loves being apart of his foster mom's daily routine. He's a big fan of snuggling in laps and in laundry baskets. He loves his toys, is especially a fan of de-stuffing stuffy toys on his free time and chewing bones to keep his teeths nice and clean! \nThor is a big fan of walks and adventures whose ideal home would be one where he can enjoy both being included on jogs, walks, and adventures, as well as any snuggling opportunities he can get with his human. His ideal human would be willing to continue working on his training so he can be successful in his forever home. Thor has proved to be one of the most loyal and bestest boys we have met! Please consider him for your forever pet!\n\nTo adopt, click the link below for an application\nhttps://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/TGD/Dog\n",

She\u2019s 2 years old and weighs 55 lbs. \n\nZoey was an owner surrender to Pasco County Animal Services and we took her in because she was terrified, thin and missing hair due to fleas. Sudden movements, raised voices, loud noises all seemed to frighten her. While in our home for the past 5 weeks she\u2019s made an amazing improvement, she is no longer fearful. We have shown her love and understanding during her transition. She knows she\u2019s safe with us. She has steadily gained weight and all her hair has grown in. She\u2019s gorgeous. \n\nWe are looking for an adopter who will show her the same love and understanding that we have. They will need to go slow and have patience. She is a bit fearful of men. \nOnce Zoey is comfortable she\u2019s a total love bug and big lap dog. \n\nAn active family would suit her best. She would make an excellent partner to jog, bike or hike with. She really enjoys the outdoors. \n\nRequirements for adopting Zoey:\n- Must have at least 1 other playful dog; she\u2019s great with both large and small dogs\n- No cats\n- Kids 10+ (she will not hurt a small child, she is afraid of them. Visiting small children are ok)\n- A fenced yard is preferred. \n-Must work from home, be retired or work only part time; Zoey does not like to be alone. \n\nShe is spayed, microchipped and current on vaccinations. \n\n*Potential adopters must live no further than an hour of Wesley Chapel*\n\n*We accept email inquiries only* \n",

            "description": "No seriously, adopt the smartest, most agile, and faithful malinois. Working dog experience is a must in order to be considered for this guy. He will require daily exercise and mental stimulation or he will find himself in the dog house (don't worry taster we don't judge). Taster has come along way since he came to us as a true \"maligator\", with no off switch. Taster will require an experienced home that sets boundaries . Even though taster is in a foster home with young children, we recommend older kids as he may knock over the younger ones and when excited sometimes gets a little mouthy (not in a mean way but playful and has been working really hard on not doing so since we took him in). He does well with dogs of all sizes(his foster home has dogs ranging from one pound up to fifty pounds) but may be too much for smaller dogs as he loves to play and doesn't realize his size. He does well with horses and doesn't bother with them as long as his person is with him. His foster has crate trained him and he does amazing, doesn't have any accidents and no jail breaks. He has slept out of the crate and done well too. He's working on and doing well on a leash. He's learned sit, drop it, lay down, and roll over. He's currently working on the stay command and his recall is perfect. Taster loves the water and you will often find him in the smallest of puddles if he can find them. He's a faithful dog who loves his people and he's attached himself to the nine year old little girl in his foster home and is her constant shadow. He's picked up on new tricks within minutes of learning them. Hes ben introduce to some agility and would excel in it. He's a special dog that will continue to do and be amazing in the right home. If taster joins your family, you'll see just what a special gift you've received with him.\n\nOur dog adoption fees range from $150-$240 depending on the dog's age, and our cat fees range from $45-120. They are all spayed/neutered, microchipped with lifetime registration, and have received age appropriate vaccines. If you would like to meet one of our pets, please do the online application at\nhttps://www.petstablished.com/adoption_form/12113/generic\nYou only need to do it once for our organization, regardless of how many of our dogs you are interested in.",

Impounded at the shelter, Rollo got wind of our organization and used his one allotted call to ask if we'd come down and spring him. One look at his mug shot and we were there in a heartbeat; already in love with that face. On the ride over, he let us know that he has some physical ailments: cataracts (causing some sight impairment), some hearing impairment and a heart murmur. We didn't care. As far as we're concerned, he's perfect! Although shy when he first arrived, it didn't take him long to come out of his shell; or map out his new digs. He even met a couple of ladies who he's become quite fond of; oftentimes sharing the comfiest bed in the suite for an afternoon snuggle. And it's not just his canine pals he likes socializing with; he's beginning to really enjoy being around humans, too. Still not 100% sure of how to courageously ask for affection, he's getting there. We don't think he'd be one for long, romantic walks on the beach, but he does appreciate time outdoors for a breath of fresh air. Despite being in his golden years, Rollo still has plenty of life and love to give. We hope you'll consider our beloved friend as your next forever companion.",

Adopted by her family with her best friend (who was quickly returned to the shelter), she was given up by her family because they couldn't care for her any longer. A sad situation, but we consider ourselves pretty lucky to have her in our lives. She's about as perfect as can be. Although she doesn't change her wigs and apparel as often as her namesake from \"\"Schitt's Creek\"\", she definitely shares the spunk and personality! Every time you look at that adorable face, there's a smile hanging around it. She is always happy to see you; waddling her way into your space with an ever-present, happy tail. She can be apprehensive of being picked up at times, but will never turn down the opportunity to receive your swoons, coos and affection. Moira is kind to her canine friends, but really cares more about the humans. She will do just about anything to be the center of your attention. Lovingly referred to as the \"\"baby hamster\"\" by staff, this beautiful senior still has lots of life and love to give. She'd be the most loyal companion you could ever ask for. Won't you please consider Moira for your next forever friend?",

He is a friendly boy who loves attention and loves to play and play. He has pretty simple needs for his new forever home and that is for someone who wants to go on nice long walks/hikes or whatever and someone who wants to play with him. He is currently still in that \"\"teenager\"\" stage and loves to just be goofy but still has a wonderful personality to match. He is house trained and crate trained and walks well on a leash. Other dogs are fun he loves to play with a proper meeting of course, but not sure about kitties. We do suggest any kids to be older then 10 in the home due to his energy. He is ready to be someone's sidekick and motivator, he will motivate you to get out and get your daily exercise done. And then just chill with a nice bone or toy to play with is his style. If you think you can give this energizer bunny youngster a wonderful forever home, an online application can be found at SandiPaws.org\nThank you for your interest in a Sandi Paws Rescue, Inc. Please visit our site at sandipaws.org for more information on our organization or to fill out an application to adopt one of our pets.

            "description": "Leyton is currently enjoying the life of a foster dog, and according to her foster parents, Leyton might just be the world's sweetest pittie! She is a total snuggle bug with a very gentle and even-keeled temperament. Like the classic Staffy, Leyton is extremely obedient, loyal, and eager to please. She loves to cuddle up on the couch and give you sweet kisses. She is content to nap quietly all day while her foster mom works in another part of the house. Leyton loves going on walks and weekend hikes too. Since she just came from a home, she is 100% housebroken, crate trained, and knows her basic commands like sit, shake, and stay. We originally pulled her from a shelter in Riverside County in late December 2016. She was adopted a little over a week later, but recently returned to us December 2020, nearly 4 years later. Her previous home consisted of another dog, a cat, and 5 children. Leyton grew protective of her family and domain, so when the kids would leave the doors and gates open, she would get out and go after neighborhood dogs. Leyton can and has been good with other dogs when properly introduced inside her home. She is not suitable for off-leash environments like the dog park or dog beach. She is great with cats, kids, and adults alike. She can be a little timid upon first meeting new people, but she warms up quickly. She is looking for a secure home with tall fences and old enough humans who can follow instructions on how to keep doors closed at all times. Leyton is 5 years old and weighs 53 pounds. If you think you might be the right home for Leyton, please apply!\n\nIn the meantime, you can learn more about Leyton and follow her daily foster adventures on Instagram at @theserialfoster!To initiate the adoption process for this dog, please complete our online application by clicking below. Your adoption coordinator will respod to you via email once they receive your application: www.thebarkinglot.net/adopt",

            "description": "Available Wednesday, January 20th at 7pm on our Adoptions Uncrated website. \nhttps://www.followyourheartanimalrescue.org/shop\nDezi is a sweet and energetic girl. She gets pretty excited so would be better in a home with older children that she isn't going to knock over. She needs a home without livestock (chickens, pigs, etc) or cats as they are too much fun to chase.\n\nDezi and her pups joined the rescue when her pups were about 5 weeks old. Little is known about her prior life as it was very late on a Sunday evening when she was dropped off with her pups. \nShe is a large girl, possibly lab/shepherd blend and her ideal weight is somewhere between 60-65lbs when filled out. \n\nDuring her time with the rescue we learned that she is quite the puppy herself in age and manners. Dezi does want to please but can be impulsive.....such as in attempting to swipe a snack right out of your hand, jumping up to give a face to face kiss etc. she is very friendly and loves all humans but might be knock over small children. Dezi has a pretty high prey drive and thinks livestock would be better snacks than roommates. Dezi does good with cats but due to her drive would say constant supervision would be necessary. Dezi can be quite rough during play and while she gets along with other dogs her exuberance for life could be very annoying to the wrong dog so if considering adopting as companion to another dog intros would be necessary.",

Please send an inquiry via this Petfinder link Or...to learn more about the NMDOG Adoption Program, please visit this link on our website - www.nmdog.org/adopt \n\nROO is 5 yrs old & he is a verrry good boy! He is wiggly, he is squiggly, he is goofy & fun!! But that comes after he warms up to you a little bit, not right at first. Placement with a female dog would be considered based on human experience & resident dog temperament. Ideally....we are seeking a home for CAPTAIN KANGAROO where he can be the only Doggie kid, continue confidence boosting & enrichment activities...as he explores his brand new world ? We expect ROO & his peeps to be awesome & responsible Breed Ambassadors. Cats are unknown & we ask that children be 10+! \n____________________________________________\n\nAs an all volunteer, foster based, 501(c)3 non profit rescue, NMDOG is always in need of new, approved foster & adoptive homes in order to continue our Mission: to serve & protect New Mexico's Forgotten Dogs!! #UNchained\n\nIf you see a dog you are interested in that says \"in need of a foster home\", we are currently seeking a temporary foster home for that dog in order to provide them with the cozy & loving experience of a home environment while we work hard to find their forever family. This also frees up space & funds, which enables us to save another life. There is never a cost to foster for NMDOG & you will have the dedicated support of the NMDOG TEAM every step of the way. We take the time to really get to know the needs & personalities of our kids & we go the extra mile to ensure we make the best possible match...setting our dogs & their humans up for success!

When a dog enters the NMDOG program, they are guaranteed to receive the very best of care. All of our available dogs have received a full medical & behavioral clearance prior to placement. They are (at the very minimum) spayed or neutered, UTD on age appropriate vaccinations, microchipped, dewormed, Heartworm tested & currently on HW/flea & tick preventative. Due to the nature of our work, many of the dogs we rescue need much more extensive care before they are cleared for adoption.

He is a TriPawd Wooly Husky with considerations in place for the best interest of the health & longevity of his 3 remaining legs...as well as his \"King of the World\" bigger than life, adorable, FloofFace personality. \n\n- ROADIE will need a home with a majority of carpet in the house & grass in the yard. He has no problem with stairs as with a secure/carpeted place to \"land\". \n- ROADIE will do best as the only dog in the home. No cats, pocket pets or birds & we ask that any children be 10+. \n- ROADIE needs a 5ft min fence or wall to keep him safe. \n- No dog parks for ROADIE. \n\nNone of these considerations will keep ROADIE from finding a home....they will ensure that ROADIE finds the right home :) Being a Tripawd doesnt keep ROADIE from going on hikes, doing zoomies in the yard or playing on his long line with at the (dog friendly, human) parks. ROADIE is ready to find his special FoReVeR Family!! \n\nHe is super duper snuggly, soft & he sings the beautiful songs of his people....WooWoo ArhooRooooo WooWooWoo!! ROADIE rides great in the car & he LoooVes going on daytrips, weekendenders & overnights, or long road trip adventures. He is housetrained, cratetrained & walks well on his leash + harness (except when he sees a chipmunk, a roadrunner or a bunny rabbit - then all you can do is hold on & you have to!) Sometimes ROADIE likes to play chase, ruffhouse, use his best friend as a chew toy & wrestle \"Rawr Rawr Rawr\"! But if you're a Husky person, you get this & no explanation is needed :)\nROADIE is a truly amazing Husky companion. \n____________________________________________\n\nAs an all volunteer, foster based, 501(c)3 non profit rescue, NMDOG is always in need of new, approved foster & adoptive homes in order to continue our Mission: to serve & protect New Mexico's Forgotten Dogs!! #UNchained\n\nIf you see a dog you are interested in that says \"in need of a foster home\", we are currently seeking a temporary foster home for that dog in order to provide them with the cozy & loving experience of a home environment while we work hard to find their forever family. This also frees up space & funds, which enables us to save another life. There is never a cost to foster for NMDOG & you will have the dedicated support of the NMDOG TEAM every step of the way. We take the time to really get to know the needs & personalities of our kids & we go the extra mile to ensure we make the best possible match...setting our dogs & their humans up for success! To learn more about the NMDOG Foster Program, please visit this link on our website - www.nmdog.org/foster\n\nOur adoption fee is $250 which includes; a 7 week NMDOG obedience/bonding class with your new Dog (classes are located in Abq & are also offered to our Foster Guardians at no charge), a complimentary vet wellness check & our dogs come with all of the supplies they need to get started on a trial adoption in their new home. All adopted dogs also receive free or discounted goodies & services from many of our awesome community partners!! Grooming, food, training, boarding, pet sitting & more.\n\nNMDOG doesn't cut any corners when it comes to the care & placement of our dogs. When a dog enters the NMDOG program, they are guaranteed to receive the very best of care. All of our available dogs have received a full medical & behavioral clearance prior to placement. They are (at the very minimum) spayed or neutered, UTD on age appropriate vaccinations, microchipped, dewormed, Heartworm tested & currently on HW/flea & tick preventative. Due to the nature of our work, many of the dogs we rescue need much more extensive care before they are cleared for adoption. At NMDOG, we stand by our dogs for life & we make a promise to always be there for them (& their people) should they ever need us. .\n\nPlease contact us with your interest in becoming a treasured NMDOG Foster Guardian or FoReVeR Guardian Angel to one of our amazing dogs in need! Direct email contact for applications ~ TiffanyN@nmdog.org\nWe look forward to hearing from you & answering any questions you may have. WooF!!\n",

She likes walks and knows how to run on a leash properly! She will match your energy, and when she wants to go out, but you haven't noticed, you'll be wooed outside with Chewbacca noises. She has weaned her puppies and is ready to move on with her life! We are not sure how she'll get along with other dogs. She can be rambunctious when playing, so a large dog playmate would be more her style. She's not a fan of those felines, but she is learning 'leave it' when the neighbor's outdoor kitties wander by to tease her. She jumps up to greet her humans, so kids older than 5 or 6 would be ideal. She is house-trained, and doing well on her crate-training. Her best life would be an active home, and a couch to veg out on. If you are looking for a really chill pup with a lot of snuggles to give, who is great on leash for jogs, come meet Twilight. She's ready for some love after being a wonderful patient mama to nine puppies!",

He has learned to walk well on leash, he knows all of his basic commands, he will wait until instructed to eat, and will stay seated before leaving for his walks. He prefers to stay away from other pups on his leash walks. He is also a very quiet pup and will only bark when he's having a silly dream! This sweet, affectionate, and loving guy wants to be with his person more than anything else. He prefers to sleep most of the day, doesn't like toys or games, mostly he just wants to chill and live the good life of retirement. Viper would do well in a home where he is the only pup as he really only likes to socialize with other dogs for a few minutes. He would also thrive in a home that can provide him lots of love and attention. Viper will take time to warm up in a new home, and would love a patient human who is experienced at working with anxious pups and larger breeds. He would ideally love a home with a yard where he can stretch his legs and get his exercise running around in the yard. Come meet this sweet boy, he's waiting for his loving furever home!",

Bear does need to gain a little more weight, but otherwise he is doing very well.\nDog Friendly: Yes, is very playful with others\nCat friendly: Unknown\nKid friendly: Yes, he might knock over smaller children with his rambunctiousness.\n\nPotty trained: Yes, he does have access to a doggy door.\nLeash trained: Needs work on walking on a leash, he pulls. A martingale collar would work well for Bear.\nKennel trained: Bear has not messed in his kennel even once. We had an unexpected long period of time away and he still held it.\n\nEnergy Level: At first, he is hesitant but after he feels comfortable his energy level gets more puppyish and some unpredictable moves (he will catch you off guard with mouthing, pawing with his front paws).\n\nBIOGRAPHY: Bear was a stray in Oklahoma and had been in a shelter there for several months with no interest from anyone. He was put on the euthanasia list and that is when we brought him into our rescue to save his life.\n\nBehavioral Issues: Bear barks some when he gets excited. He will also jump up on you.\n\nMedical Issues: None Known.\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\nLocation: Pratt, KS\nPlease apply to adopt at www.tinyurl.com/adopthaa",

She LOVES people and gets very excited when meeting new friends. She is working on leash training and can walk well when she is calm. She loves to run and is bouncy and playful but she has also been the perfect work from home companion who is content just snuggling up next to you.\n\nShay may get along with other dogs, having lived with one, but introductions should be made slowly. Shay is a firm NO for cats and has never lived with kids, but after a short stay in a home with a toddler, we know that Shay gets nervous around young kids. She will need to be in a home with maybe teen-aged children or adults only. Shay would do best in a home with a yard & plenty of room for her to play. A fence would be required because she will not know to return when called right away. Shay will need a patient family that understands she will need time to adjust to house manners, but he is super intelligent and a quick learner!\n\nApply to adopt SHAY LONESTAR at www.EHRDOGS.org!",

            "description": "Animal Profile: Zeke is a gorgeous sable German Shepherd that is looking for a home that has experience with Shepherds. He was purchased from a breeder at 6 weeks old, and was mostly an outdoor dog that didn't get much in the way of obedience training. He knows basic commands like 'sit' and 'down', and is house and crate trained. Zeke is playful and affectionate and wants to be with his people. He loves carrying around toys in the house, and will even carry them on his walk. His leash manners are a work in progress, and he will need a confident handler to continue his training as he is strong and motivated. Zeke can be leash reactive and dog selective. He has lived with other dogs in the past but his ideal home would have no other pets. Due to his size, strength, and tendency to jump and mouth when he is playing, we will not be considering homes with young children. Zeke loves to play fetch and tug, is crate trained, house trained and has good manners inside. Zeke would excel in a home that was interested in dog sports like rally, nosework, barnhunt or agility. Zeke is up for any adventure but also had an off switch and can hang out at home. He requires a securely fenced yard. We will not be considering first time dog owners for Zeke.\n\nSeattle Foster Update: Coming Soon!\n\nAdoption Info:\nAdoption fee is $400 which includes spay/neuter, all core vaccinations, microchip, heartworm test and health certificate.

He is such a shy guy that he really needs to live with another dog, it helps give him the confidence boost he needs and really shows him what being a dog is all about! Milo needs a quiet home, one with minimal visitors as he is just so frightened by the world. He needs an experienced owner and confident handler who can help him navigate stressful social situations and who knows when to give him his space. Because he is so nervous, he would do best in an adult only home. Milo walks well on the leash and rides nicely in the car. He loves to go on walks at the park with his kennel friends.

            "description": "Kylo was originally rescued from a crowded Texas shelter with a broken jaw that he'd received from blunt force trauma and a skin condition that left him looking pitiful. Life became infinitely better for Kylo when he was rescued came to New Jersey, where he was adopted a short time later, but sadly had to be returned to because the family found that they just could not give him the time, training, and attention he required. When alone, he developed some destructive behaviors that we are working on correcting. He is a chewer--he needs lots of chew toys to keep him on the right track. He also needs a confident handler, an owner with experience in dog ownership and training. Because of his rough start, Kylo gets nervous very easily in social situations and that can display itself in more aggressive ways. Having an established, confident adult dog in the house will help with this, but that dog would also have to be okay with Kylo's sometimes rough play.\n\nKylo is a very energetic pup, who plays hard and loves harder! Even though he has actually become fairly large at almost 50lbs, he still thinks he's a lap puppy and will spend all day in your lap if you let him. Because of his nervousness, combined with his energy, size, and strength, Kylo needs to be in a home without children, where there will be very low traffic levels from visitors. Kylo needs an adopter that is very active but also around for him - he does have some nervousness when left alone, and can get into mischief if not monitored. He would do best with owners who work from home and can take breaks to exercise him. He knows to go to the door when he needs to go potty, but he still has occasional accidents and needs to be walked regularly. He also needs an outlet for all of his energy and excitement, so a fenced yard would be preferred.\n\nKylo is very food motivated and will do pretty much anything you ask of him if a treat is involved. He also loves to ride in the car.\n\nApply to adopt KYLO LONESTAR at www.EHRDOGS.org!",

            "description": "Dakota is a 1.5 year old Australian Shepherd/Foxhound mix (DNA test) although we know he doesn't look it! He is also mixed with several other breeds. He was adopted as a puppy but recently had to come back to Eleventh Hour to find his new forever home.\n\nDakota is a very smart boy who learns easily. He knows lots of commands: Sit, stay, paw, lay down, roll over, drop it, leave it (if fixated on something while on a walk). When being fed his meals if you tell him \"Sit/Stay\", then put his food bowl on ground, he will wait until you tell him \"go ahead or OK\" then will eat his food. He can be a very good boy.\n\nDakota was very under socialized as a pup so he is afraid of new people. He definitely prefers women over men, but he can warm up to men fairly quickly as well, and he cannot be in a home with children. Dakota needs a slow introduction to new people as he is very scared. He is the SWEETEST boy ever once he is comfortable with you - kisses, hugs, everything. Dakota is dog friendly and would actually benefit from having another dog in the home with him, but it must be a very confident dog.\n\nIf you think you could provide Dakota with the loving home he deserves, please fill out an application at www.ehrdogs.org & be sure to mention his name!",

            "description": "Kubo was found as a stray by a rural animal control facility in Texas, and no owners were ever located. Kubo came to EHR and was adopted out but recently returned because Kubo needed a quieter environment. He suffers from a bit of anxiety at times so his ideal home will be low traffic, relaxing, and not fast paced. Although Kubo is good with kids, we recommend he be placed with older kids if any. He is a shy guy at first but warms up quickly. He can be dog selective so we think if he were to have any doggie siblings, it should be of a submissive personality. With his size and energy, he would do best with medium to larger dogs so he does not accidentally hurt them. Kubo is not good with cats, but he snuggles better then them anyway!\n\nIf you are interested in Kubo, visit EHRDOGS.ORG and fill out an application for KUBO",

AFTER HE HAD HIS INITIAL CHECK UP HE WENT TO HIS FIRST VET VISIT. THERE THE VET TOLD US HE HAS GLAUCOMA. HIS FEAR IS PROBABLY DUE T LOSING HIS FAMILY AND DUE TO HIS CONDITION. WITH TREATMENT AND A LOVING HOME HE CAN LEARN TO BE CONFIDENT AND LIVE A LONG LIFE. HE MAY NEED MORE TREATMENT FOR HIS EYES LATER ON BUT CURRENTLY HE JUST NEEDS EYE DROPS AND A LOT OF LOVE.\n\nhttp://www.wagsandwhiskerspetrescue.com/adopt.html\n\nThank you so much for looking into wags and whiskers for your next family member.\n\nAll of our pets are up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, heartworm tested if over 6 months old and will be spayed or neutered before being allowed to go home.\n\nUnfortunately, we don't always know the background of each dog. Some were dumped, abandoned in an empty house, left tied to a tree, picked up by animal control as strays, or simply unwanted by their owners. We ask that only serious and committed adopters apply as these dogs have suffered enough.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet please apply to adopt at\nhttp://www.wagsandwhiskerspetrescue.com/adopt.html\nif the pet is still available for adoption and you are approved to adopt we will contact you to set up a meet and greet appointment.",

He carried his blankie or a toy around all the time because he just gets so excited around his friends. Alamo needs a quiet home, he is easily frightened. Alamo would do best in a home with only one or 2 people he can become close with and trust with his life. He does the absolute cutest thing when he sees his favorite people and makes adorable snorting sounds. Alamo is a real cuddle bug once he trusts you. Alamo isn't dog reactive but we recommend him being the only pet in the home just because of how easily he frightens. He shouldn't be placed with children, and needs someone who doesn't have a lot of visitors or activity inside their home.\n\nIf you think you are a good fit for Alamo, and want a buddy who will cuddle up with you at every chance he gets, fill out an application and don't forget to mention ALAMO LONESTAR!!!!!",

            "description": "Bruno Davis Lonestar was abandoned in the summer heat on a back country road in Texas. He's big goofy guy, always ready to play or crawl in your lap, and will become your shadow. He LOVES to play with his chew toys, squeaky toys, and can be kept busy with puzzle toys. Bruno is eager to please and would do very well with additional training.\n\nHe loves to play with other dogs but plays a little rough, so he needs a young, energetic dog(s) who is of equal size or bigger to clown around with or a very active family!\n\nHe is house-broken, crate-trained and harness-trained. He does very well on a leash and loves to go for walks. His weight is 68lbs and vet estimated his age around 2 yrs. He would do best in an adult home or one with teenaged or older children. If there is a fenced in yard, it needs to be at least six foot or he can go over.\n\nApply to adopt BRUNO DAVIS LONESTAR at EHRdogs.org!",

We will post more info as we get to know her. Due to her breed, Joy is looking for a home with a securely fenced yard. We will not be considering apartment homes for Joy.\n\nFoster Update:\nJoy is very endearing and loves to love. She is playful, and is happiest in the yard our out on the deck with us. She is good in her crate and does well with the resident dogs in the house and would do fine with another playful companion or as an only dog. Joy doesn't have much training, but we are working on the basics with her.\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $500, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, heartworm test. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue.\n\nApply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org\n\nAnimal History: This dog was transferred from our Texas rescue partner. This dog will be available for adoption in Seattle once evaluated.",

He would really enjoy joining a new home where he can get lots of attention and be your adventure buddy! Thor is a smart boy that already knows some commands, including \"sit,\" \"down,\" and \"shake\" along with the command of \"stay...no way!\" He does better with his commands if you have a high value treat in hand (not surprisingly!). He has lived with another dog and may enjoy another dog buddy in his new home, though will need to be watched around bones and antlers as he has shown some guarding tendencies. He is crate trained and does well at the vet office and with the groomers. True to his breed, he needs a lot of activity and secure containment (he has been known to try to get out of windows and doors). He loves car rides and is playful and active, so will make getting to adventures fun and easy! He also particularly enjoys Pupuccinos! Interested in sponsoring? See our sponsorship information.",

See our adoption proccess.\nOREO is a sweet cookie that is looking for - and really deserves - his forever home. This pup has been through a lot, coming into rescue with an injury, untreated bladder infection, and underweight after having been essentially rescued by a good Samaritan from a life living in a parking lot sleeping under cars. He is well on his way to a full recovery and this experience has not daunted his malamute spirit at all! He is adaptable and a big, strong malamute that would love to be part of a pack of his very own. He is friendly to people, curious, and already knows the command of \"sit.\" He does really well in cars, taking the opportunity to chill and even nap. He will need some help with his leash training, which is not surprising based on his history as he has likely not had a lot of experience. He enjoys attention and being pet and we are confident he will really enjoy learning about the finer things in life - like indoor snuggles and lots of adventures! Interested in sponsoring?

She\u2019ll climb on it and sleep for hours. Goldie is the momma that was attacked by another dog in Washington county along with her puppies. She had a terrible infection in her front leg that was so severe she couldn\u2019t even use it. After a week on strong antibiotics her leg healed good and she\u2019s feeling great. She\u2019s a sweet sweet girl. She\u2019s shy at first but quickly warms up. She hasn\u2019t shown any aggression to people just a little standoffish until she realizes you are ok. She does well with other dogs but can be a little intimidated at first so she needs slow intros. Once she\u2019s use to everyone she loves to play. She\u2019s not fond with cats. She did well with a 3 year old. She is she is house and crate trained. Doesn\u2019t seem to be a chewer. She is pretty mellow but will play. We were told she is a purebred black mouth cur . around 2 years old. She is utd, hw negative (tested below detectable levels) and spayed. \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter!\n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue.

            "description": "What can we say about Roger!? He is the most genuinely soft and sweet dog we have met in a long time. He takes a few days to warm up to his people, but when he does... ya'll its well worth the wait. He aims to please his people. \n\nRoger came to Friends of Faye after one of our members witnessed him being hit by a car. He suffered a broken pelvis, and a hip injury - but has been cleared by our veterinarian for adoption.\n\nHe may need FHO surgery in the future, a procedure in which we will cover all costs at our vet, \n\nWe hope someone will give our shy boy a chance at a forever home. He so deserves it,. \n\nA fenced yard is a must, as he is still a bit skittish of cars. We have been working on our leash skills, and have finally mastered walking down the road, although when cars come, he would prefer his person be a buffer between him and the vehicle, understandably, \n\nRoger loves his kennel and his personal time and would do great in a low key home. \n\nPlease consider our boy and submit an adoption application on our website\n\nwww.FriendsofFaye.com",

Marilyn has lived previously with a male GSD however she has shown to be reactive to new dogs in her foster home. She is currently working with one of our trainers on basic commands and has amazing potential! She is an affectionate girl that will cuddle and give kisses. Marilyn loves her toys and human attention, but doesn\u2019t necessarily want to share with another dog. She would love to be an only dog in her forever home where she can be the sole focus. If she were to be placed with another dog, it would need to be a submissive, non-reactive male and a family committed to managing resources. Marilyn does well in a crate and will put herself in there even when the door is open. She enjoys running with her ball and will require a fenced yard. This princess deserves a family to call her own! If interested in adopting Marilyn, apply at www.gsrescue1.org",

She can open flat handle doors.  She wants a loving home. It looks like she was chained and just spit out babies and we are so happy her past is now behind her. She will get a tummy tuck when she gets fixed next week. She's about 2 yrs old. Her name is Eve but I call her mamma Hound.  You can see a few more photos and a short video on our rescue FB page:https://www.facebook.com/talltailsrescue\n\nShe is currently in Fort Worth, TX but will making the trek to Olympia, WA scheduled to arrive on Saturday Jan 9th IF she is pre-adopted meaning you need to get your app in, approved and pay the adoption fee to secure her.

            "description": "All of our dogs are Spayed/Neutered, Micro-chipped, and up to date on shots before being released to adopters.The Willow situation: Willow has lived with a wonderful family for a couple of years now. She is still in need of a home who is ideal for her and her special needs but she has come a very very long way. She is deaf and has one eye, she has been through a lot of personal training, is also trained in hand signs and to use a stim collar (vibrate recall) etc.In the RIGHT situation with routine she mostly lays around all day, and is an easy bull dog 90%. She needs a home without other animals and while she absolutely loves kids, she is too strong for them at times. This may seem silly, but the problem is that while she is VERY tolerant of kids, she is also an extreme leg humper&#129318;&#127996;&#8205;&#9792;&#65039;.. yup! And sometimes she gets super excited and will grab onto a leg and scratch you up if you don't correct her and kiddos aren't strong enough to do this. She is very very strong. In a home with other animals she is very different- she has high drive and becomes neurotic and overstimulated and very difficult in a home with other animals. In the wrong home she can be difficult to manage so we are looking for the right situation now that we have her figured out. Crate trained, potty trained, great temperament.She thrives and requires a strong calm structure and leadership. She can be very submissive to her people but can also be pushy and dominant if you aren't managing her properly. It is hard to get her attention with her hearing special needs and loss of an eye, so her person needs to continue to work on her on e collar recall/ hand signals. She has already received lots of training. We want to ensure that her adoptive home will love and keep her for life.&#128062; Go to www.k9ppr.org to send us an adoption application and tell us all about you and the home you would give sweet Willow! #k9ppr loves their bulldogs! Opt to adopt!If you you are interested in meeting one of the dogs, please fill out an application from our website at www.K9PawPrintRescue.org. We are always in need of fosters and volunteers",

She also loves going for long walks.\n\n\n12/28/2020\nMeet Serenity! She is a mixed breed dog, possibly a Basenji mix.  She is listed as being 2 years old, but acts much younger.  Serenity is outgoing and friendly and loves children!  She is house trained and sleeps well all night in her room with her puppies, but sometimes wakes us up because she needs to go out.  We think this is due to her being so young.  She is good in the house and takes directions well. She is still working on a few manners, but is eager to please, and should learn quickly.  Serenity loves to cuddle on the couch and seems to love just being part of a family.  She is about 35-40lbs and will be up to date on vaccines by the time she is available on January 11th.\n\n\nTo Begin the adoption process please, fill out our online application. Go to WAGSRESCUE.COM and CLICK on adoption form.\nPlease call Susan @ 267-312-3372 or Colleen @ 267-238-7892 if you have questions\n",

She can be a little nervous at first when away from her person, but she will continue to be all tail wags, happy and social. She loves people! Dixie is great in the home, good about being in a crate, and understands basic commands well. While home, she is excited for people to come over and wants all of their attention, to pet and love on her. She is good around children too. \n\nDixie Mae is an active dog and loves to go for walks and hike. She would do best with an active person or active family.She does have some leash reactivity when she is out and about, so needs an adopter who is willing to work on her leash manners around other dogs. \n\nDixie is house trained and very well mannered in the home. She prefers to be the only dog in the home because she attaches very quickly to her person and wants them all to herself. She is extremely intelligent, a quick learner, and eager to please. \n\nWe will only consider a one dog household for Dixie, as we know she really prefers to be the only dog and we want to set her up for success. \n\nDixie came into our program when her family was moving across the country and could not take her along.",

            "description": "Alex is a good looking pup, estimated to be 12 months old in December and we\u2019re guessing him to be a Shepherd/Hound mix. He came to HART from a shelter in West Virginia where he was picked up as a stray. He is 15 inch tall at the shoulder, weighs 32 pounds, and has a muscular build. He was treated for worms, cleaned, got all his shots, and is doing well.  \n\nAlex is a very playful dog, loves to play, run, and wrestle with other dogs. He is also playful with people and would be good with children, although you\u2019d need to be careful with smaller children as he gets excited when meeting new people and may knock them over, but fine after initial meeting. He does chase cats.  He likes to explore new places, like the garage and basement, etc. He likes chasing balls and will play fetch. \n\nHe's very loving and confident dog that likes to cuddle on the couch in your lap after some playtime. We're not sure how long Alex was fending for himself in the wild, so some basic training is likely in order. He is crate trained. Working on house training and is doing well if left out often enough.\n\nHe does come well on command, stops most of the time on command,  and working on sit command. He is very food driven. He likes to run in the yard, so a fenced yard would be best for him. Initially he pulls some during walks, but he loves all the new sites and smells.  \n\nHe\u2019s a sweetie and would absolutely love a home to call his own!\n\nIf you would like to meet Alex, please go to our website at www.rescueahart.org and fill out an online adoption application.\n\n\nAll HART dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped and up to date on all vaccines, including bordatella and rabies.   They are heartworm tested and on preventative for heartworm, fleas, and ticks.   If you are interested in any of our pets, you must complete an online dog adoption application   at www.rescueAhart.org .   The application will put you in touch with this wonderful dog's foster family so you can schedule a meeting.   Thanks!   www.rescueAhart.org",

She's a bit itchy at times, but certainly doesn't act too bothered by her condition! Lucille Bald LOVES toys. She wasted no time galloping into her foster home and taking every single one of her new toys out of the basket, and is working on trying to figure out how to play with them all at once. Lucille is extremely friendly, wiggling up to anyone she meets, excited to make a new friend. She's said to lived comfortably in a past home with a cat and younger children, but we'll be taking some more time to get to know her and determine a maintenance plan to keep her lovely fur on her body.",

Our staff says she's very sweet and loves people. She's about 2 years old, and her coat is black with white markings. She walks well on her leash, and she has alert \"radar ears\" that won't miss a thing. Those ears have been getting a workout because whenever she hears young dogs here at the shelter, she thinks they might be her puppies. We'd love for her to find her new home and family so she can devote her full attention (and affection) to you! Her mom-dog days are over because she'll come to you spayed, microchipped and up to date on her shots. Please come see our sweet Momma!",

His favorite thing is fetch, except you don't get the ball back until he enthusiastically shakes it to make sure it's not a threat to humans (you're welcome). Elton is also the very best snuggler, insisting on putting his squishy face on foster mom and dad's shoulders before bed time each night with and saying softly...slowly...\"hold me closer tiny dancer.\" Because Elton is still working on some manners for a few puppy behaviors, we would recommend he go to a family with older children.",

From what we heard, faithful Chance tried hard to protect little Maple, and we aren't surprised, given how loving he is with her and how sad he gets when she is not around. Chance and Maple are most definitely a bonded pair who need to be adopted out together. Because of their recent trauma, they can live with other dogs but introductions must be done slowly. They both LOVE any and all people and honestly believe they are each ~15lbs and can comfortably fit on your lap. Together. Chance is party animal of the two, always wanting to be in the center of the action when out and about while Maple is thrilled with pawing at the closest human hand to direct them toward given scratches. These special bullies are incredibly (and miraculously) loving, loyal, and trusting, despite having been through the worst of the worst.",

From what we heard, faithful Chance tried hard to protect little Maple, and we aren't surprised, given how loving he is with her and how sad he gets when she is not around. Chance and Maple are most definitely a bonded pair who need to be adopted out together. Because of their recent trauma, they can live with other dogs but introductions must be done slowly. They both LOVE any and all people and honestly believe they are each ~15lbs and can comfortably fit on your lap. Together. Chance is party animal of the two, always wanting to be in the center of the action when out and about while Maple is thrilled with pawing at the closest human hand to direct them toward given scratches. These special bullies are incredibly (and miraculously) loving, loyal, and trusting, despite having been through the worst of the worst.",

            "description": "Petey is an 18-month old pup who is a lovebug! He's super affectionate and enjoys being attached to his people all of the time. He really needs a family who can be home with him most of the time, as he gets scared when he's by himself. \n\nHe's full of energy and isn't a fan of pottying on a leash, so he absolutely needs a home with a fenced yard! \n\nPetey has done really well with cats, and with some patience he really enjoys doggy siblings to play with. Slow introductions are needed, but once he's there the fun never stops!\n\nPetey can be timid in unfamiliar places. He can get overwhelmed with seeing lots of people, cars going by, and finding strange smells. With some patience, a trusted human, and lots of love, he should improve with new situations.\n\nWith Petey's nervousness, it's important that if his new home has kids, that they be 10+ years old for better understanding. \n\nPetey needs a fenced yard, a family who can be home with him most of the time, and kids over 10 years old. He likes doggy playmates but he also prefers to hog his people to himself so other pets aren't necessary. Petey would do best with a family wants to earn his trust and patiently help him past his hurdles. If you're looking a super affectionate little bed-hog, Petey is the boy for you! \n\nPetey's adoption fee is 300. This fee covers the care he's received during his time with us. Petey is neutered, microchipped, just saw the vet (all clear),  and recently received his booster shots. He's definitely a good boy! \n\nPetey is doing well in his foster home, so he'd love to find a forever family to start 2021 off right!\n\nWhile we are based in rural Minnesota, Petey is being fostered near the metro, and we complete adoptions all over the state! \n\nAn Adoption Application must be submitted to take the next step if you are interested in meeting/adopting Petey. Please allow up to 7 business days for us to get back to you! Apply here: https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/25718/generic",

            "description": "Denali was born in January of 2020 and is a big boy - about 120 lbs.  He was rehomed from his first home due to lack of space and no fenced yard.  Although he was raised with children, he was unfortunately not treated well by them, so would do best in a home with older teenage children or an all adult home.  his 2nd home had a 5 year old child who he played too rough with, resulting in him coming into rescue.  He is friendly and playful  with other dogs, and loves to snuggle with adults.  His best match would be an energetic female dog. He does not know boundaries, so would benefit from some obedience training.  He still thinks he is a 20 lb pup! We recommend obedience training for all newly adopted pyrs, to help you create a special bond with you and your new friend, and so you have a well behaved canine. Great Pyrenees are willing to learn, but are not as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds. They are bred to be independent thinkers. Applicants must be over 25, own their own home and all children in household must be over 15 years old. Your resident pets must be up to date on vaccines, sterilized, you must have a good history of vet care for them, and you must have used heartworm preventative year round for your dogs. \n\n\nDenali will be placed as an inside pet with outside privileges. You MUST have a securely fenced yard accessible from your home. Invisible fencing does not work with this breed and they will take the shock for the freedom.  Great Pyrenees are bred to roam and will create their own territory if not secured, which can led to them being lost, hit by vehicles or shot by people who see them as a threat. The breed is not a good off leash dog, and cannot be trusted to not run away.  A Great Pyrenees off leash is a \" DisAPyr.\" \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please complete the appropriate application on our website, www.igpr.org under the Adopt tab. \n\nAll of our dogs marked as needing foster homes are also available for adoption.  If a dog is listed on this site, it is available.  No need to contact us to see if it is,  We do require you  complete the adoption application prior to meeting a dog.\n\nWe also offer a foster to adopt program. You foster the dog, and have first right of refusal on them if an approved application is submitted for them. \n\nIn fostering a dog, the dog comes to you fully vetted. and groomed. You provide good quality food, grooming, and we provide the heartworm preventative and medical care, if needed* .(*Based on approval from IGPR.)\n\nDenali will be placed with a neuter agreement to be completed between when he is 18 - 24 months old.   Studies have shown that large breed dogs benefit from the hormones in their bodies to help with long bone growth, to lessen the chances of osteosarcoma or joint issues occurring later n their life.  At the time of the neuter, $100 will be refunded with proof of neuter. \n\nAdoption fee is $400",

Its hard to guess an age but we know he is older and was probably never well cared for. Toby does have a heart murmur, fur loss, he was shot with a bb gun and arthritis but he is still the toughest little guy with a lot of life left. His bloodwork and all tests came back great so now he just needs a loving home to live out the rest of his days in. Toby loves going on short walks and snuggling on anything soft he can find. He is potty trained but needs to be let out a little more then youre normal dog. He is a quiet, non destructive good boy. He will still chase a cat down so no cats! He is ok with other calm dogs but would probably be best if he had his own little spot. If you think you might be interested in giving a sweet senior a loving home please fill out the application below. He is UTD on vaccines, preventatives and is neutered.",

He adores the younger kids in his current foster home and giving loads of cuddles. He also does great with very playful dogs! Senior or tiny dogs he wouldn't be a good match for, as he would expect them to play as much as he does, so a playful friend would be beneficial for him! And a dog to teach him how to be a dog! He also does great with cats. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org/available-dogs",

            "description": "FROM THE FOSTER: Hello future family! My name is Maybelline, but my foster family of six months calls me Minnie. I've been told I am the sweetest girl in the world, as well as the goofiest. Although I'm quite the cutie, I had mange when I came in and my fur is still growing, and I had an eye that was damaged and needed to be removed, so Im also adjusting to life with one eye. I love my people and I am incredibly loyal. I will always be there to snuggle with you (I love warm, comfy spots to curl up in), play with you, and protect you. I am currently working on walking on a leash and my socialization with other dogs. Even though I'm unsure about some things, I'm housebroken and follow commands well. I like to run around and be silly, so I am looking to meet someone with a big yard to bounce around in! Since my previous life was a tough one, I am hoping that someone will take a chance on me, love me, and be patient with me while I continue navigating the dog world.\n\nORIGINAL POST: Maybelline is a 3 year old, 48 pound bulldog mix that came from a shelter in south GA. When we got her she had demodex mange and was missing most of her hair and had one eye that was damaged and had to be removed. We do not know her backstory but we cant imagine that it was a life well-lived. Thats all over with now. She has been in the program for a few months with a wonderful foster, while she recuperated and now she is ready to go to a forever home. She is incredibly loyal and loving, great in the house, walks well on a leash and follows commands. We have kept her close the past few months while she went thru two surgeries, so she needs a little socialization with other dogs, which we will do, but we would love to get her adopted, so she can start her new life. If you would like to adopt this sweet girl. Please go to www.atlantalabrescue.com to fill out an application.",

My name is Willow Bug, but not like a gross bug such as a spider or slug. I am more like a snuggle bug. I am looking for a special family that has Megaesophagus experience, as I need to be fed upright in a Bailey chair. I am super friendly with everyone! I am dog friendly. I love humans big and small. I have yet to meet a cat. I am crate trained. I am working really hard on potty training. Leash training is going well. My foster mom calls me her shadow, as I am always under foot and can never get close enough. I love toys! I know how to sit on command and I takes treats gently. If you think I would be perfect in your family, please apply today.\n\n*Please make sure to list your Megaesophagus experience in your adoption application.\n\n***Please inquire ONLY through our website: www.woofgangrescue.com***\n\nDATCP 402490",

I came off a little mean, but staff saw right through my bluff! They gave me the time I needed to adjust, and my personality started showing! I do pull on leash so I would recommend leash training for me. I love to be around my humans, but I get SOO hyper!! I do what they call, zoomies, although in the process I may run into you! No harm done, just excitement! I tolerate all handling but I become so excited so I cannot stay still. I may come off a bit rude when it comes to play time, because I love to jump and I may jump too hard, I don't mean it! I'm just too excited. I love treats and rawhide, I don't mind sharing either. So, since I am a queen (duh) I need to be respected by other dogs! I met a energetic invasive male who I met nicely, but he became a little rude so I corrected him! Being that this is who I am, I would recommend a family with children no younger than 12 due to my jumpiness and high arousal, also initial meetings. I hope to meet the perfect family soon!",

He also takes daily medication for his heart, but this guy doesn\u2019t let his challenges stop him from getting lots of cuddles!\n\nBuddy does well with respectful kids who understand how to approach a vision challenged dog, and gets along with dogs of all sizes as long as they give him time to get used to them!\n\nBuddy walks well on a leash for short walks, does great with house training as long as his people let him out regularly, and sleeps through the night like the gentleman he is!\n\nHe is neutered, UTD on shots, HW neg and on HW prevention.\n\nHis adoption donation is $250.00.\n\nIf you are interested in the above dog, please do not email us and tell us that you are interested, but submit an adoption application. The link for the application is below.\n\nTo submit an application go here\u2026\u2026chihuahua-rescue.com/adoption-application/\nAn application must be submitted and approved before a meet-n-greet can be scheduled.\n\nYour current dogs/cats must be spayed or neutered unless a veterinarian has determined that your current pet(s) should not be fixed due to medical reasons. \n\nThey must also be up-to-date on shots and on HW preventative.\nReference checks and a home visit are required so SE dogs can only be adopted in NC/SC, VA, TN, AL, MD and GA.\n\n",

He is house trained, loves to be petted and rides well in the car. Lt Dan is active and playful with wonderful manners and a loving personality! He was obviously part of a loving family that lost track of him or could no longer keep him in these hard times. Lt Dan knows basic obedience commands and hand signals. He is crate trained and shows no food aggression or other difficult behaviors. Lt Dan will make a great addition to a new family!\n\nLt Dan T. Summary:\n- Lt Dan is a male, 11 yrs old, weighs 80 lbs, current on shots\n- Good with Adults, children, dogs, and travel in the car\n- Cats TBD\n\nLt Dan passed a set of evaluation tests before being accepted into the TSGSR. The tests are not intended to assess how smart the dog is but are important for TSGSR to determine if the dog is expected to be safe in a family home. The tested behaviors check to see if the dog will guard or protect food or toys from people, will tolerate handling all over its body (including ears, nose, lips to check teeth, lifting paws, belly, back, and gently pulling the tail) and the ability to get along with other well behaved dogs. He remained calm during all of these tests and showed no aggressive tendencies. \n\nPlease join us in welcoming Lt Dan to TSGSR! Check back often. We will be updating his bio as we learn more about him!\n\nWhat's Next for Lt Dan T:\nThulani Senior German Shepherd Rescue (TSGSR) will continue to see that Lt Dan is well cared for and receives all medical care needed for his well being while in our care. In addition, TSGSR is beginning a search for an adoptive home that will care for him for the rest of his life. He will come to his new home with a supply of food, a cushy pad if wanted, and other goodies such as toys. \n\nLt Dans medical expenses will be covered for the rest of his life by Thulani Senior German Shepherd Rescue (TSGSR)!\n\nIf you want to learn more about Lt Dan, or are interested in possibly providing an adoptive or foster home, please send us a message by clicking on the \"Ask About Me\" button. We will often get feedback or \"updates\" from a dog's foster home and as any updates become available they will be included here.\n\nIf you are reading about him on Petfinder.com sometimes an available YouTube video is not listed. If this occurs you can still view the video by pasting its URL into a new browser window or tab.\n\nAvailable Video URL(s): https://youtu.be/OMf-KeehU9Y\n\nSaving one dog wont change the world. It will change the world for that one dog.",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Cheyenne! I\u2019m a small size Great Pyrenees mix and weigh about 65 lbs. I am about 3 years old and originally from New Mexico. I\u2019m very friendly but very shy and easily startled in the beginning with people. I get along great with other dogs, and am good with cats and other critters as well. I am a low to medium energy dog and am house trained. I love to go for walks and walk very well on a leash. I do not like riding in the car at all and am stressed out when I have to go somewhere. If you are looking for a dog to go places with, I am NOT your girl. I much prefer to stay around my home. It helps to have another dog with me when I have to go somewhere but I still get very worried. At night I like to sleep in a crate with the door open. I love chew toys like antlers and benebones. I am a picky eater, and sometimes skip meals. I am working on some separation anxiety issues, especially when the sun is down. I am afraid of strangers, visitors to the house, and cars. When I am afraid I bark to warn them off and can remain stressed and upset even after they are gone. I\u2019m a fan of open spaces, but not of living in town and human activity. I\u2019m therefore looking for a rural or mountain home where there are fewer things that scare me. I will be the happiest in a home with at least one other dog. I was used to living in a pack and I feel more confident when there are other dogs around. I am a sweet and affectionate dog, looking for a patient family that will give me a home for life.

He is a very energetic and playful guy who is always down for belly rubs and neck scratches. Cuddling is new to him so he is very awkward, but he loves it and now even gives little kisses. Toys! He is obsessed with toys, all toys, but especially if they have stuffing that he can rip out. He loves to be with his people and will follow you anywhere except the basement, waaay too scary for him. Simba is housebroken and somewhat crate trained. He is a great dog and highly trainable, he would do fantastic with more training. He is a guardian breed and will do best in an experienced home. He also has a high prey drive. No children, no cats, no small animals.\nSimba was found Feb/March 2020 in Michigan. His microchip said that he was missing for 2 months from Miami, Florida! We tried for months to return him to his owners, but the pandemic made things difficult. His owners could not afford to bring him home and signed him over to me to find him a new home. He is HW positive and is currently going through treatment.\nHe is available to be fostered or placed in a foster to adopt home. He will have to be kept calm during his heart worm treatment.",

We would love for Rosie to find a loving family so she can enjoy what being a dog is really about. Rosie's adoption fee is $250 and you can fill out an application for her at www.apsofpc.org",

Maybe lab/pitbull/shar pei with a whippet tail and a hound focus on scent, she\u2019s about 4 years old and came to us as an owner release. \n\nTwila is housetrained, well-mannered and responsive to her people. She will come when called indoors and in the yard. She knows basic commands and will sit and wait nicely for meals. She hasn\u2019t had much training on leash walking, but her foster family has been working with her on it. \n\nShe\u2019s a smart girl who needs as much mental stimulation as physical. She loves her explorations in the woods at the off-leash dog park and socializes well with the other dogs.  Sometimes she gets a little rough when she starts to get tired or overstimulated. When she does, she just needs a little help getting grounded again.\n\nShe would enjoy continued training in a positive method training class and would do well in agility and/or scent training. Twila would love to have a home with a big yard where she can play and romp. She\u2019d be an enthusiastic hiking and beachcombing companion. An active family who wants to include her in their outings, activities and adventures would be ideal.\n\nShe would be happy with another well-adjusted dog in the family but isn\u2019t a good match for cats. We think the best fit would be with adults or a family with children who are dog savvy.\n\nTwila has a big heart and just wants someone to love, someone to play with her, cuddle with her, and love her back. She's looking for a home where she is adored and made to feel special. She\u2019ll make you feel special, too!\n\nTwila\u2019s adoption fee includes spay/neuter, basic vaccinations, rabies vaccination, and heartworm tested negative.\n\nYou can find her application here:\n\nhttps://forms.gle/5eSBjHrWv7pTEEzUA\n\nQuestions? Contact us at connellpetrescue@gmail.com \n\nThank you! And Twila thanks you!\n\n",

His baby blues and rounded ears make you want to scoop him up for a cuddle, easy to do considering his smaller size of 30 pounds.  Cute and sweet, Blue likes you giving him ear and belly rubs, and will lean on you for attention if you wait too long.  Just seeing you starts his tail wagging and his face smiling.  Our mid-energy guy walks well in a pack of dogs, responding quickly to any needed corrections, and growling if another dog gets too close.  We are working to socialize Blue more around other dogs; for now, he should be the only fur-ball in your home.  Blue has a condition called mega-esophagus, readily managed by having him eat and drink in an upright position using a Bailey chair \u2013 kind of a high chair for dogs (the rescue can provide this chair).  He enthusiastically puts himself in it, standing with his paws on the tray, waiting to be served. Think of how perfect he\u2019ll look at the end of your bed or in the back of your car!\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website!

            "description": "Norman is an active 7 year old male Bench English Setter. His owner died a few months ago and the wife is unable to give him the exercise he needs due to her physical disability.\n\nNorman would do best with a male owner and possibly another same size active dog. Since Norman lost his male owner (and much needed exercise) he has started bullying and thus intimidating the other older English Setter in the household. So he will do best in a home with an active man who can provide leadership and daily exercise and training.\n\nNorman is leash reactive (lunges and barks) at other dogs when out walking. He is very strong and would require experienced and consistent training in this area.\n\nHe is used to a quiet home where someone was home most of the time with no children or smaller pets and is looking for a similar type home. He has never lived with cats and is not a candidate for a home with cats.\n\nHe is house trained and when inside he is happy to lay on the couch and loves to have his head in your lap. Furniture privileges are very important for Norman. He does bark if he sees activity outside the window, but otherwise he is calm inside when he has plenty of outside exercise and stimulation.\n\nOutside Norman is active for a middle aged bench boy and requires a home with a secure fenced (at least 4 feet tall) yard that is large enough to run and interesting to explore. He is used to daily walks and would like this in his new home too.\n\nNorman is neutered, up to date on vaccines and tests, and microchipped. He is in a home in Denver, CO.\n\n For an application to adopt or for more information about Southwest English Setter Rescue including our adoption requirements and transport availability, please go to http://www.swesr.org/. Please call us at 214-997-3885 if you have any questions.",

            "description": "From Marley's family..\n\nThis beautiful boy needs a new home! His owner is having health problems and can no longer work or train Marley to be the brilliant dog he is meant to be. Marley is approximately 2 years old and weighs 90 lbs.  If you are someone that loves to run/walk or hike then you will enjoy this dog! Marley is very curious and active; he is an amazing swimmer and likes to spend hours in the water! He also loves to ride in the car!!\n \nAlthough Marley is good with kids and dogs we do not want him to go to a home that has children and dogs at this time. Marley has been ignored and needs undivided attention. He can be around other dogs and children in the future after trained but at this time he should be with someone who focuses on him! He is so smart, learns very quickly so physical exercise and consistent training will get the job done quickly. Marley is housetrained, good in the car, medium energy and will return what you give. \n \nMarley has been working with an amazing trainer who believes so much in him she is willing to offer some free training if you are invested and willing to put the work in. Please see her comments below!\n\nFrom welcome Home Sanctuary... This dog and trainer below is a gift. If you have the opportunity to work with this respected trainer you will learn more about dogs and training then you ever thought possible, it's a win win. Sarah is offering her free time for this dog because she believes in him that much. We will be waiving the $365 fee and asking that it is given to Sarah before you bring Marley home. You will not be able to adopt unless you make a commitment to training with Sarah...\n\nMarley\u2019s trainer here:\n \nMarley is an exceptional dog, in need of an exceptional home.\n \nIn several decades of in-depth and full-time involvement in the training and behavior community, including two decades as a professional animal behavior expert seeing and working with canine behavior from pretty much every angle, I have seen few dogs with Marley\u2019s potential.\n \nI\u2019ve seen and trained many dogs who have become regarded as the \u201cultimate\u201d in canine behavior and training, fitting a wide variety of needs and desires from service dog to competitor. And always most importantly, loving companion and canine ambassador. And yet, Marley\u2019s potential still stands out, even from the perspective of such a depth and breadth of experience.\n \nMarley is highly intelligent and perceptive. And, just as critical to the ease of teaching and living with a dog, Marley\u2019s intelligence is naturally and easily focused on cooperation and teamwork. With the right methods, he is excellent at learning whatever we wish him to learn, and then doing that to the best of his considerable abilities.\n \nHe is also outstandingly athletic. He loves to play, is an amazing swimmer, and has beautiful natural balance, coordination, and body awareness.\n \nI would eagerly take him home in a heartbeat, if I could justify bringing one more dog home at this time, without risking running out of the time and resources for my current dogs. And I would do so knowing, without question, that Marley would make me proud, as a role model and helpmate in my work as a canine professional. If I could bring one more dog home at this time, any dog at all, it would without question be Marley. That is how amazing he is.\n \nHowever, as happens to exceptional dogs like Marley just as often as it happens to any other dog, the humans on whom Marley depended in his early life, were not the right match for him. Eventually, he was given to a well-intentioned person who simply did not have the resources to care for another dog, let alone one who is large, young, athletic, and energetic. Additionally, despite Marley being as brilliant and willing as a dog could be, he was handed off to his current owner with both a lack of what he should have been given by that time in his life, and some residual issues as a result of all that he had been through before coming to his current home.\n \nEven so, once we began our work together, things were improving as well and as rapidly as one could have hoped for. Until a significant life event occurred for his owner, which made continuing that work or even taking care of Marley\u2019s basic needs, (exercise, training, attention), simply impossible. \n \nMarley blossomed with the right training techniques \u2014 from our first lesson together, he rewarded even the highest expectations, at every turn. Despite very little time to dedicate to his training, to exercising him, to socializing him, he nonetheless showed up for each lesson by not just meeting that high standard of expectations, but more often exceeding them than not.\n \nUnfortunately, he has not been able to have training for a while now, due to a lack of resources. And without that, as well as without time to exercise him or care for him, the home in which he lives cannot keep him. There is simply no space, no time, and no resources to make that work.\n \nBecause Marley is so exceptional, and because his response has been so reliably outstanding, to the specific techniques I have developed over the past 30 years of intensive involvement in animal behavior, I am offering something I have offered to only one other exceptional dog in the past. (And, by the way, that dog went from being deemed \u201chopeless\u201d, due to improper training techniques, to becoming the \u201cbest dog\u201d his very experienced owners feel they have ever had. And Marley has the abundant ability become that once-in-a-lifetime dog, for the right home, as well.)\n \nWhat I am offering is this: For the right foster home, or adopter, or foster-to-adopt, I will give weekly lessons at no cost. This is a commitment which, if taken, must be taken as seriously as if it is being dearly bought; because the goal is for Marley to reach his marvelous potential, and he has already paid too high a price, for people to play around with his training without consistency or sufficient knowledge.\n \nFor someone who wants to learn more about canine behavior and training, wants to learn how to do a better job of fostering, or training, or simply caring for their own dogs, this is an opportunity to gain literally thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of education. All while saving an amazing dog, and potentially adopting the dog of your dreams, if the fit is right. A potential lifelong win for his foster, his adopter, for the person who now owns him but truly cannot keep him, and most of all, for this magnificent and deserving at-risk dog.\n\nWelcome Home Sanctaury is asking you, his new adopter continue his education so that Marley can thrive.\n\nThis is a courtesy post for all who care and love Marley.",

            "description": "Roy\n\nRoy is a large neutered male senior Coonhound mix who is about 10 to 12 years old and weighs about 70 pounds.\n\nHe was found as a stray and sadly was never claimed. He's super sweet, friendly, and social. Roy always wants to meet other dogs and people he sees on his walks, which he looks forward to greatly. Although he can have bursts of energy, especially for a dog his age, he also very much enjoys his naps.\n\nRoy has a big howl on him and will let other dogs know when they pass by. However, when meeting dogs he knows, they can bark at him and he just stares quietly back.\n\nWhen out on walks, Roy can sometimes pull toward interesting things he wants to investigate, but he has made good progress with his leash training. He may rush in and sniff dogs (which can be an issue for some dogs), but once he ha a sniff he minds his business and carries on.\n\nRoy doesn't appear to have had much training in the past, but he's a great guy and is willing to learn. He is fully housetrained and is also very good in a car (he came all the way from the Ottawa area).\n\nRoy needs a house with a fenced yard; committed adopters and a family that will love him unconditionally for the rest of his days!\n\nMedical: he's had a dental, several lumps removed (all benign), he has a LOW GRADE heart murmur that was ex-rayed and NOT enlarged (no meds required) and tested positive for LYME which he was treated for and is NOT symptomatic (needs to have a retest in June and only 5% of dogs who test positive ever show signs of Lyme; so it's not like human form of Lyme's disease)\n\nHe's neutered, up-to-date with vaccines, chipped, all his blood work for organ function is NORMAL and he's HW negative\n\nCan you give this sweet, friendly boy the forever home full of the love and care he needs? He'll pay you back with Coonhound howls and wags!\n\nThis guy really deserves a break and needs good dog people to swoop him up and love him as much as he'll love you!\n\nMore about Roy\n\nHouse trained Friendly with people Color: Black and White Activity level: Active at times with down time Very little training\n\n2/2/21 8:46 AM",

She has been in boarding for several months in hopes her dad would be able to come back for her, but he is unable to do that. She needs a new family that can spend time with her and love her.   \n\nDogs laugh, but they laugh with their tails. -\nMax Eastman\n\nHoney \n\nShe\u2019s a \u201cin your face\u201d kind of dog. She needs to be reminded \u201cnot\u201d to jump up. She\u2019s getting better, but she just wants your attention and will jump to do that. A little more training should do the trick. She comes when called. She\u2019s very food and treat motivated. \nShe loves her Nyla bone and is comfortable in her crate, but might chew up her bedding, if she gets bored. \nShe loves to be outside to run and play.\nShe will need supervised introductions to other dogs her size. She wouldn\u2019t do well with small dogs or cats. \nA passive non-aggressive male would be her best match.\n\n",

I'm a gorgeous hound with an amazingly sweet disposition. I was hit by a car and my leg needs to be amputated.. The nice folks at RDR will update my profile when they learn more about me. I can't wait to find my forever home where I can be treated with the TLC I deserve!\n\nAdoption Application:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/adoptrdr\n\nFoster Application:\n\nhttps://rdr.formstack.com/forms/foster_app\n\nThis pup tested HW Positive and is undergoing treatment. For more information on heartworms click here: https://www.heartwormsociety.org/pet-owner-resources/heartworm-basics\n\nAdoption Application:\nhttp://bit.ly/adoptrdr\n\nFoster Application: http://bit.ly/fosterapprdr\n\nAdoption Process: In order to adopt, we require an adoption application. After you submit an application, if you pass the screening, we will contact you to schedule a phone interview. We will call your references, including your veterinarian and landlord (when appropriate). We will also conduct a home visit. After these steps are complete, you will be approved to adopt a dog. Please note this process takes 1-2 weeks so applications submitted when you are ready to bring a dog home within that time frame. You can meet our adoptable dogs at events, however, we cannot guarantee that dogs at events do not have pre-approved applicants meeting them there as well, so the application is the best way to start the process.\n\nMission Statement: Forever true to \"The Underdog\", Rural Dog Rescue is dedicated to saving the lives of dogs in shelters who are often overlooked for adoption or rescue. We save the dogs who are at most risk of being euthanized: the hounds, the black dogs, the seniors, the sick and the broken. We make a commitment to reserve a minimum of 50% of the dogs we save to The Underdog. Root For The Underdog!\n\nRural Dog Rescue's home base is in Washington, DC. We adopt to the Washington, DC metropolitan area to include Maryland and Northern Virginia.\n\nWe support several high kill shelters that euthanize in 72 hours and whose kill rate is 70% or higher in rural areas of Virginia, West Virginia, North and South Carolina. Rural Dog Rescue also helps dogs in need in Washington, DC and Maryland.\n\nWe are 100% volunteer and foster based and no salaries are paid. 100% of your donation and adoption fee goes to helping the dogs and cats of Rural Dog Rescue.\n\nAlthough we try to be as accurate as possible, Rural Dog Rescue cannot guarantee the breed or full-grown adult size of any of the dogs or puppies in its care. Because many of these dogs were found as strays or are the result of irresponsible, unplanned breeding, we do not know the dog's exact background and can only list breed and size by our best educated guess. If exact breed and size are important to you, please consider adopting a dog from a specific breed rescue. Our goal is for our dogs to be adopted by people who will love and care for them forever for who they are - no matter what breed and size they turn out to be!\n\nAll dogs go to their new homes spayed or neutered, up to date on all shots, dewormed (although a second deworming may be required), started on heartworm and flea and tick preventative and sometimes microchipped.",

I'm a playful pup who has a fun-loving personality. I have been described as 'the most loving dog in the world.' I'm great on a leash and I love exercising and hiking in nature. I already know a bunch of basic skills, but I'm very food and attention motivated and could be a really well-trained dog with a little work from my new family. I'm just the best pup and I\n\ncan't wait to find my forever home where I can share all the love I've got to give.\n\nAdoption Application:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/adoptrdr\n\nAdoption Application:\nhttp://bit.ly/adoptrdr\n\nFoster Application: http://bit.ly/fosterapprdr\n\nAdoption Process: In order to adopt, we require an adoption application. After you submit an application, if you pass the screening, we will contact you to schedule a phone interview. We will call your references, including your veterinarian and landlord (when appropriate). We will also conduct a home visit. After these steps are complete, you will be approved to adopt a dog. Please note this process takes 1-2 weeks so applications submitted when you are ready to bring a dog home within that time frame. You can meet our adoptable dogs at events, however, we cannot guarantee that dogs at events do not have pre-approved applicants meeting them there as well, so the application is the best way to start the process.\n\nMission Statement: Forever true to \"The Underdog\", Rural Dog Rescue is dedicated to saving the lives of dogs in shelters who are often overlooked for adoption or rescue. We save the dogs who are at most risk of being euthanized: the hounds, the black dogs, the seniors, the sick and the broken. We make a commitment to reserve a minimum of 50% of the dogs we save to The Underdog. Root For The Underdog!\n\nRural Dog Rescue's home base is in Washington, DC. We adopt to the Washington, DC metropolitan area to include Maryland and Northern Virginia.\n\nWe support several high kill shelters that euthanize in 72 hours and whose kill rate is 70% or higher in rural areas of Virginia, West Virginia, North and South Carolina. Rural Dog Rescue also helps dogs in need in Washington, DC and Maryland.\n\nWe are 100% volunteer and foster based and no salaries are paid. 100% of your donation and adoption fee goes to helping the dogs and cats of Rural Dog Rescue.\n\nAlthough we try to be as accurate as possible, Rural Dog Rescue cannot guarantee the breed or full-grown adult size of any of the dogs or puppies in its care. Because many of these dogs were found as strays or are the result of irresponsible, unplanned breeding, we do not know the dog's exact background and can only list breed and size by our best educated guess. If exact breed and size are important to you, please consider adopting a dog from a specific breed rescue. Our goal is for our dogs to be adopted by people who will love and care for them forever for who they are - no matter what breed and size they turn out to be!\n\nAll dogs go to their new homes spayed or neutered, up to date on all shots, dewormed (although a second deworming may be required), started on heartworm and flea and tick preventative and sometimes microchipped.",

My name speaks to my personality -- I'm royalty! The nice folks at RDR will update my profile when they learn more about me. I can't wait to find my forever home!\n\nAdoption Application:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/adoptrdr\n\nFoster Application:\n\nhttps://rdr.formstack.com/forms/foster_app\n\nThis pup tested HW Positive and is undergoing treatment. He will be ready for adoption in February. For more information on heartworms click here: https://www.heartwormsociety.org/pet-owner-resources/heartworm-basics\n\nAdoption Application:\nhttp://bit.ly/adoptrdr\n\nFoster Application: http://bit.ly/fosterapprdr\n\nAdoption Process: In order to adopt, we require an adoption application. After you submit an application, if you pass the screening, we will contact you to schedule a phone interview. We will call your references, including your veterinarian and landlord (when appropriate). We will also conduct a home visit. After these steps are complete, you will be approved to adopt a dog. Please note this process takes 1-2 weeks so applications submitted when you are ready to bring a dog home within that time frame. You can meet our adoptable dogs at events, however, we cannot guarantee that dogs at events do not have pre-approved applicants meeting them there as well, so the application is the best way to start the process.\n\nMission Statement: Forever true to \"The Underdog\", Rural Dog Rescue is dedicated to saving the lives of dogs in shelters who are often overlooked for adoption or rescue. We save the dogs who are at most risk of being euthanized: the hounds, the black dogs, the seniors, the sick and the broken. We make a commitment to reserve a minimum of 50% of the dogs we save to The Underdog. Root For The Underdog!\n\nRural Dog Rescue's home base is in Washington, DC. We adopt to the Washington, DC metropolitan area to include Maryland and Northern Virginia.\n\nWe support several high kill shelters that euthanize in 72 hours and whose kill rate is 70% or higher in rural areas of Virginia, West Virginia, North and South Carolina. Rural Dog Rescue also helps dogs in need in Washington, DC and Maryland.\n\nWe are 100% volunteer and foster based and no salaries are paid. 100% of your donation and adoption fee goes to helping the dogs and cats of Rural Dog Rescue.\n\nAlthough we try to be as accurate as possible, Rural Dog Rescue cannot guarantee the breed or full-grown adult size of any of the dogs or puppies in its care. Because many of these dogs were found as strays or are the result of irresponsible, unplanned breeding, we do not know the dog's exact background and can only list breed and size by our best educated guess. If exact breed and size are important to you, please consider adopting a dog from a specific breed rescue. Our goal is for our dogs to be adopted by people who will love and care for them forever for who they are - no matter what breed and size they turn out to be!\n\nAll dogs go to their new homes spayed or neutered, up to date on all shots, dewormed (although a second deworming may be required), started on heartworm and flea and tick preventative and sometimes microchipped.",

She was adopted by a couple but 4 years later, on Christmas Eve,  the husband brought her back in tears fearing for the safety of his dog. He saw a disturbing video on his security footage of his wife beating trees with a long stick along the fence line and harassing the dogs with it as well. Another video showed how she got the dogs all hyped up and when they started fighting each other she just sat there completely spaced out. The husband realized he can't reason with an addict and the had to choose safety for his dogs.\nWe would love for this girl not to grow old in rescue care. \nShe would love a home where she can be the only dog just because of what she has been through. She is not dog aggressive but developed an attitude she shows sometimes. \nShe loves to go for a stroll and is not requiring lots of exercise. She loves to snuggle and is very well behaved, crate and house trained. She loves people and kids and is a very gentle older girl \nAva is about 7 years old and might have some bull terrier in her.\nShe has only 1 eye and we don't know what happened. She might not be the most prettiest dog in some people eyes but she is the most beauty at heart and loyal to the bone. This girl will melt your heart if you give her a chance.\n\nIf you would like to meet our amazing Ava, please send us a message in order to receive an application. We are only able to meet with approved applicants by appointment.\n\nAva's adoption fee is $ 250 which includes all vaccines, heartworm test, spay and micro chip.",

I'm a handsome hound mix with a lot of love left to give. The nice folks at RDR will update my profile when they learn more about me. I can't wait to find my forever home!\n\nAdoption Application:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/adoptrdr\n\nFoster Application:\n\nhttps://rdr.formstack.com/forms/foster_app\n\nThis pup tested HW Positive and is undergoing treatment. For more information on heartworms click here: https://www.heartwormsociety.org/pet-owner-resources/heartworm-basics\n\nAdoption Application:\nhttp://bit.ly/adoptrdr\n\nFoster Application: http://bit.ly/fosterapprdr\n\nAdoption Process: In order to adopt, we require an adoption application. After you submit an application, if you pass the screening, we will contact you to schedule a phone interview. We will call your references, including your veterinarian and landlord (when appropriate). We will also conduct a home visit. After these steps are complete, you will be approved to adopt a dog. Please note this process takes 1-2 weeks so applications submitted when you are ready to bring a dog home within that time frame. You can meet our adoptable dogs at events, however, we cannot guarantee that dogs at events do not have pre-approved applicants meeting them there as well, so the application is the best way to start the process.\n\nMission Statement: Forever true to \"The Underdog\", Rural Dog Rescue is dedicated to saving the lives of dogs in shelters who are often overlooked for adoption or rescue. We save the dogs who are at most risk of being euthanized: the hounds, the black dogs, the seniors, the sick and the broken. We make a commitment to reserve a minimum of 50% of the dogs we save to The Underdog. Root For The Underdog!\n\nRural Dog Rescue's home base is in Washington, DC. We adopt to the Washington, DC metropolitan area to include Maryland and Northern Virginia.\n\nWe support several high kill shelters that euthanize in 72 hours and whose kill rate is 70% or higher in rural areas of Virginia, West Virginia, North and South Carolina. Rural Dog Rescue also helps dogs in need in Washington, DC and Maryland.\n\nWe are 100% volunteer and foster based and no salaries are paid. 100% of your donation and adoption fee goes to helping the dogs and cats of Rural Dog Rescue.\n\nAlthough we try to be as accurate as possible, Rural Dog Rescue cannot guarantee the breed or full-grown adult size of any of the dogs or puppies in its care. Because many of these dogs were found as strays or are the result of irresponsible, unplanned breeding, we do not know the dog's exact background and can only list breed and size by our best educated guess. If exact breed and size are important to you, please consider adopting a dog from a specific breed rescue. Our goal is for our dogs to be adopted by people who will love and care for them forever for who they are - no matter what breed and size they turn out to be!\n\nAll dogs go to their new homes spayed or neutered, up to date on all shots, dewormed (although a second deworming may be required), started on heartworm and flea and tick preventative and sometimes microchipped.",

            "description": "Oh Holly, our sweet Christmas hound. She was in a tiny rural shelter in OK and they reached out for help because she went into labor there. A cold concrete floor is no place for newborn puppies. Holly is 80lbs and the best mama to her 4 newborn babies.\n\nHolly was terrified of the leash and had never worn a collar in her life before she came to us. In a short week she has progressed to confidently walking on leash with our dogs for support and takes his time taking in all the smells.  With lots of treats and love she conquered his fear of the harness and stairs in just a few short hours. She is very treat motivated and is learning quickly how good life could be.\n\nShe is super sweet. She loves both food and attention a lot. She likes to sleep on her bed in between walks, meal times and cuddles. She gets super excited when she thinks it is going out time.  She settles down when you sit on the couch or leave the room. She does well in her room wiith her puppies.\n\nShe sometimes shows her dissatisfaction by sounding like a motor bike and short barks she stops upon hearing her name. We have learned that a Kong toy full of frozen food and PB makes her enjoy her night time routine more. Treats and a happy voice always gets her attention too. She LOVES chasing squirrels if given the chance. She still does not show any interest in toys, and her main interest in fenced areas are sniffing around. However, she has recently learned to play fetch with a stick. She responds to her name and comes back to you for some pets or treats. She does well in bath time. Generally, she is super sweet and patient with her people. She is a great loving companion dog.",

We were stunned to find out she does not have any major health issues, except some aging joints and loss of hearing. She is, in fact, deaf, but it sure doesn't slow her down one bit. Grace adores her humans and isn't afraid to express herself with her walrus-y barks and howls when there's something she wants. She also has the most hilarious single snaggle tooth that sticks out of her underbite at all times. Amazing Grace is in a foster home currently with other dogs, and generally ignores both them and the resident kitties. She is also perfectly happy nested in a fluffy dog bed or by your side for a snuggle. Since Grace is deaf, she will take some time to adjust to her new surroundings and might get a little grumbly if she's startled. For that reason, we think she'd do best in a home without a ton of visitors or small children (visiting or living in the home) so that she can feel comfortable in her space.",

            "description": "LAWRENCEVILLE, GA\n\nGordo is a 7 year old Pekinese mix we pulled from a high kill shelter His chances where slim to leave the shelter alive due to his attitude problem.\nGordo was an owner surrender to the shelter and the previous owner sad, he just doesn't like to be petted....\n\nWell.... let me explain....!\n\nREAD CAREFULLY:\n\nOnce you bonded with Gordo yo can pet and cuddle him. He will let you brush him, he likes to go for walks, rides well in the car and does great with other dogs and cats. He is almost house broken and loves to hang out on the couch with you . Gordo likes to have a routine. \n\nHere comes the BUT.... you will have to go through a process with him so he opens up to you and until then he can be ugly sometimes. He grummels and growls... will bit you if you try to touch him to soon. He does not like to be picked up.\nThe way you get to him is to take him home, give him 48 hours and let him come to you. Don't force yourself on him. He will come.....He will even come and sit on your lap and snuggle up but it's all on his terms. He will not bite without warning but you have to listen to him telling you.\n\nGordo would love a low traffic home with no small children. If any then teenagers will be good. A single person or a couple, maybe even older, who are not looking for an active dog. Some rounds through the yard or a small stroll through the neighborhood will do it for Gordo. \nHis vision is very slightly impaired which is normal for that type of dog when they get older, but it doesn't hinder him from anything. He is otherwise in perfect health.\n\nIf you would like to meet our grouchy Gremlin looking cutie, please send us a message in order to receive an application.\nWe only meet with approved applicants by appointment. \n\nGordo's adoption fee is $ 250 which includes all vaccines, heartworm test, neuter and micro chip",

Please email the completed application to newleashrescue2018@gmail.com\n\nGracie May is a Shepherd mix that is about 2 years old. She weighs around 55 pounds, and came to us from a shelter where she had been surrendered by her family.  She was a great dog 95% of the time, but they were having some trouble when it came to her food and treats - she was being protective of resources including with people.    \n\nGracie can be active and playful and she loves to be outside.  She has been able to jump a 3 foot fence, so odds are she could probably also jump a 4 foot fence and would do best with a 5 or 6 foot fence where she can romp and lounge outside (even in the snow) and be safe.    Gracie gets a little anxious when a house gets too busy, so a quieter environment would be a better fit for her.\n\nIn her foster home, Gracie is good with the other dogs.  She is around other dogs 20 pounds and up.   She has played some chase but hasn't shown much interest in toys yet while she has her doggie pals around.    She doesn't care too much for puppies or younger dogs that want to be in her face.  Gracie wants to have her own space.    No cats or other small pets for Gracie in her new home. \n\nGracie can be a little picky about her food and likes to have some soft food mixed in.   In her foster home, she eats in her kennel and has been doing pretty good with it.  There are not high value treats given when the dogs in the house are around each other.   Due to the prior home history and the potential for concerns with food/treats - we would not recommend Gracie for living in a home with kids under age 8.  Any children in a new home would need to be able to respect Gracie's space, especially when it comes to food.    She does great in a plastic crate in her foster home, so it's easy to put her in the crate when needed.\n\nGracie will shed, so needs a family that will brush her to keep that pretty fur from getting tangled.  \n\nAdoption fee is $350.00 + tax (no checks)\n\nFoster to contact Katie @  kit_n_caboodle22@hotmail.com\n\nThis dog will be at our adoption event at the Woodbury PetSmart on Saturday from 11-2 looking for a home!\n\n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home. An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home. Sometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home and truly become comfortable. \n\nThere are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption, discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months. We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.",

I will retrieve a ball from the lake endlessly. If you bounce a ball on the sidewalk, I will jump up in the air to catch it. I'm not super keen on giving the ball back right away, because I just had so much fun catching it! But we can work out that part together. \n\nPeople who know me well think I would make a great addition to a family with children. I am very gentle and loyal. I'm also a good watchdog as I'll bark to notify my family of visitors, but then I'll welcome our visitors when my family lets me know we are all friends. \n\n In the past, I've gone through service dog training together with my previous owner.  I was top of my class, probably because I have such a friendly and calm disposition. To balance out all of the amazing qualities I have, you should also know that I have a penchant for adventure and have actually gotten out of a fenced yard to go explore and meet the neighbor dogs. Obviously this is a safety hazard for me, so I really should have a tall fence to keep me safe and sound with my new family.\n\nI am a loving and affectionate boy who is ready to start the next chapter of my life with my new family. Are you the family for me? Come meet me soon to find out. Love, Bubba\n",

Hosts open mic poetry slam 'sesh\"es at the local Ebz. \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Intake Date: 13 Dec 2020 ----- Date of Birth: July 22, 2018 ----- Breed: Belgian Tervuren Shephard / West German Shepherd ----- Size: 75 lbs ----- Status: owner surrender ----- Compatible with: Children, dogs. NO CATS ----- Suitable for: home with a securely fenced yard. Non negotiable----- Medical/Behavioral Needs: Rehab case. \n Little interaction and socializing outside of the home.  Fearful of new people, growly, standoffish. ----- Additional Notes: Bubba is a beauty.  He is NOT good with cats but seems great with everyone else so far.  Due to his size and not knowing how much exposure to small dogs, would recommend him for a home with medium dogs or larger.  His was purchased by a younger kid and he bred her and kept a puppy back.  Unfortunately, Bubba missed out on proper socializing and training.  And then decided that he wanted to go live the less tied down life and Bubba needed placement.  His mother reached out to us for assistance thankfully! He is a work in progress so an adopter MUST be aware of that and able to continue working with him!  He is NOT OK with cats, so he cannot go to a home with cats.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If interested in meeting and potentially adopting please read the adoption requirements and complete the adoption application located at forbellessake.org. Once processed and approved a meet and greet can be scheduled and if a match an adoption is finalized at that time. FBS standard adoption fee is $175 and all dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, and treated for any known medical needs. Breeds are not guaranteed but often a best guess. Housetraining is not guaranteed but crate training is worked on with all residents. If a yard is present, a secure fence is mandatory.",

Velcro dog and sometimes blanket hog.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Intake Date: 13 Dec 2020 ----- Date of Birth: Nov 2016 ----- Breed: Belgian Tervuren Shephard ----- Size: 65 lbs ----- Status: owner surrender ----- Compatible with: Children, dogs. NO CATS ----- Suitable for: home with a securely fenced yard. Non negotiable----- Medical/Behavioral Needs: None noted ----- Additional Notes: Bailee is a beautiful girl.  She is NOT good with cats but seems great with everyone else so far.  Due to her size and not knowing how much exposure to small dogs, would recommend her for a home with medium dogs or larger.  She was purchased by a younger kid and he bred her and then decided that he wanted to go live the less tied down life and she needed placement.  His mother reached out to us for assistance thankfully!  Luckily, she seems to have had a great puppyhood which allows her to be a pretty well rounded dog.  She is NOT OK with cats, so she cannot go to a home with cats.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If interested in meeting and potentially adopting please read the adoption requirements and complete the adoption application located at forbellessake.org. Once processed and approved a meet and greet can be scheduled and if a match an adoption is finalized at that time. FBS standard adoption fee is $175 and all dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, and treated for any known medical needs. Breeds are not guaranteed but often a best guess. Housetraining is not guaranteed but crate training is worked on with all residents. If a yard is present, a secure fence is mandatory.",

Patch has been friendly with all people and dogs that he has met. Since he is so large and wiggly when meeting people, we dont suggest him around any young children. He was surrendered to animal care and control due to his dad getting divorced and losing his home. So poor Patch's whole life has been flipped up side down. Since he has been with us he has showed resource guarding to any bones he has had. He takes treats very sweet and is also ok with stuffed animals but bones he will guard, growl and lunge over. This is why we would like to find him an adult only home with expierience with XL breeds. If you think you might be the right fit for Patch please fill out the application below. He is neutered and UTD on all vaccines and preventative.",

He was so scared and devastated when they left him behind to move on to their own life. Unfortunately in the three years they had him they never socialized him so he is terrified of strangers unless they are kids! He absolutely loves kids and he feels safe around them. He seems to be good with other dogs and shared a home with one but a meet and greet with any potential fursiblings would be necassary. When he first meets people he will growl and back up but after a few meetings he will greet you with a wag of a tail and happiness. Sharky was born with an overbite which makes his snout look like a shark! It does not affect him in anyway and just adds to his character. If you think you could be Sharky's hero fill out the application today! Any potential adopters would have to come and meet him a few times but it will be worth it in the end!",

If you enjoy paying attention to everything around you, Twist has that in common with you.\n\nShe was born October 14, 2020 to a Poodle mom and a Pug dad.  She is crate trained, ready and willing to continue her leash training since she likes getting outside.  \n\nTwist is a warm, gentle, and playful puppy.  Some of her siblings have very high energy while Twist has middle of the road type energy.\n\nShe gets along with other dogs and people, but we don't know about cats because there are not any in her foster home.\n\nThe litter was surrendered because the family could not afford the care.  Our rescue group vetted the parents, including sterilizing them, of course.\n\n\n*.  *.   *.  *.  *.   *.  *.  *.   *.  *.  *.   *.  *.  *.   *.  *.  *.   *.  *.  *.   *.  *.  *.   *.  *.  *.   *.  *.  *.   *.  \n\nWe do not complete DNA tests on our rescued pups. If we do not know who the mom or dad is for sure, we guess; we use Gozer, a iPhone dog breed identifier. And, we look at their paws, ears, snout, coloring, and body build. Sometimes we are not spot on. And, remember too that even if you know the supposed dominant breed in your new puppy or adult dog, it does not mean that those particular genes will dominate your dog's personality. :)\n\nAPPLICATIONS ARE ONLINE @ karmicrescue.org",

When she initially came into the shelter she had a terrible case of mange, but shes all healed up and a very happy, lively puppy!\n\nMercy is a potty-pad trained. She hasnt been exposed to many people but shes very sweet and cuddly to those she knows. She gets along well with other dogs but likes to chase the cat when the cat runs. If the cat is sitting still shes a little intimidated.\n\nMercy is all puppy - she is vocal, energetic and playful, and in the process of learning basic behaviors and what are appropriate chewing item as she can be fairly mouthy. She would do best in a home with children at least 10 yo and other friendly dogs, but would do equally well with a single person or quiet couple. \nTo adopt Mercy please complete an application at www.sloppykisses.org/adoptions!",

Spook is very nervous with new people but LOVES to take snacks and enjoys morning cuddles on the couch. Spook must have a physically fenced yard and other dogs in his home. He has not been cat tested but we don't expect an issue with dog saavy cats. \n\nSpook gets along with most dogs, but does best with dogs who aren't afraid to stand up for themselves. He prefers females of any size and neutered males. He can be very playful and LOVES to cuddle with them (no matter how they feel about it)! Spook has just started to show interest in tennis balls and other toys.\n\nSpook will not go to an apartment. He is working on leash training, but he MUST have a fenced yard. \n\nHis adoption fee is $150 and comes with vaccinations, microchip and neuter.",

Their owners must move into a relative's home where there are already two large dogs so they need to come to us to find a new life.  Who are these two?  The girl, on the right, is a pudge.  She is a Golden/German Shepherd mix and she weighs about a hundred pounds!  Getting her down to a more svelte figure will be very good for her.  She is 8 years old.  The boy is a Golden/Lab cross.  He's 7 years old and is no tiny dog at 85 lbs.  Both are great with other dogs and with kids. (We got photos of both dogs with toddlers crawling all over them!). They haven't been around cats so we don't know their reaction.  They are bonded to one another and will need to find a foster home that can look after both of them until they are adopted into the same home.\n\nWe require an application, phone interview and home visit prior to adoption. We will not discuss a specific dog with an applicant until the adoption process is completed. Our adoption fee for dogs under 8 months is $300, dogs between 9 months and 7 years is $250 and our super seniors are $125. Please visit our website for more information. Thank you!",

She is a happy, friendly girl who loves people of all ages and will need a securely fenced yard and a resident dog to model appropriate canine behavior.  Lily is learning to walk on a leash and play with toys and is house trained when kept on a schedule..\n\nAdoption donation for Lily is $400 which goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our rescue dogs.\n\nWag N Train Terrier Rescue adopts to applicants living outside our geographical area as long as we are able to find a volunteer able to perform the required home visit.  If approved, the applicant is required to travel to Omaha, NE to pick up their newly adopted dog.  We do not arrange transport, or fly our rescue dogs without a human \"pet nanny\".  All of our dogs coming from a commercial breeding background require a securely fenced yard AND a resident dog as a companion unless stated otherwise in the dog's bio.  Please note, invisible or underground fencing is not considered secure or appropriate containment.  Adoption applications can be found at www.wagntrainterrierrescue.com/adoption-information",

I am approximately two years old and I weigh 55 pounds.  I may be a plot hound mix.  I certainly have the ears, coat and build for it.  My vet has determined that due to a previous untreated eye injury my vision is extremely limited in one eye.  This does not affect me in any way and just adds to my charm.\n\nI am a friendly girl and currently in a foster home.  I absolutely adore my humans and this includes the kiddos.  I am very playful and love my squeaky toys.  I am working on my leash training and doing quite well with that.  I am a smart, friendly, beautiful girl.  I get along with other dogs\u2026both large and small.  I am not a fan of cats so my people are going to say no to a home with furry felines.  I would make the perfect hiking dog and would love to go adventuring.  If you want to relax, you should know I love to cuddle and have big dreams of being a lap dog. \n     \nI am spayed, microchipped, up to date on vaccines and healthy.\n",

            "description": "Wow! This boy is very handsome! Say hello to Patrick! <3\n\n\"Patrick Mahomes is a little skittish and shy at first, but he has really opened up this past week with us. He is such a sweet, gentle dog. He is a sensitive soul, and it is easy to forget he is a dog-he seems very much like a person! He looks like an Akbash, but could be a pyr/lab mix. Whatever his breeds, he has double dew claws, a soft, fluffy white medium length coat and the curliest white tail. He weighs around 86 pounds, and is a little underweight. He'll be a bit closer to 100 pounds ideally. Patrick's favorite activities are spending time with his people (this is his FAVORITE activity), and exploring the backyard. He loves watching for squirrels! He is a giant puppy, and will lope around the yard when he's excited-it is super cute to see! He is such a sweetheart. He enjoys watching movies with his family, and will occasionally step onto the couch for snuggles. He is a real gem, and his future family is going to luck out with him. He is such a nice dog!\"\n\nGood Afternoon folks, what a pleasure it is to meet all of you! My name is Patrick Mahomes, and I am a year old male Great Pyrenees mix. I am either mixed with Akbash or Labrador Retriever. I am a very handsome boy that will top out close to 100lbs. I was found just wandering around. After serving my stray hold and being unreclaimed I came into this pawtastic rescue! I am now ready to find my forever family and am very excited! \n\nMY PERSONALITY: \nI am laid back and calm, but still a giant puppy. I can get pretty playful with the other dogs. I love to romp around outside! It is pretty cute to watch me having fun. I am shy when meeting new people. I love people, but may back away or act a little nervous when I first meet someone. I haven't been to many public settings but did great with a picnic in my fosters backyard. I am shy, so will act a little cautious at first, but then I am all about getting pet! I am uninterested in playing fetch. I prefer spending my time watching for squirrels with my fosters dog, Harry. I don't seem to be much of a water dog. I have picked up some stuffed toys, and carried them around a bit. I think I'll start to play with toys as I settle in. I do great in the car, but am pretty scared of getting into the car. I am pretty scared on the leash. I am shy and can be pretty stubborn. My fosters have been working on getting me more used to a leash, but my new family will need to keep working with me. When I get scared, I will lay down. I am great with other dogs. Since I am pretty shy, it takes me a bit to realize the other dogs aren't going to hurt me. Once I feel safe, I will play all over the yard with the dogs! I have not been around any cats. I think I would do well with kids, but they will need to be patient and understanding about me being a shy dog. Loud noises and sudden movements scare me, so if I am around really active kids, I may \"hide\" behind a door or piece of furniture.\n\nMY HOUSE MANNERS:\nI can be trusted with the full run of the house. I am not much of a chewer. I love milk bones, oinkies, and dog treats, but haven't been interested in nylabones or rawhide rolls. I haven't shown any signs of having food aggression or resource guarding. Occasionally, I will jump up to give my fosters dad some hugs, but am not really jumpy. I do believe I would do good in an apartment setting, IF my new owner is okay with working with me on my leash training. I am not a big barker, but will bark if I hear something suspicious all of a sudden. I am protective of my family and a guardian, after all. I have free roam of the house when my fosters are away. At night, I sleep in the bedroom. I would prefer being on the bed, but Shade and Harry(my fosters dogs) are pretty bossy about the bed being theirs! I would love to sleep close to my people, though. I am potty trained, but not kennel trained. \n\nTo my new family: \nHere are the things that I am looking for in my new family! \n\n-I am a very easy going dog, and am all about being with my family. I think I would do well with just about any family. I would enjoy doing activities like walks and car rides (once I warm up and understand I am safe). I would also do well in a calmer household too. I'd be a GREAT work from home dog-I won't interrupt any conference calls, and would like to nap next to my human. I get along with dogs, so I'd do well with another dog. I really prefer being with my people, so would do well as an only dog, too.\n\nSooo....if you give me your hand, I will give you my paw! And from there, we will start an amazing new journey...TOGETHER! Apply for me at https://www.pyrpawsandfluffytailsrescue.com/adoption-app \n\nMy adoption fee is $225. That includes my DHLPP, Rabies, and Bordatella shots. I will be micro-chipped, heart-worm tested, ehrlichia tested, have a fecal done, be de-wormed, be spayed/neutered and will be current on my heart-worm and flea/tick prevention.\n\nLastly, I am being fostered in Tulsa, OK. I have no qualms about going out of state if my adopters don't live in Oklahoma. All I ask is they come pick me up. Those transports are too stressful and this rescue doesn't put us on those or ship us.",

She was found on the streets of Arkansas before being rescued. Willow's foster mom reports that she uses doggy doors to use the bathroom and loves being on the couch. Like with every dog we recommend following a two week shutdown to help ensure success in your adoption. \n\nOther information from her foster: Willow would be happiest in a home  where someone is home more then not. She does need a fenced in yard and doggy doors is ideal so if she starts feeling anxious she can go outside and not feel so \"cooped up\". She needs a family who understand that rescue dogs need time to decompress to ensure a successful adoption. She is quirky and at times is still learning how to play and interact with other dogs. She would be fine as an only dog (can be only dog, does NOT need to be only dog) or a dog her size or bigger. I would not recommend cats or small children \u2026 quiet and relaxed is her speed.\n\n\nWillow has been vet checked, is UTD on shots, spayed, dewormed with Drontal, on Heartgard and Flea/Tick Prevention. She is also microchipped. \n\nIf interested in applying to adopt with us please fill out an application and one of our application processors will contact you as soon as possible. We appreciate your patience.\nhttps://goo.gl/AzrASu\n\nThank you for saving a life by choosing to adopt :)",

            "description": "Jax is a GSDx who is approximately 2 years of handsome awesomeness. Jax has a shorter tail (no pesky table clearing abilities here) and is a micro-pop at just approximately 60 pounds - his penciled toes are adorable! He is crate-trained and housebroken. He loves to be inside with his person and sticks like glue to his human friends. The concept of a leash seems new to him, but his paw-some foster family is helping him learn about it.\n\nJax was confiscated from his previous home with other dogs (including Britta), but we do not know if he has the ability to get along with small dogs or cats. He is up-to-date on vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. Jax is housebroken and crate-trained. He can be vocal when he gets excited or nervous (not in an aggressive manner, just expressive!), but quiets down when he is told to. Jax has a moderate energy level and would benefit from an active home <3 \n\nWould you like to adopt Jax or another rescued GSD? goto shepherdswithoutborders.org",

She is a sweet shy girl who may benefit from having a dog friend to show her confidence. She loves people, but seems to not been exposed to many things; cars, leashes, and things, like a vet, seem to terrify her (no aggression at all, just flattens to the ground and needs to be carried). With time, confidence and some training, we know Britta will come out of her shell - Don\u2019t worry sweet girl... you\u2019re safe now! \n\nBritta would be best placed with children over 8 years of age (she is learning not to jump when excited).  We do not know if Britta has been exposed to small dogs or cats.\n\nTo apply to adopt Britta, goto shepherdswithoutborders.org",

            "description": "Meet Ryder.............a true survivor! He's looking for a dedicated and qualified person who can walk through his healing process with him.\n\nRyder is a handsome eight-year-old male Pointer/Pit mix who has endured some big-time neglect. However, he also has proven to be on the road to a very happy/healthy recovery. He is such an awesome dog, and given everything he's been through any dog lover would want to get him out of the shelter ASAP. Even the staff realize it\u2019s just not the right environment for Ryder.\n\nRyder continues to recover physically. He has demonstrated a few situational behavior issues when around strangers. As we advocate for his needs, we are looking for a very particular forever or foster home so he can prosper into new life adventures.\n\nRyder was found back in April literally boarded up with another dog inside an abandoned car. He was absolutely emaciated and covered head to toe with infected sores and bite wounds from the other dog. Even his poor eyes and the bottoms of his feet were infected. The dogs had both been alone in the car, starving, for who knows how long. Ryder was only about 39 pounds when he was found. A month later, Ryder was up to a healthy 65 pounds. He has been on various medications and treatments over the several months as a team of dedicated people try to get his skin, eyes and paws back to normal. This guy has made HUGE progress and looks like a totally different dog. He's probably going to be recovering, on meds, and needing semi-regular check-ups for a while. He last vet visit was in August. They started him on a new course of antibiotics, eye meds, and skin meds. He has been growly with male veterinarians when he's first met them, although he was fine with them after just a few minutes.\n\nBehaviorally, Ryder is your typical smart, super-goofball Pitbull. He\u2019s very intelligent and eager, lots of healthy energy for his age, good on-leash, totally housebroken, very affectionate and responsive with people he knows. He has done well with most of the other dogs he's met. Ryder is generally more comfortable with women. He has been kennel-reactive to strangers walking by, both male and female. Mostly just barking, but sometimes he will lunge at the gate if the stranger (with a backpack, hat and/or sunglasses) lingers. Since he was a homeless person's dog for the majority of his life, his protectiveness is quite understandable. His triggers will be important to respect as Ryder learns to increase his ability to trust. Potential! Potential! Potential! He\u2019s almost there!\nIn the right foster or forever home, Ryder is going to do amazingly well! He\u2019s such a great dog when he's in a comfortable setting. Clearly, he has been through many difficult situations. He has not given up!\n\nIf interested, please send a brief description of what you can offer Ryder. ellen.second.chance@gmail.com",

            "description": "Meet Chewie. He is about 2 years old.and is being fostered in the Philadelphia area. He's neutered and up to date on his vaccines. He's heartworm negative and available by filling out an adoption application on MAJR.org\nChewie is a sad story. He is a sweet little Jack mix who is around 2. He ended up in a shelter . Because he is cute, he was adopted out several times. He came back twice as a stray and both times the adopters said they didn't want him back . They said he had too much energy and he barked too much.  The third home returned him because the owner said he bit her slipper when she tried to put it on.\nChewie has been with his foster home for about 3 months . When he first came to his foster home, he was a mess. He had no social skills  and seemed to nip the other dogs when he got excited (which he still does but only with one dog and he is learning that is not a good idea).. He was reactive with other dogs but not in a mean way. He just wanted to meet other dogs and didn't know how to react so he overreacted. , He is reactive on a leash and we are working with him on that. He barks in the crate but is relatively quiet outside the crate (he will chortle) and will settle quickly at night in the crate.  He is learning to be a dog and a companion. He is smart but he's like that nerdy kid with the misbuttoned shirt . He would do best in a home with no children and a home that is willing to continue to work with him ...maybe take him to a positive and knowledgeable obedience classes or give him a job like nose work or barn hunting. He is smart but for his first 2 years he was never asked to think and problem solve as a companion. He just needs that time and patience. He is sweet and loves to cuddle and he is willing to share a lap .\nMAJR is a small foster based  rescue. We do not have a kennel with visitation hours. If you are interested in adopting a dog from us you must fill out an application and be approved for adoption. Thank you",

            "description": "Hi my name is Baby, but my friends here at MVPC call my Granny. I am not sure why I ended up at the shelter, but let me tell you, it was hard on these old bones. Shelters are no place for any dog, let alone an old gal like me. I have two speeds...nothing and slow. I want to nap and eat. That\u2019s pretty much it. Can you tell taking my picture isn\u2019t a favorite of mine? Food is though. Love food. I am good with other animals, but I am over playing and shenanigans. Cats, dogs, whatever...they are all fine. I just want to lie down and chew on my bones until dinner. I am not a fan of having my nails cut, but other than that, I am not too grumpy. If you just want to exist through life, and eat, I am your girl. Don\u2019t leave food near me though...all\u2019s fair if you walk away. The shelter isn\u2019t too sure what my breed is, so lab was the guess. I was a pretty girl in my hay day, now I am aged and classy.\n\nADOPTION FEE: $200 (All MVPC dogs are heartworm-tested, completely vetted, spayed/neutered, microchipped, crate-trained and house-trained)\n\nA $100 hold fee is required for approved applications and will be applied to the full adoption fee at the time of the home visit. \nADOPTER: Dog experience\nBIRTHDAY: Estimated 11 years\nFENCE: Preferred (an electric fence is not an acceptable form of containment)\nDOGS: Yes, but I don\u2019t want to play\nCATS: Sure\nKIDS: Yes, over 8 please, I am an old lady \n\nINQUIRIES: ALL inquiries begin with a submitted adoption application, which is found on our website, www.miamivalleypitcrew.com. We do not adopt to individuals under the age of 25. We prefer male/female dog pairings unless both already reside in the home. \n\nDO NOT: USE THE PETFINDER CONTACT/ADOPT BUTTONS--we are unable to monitor those and you will not receive a response. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: We are volunteer based and a home visit is required; we have a two-hour adoption radius from Kettering, OH for our adult dogs and 75 miles for our puppies. Exceptions for our ADULT dogs only, though rare, may be made on a case-by-case basis but we must be able to do a home visit. Thank you for your understanding!\n\nProfessional Valentine\u2019s Day pictures courtesy of the talented Gwen Estep Photography, Inc. https://www.facebook.com/GwenEstepPhotography/",

            "description": "Interview with Squeaks! 1.WHY DID THEY NAME YOU SQUEAKS? Because when i want to do something i kind of squeak instead of whines. I just cute like dat. 2.HOW ARE YOU SO CUTE?! I dont know...someting called genetics? They arent scary, they dont really tell me what breed i am based on looks, and I cant eat or see them so i dont really know what they is...but they made me cute. 3. WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE THING TO DO? Walks and pettings and playing with things but mostly snacks and walks ohhh and when my friends come say hi and love me but walks alot....dis is hard one! 4.DO YOU HAVE DOG FRIENDS HERE? At first they are scary and I make sure I stay safe but then when i see they are nice i am very nice too and we are best friends fast and forever. They can't be scary though. I really dont like scary things. 5. WHATS YOUR DREAM HOME? One with all the walks and snacks, and maybe nothing scary...i would really like a comfy bed and lots of loves and maybe i can sleep on the humans bed? I hear some humans like that....Do humans have genetics? I want them to have those too if i have them. We can have a bunch of different ones and celebrate them. OH! I also am kind of nervous of little humans so lets go really slow with those or none of those....i fink they are called kids. 6. WHATS ONE PROMISE YOU MAKE YOUR FUTURE HOME? To always try my best and always love dem and never to give up on dem. Adopt this cute guy today! Hes just too precious!",

He is an active pre-senior super smart loyal boy with moderate activity level! He likes daily walks and would enjoy a game of ball. After proper exercise, he is happy to settle in with his people.\n\nSully\u2019s future family will greatly benefit from participating in training classes and his trainer will offer a complimentary training session to his new family. He wants to please and is oh so smart! He loves routine physical activity and truly wants to hang out with responsible people who are very invested in his happiness.  Sully would prefer to be in a single pet home with no small children.  He is making great progress on his leash skills in his foster/trainer's home and he has been learning how to just kick-back & trust. He is enjoying that calmness.

I am great in my crate and am even pretty good on a leash! Contrary to what you might think, I am perfectly fine with other dogs and I play very appropriately! I am stubborn and strong, and am looking for a kind, fun, snuggly family who will take me on adventures, then snuggle in at night. \n\nADOPTION FEE: $200 (All MVPC dogs are heartworm-tested, completely vetted, spayed/neutered, microchipped, crate-trained and house-trained)\n\nA $100 hold fee is required for approved applications and will be applied to the full adoption fee at the time of the home visit. \nADOPTER: Dog experience\nBIRTHDAY: Estimated 3-4 years\nFENCE: Required (an electric fence is not an acceptable form of containment)\nDOGS: Yes\nCATS: No, I want to chase the one in my foster home, but can be redirected\nKIDS: Yes, over 5 please\n\nINQUIRIES: ALL inquiries begin with a submitted adoption application, which is found on our website, www.miamivalleypitcrew.com. We do not adopt to individuals under the age of 25. We prefer male/female dog pairings unless both already reside in the home. \n\nDO NOT: USE THE PETFINDER CONTACT/ADOPT BUTTONS--we are unable to monitor those and you will not receive a response. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: We are volunteer based and a home visit is required; we have a two-hour adoption radius from Kettering, OH for our adult dogs and 75 miles for our puppies. Exceptions for our ADULT dogs only, though rare, may be made on a case-by-case basis but we must be able to do a home visit. Thank you for your understanding!\n\nProfessional Valentine\u2019s Day pictures courtesy of the talented Gwen Estep Photography, Inc. https://www.facebook.com/GwenEstepPhotography/",
