IF you have small children, he may not be a fit (several families w/small children loved him but were concerned of his energy level w/their kids.) He IS a puppy whose life has been crated due to his broken leg/surgery/recovery, so WILL have high energy.\n\nArcher is so sweet and so loving. He loves to play/walk/hike/run! He was not well socialized with other dogs but is much better now that he's with a foster who is a dog trainer. We would like Archer to continue that life - with another playful dog.\n\nArcher is getting some training w/his dog trainer foster person so is better than he was a week ago (this bio revised 1/25/21).\n\nArcher is SUCH a GEM! All that meet him say \"I love him.\" Current foster said \"he's such a smart dog and listens well and learns quickly!\"\n\nMETRO ATLANTA ONLY\n\nEmail\n\npassionforanimals5017@gmail.com\n\nif interested in Archer",

If a dog receives multiple applications, we operate on a best-fit basis, not first come first served.***\n\nHi! My name is Novacora, but foster mom usually calls me Nova or Novabear! I am a very sweet, loyal, and snuggly girl once I bond with my people. I am the biggest snugglebug! My favorite pillow is my foster mom or whatever pillow she's using -- sometimes both! I love to curl up next to her, and I can't wait to do the same with my forever family!\n\nI came to my foster mom with heartworms and have received treatment through Second Chance. I am now finally able to run around, which I still only do from time to time. You see, foster mom says I am a medium to low energy girl, with random spurts of energy.\n\nI love to go for walks, take naps, do zoomies (every now and then) around the yard, and most of all, spend time with my loved ones. \n\nI am looking for a forever home where I can be the only four-legged princess in the house and get all of the attention. I've been around kids and like them a lot! \n\nI am spayed, up-to-date on vaccinations, microchipped, have been dewormed, and am current on my monthly heartworm and flea/tick preventatives. My adoption fee is $300. If you think I could be the one for you, please fill out an adoption application on our website: www.secondchancenc.org. Thank you!",

Let's just say that our \"\"owners\"\" weren't very good at having pets...\nWe were rescued by the good people of Houston Animal Rescue Team - HART and as hard as it's going to be, we are looking for a home all together. We aren't cute puppies anymore and we are of course heartworm positive. That gives us very little chance to find a forever home.\nTo meet us, please fill out an adoption application on https://www.hartrescue.com/adoption-foster-application-formTo meet me, please fill out an adoption application on https://www.hartrescue.com/adoption-process",

She is the perfect companion. She gets along great with kids and adults. \n\nAlthough she is extremely energetic and crazy at times, she also LOVES to take naps. Petunia snores like a human and wow is it cute! \n\nWhile she enjoys playing with other dogs, Petunia does not realize how strong she is, and can get over-excited, especially on walks. She would be best in a home with no other animals because she loves to be the center of attention! She does wonderful with every human, and meeting new people is one of her favorite activities! If the home does have another dog, it must be a female - no males, please. \n\nPetunia is such a smart girl and ready for continued training. She catches on quickly. She is the most loyal companion and would be the perfect fit for someone who is active outdoors but likes to snuggle occasionally too. Fill out an application at cfp-nc.org/adopt!\n\nIf you are interested in this animal please start by filling out an adoption application at <a href=\"\"http://www.cfp-nc.org/adopt\"\">CFP-NC.org/adopt</a> and we will get in touch with you.",

            "description": "Meet Noah! Noah is one of about 50 dogs rescued from a neglectful hoarding situation in South Georgia back in early July. Some of the dogs on the property had been living inside and were more socialized, able to be adopted quickly. But sadly, there was another group that had lived their whole lives outside with little human interaction. It has taken a couple of months of living in a foster home for them to start realizing that there are good people in this world who will love and cherish them. These dogs have come amazingly far since being rescued but do still carry the weight of their previous life with them. As such, they have very specific adoption requirements listed below. Please understand, we have taken 3 months to get to know these dogs and what they need to succeed. The adoption requirements are not arbitrary but are what is needed for them to lead happy, healthy lives and as such no exceptions to these requirements will be allowed. \n\n \n\nNoah is about a two and a half years old and under 25 lbs. Hes a sweet, playful boy but still a bit on the shy side. He needs a patient adopter who is going to give him the time and space he needs to adjust and get comfortable in a new home. Given that the best teachers for dogs lacking confidence are other dogs, Noah also must have other confident dogs in the home with at least one of them being under 30 lbs and playful. He is learning to walk on a leash but has yet to gain enough confidence to go to the bathroom on leash and does require a SECURELY fenced yard - solid wood privacy fence only (minimum 6 ft); chain link, wrought iron, or other types of fencing are not sufficient. Lastly, given that Noah is still learning to trust people, he will not do well with the unpredictable nature of children. Homes with teenagers may be considered on a case by case basis, depending on the experience level of the family. \n\n \n\nWe do understand that the above requirements greatly narrows the pool of potential adopters and may even scare some people away. Noah is most definitely a work in progress but we cannot even begin to explain how rewarding it is to watch the transformation of a dog like this who has never known love before. Once they learn to love and trust, they are so very very grateful and the amount of love they have to give and their loyalty knows no bounds. If you are interested in becoming part of Noahs continuing story, email adrienne@rescuemega.org or fill out an adoption application on our website- www.rmgdogs.org",

            "description": "Rossi is an amazing dog who knows a wide variety of commands and is obedience trained very well. He loves playing ball and has been good with dogs big and small as well as with kids. (We recommend no young children because heelers have a classic nipping tendency to herd children and some children may view this as aggressive. Older children should have no problem.) He is obviously incredibly intelligent and he has a huge personality. He loves attention and lives to please.\n\nHe is a border collie/heeler mix and favors the heeler personality. He cannot have ivermectin based heartworm preventative as he likely has the MDR1 mutation that makes him sensitive to it. \n\nRossi is up to date on all of his shots including Bordetella and rabies. He has 6 months of HW preventative and obviously is HW negative. The lump on his hip was tested. It is a harmless cyst and nothing to worry about. His prior owners recommend no small animals due to food agression but has been fine (when food isn't involved with cats and other dogs both big and small). \n\nHis prior owners say....\n\nHe always alerts us of copperheads. The intensity and pitch of his bark changes. He has done it three time this year alone. He got bit once several years back and is extra vigilant about alerting his family to them He is inside while we are home and outside while we are gone because if there is food left out or to be found, he will find it. He knows how to flip up the lid on his dog food bin so we put something heavy on top when we leave him in because of rain.\n\nHe respects his fenced yard. Before we replace it the fence that was here it was really lose fitting horse type fencing. He could push the fencing out at the bottom and squeeze under. He got out while we were gone and when we got home we had a dead chicken, he was covered in dirt and debris but he was waiting on our front porch when we got home (but he had been places). It happened a few times. We put up a good solid fence and he has never dug under or tried to climb it.\n\nHe has always slept inside in his crate in our room. He actually likes it. There are times he beats us upstairs and will push up the door and go in on his own.\n\nBoyd Animal Hospital and TCAP have been the other places he has had vacations and HW tests. He has never been to the vet due to illness or injury. They lump on his hip was the only concern and they tested it in Denton...it is just a cyst nothing to worry about. \n\nWe have camped several times with him and have taken him to public places. I would obviously say the handler should confident and understand heelers. He did wonderfully.\n\nVery obedient. Energetic and so so funny. He loves to play with his toys and his people. My daughter has a large lab/shepherd mix. She and Rossi absolutely love one another so she brings her over so they can play. He just needs people who know heelers and no small animals to avoid food aggression issues.",

She found herself in a shelter with a badly broken back leg, and her family never came for her. \n\nMila is now all well, spayed and ready for adoption. She\u2019s had some formal training and SCGSR will provide training sessions with our trainer for her new family. She\u2019s a good girl who needs a family who has experience with protective females and has strong yet gentle leadership qualities.\n\nIn the right home Mila may do fine and enjoy having other dog friends. Please email Marcy with any questions about Mila.",

Who could ask for more?! Heather is a very smart pup and knows how to sit, wait, and come! To make things fun, she is working on laying down and how to shake! There is no need to worry about constantly entertaining her as she is happy to grab a toy and chew on it for a while. Her manners are incredible as she is house trained and crate trained. She is so comfortable with her crate, to the point where she just jumps in it without needing to convince her to get it and sometimes like to hang out in it. You will find she likes to be around you and follow you around the house too see what's happening so she doesn't miss out on the action. She loves walks and is working on getting better on the leash. A little patience and she will get there! There is no doubt Heather will be the perfect companion for your home! Follow Heather on Instagram @adopt.heatherfeather",

My mesmerizing eyes, my gorgeous amber coat, the cutest ears ever and muscles that don't quit. The volunteers say I am the complete package and I'd have to agree. WOOF! Boy, they know me from nose to tail.\n\nI am a little aloof, but love to be loved. Rub my ears, give me a treat and I melt, but spending quality time with my family means the world to me..\n\nI look forward to my daily walks and start off cautiously checking out my surroundings and sniffing all the fabulous smells. Move slowly, give me a little time and space and once I feel grounded it's giddy up and go, go, go. I do have a little, secret, I also like to jog. When I get the urge, off I go trotting along with the wind in my ears, a smile on my face and you in tow. These short bursts, often called High Intensity Training (HIT), make me one good looking pup and is great for your health too. It's a win, win for you and me.\n\nAnother little secret.. I do need to be the only pet in the home. No dogs or cats and no dog beach/dog park. You see, I'm ok being around other dogs, but I'm not one to share my personal space! I have even worked with a trainer on how to be well behaved, and you will definitely need to be on board to continue my awesome training!\n\nSo dear friends, if you are looking for a hunka, hunka burning love who has it going on, I am the family member for you. Trust me, you won't regret it. I will fill your hearts with endless love, wags and kisses and you get to say, \" Elvis is in the house!\"\n\n*no other pets/adult home only/no apartment! Need big dog experience, no first time dog owners!\n\n*Please complete our online application for further consideration. We do best fit for both dog and family, and completing an application is not a guarantee of approval.",

We don\u2019t know her backstory, but we imagine being left to take care of herself wasn\u2019t easy.  Amble was quite fearful of strangers when she came into our program, but she allowed our veterinary team to check her out and vaccinate her without even the tiniest growl of protest.  She would love to have someone who either has some experience with shy dogs or someone willing to pour a little extra love and patience into her to help build up her level of comfort.  She would thrive in a quieter adult home with a strong routine she could settle into with you.  She is gentle and seems very much to want to foster a connection with you.  She just needs a guide who can show her how to feel more comfortable in the world.  As someone with a very shy dog from a similar background, we can tell you these dogs can \u2014 and do \u2014 love you back, with a depth of love and appreciation that is hard to describe but amazing to experience.  Amble just needs someone willing to take time and build trust.  The payoff is as sweet as it gets, friend. \n",

If you have questions concerning a specific animal, PLEASE fill out an application and the foster parent will be in touch. We will not arrange any home visits with any of our dogs and cats until your application is processed. Please understand our foster parents are precious to our 2nd Chance family; without them we cannot function, so we do our best to not burden them with multiple appointments. Our foster parents will choose their top 3 applications and arrange home visits with these applicants. The adopter will be chosen at that time. The process can take anywhere from a week to a month. We want to make sure our little furry ones are placed in their 'forever home' and never have to go through a rehoming again!My name is Murphy. I was kept outside all my life in a fenced in area with rats as big as rabbits :( My owners never touched me. I am partially blind. The officers finally came to the house and took me and my 3 brothers. One of them died at the shelter :( Now 2nd Chance has the rest of us. I want to be in a home where I get to be your one and only. I am already potty trained! Don't worry about my blindness I get around just fine :)Please fill out an adoption application:\nAdoption application (Dog)\nAdoption Application (Cat)\n\nPlease understand we do not adopt out dogs to\nfamilies with children under the age of 5. We do not adopt dogs to renters. Some dogs will have fence requirements while others may not.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment. The dogs and cats in our system find themselves there, for the most part, because their humans did not have the same loyalty to them as they did to their owners. We do not take the adoption process lightly, and will do everything in our power to make sure the animal is placed correctly the first time around for your sake and theirs. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!",

            "description": ". Scrappy Doo is a 3-to-4-year-old, 21-lb rat terrier mix currently being fostered in Bradenton,FL. She is very shy and timid in new situations, but will blossom if given a day to get used to her new situation. She is a bit untrusting with new people, and again needs a bit of time to acclimate. It took her two days in my home as a new foster. She is great with other dogs, great with people once she knows you. If given the chance, she can be a velcro dog, but she is not given that opportunity here. She will do well with another kind quiet dog of any size. She loves to run outdoors and gets the zoomies frequently. She would need a fenced yard. She does know basic commands, has no issues crating. I have seen no resource guarding. She does have prey drive, no cats or small furry creatures. She is learning to explore water so swimming may be in her future. I have had her a week so we have not explored toys yet. Quiet and unassuming. Great dog for an older couple or folks that want an easy going pup. She will take advantage if you are not the boss as with any terrier. Would prefer someone with terrier experience please. She has had a bad case of flea allergies and demodex, the hair on her back is filling in nicely.",

I am fully house trained, and don't mind a crate, but my favorite spot is either on my bed, or snuggled on top of a blanket on the couch with you!  I love to dig and run, and can not wait for it to snow! Playing in the snow is something I really enjoy!  I also look forward to daily walks, as long as I am on my leash.  I love to do \"work\" by sniffing out treats, and practicing different commands like sit, wait, and down.  I also really enjoy working to get some mashed sweet potato and peanut butter out of my Kong! I am a bit nervous when I first meet you, unless you have another dog that is a bit more confident, then I am much more comfortable.  I would do best in a home with no children, and at least one other dog to play with.  I can take my cues from them, and know that I have nothing to be nervous about!  I have been to a board and train, and understand \"place\", as well as the proper way to walk with a leash.  I am such a snuggle bug, and truly love those I am around.\"\n\nShelby is a 5 year old female and weighs about 70 pounds. She is gorgeous and will make a wonderful new BFF ! She is house trained, healthy, up to date on her shots and is spayed. Shelby is currently in CT and can travel to her new home ASAP.  Shelby would love to join an active person looking to add a second dog to their pack.  Her adoption donation is $350. \n\n*Unless stated otherwise, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, on flea/tick product and heart worm prevention medicine (if older than 5 months) and micro chipped prior to adoption.\n\n*Please note that while we do our best to accurately state the breed or breed mix of a dog, we often have very limited information to draw from. Identifying the breed without pedigrees and information on heritage can be very challenging! \n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our animals, please go to www.angelsamongusanimalrescue.org and fill out an online adoption application. Thank you!",

Her puppies were beautiful and she was a great mom.  They were all adopted to families and we continued working with Dolly to help her become better socialized.  She is doing great and we think it is time to place her for adoption.  We are hoping we find just the right family that will be patient and give her the love and training needed.  \nShe would probably do best with children 8 yrs and up and a fenced yard.  We arent sure about cats but  she doesnt appear to have a prey drive. Call 402 846 5100 if interested and please fill out an application.",

We do not always receive those emails.\n\nEmail us your questions at WSADOPTIONS@WOLFSPIRITSRESCUE.COMYou MUST fill out an application to be considered for adoption. WolfSpiritsRescue.com/info/adoption\n\n01/19/2021 Whitley has been his normal self and read to meet a potential new family on Sunday 01/24/2021 We all have our fingers and paws crossed for him12/6/2020 UPDATE. WHITLEY IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. HE HAD A SEIZURE YESTERDAY AND THE VET WANTS TO WAIT AND SEE IF HE HAS ANYMORE IN THE NEXT MONTH BEFORE ANY TESTS OR MEDS WILL BE DONE. HE IS OK AND WAS BACK TO HIS ORNERY SELF WITHIN MINUTES. Whitley is back in Ohio and needs a home with someone that undertands frightened dogs. He needs a home without children or big dogs. He was picked on in his previous foster home by one of his foster brothers and now very fearful. He can be nippy when frightened. He is not a fan of baths or having his nails trimmed so patience and understanding is needed. He needs an experienced human to help him overcome some of his fears. Chihuahuas are not for everyone but once they bond with you. He is a tiny little guy who just wants to love someone and be loved for himself.\nHi,\nMy name is Whitley. I am cream colored young Chihuahua looking for a very special person who has loads of patience. My brothers are Pepe and Shorty who pick on me when we first run outside. Then I get upset and my foster Mom holds me and says it is okay. Toys I do not play with. When it is treat time I can do several spins. I will kiss your hand after I receive a treat. Like my brothers I know come and stay. Though I am trained to walk on a leash, a fenced yard is a safe place for me on breaks with you nearby. When it is cold outside, I can go in under a minute. A warm blanket on the couch is my favorite place and if you are there your lap is the best! If you know you are that person I am looking for, please fill out an application on me. My brothers and I are fostered in WI.\nWarm snuggles, Whitley. I used to live in a room with other Chihuahuas not able to go outside. Now I am being fostered in WI waiting for that special someone to call my own. Snuggle Bunny Alert! My name is Whitley. I am a young male, tan Chihuahua. My foster Mom says I am such a sweet boy. Going outside and playing in the yard is one of my favorite things to do. I was previously kept in room and never allowed outside. So I really enjoy my breaks in the fenced yard. I can walk nicely on a leash and am housebroke When I am inside I love to snuggle on your lap or lay next to you on the couch. I do well with a man or woman and love my back rubbed and being talked to. If you feel you are a kind, gentle person who will love me forever and give me the attention\n\nLocation: 44312\nFence Required: Yes\nObedience Training Needed: Needs Training\nGrooming Needs: Low\nOwner Experience Needed: Breed\nReaction to New People: Cautious\n\nClick here to watch a video of WhitleyPENDING ADOPTION.",

            "description": "Aspen is a precious puppy who is a part of a litter of 5 who were all saved from a local kill shelter. Their estimated date of birth is 8/13/20. At 3 months old,  Aspen currently weighs 13.3 pounds. Friendly & sweet, Aspen loves everyone she meets. She is used to being crated at night and playing in a safe, fenced yard during the day. Aspen is fine with other dogs and will be fine with cats and other animals if introduced as a puppy. Aspen is crate trained, trained to a potty box and has lots of toys and a fluffy bed in her crate that she does not chew. She is now fully vetted and ready for her forever home. Aspen's wish list consists of an inside forever home with a big fenced yard for playtime, a home with lots of toys and another doggy friend for play time and pet parents who understand the time commitment that a puppy requires. Adopters who are retired or work-from-home parents are ideal as they have the time to spend with the pet. Adopters committed to doing a 6 week basic obedience class to ensure Aspen's continued success at being a good canine citizen would also a plus. If you think you have the perfect home for Aspen, contact us at info.caresga@gmail.com for an adoption application. We adopt up north and all over so please ask for details. $400 adoption fee and a vet reference is required to ensure a great home (this means you have had a pet so we can call to verify their level of care). Eligibility for adoption means your current or past pets are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccines and on monthly heartworm and flea prevention. Please be aware that we do not allow shock collars (ie underground fences) or \"pens\" as an alternative for a fenced yard.\n\nWe do our best to place our rescue pets in the very best homes. Please be aware that we have an application which also includes required vet records showing your existing pets are current on preventative medical care. Puppy adopters please take note that we generally try to place our puppies into homes where at least one parent is retired/stay at home/works from home to ensure the puppy gets enough attention and training (puppies cannot hold it all day in a crate) so please have a plan ready when contacting us. For safety reasons, we try not to place small dogs or puppies in families with children under 5 (there may be exceptions depending on situation).\n\nTypical adoption fees for puppies are $350, juvenile dogs $300, adults dogs are $250, senior dogs are $150. Some pets, smaller dogs for example, may have a higher than normal adoption fee but we will alert you if there is a variance. Dogs rescued from China always have a higher adoption fee. Adoption fees help our group offset PART of the cost of rescuing, rehabilitating, and getting the pet healthy so they can go on to find a loving home with someone willing to give them a second chance at life. This amount includes each animal being current on age appropriate vaccinations including DHPPL, bordetella, influenza, rabies, and boosters when appropriate. De-wormed for any internal parasites (round worms, hook worms, tape worms and whipworms) with Drontal Plus, 4DX tested heart-worm negative (if positive, they are treated), tested negative for tick borne diseases, spayed/neutered, implanted with a micro-chip and have been examined by a veterinarian to certify that they are healthy. Any other known health issues are treated as well prior to adoption (examples: UTI, broken bones, contagious infections, dental cleanings, etc). All animals are also on a regime of flea and heartworm medication every month. Lifetime registration for the micro-chip is included in each adoption fee. In addition, each adopter will go home with a fitted collar, tags, a bag of dog food the pet has been on, copies of all vet history, and an adoption kit filled with valuable information and coupons as well as other various treats or toys as promotions become available. All puppy adoptions include two puppy training books, the Puppy Primer & Way To Go by Patricia McConnell, and all adult adoptions go home with Love Has No Age Limit by Patricia McConnell to help ensure a smooth transition for your new family member.\n\nWe ask that you consider an additional donation on top of this pet's adoption fee. This money will go directly into our Adoption Fund to be used exclusively for rescuing and caring for other pets in need. Many pets we take in have very high vet bills to get them healthy and adoptable for the public - much higher than their adoption fees. We receive no government funding and rely solely on donations from our community and caring adopters to continue our rescue efforts!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Old man Champ is a senior boy with a super cool personality who wants nothing more than to live out the rest of his years loving his human and taking naps. He loves to greet you when you come home from running errands and follow you from room to room when you are home. He has gotten better at being left alone for longer periods of time but would still enjoy an adopter who is home more than they are not. Champ is such a good boy that he doesnt need crated when you leave, which is good because hes not fond of the crate at all. We actually think that his prior owner likely kept him crated a lot because he will gnaw on the wires and his front bottom teeth are ground down :( He is currently being fostered with other dogs in the home and does well with them but hes not much of an endurance playmate. He would be fine as an only dog or with another low energy dog in the home. He has met a cat outside from the other side of a fence and was interested in sniffing but did not try to go after him. So a dog savvy cat would likely be ok. He is able to do carpeted steps at this time but his strength matches his age so that may change sooner than later. He is great on a leash and should be leashed to go out if there is not a fenced in yard because he does like to sniff and is a little hard of hearing. He loves laying on fluffy dog beds, blankets and on the couch next to you. When his blanket falls off the couch he will make eye contact with you and let out a raspy bark to let you know it needs put back on the couch lol. He is completely house trained and will go to the door when he needs to go out. Sometimes he likes to lay like a frog on the floor with his back legs out to the sides lol! If you have your heart on a senior dog or would like to open your heart and home to champ, please apply for adoption through our website www.onedogatatime.us",

She took me to the city shelter, but my family never came for me.  Unfortunately, I have heartworms and have to go thru a treatment. Due to my age, it was decided the monthly prevention is safer and will slowly kill off the remaining heartworms, but it is a slow processs.  So I  will need to be walked and not do any running until everything is clear.  That's OK because I just want to be a lazy boy anyway.    I really like people and just want to be loved so bad!  I'm keeping it a secret as to my exact ancestry! \n\nCruz is currently in foster care.  To see him, please contact Ward-Wiseman by phone or email and arrange a meeting.\n\nAdoption fee $100 includes neuter, vaccinations, microchip",

I weigh 16 pound  \n\n Here is my story...\n I  came here with  7 other dogs from Texas, and we had a rough start. We lived outside in someone\u2019s enclosed yard and weren\u2019t shown any love or attention. No one interacted with us, so we thought that humans were scary. \n\n But that\u2019s the past and now that I have been rescued and am constantly told that I am special and Posh, I\u2019m leaving my past behind and ready for a new, happy life with a loving family. \n\n I am in a wonderful foster home in New York where I am learning  to trust \n\n My foster mom has been very patient with me as I was very skittish when I first arrived. Their kindness and patience and living with OTHER DOGS  is really helping me thrive and I copy them so Our rescue feels that ANOTHER$ SMALL DOG in the home is required, as it is very good for me to live with a stable dog I can play with.\n\n  I  also have discovered how much I love to be touched and get belly rubs  but this has taken the time and any new person must realize it's going to take time and patience \n\n I am still skittish of strangers coming into the home and will run and hide. But  I love to come and play with the other dogs and love car rides and going for walks \n\n The leash is left on me as I still have a tendency to hide when I am scared, and that makes it easy for my foster parents to get me and take me for a walk \n\n I hope your heart is open to giving me a chance at having a loving family to call my own. I promise I\u2019m worth getting to know. I NEED ANOTHER DOG in the home to also keep showing me how to be a great family member. \n\n A home in the suburbs is best for me with a fenced in yard also as I am still nervous of loud noises\n\n I am neutered now and have all my shots. Heart Worm tested negative\n\n Please fill out this application by copying and pasting the link into your browser\n\n https://poshpetsrescueny.org/dog-application/",

She loves to curl up next to her foster mama and lay her head in her lap for pets. She's really a dog that just wants to be wherever her family is!\n\nAn ideal home for Scarlett would be one with a confident fur sibling to play with. One that can show her the ropes and be her best friend! \n\nScarlett does great with other dogs and grows in confidence herself when she has one to follow. She's really taken to one of the male dogs in her foster home and follows him everywhere.\n\nScarlett prefers female humans over males, but she has warmed up to the males in her foster home given time. \n\nShe is a timid dog that needs a patient forever home that will accept her for who she is. She may take a while to warm up in new situations and when meeting new people, but she's very sweet when she does. \n\nScarlett came into the rescue scared, timid, and pregnant. She was a wonderful mama to her six beautiful puppies, and now she's ready for a loving family of her own!\n\nShe is now spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, and housebroken. \n\nIf you think Scarlett is the girl for you, please apply now at www.luckylabrescue.com\n",

            "description": "CAPTAIN AND TENNILLE, MALE AND FEMALE, 5 YEARS OLD, 20 POUNDS\n\nCAPTAIN AND TENNILLE ARE BEING FOSTERED IN THE RICHMOND VA AREA. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THEM, PLEASE GO TO WWW.MOMSVA.ORG AND COMPLETE AN APPLICATION. \n\nThese two are best friends and need to stay together in a home without small children.  It would be easier to keep them together because they keep each other entertained all day playing and then snuggle together all night.  Tennille is very shy and Captain helps her to be brave.  They are small in stature for beagles so the two of them basically make up one dog.  And really, two dogs are always better than one!  \n\nCaptain \u2013 estimated to be 5 but may be younger, about 20lbs\nCaptain is a funny, sweet, energetic, handsome little man.  He generally spends all day wrestling with Tennille.  He loves to snuggle with his beagle sister Tennille or with humans.  He gets very excited to go on walks; however, he is very vocal when he catches the trail of something or when he sees bicycles \u2013 his sworn enemies.  Walks with Captain can be a handful especially on a nice day.  He is very smart and learned how to sit for treats very quickly.  He\u2019s very food motivated.  He has not shown food aggression unless there\u2019s a special treat involved.  He does not seem to care for playing with toys but loves to chew/play with rocks (which explains his teeth).  Captain does well with dogs his own size up to large beagle size.  He growls and snaps at dogs larger than him while on a leash, but given time to work things out off-leash, he has gotten along with larger dogs.  Captain likes most people but he will growl at new people if they approach while he\u2019s sitting with his favorite human.  He does have a very bad habit of eating poop and digging holes.  He\u2019s quiet in his crate when left during the day and through the night.  He is about 90% house trained, just don\u2019t make him wait too long to potty or he will go in the house.  Captain is pretty brave and is not scared of most sounds including thunder and fireworks and seems to be relatively unphased by the vacuum.  He\u2019s a flight risk and needs to be watched around open doors and gates.  IMPORTANT: Captain does have a seizure disorder and takes medicine twice a day every day with a cost of $30 a month.  He will need this medication his entire life to control his seizures.  He has not had a seizure since starting the medication.\n\n\nTennille \u2013 estimated to be five but may be older, about 20lbs\nTennille is a happy, cute, pudgy little lady.  She loves all people, kids, other dogs, and even the one cat we met on a walk.  She gets SO excited when she sees someone, she does a little dance.  She generally spends all day wrestling with Captain or burying her stuffed toys. She does not like to cuddle or be held very long by a human.  However, she does love to snuggle with her beagle brother Captain.  She gets really excited to go on walks but she is very vocal when she sees squirrels or bunnies \u2013 her sworn enemies.  Otherwise, she walks very nicely on a leash.  She has not shown food aggression unless there is a special treat involved.  I have not been working with her on sit because she just naturally sits nicely and patiently for her treats or meals.  What a good girl!  She also has a bad habit of eating poop and dirt.  Tennille never had an accident in the house until we had long spans of rain so I\u2019d say she\u2019s about 90% house trained too.  Tennille is quiet in her crate while I leave the house and through the night.  She is pretty timid and is scared of inside house noises like the blender, vacuum, and plastic bags rustling.  She does not seem to be scared of thunder or fireworks.  She is also nervous/apprehensive when eating and going in and out of doors.  Most of the world scares Tennille but she remains a happy little dog.      \n\n\nIf you think you're a match to Captain and Tennille, please go to www.momsva.org and complete an application.",

            "description": "This is Jaguar!\n\nJaguar is sleek, and when he prowls he looks exactly like his namesake. Jag isn't always great meeting other dogs on leash, but has been in multiple play groups here and is a social guy! He's a hiking buddy, a snuggle partner, and a winery regular. Jaguar is 9 years old and weighs 69 lbs. He came to us from Baldwin Park Shelter on October 4th.\n\nJaguar went on a two-week Frosted Fling and is now in Foster with his Fling dad! It's pretty special when someone who has done multiple Frosted Flings comes back to foster a dog through to adoption, because they see how special the dog is. Jaguar is well-behaved, knows basic commands, and is perfectly potty trained, but what really makes him special is his sweet and silly personality.\n\nHis Foster Dad shares, \"Jaguar is a sweet soul, who just wants a human he can love. This beautiful boy actually walks like a Jaguar, creeping along with an athletic stride, low to the ground, with his tail tucked down. And yet he's a total goofball - I think it's the Great Dane in him. Jag loves to play, sometimes throwing toys up in the air to himself, and he still gets the zoomies after his baths. It makes me laugh every time!\n\nJag initially acts a bit aloof with new humans. During our three-week foster, he seemed to prefer sleeping on his bed on the floor. Then on our last night together, he finally found the courage to jump onto my bed. He sheepishly fumbled his way up and looked around for approval before sprawling out for the night. He's as sensitive as he is loyal and he deserves to be with one lucky family for the rest of his life.\"\n\nLooking for a devoted best pal? Apply to meet Jaguar: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees and we help with medical costs!\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 1/27/21 KG",

            "description": "Meet Kodiak!\n\n10-year-old Kodiak was surrendered to Baldwin Park Shelter by his family. We don't know why he ended up there, but right away we noticed he had hind end weakness and when you try to help him he says, \"I can do it myself!\" with his mouth and a big bark. The shelter's rescue coordinator reached out to say what a great dog Kodiak is, and we agree! Kodiak has liked every dog and cat he has met, and enjoys sleeping under the big pine tree in his play yard.\n\nIt's no wonder this sweet old man shares his name with a bear - Kodiak is as fuzzy as a grizzly and sounds a bit like one too! His back end is weak, but once he's up, he's up and ready to go! Kodiak loves to go on our weekly Frosted Fakers hikes. The volunteers who walk with Kodiak keep his hikes shorter, and he does great! If anything, it takes some negotiation to convince him it's time to stop walking and head back to the FFF van! He's perfect on leash, sticking close to his partner's side, never pulling, and occasionally checking in with a glance of his big soulful eyes.\n\nWe know that our big bear needs a special family with big hearts and no stairs, so we sent him on a two week Frosted Fling to see what else we could learn about him in a home environment. Kodiak earned rave reviews from his Fling Mom for being amazing with her five small dogs, including not even minding a bit when the tiniest one (3 lbs.) would walk over him! She also reported that Kodiak is potty trained and barks while standing at the door to let you know when he wants to go out. Our favorite bear is very mellow, enjoying slow strolls around the neighborhood, wandering around the yard, and taking naps.\n\nKodiak quickly learned to trust his Fling Mom and was a good boy about getting his eye drops and accepting her help if he needed it when getting up. He loves to eat and takes his medications easily. A fun fact about Kodiak is that he enjoys music! While with his Fling Family, he would gaze at their guitar and sit close when it was played.\n\nWe think Kodiak's Fling Mom summed it up perfectly when she reported, \"Kodiak is seriously the best dog. He's the most gentle giant!\" Please consider making him part of your family, he is so deserving!\n\nStop by to meet our special bear during the next Open House!\n\nVisit during Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm\n\nLearn more about our programs at: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family No adoption fees and we help with medical costs!\n\nApply to become a family: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 1/31/21 KG",

            "description": "Very sweet, 2 year old. Best as only dog in home with NO other pets. He wants all the love for himself and will provide constant affection. Great watchdog and very calm. Loves to go on walks and would love a fenced in yard to play, but he does not want to be left outside, he wants to be inside where it is cool. Trained to follow basic commands (Sit, Down) and eager to learn - food motivated. Interested in playing fetch and needs bones to chew on. He can get along with other dogs and would like to play, but needs a proper slow introduction. Snow needs his own person to love and that will love him forever.\n\nContact Ridley at 202-780-6742 if interested.\n\nTo adopt, fill out an application at\n\nwww.paws4you.org/application\n\nTo get our newsletter, text\nPAWS4YOU\nto\n22828\n\nConnect with us:\n\nwww.instagram.com/paws4you\n\nwww.twitter.com/paws4you\n\nwww.facebook.com/paws4you",

I could use some training as sometimes I forget to use my manners. I play very rough with other dogs and I ignore their cues when they try to tell me that they are done playing. I would do best in a home where it is just me or I will need to be closely supervised with other dogs when we play. I may be a bit much for small children until I have had some formal training so I would do best in a home with older children around! I am very fixated on cats and was brought in by my finder because I really wanted to hunt her cat, so a no cat home is what I am looking for! That would include small animals too! It's really fun to have toys around to play with so I don't get bored, my favorite is a gigantic rope! I would like to find a family of my very own! I would really like to meet you to see if we would be a good fit! Check me out! I just know that we are going to be best friends forever!",

            "description": "FCIA rescued Boris, a rottweiler mix, from the shelter after his previous owner surrendered him due to his medical needs.  He is 5 years old and weighs 82 pounds. He was suffering from chronic fungal and bacterial skin infections that had left him nearly bald, underweight,  and with severe ear infections. Despite this, he remained very sweet and loving.  After almost a year in our care that included intense and frequent medical tests and treatment, he is finally medically stabilized.  He is happy, healthy and his coat is full and lush.  Boris will require lifelong medication and routine vet checks.  He is now on thyroid meds 2 times a day, iron supplements daily, an autoimmune shot every 10 days, and a special diet that controls his allergies.  He remains sweet and loving and very playful with most other dogs .  He does tend to guard his yard and person so needs an adopter with Rottweiler experience and one who is prepared to continue his health routine.  \n\nBoris is so ready and deserving of his forever home.  If you are that person, please contact us at FCIAadoptions@aol.com for more information.\n\nAs we are currently not having any adoption events, we are asking interested people to please fill out our application at www. FCIAnimals.org and if it looks like a good match, we will arrange an introduction. \n\nWe suggest a home with children over the age of 10 for this dog. This dog cannot be adopted out of state. Please see our home page for a list of our Saturday adoption sites. Every potential adopter is required to fill out an adoption application and the dog is placed in the home that would be most suitable for the dog. We do not place our dogs in homes with unfenced swimming pools. Generally we don't release the dogs at the adoption site that day except on occasion to former adopters.",

After her owner had to surrender her, she was lonely and sad. Now, after some time, she is coming around! She loves to play, chasing balls in the yard, and zoom zoom zoom to get all her energy out. She loves human attention and would prefer to be able to keep all her humans to herself so she doesn't have to share time and space with other animals. Jezzy is a smart dog that is very food driven and will be easy to train. \n\n----\n<br>Please call the shelter at (706) 795-2868 to schedule a meet and greet.\n\nMadison Oglethorpe Animal Shelter is a non-profit shelter serving over 720 square miles. We are open intake, meaning we can not turn away animals from either county we serve. Our shelter intakes double or triple it's capacity every month so it is essential we place animals quickly into adoptive homes. Since so many animals enter the shelter we often don't have enough volunteers to write an individual bio for each.

Please visit our website to learn more about our adoption process at newhoperescue.org. \n\nThis dog is being fostered with New Hope Dog Rescue (Saskatoon).  If you are interested in adopting please fill out an Adoption Application. Meet and greets are by appointment only and done so after an adoption application has been submitted. A successful applications will be contacted by the foster home to discuss further. We are volunteer run so please be patient.\n\nHi, my name is Nova and I'm a pretty shy girl. I am just over 1 year old and I am a mixed breed. At my last vet appointment I weighed 21 kg. \n\nOnce I get to know you we can be best friends. I'm the happiest girl once I've settled in and my whole body wags with my tail. In my foster home my best friend is another dog named Willow. We love to wrestle and play.\n\nDuring the day, I can be crated and I like my wire crate that i can see out of. I absolutely shouldn\u2019t be left out of my crate when you can\u2019t watch me as I can get into things, I am still a young dog so I am still learning! \n\nNova will need a patient home to work with her nervousness. Older kids who can respect her boundaries and give her time to bond would be best. If the house has another dog, the dog must be fairly calm and friendly. She is a sweet girl who needs a home to give her time to adjust, she\u2019ll be your best friend within a few days!\n\nNova has been spayed, microchipped, dewormed, current on age appropriate vaccines and has received a health check from a vet. adoption fee is $295.\n\nTo view more dogs go to http://www.newhoperescue.org/adopt/available-dogs/\n\nDisclaimer: in most cases we are guessing the breed mix. These are best guesses on our part. For puppies it can be extremely difficult and we are also guessing on what size they will be. \n\nNEW HOPE DOG RESCUE is not a shelter. Our dogs are placed in loving foster homes. WE NEED FOSTER HOMES TO HELP MORE DOGS - CONTACT US TODAY!!!\nDefinitions:\nPending - means that we are working through the adoption process with the 1st applicant. We usually don't add the pending until we are pretty sure the adoption will go through (like at the home visit stage)\nAdopted - you know!! A happy ending for a homeless dog.",

He is such a friendly soul that he actually jumped  in the UPS drivers' van once! Raymond is very social and enjoys attending every birthday party available :) \n\nRaymond is wonderful with the little kiddos, and his foster sisters include a 5 year old and 3 year old girls. He enjoys being a part of  the action, even if that means he has to play dress up! He has been known to steal a few Dinonuggets from time to time. \n\nRay is a stage 4 clinger, and has to be next to you pretty much half of the day! He loves to give kisses as well, although his old man breath makes it very enduring :) Ray loves to stay close to you outside as well, and frequently has to be bribed into going outside in the snow. \n\nHe seems a bit excitable toward kittens, and he is not a fan of those big creatures they call horses, but Raymond would most likely do well in a home with another calm senior dog like himself. \n\nIf you're looking for good laugh, a good hug and a great friend - look no further than Raymond! \n\n",

Consult www.Crisisdogsnc.org for Adoption fees\n\nFOSTER OR ADOPT URGENT!\n\nGentle easy going Lilly \nMiss Sociable\n \nA gentle, small American Staff who was taken from neglect, 6 year old Lilly still acts like a puppy in her energy, trust of people and love of life. This beautiful gal with expressive brown eyes is super affectionate, relaxed in the house, will need more leash training but loves to learn. Lily is not good with other dogs in her space so she needs to be your only dogta. She is also too active to be in a household with young children Lilly is only 45 pounds, a stunning silver with pointy ears (so she may have cattle dog in her). She is well mannered in the house, loves to ride in the car, enjoys meeting people and will stay happily by your side at home. Lilly is healthy, fully vetted, ready to settle into a home where she can play. See her video:https://youtu.be/_E4IHyYjmew \nAsk for more pics. American staff experience preferred. Vet reference and virtual home visit required. This is a lovely dog who has had a hard time and deserves a break. Please step up. She is now in foster and we can connect you with her foster for more details. No small kids, prefer mature easy going household who will appreciate her companionship.",

My friends here tend to refer to me as a speedy ball of muscle, and they are always begging me to slow down so we can snuggle, sometimes I let them, I'm such a tease!   I am hoping to find someone to love me that has the ability to reign in and help me drain my 1 year old puppy energy and curiosity.  I'm working on being patient in my crate, I just get so bored after a few hours, and I really work hard to let you know when I have to go potty when we are chillin at home.   I don't love being tied outside the house unattended, I do best when my people are with me so I feel safe and I don't have to bark at the people walking by.  See, sometimes new people can be concerning to me so I'm also hoping my people will be cautious as I learn to be more confident in new situations, I promise I mean well and I just need to know how to react appropriately.   My friends at the shelter always tell me how darn cute I am and that I am the most entertaining dog they have ever met so if you are an active person who is looking for someone to rock and roll with I'm your guy!!  \nYou can find an application on our website www.whsadopt.org, and once that is approved our adoption team will be in touch so we can hang out!  www.whsadopt.org, click on adopt, then dog adoption questionnaire.\n\n",

If you would like to do a meet and greet with Crosby, please go to the RescueADog.org website and under the forms tab fill out the adoption application and email it to info@RescueAdog.org We will call you to arrange a time.

She would also to best in a home with kids 8 and up as if they run she likes to herd them as well and may try tip nip at their heels.

            "description": "Max is 6 years young and currently in a loving home. He's been with his family for a couple of years, but from the start they always knew that Max would be better suited for a life with someone more active with the time, ability and interest in hanging with a really cool, playful and intelligent dog. He loves walks, sunbathing, belly rubs and playing ball.\nA couple of years ago he had surgery, leaving a pin in one of his hind legs, but it doesn't slow him down a bit; just something to be aware of when exercising. Max is great with other dogs, though best to keep toys (especially balls) out of play as he tends to resource guard.With training the issue is gradually improving, so his new owner will need to commit to working through that process.\nIf he's going to live with another dog, a confident female would be ideal (he's currently and temporarily living with a female pittie).\nWe don't recommend Max live with a family with young children, though he shows no sign of aggression with humans, even around the ball, he is an exuberant greeter and player, best suited for those who can match his powerful energy.\nMax goes out on 'doggie adventures' multiple times a week.

Have seen her protect her food and keep others from eating\nGood on a leash: yes, but pulls at first from excitement\nRides well in a car: yes\nDestructive: No\nNeeds a home with a yard: Yes, loves outside.\nNeeds another dog: NO, loves attention and loves to sleep with her human. She will lay on top of you to show her love. Best as a ONLY dog.\nCan live in an apartment: No\n\nBackstory: Miss Bull was brought into a high kill shelter as a stray. She had been hit by a car and was very underweight. She was released to be euthanized and saved by the rescue.\n\nFoster comments: Miss Bull knows her name. She is very loyal to her human to a fault. Someone who works from home and wants a true companion would be a great match for her. She LOVES to chew bones so keeping those available to her is recommended. She is very trainable and eager to please. She will give her heart so needs an adopter who will also give her their heart. She LOVES people.\n\nFoster update: Are you ok not to use a crate \u2026 because all she wants is love \u2026 to let your dog on the couch .. because all she wants is to cuddle \u2026 to sleep with you because all she wants is more love? And in return get a fully housetrained, loving, respectful, non-barker, a dog that loves going for walks, going in the car, kids and dogs? Then Miss Bull is for you. She is a 60 pound very solid, very strong American Bulldog mix that is a gentle love bug. She needs someone who will be strong enough to walk her because she\u2019ll pull you along, but she is smart enough to eventually learn to slow down. Anyone with a good heart and a loving nature will be lucky to adopt Miss Bull.",

Thankfully they were found and taken to safety at the local animal shelter. The shelter reached out to us to help Rozar as the neglect he has suffered is quite evident. We are more than happy to welcome him into rescue and have promised him everything from here on out. Rozar will of course be going to a vet to be thoroughly examined and the road to recovery has begun. He will be getting fed a lot of smaller meals to help him gain weight correctly. In the meantime, his foster family will be loving him, caring for him and helping him get well before they begin working with him on any house manners he may need. Rozar's journey has just begun - are you his happy ending?\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

            "description": "Introducing is absolutely gorgeous girl named Pandora! This super sweet girl did not have an easy start in life. She was used for breeding and was likely not treated very well. She managed to liberate herself and was picked up by a wonderful animal lover who found her roaming. Every effort was made to contact her previous owners however nothing came to fruition. So, fortunately for her, she was free to find a much better life! Our organization was contacted as we have experience with this breed, and everyone wanted to ensure that she find a home that was absolutely perfect for her, and will cherish her always!\nShe was immediately taken to a vet where she was estimated to be about four years old. We had all of her vaccines done and had all of her medical work completed including spay. She was given a clean bill of health and she weighs about 100 pounds. She went to her foster home where she slowly showed them that she is truly an incredible, wise old soul. she is exceptionally intelligent, and equally as loyal. When she knows that you are her parents and will truly love her, she will be your Velcro dog for life. She has probably spent every day longing to finally have someone who would love her, and reciprocate to her the devotion she had been longing to give and receive. \nPandora should go to a home that has similar breed experience. She has not displayed overly protective behaviors, but it is absolutely possible that once she is settled into her forever home that she might. Therefore, parents who are confident with an extra large protective dog are a must! The other must is parents who absolutely want to snuggle with her dog as much as possible! She is the type of girl who will mosey on right next to you when you\u2019re walking around in the yard or doing anything in the house. She will be sure to follow you, longing to be as close to as possible as well as making sure you\u2019re always OK. She is exceptionally devoted, and has such a pure heart of gold. She will do better in a more reclusive setting, where she can watch the birds and there\u2019s lots of trees and yard space. She\u2019s more of a country dog who likes to relax and have an easy-going lifestyle. A low traffic home with relaxed, nurturing, confident, loving parents is her dream come true! She would probably be best as an only dog, however she could live happily with a mature mellow similar large male companion dog as well. Interestingly, she has shown no reactivity to cats at all! Given the opportunity, she would rather curl up with you on a couch than chase a cat! Her foster parents have grown to love her deeply and see what an incredible dog she is. She is a girl who is for people who want an incredible connection with her dog, who understand dogs, and can respect and adore everything about her. She has paid her dues being bred and bred her entire life. It is time for her to relax in a warm soft loving home, where she can feel peace, security, and the connection with parents she has always longed for. If this girl has touched your heart and he would love to make her dream come true and welcome her into your home please visit our website and submitted application for adoption today! www.greatdivideanimalrescue.org",

At 4 years-old, Rexs energy is the perfect combination of Hey, lets go on an adventure, and chill. Hes house-trained and a super smarty pants! Rex can be a little bit shy when he first meets new people, but with a proper intro and some yummy treats, hes good to go. At the shelter he loves to zoom around the yard, hopping in and out of the doggy pool, and sitting quietly gazing adoringly into his person's eyes. Rex has been perfecting his leash skills and stays impressively engaged with his handler during his training sessions. Rex recently went on an outing with his favorite volunteer lady, and he had so much swimmin' and explorin' and car-ridin' and burger-eatin'! Rex would prefer to be your one and only pet but hes got more than enough love to go around! During his shelter stay hes become a staff and volunteer favorite... hes kinda perfect. He just needs a chance to show it! As with all our pups, Rex will go home with our ongoing support, as well as a training voucher from Friends of Austin Animal Center and a crate and goody bag. I weigh approximately 60 lbs. Click here to view my paperwork.",

Anxiety seemed to be a huge issue for him. It took finding the right type of meds, but it seems like Zeus is coming around. Zeus is finally able to be a dog. He has life in his eyes now and is happy. Now that he can finally relax, Zeus loves to enjoy all the things he couldn't before like people, food, and drinking from the toilet. Zeus's fear of new people has also lessened. Zeus can still be stubborn, but he is working on it with his foster and we are seeking further training to help Zeus to become an even better dog. \n\nZeus is up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, and neutered. His adoption fee is $200.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Zeus or learning more about the adoption process, please submit an adoption application at careforanimals.org. Thank you!",

She is about 8 years (possibly older) young.  Crate- trained and Potty-trained (outdoor and will use wee wee)!  Likes dogs and ignores cats.\n Pia was out of time when FWFP stepped in. \n\nInterested in becoming a forever home for Pia? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Pia.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Pia the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \nFor immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.\n\nOur adoption fee is $475. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

            "description": "Genny is a young lady, between 1 and 2 years old, is up to date on all her vaccines and spayed plus already started on monthly heartworm preventative. She has some issues with being kenneled and crated meaning she does not make a good first impression inside so an experienced dog owner is required to help her adjust. She craves attention once she\u2019s out and is very playful and energetic.  She wants you to think she is a tough girl but open her kennel door and see her real personality!! Genny is bouncy, playful, and LOVES attention!! She also enjoys walks and passing out kisses!  Genny does well with male dogs but a home with older children and NO CATS is recommended. If you can provide Genny with the loving home she is waiting for email below! \n\nFOR ADOPTERS: please contact Kelly, our Adoption Coordinator, with any questions at taylorcodogs@gmail.com or inquire directly via Petfinder. There is a link to our online ADOPTION APPLICATION on our Petfinder home page. You may also request an application via email. Paper copies are available at our shelter.\nWe always recommend a meet and greet with our dogs available for adoption. We are not able to assess dogs with cats since we are set up for dog intakes only. If you have cats, we advise a proper introduction while keeping the dog on leash in your home.\nWe are volunteer-based, so please be patient with our response time.\n\nFOR RESCUES: Taylor County is rescue friendly! If you are a rescue, please contact our Rescue Coordinator, Diana, at deed1123@aol.com\n\nDONATIONS: We are always in need of donations to help care for our dogs. We feed IAMS Adult Mini Chunks (green bag) and IAMS Smart Puppy. If you can assist financially, please mail a check payable to Taylor County Humane Society at PO Box 4045, Grafton WV 26354 or visit our website to donate via PayPal. http://www.tchswv.com/donations/",

He will need someone that is strong to walk him and control him. He is a good dog, but needs someone who can work with him . He is 130 lbs, and pretty tall. No small kids because he will knock them over, not on purpose or to hurt them, just because he is goofy and does not understand his strength. He is a gorgeous boy and loves being with his people.",

She has since had her pups and they were weaned recently and she was able to go into foster with other dogs and cats. She is a petitle little girl. She is getting \"house dog life figured out. She can be spotted in the back of every activity now. (She's bringing up the end of the love bug couch train). Her first vet experience went as expected..she was terrified but handled it as well as a feral dog can. She's an awful car rider. She is a very particular treat taker, no fruits and veggies so far just meat. She is still being leashed inside and outside but is less frantic when approached. Roo currently has no interest in lovins or animal interactions but she is starting to be very interested in EVERYTHING going on. She accepts .2 seconds of pets then scurries off, then returns .5 seconds later to give very sloppy licks and scurries back off but it's something. We love her and can't wait to see what her personality brings. Fingers crossed",

My favorite thing in the world is getting pets (especially on my belly!) and giving kisses. Other favorite things include cuddles, bones and deer antlers. \n\nAt 44lbs, I'm a young and adorable pocket pitty. I'm the perfect size to sit with you on the sofa and sleep beside you in your big bed because we can cuddle and I won't take up too much room. I love meeting new people and getting lots of attention. I'm happiest when I'm with my people, so a family or owner who wants to take me on walks and adventures would be awesome! I would loooove a family with kids who enjoy playing and cuddling. Although I'm petite, I do get excited when around people, so kids over five might be best so I don't accidentally knock anyone over!\n\nI have some separation anxiety, so a patient owner who can help me gain confidence and trust will be a great fit for me. I am a smart girl and I catch on easily! I can be dog-selective, so let's do a slow meet and greet to make sure I'm a perfect fit in your pack. TLP can help! (I'd also enjoy being the only dog in your life because I would then get ALLLLL the attention!) No cats for me, please.\n\nDo you love kisses and smiles and cute snorts and the kind of adoration only a dog can show? I will be your best gal and can't wait to share my love with you. Apply to meet me today!",

            "description": "11/2/2020\nShippensburg is looking for an understanding family that wants to love him and enjoy his company for however long they can have a nice life together.  Shippensburg has degenerative Myelopathy --It is an incurable disease and is progressive. Shippensburg really wants a family of his own for as long as he may have (could be months could be years--it is unknown but we do know he is a love and deserves a family of his own).  To make this happen for him, his adoption fee is being covered by our Angel fund so that he can be adopted to an approve family that is a good fit for him.  Are you that special family?\n\n10/24/2020\nShippensburg is doing well in foster.  He is not recommended for cats, small dogs or small children as he is not as aware of his size as he would need to be.   \n10/6/2020\n\nShippensburg is an approximately 2 year old 66 lb Newfie mix who could stand to gain some weight.  He is Heart worm positive and will be heartworm treated at a Wags designated Vet.  He can be adopted prior to HW treatment.  \n!!! Meet Shippensburg, AKA \u2018Shippy\u2019!!  This gentle mini giant deserves so much more than he has been given in life so far. Shippy did once belong to an owner down south, however he was left behind in the house once the owner moved out and just decided to let this sweet soul fend for himself.  The new owners of the home did not want a dog, and so this loveable ball of fluff was brought to the shelter.  He is listed as a \u2018Bully Breed\u201d, so adopters would need to meet that criteria, but he is the farthest thing from a bully.\nAlthough he had clearly been neglected and malnourished, this beautiful fella has not let that stop him from being an absolute sweetheart or lose his trust in people.  He has likely never slept on a dog bed before, and so for now he prefers the floor to a crate or soft bed.  His foster mom has an Xpen set up connected to an open crate, and Shippy will just lay down quietly in the Xpen portion and sleep on some blankets.  He never makes a peep.  That could change as he gets more familiar with his surroundings, but so far he is a very quiet dog.  He also has done very well with house training, and has only had one oopsie in his foster home.\nShippy needs to put on some weight\u2026.don\u2019t let his pictures fool you! He is all head and fur right now.  He is currently approximately  65-70 lb, but you can still feel his ribs and hips through his fur.  He eats well and has not shown any food aggression, which is amazing considering he was probably starving in his old \u2018home\u2019.  He is learning that treats are AWESOME and will follow you around if he thinks there\u2019s a treat involved. (He loves cheese, Dentasticks, and Pepperidge Farm goldfish )  ?\nHe will pull on the leash a bit when walking, but certainly not enough to drag you down the street.  It seems as though he just really likes being outside and wants to explore.  He would do best with a fenced in yard, so that he can roam around and have some freedom.  He also has trouble walking on hardwood and/or laminate, (picture a deer on ice) so a home with carpeted rooms or area rugs/runners would be ideal. His foster parents currently have hardwood stairs to go up to the second floor, and he does not even want to attempt them.\nShippy has been around many dogs and has done great with all of them.  Slow intro\u2019s are always best with any dog, but this guy seems more interested in his surroundings than interacting or playing with other dogs.  Again, that could change once he feels more settled in a secure new place.  Unknown how he is with cats, but he is interested in squirrels during his walks, so he might chase.\nHe might pace around the first few days, which is not uncommon with the stress of moving from place to place.  But after he feels safe and understands that he won\u2019t just be left alone in a dark home by himself ever again, Shippy warms up quickly and is very affectionate.  He\u2019s even starting to sit on his foster mom, a very clear sign that he is ready for a forever home where he will be spoiled with lots of walks, kisses, brushing, TREATS, and love. And a drool rag. ? \n\nShippy is heartworm positive and begins his treatment soon. He will need restricted activity for a period of time afterwards.\n\n\n\n  To begin the adoption process please, fill out our online application. Go to wagsrescue.com and click on adoption form.\nPlease call Susan @ 267-312-3372 if you have questions.",

She is 2-3 years old and about 40 lbs with short legs and a big smile! \nDarla is treat motivated and will sit patiently for a snack. She loves to hug you, cuddle, and give you kisses! \nShe came to Take Paws pregnant, neglected, and heartworm positive. Now that her puppies are weaned and all in forever homes, she has completed her heartworm treatment and will be spayed soon. \nDarla is house trained and crate trained. She has not lived with a cat before, and says she wants all your love to herself - no other doggos please. She is great with all people and kids!\nShe\u2019s a bit greedy, with your love and with her food! She loves to eat! She will follow you everywhere and sit when told.\nShe\u2019s super excited though about the possibility of joining your family! We think she\u2019d even love to have some small humans around to love on! \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

Poppie is guessed to be about a 6 year old terrier mix and is paralyzed from the waist down. We aren't sure what caused her injury but it's not stopping her. Since her arrival at Satchel's, Poppie has caught the eye of volunteers and staff who are always there to support her special need. In the first month of her arrival she has been given her personal wheelchair, stroller, car seat, drag bag and has a massage therapist making visits. Poppie is a vibrant social girl who loves spending time with her human companions. She is very treat motivated with one of her favorite treats being the homemade frozen peanut butter yogurt treats she gets from her favorite volunteer. Poppie seems to be okay with some dogs and could possibly live with a cat. Poppie's perfect home would be with someone who spends a lot of time at home and sees her abilities, not her disability.",

DDRTX only adopts in Central/South Texas.\n\nEmail: ddrtxinfo@gmail.com Primary Website: www.DDRTX.org\nPioneer Puppy #6 - Teagan is momma\nHello folks my name is Marie Curie. And I have been in Rescue since I was born and I am a very mature six months old. I was part of Pioneer Puppies and have been with the same foster family since I was a baby.\n\nI have never gotten my very own forever home but foster mom keeps telling me that I'm going to one day. I've just recently had a new photo shoot. And you can tell that even though I don't have short legs and down ears, and they don't call me a Dachshund...I am a small, dainty, trim and frankly very pretty little girl dog. My mother was a small dog weighing around 20 pounds. My foster mom tells me I'm not going to be any bigger than my mama.\n\nMarie Has learned so much in the last six months. She has become housetrained. She has learned to sleep quietly on her own bed in the bedroom overnight. She can be kenneled easily for errands. She has a sweet nature once she meets and learns she can trust you. She gives sweet kisses and can lay quietly in your lap. Marie rides well in the car snapped in on her own seat. She has been visiting the creek, park playground, the pet store, vet and even went to the local brewery recently. She walks well on a leash and lays and/or sits quietly very near you when you sit to visit with friends.\n\nMarie can be shy at first and has a little fear when out of her comfort zone. Being young and with our social restrictions its been hard for her to become more social. But at home in her environment she is outgoing and loving. She just needs a forever home with patient folks that she can give her heart to. She is good with children. And she loves to chase a ball or a stick outside in her yard. She is very content to spend time outside in the yard.\n\nMarie is hoping someone will fall in love with her soon. She has been black but is now changing colors. She has a beautiful silver white hair coloring along her neck. Marie used to be the ugly duckling but not anymore. She is truly unique and a one of a kind dog. Please don't miss out on her!\n\nLove dachshunds and not ready to adopt or circumstances won't permit having a dog? How about being a sponsor or making a donation. Every one of our dachshunds receives excellent medical care along with day to day food, love and housing. Being non-profit, we rely on generous individuals like yourselves to help save these fur babies. You can do this specifically for one dog with the sponsor button on their webpage or a general donation on our \"How To Help\" page. Easy and quick through Pay Pal or your debit/credit card. You generosity is sincerely appreciated by all and is tax deductable. Need other ideas? You'll find tons of them on the How to Help tab. All contributions are tax deductable.\n\nDiamond Dachshund Rescue of Texas is a non-profit 501(c)(3) volunteer organization with focus on rescue and adoption of pure breed Dachshunds. All dogs are fully vetted and housed on private property. Meetings are scheduled upon adoption approval. Thank you for your continued support to the rescue and shelter communities!\nOpt to Adopt!",

I'm protective of my foster dad and foster brother. I haven't been trained, my foster dad has done what he can, but I still need some help with that! When I greet him at the door, I hug him with my paws and try to kiss him. I like to climb in his lap any chance I get, I like to sleep next to him because he makes me feel safe. I do sleep in my crate from time to time and when I'm naughy. I don't play well with other dogs and I don't trust people that easily, I'm knida of a one man dog. I did get to spend sometime in the kennel at K-9 Boot Camp up in Rutherford, that was fun but I missed my foster dad\n\nAn application is a must for the foster to call. Go to rescueridge.com and then text 732-546-8805\n\nIf any one would like a beautiful girl to sit on your lap and dote on you check out LOLA.",

She was found in 2019 living in a wood pile in Oklahoma protecting her puppies, so has some trauma there that needs worked through and a dedicated adopter will do so much for her. She needs a very structured living environment and a strong dog-savvy owner. She loves to be outside so would enjoy a nice physically fenced yard (no invisible fencing with her history, sorry). She will not do well in an apartment setting since she has a fear of strangers and needs muzzled on walks in strange places. She has been through heartworm treatment and will require an adopter who will keep her on preventatives and regular testing. She does well with dogs as long as they aren't tiny/can't be mistaken for squirrels or rabbits. She chases cats. She is food protective with other dogs, so will need to be fed separate / in kennel as a precaution. Once she is comfortable with you, she likes to snuggle and give kisses and hugs -- but it may take a few weeks for her to warm up fully. No kids for Roe -- fast movements and small creatures with her don't mix, sorry. Her adoption fee is $250. If you have an easy-going and patient lifestyle that will give this girl the structure she needs and are interested in meeting Rowena, please put an application in at www.foreverhomedogs.org and we will set up a meet with you!All adoptions are $200 per dog which include spay/neuter, micro-chipped and up-to-date on required shots. \n\nSenior dogs, at our discretion, are adopted out at $100 per dog because we know they will have less time with your family and may eventually have more needs as they get older. But we feel these dogs deserve to live out the rest of their lives as part of a loving family.",

She is a VERY happy dog but she barks at people she doesn't know. She would need someone that can work with her on that. She can be the only female dog in the home, however she gets along with male dogs.  She's not good with cats. She's good with children. She can sit, shake, and won't run away if off the leash. She has lots of potential to bring someone a ton of love. She becomes weak in the knees with a belly rub. \n\nTHIS IS A COURTESY POSTING ONLY. OUR RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG.\n\nIf interested please contact:\n\nCarly Andrews\n909-730-9111\ncarlymichelle410@gmail.com",

I don\u2019t really know what that means, but I just know I\u2019m a happy guy who likes to go go go go go!!!! I\u2019m a medium sized, shepherd mix, about 50lbs and my ideal family will be active, have a fully fenced yard, want someone to hike and play ball with, and no other pets. They say I\u2019m ok with \u2018teenage\u2019 humans but I\u2019m probably too rambunctious for smaller kids as I like to run, jump, pounce, and play hard! I\u2019m only a young guy at about 1 year old, and I haven\u2019t had a whole lot of work on manners yet. I\u2019m trying, and they say I\u2019m really smart and eager to learn, but they keep calling me a \u2018diamond in the rough\u2019 whatever that means.

I love to snuggle up close at night and will follow you anywhere you go. I have been trained to sit, stay, lay down, and even go to my place when guests come over! I am fully potty trained too. I've never been destructive in the house and I do great being left out! I prefer to be the only pet in the house as I love to be center of attention! I am very strong so I need a home with a family that can set some boundaries - and of course, one that likes to play fetch! Fill out an application to meet me!\n\nPLEASE READ BELOW PRIOR TO EMAILING IN! If you are interested in adopting this dog or any others, please go to www.hobocare.org to review our home requirements and fill out an application.

A lady almost ran over her as she was out looking for food and the lady tracked her back to her home and talked the owners into giving her and her babies up so they could get into rescue and have the care and life that they deserved. Jada is such a sweet and playful girl. She has been raised around kids and she loves toys just as much as her babies do. She is a great medium size too. She loves other dogs as well. She is going to make a great addition to just about any fun, active family. She's been a great mom to her babies but she is just about ready to enjoy the single life and have all the attention focused on her finally.\nIf you are interested in adopting her or any other dog with us please visit our website at funnyfarmrescueranch.org to read all about our southern rescue dogs and how they are fostered in TN and don't travel north until they have completed their vetted and their adoptions are finalized.\nYou can also find our adoption application there and the link to our FB page where we post live videos of the pups/dogs in our rescue. \nOne application covers any dog in our rescue so if the dog is posted its available at that moment. As soon as someone signs a contract on a dog, the system takes the dog off the site.\nHer adoption fee including transport will be $550",

            "description": "Meet Dipz! This big, pudgy fellow is curious, energetic, loves treats and toys, and is a strong go-getter! He is said to love chasing balls and gets along well with other friendly dogs. Despite his size, he still has a lot of pep in his step! He may need a few lessons in \"basic training\" to become his very best, but is a good-natured kind of guy. Will he walk pretty well beside you? Yes, but he is a powerful guy, too, and may have a tendency to pull. Because of his size and energy, he may do best with older children. And he should have absolutely no access to cats. Dipz is also a cute guy with dark spots splashed across his coat! He is currently in a foster home, so please contact the shelter if you are interested in meeting him. We hope you\u2019ll meet our happy boy, Dipz! He will welcome you with open paws!\n\nID# A072459\n\nWe APPRECIATE you for considering adopting a shelter pet. We are open Monday-Saturday, 10:00 am to 4:45 pm (closed Sundays and major holidays). The adoption fee is $40.99 ($30 + $10.99 microchip kit), which includes spaying/neutering, microchip, deworming, initial vaccinations, and a voucher for a wellness check at a local vet clinic. A rabies vaccination is not included. We do not run a heartworm test unless by request. Upon adoption, your new pet will be scheduled with Angelina Animal Hospital for its required spay/neuter surgery and microchip implant. You may pick up your new pet directly from the vet's office (average wait time is 1-3 days post adoption). The surgery must be completed before pick up.  Feel free to call the shelter or email us with any questions.\n\u201cVisual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\u201d",

Out of state adopters must come to meet the animal in person in Washington if approved for a meet and greet with a R.E.D. companion animal. Thank you.\n",

Shes used to being ignored and not loved on so she just takes time to come to you and want attention. She loves to run!! Not a big one to bark unless something is wrong.

To visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show. We have been told that you can go straight to the shelter and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog. From what we understand, the shelter will squeeze you in except between 12-3PM and near the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog. We hope your adoption process is smooth and full of happiness!\n\nThis amazing pup is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4471829.\n\nBethesda is a shy and scared girl. The shelter staff is working with her and she is improving, however, she still needs improvement. Bethesda won't walk on a leash and thrashes about when she is leashed. The kennel staff put her in a building close to a play yard and she will walk to the yard without a leash. She is still hesitant around the staff in the yard but they did find that Bethesda is very treat motivated. The last time the staff worked with her, they were able to get her leashed while rewarding her with treats.\n\nBethesda was brought to the shelter because she bit a person in the leg while they were skateboarding. She cannot go to a home with children. She is going to need a patient adopter that understands her behavior and can provide the obedience training that she needs. She is a young girl at a year old and has a long life ahead of her if given the chance. At her age, she can be taught the behavior she needs to be a pet in a home.

            "description": "This senior guy has a story to tell. Kodi was literally dumped out of a car at night on I 95. The fact that he is alive is a miracle in itself if you've ever driven that thruway. He ran off but after multiple attempts over the next couple of days was able to be caught. We were asked to help him which of course we did. Kodi was clearly neglected in his previous home. He tested positive for 2 tick borne diseases which have been treated and for heartworm disease for which he likewise\u00a0finished the treatment. It's all behind him now!\n\n?Kodi LOVED\u00a0car rides, hanging with humans, attending barbecues with friends of his foster and was a super friendly boy. He always wore\u00a0a smile on that sweet face. Kodi was fabulous on leash, a total gentleman.\u00a0\n\nKodi was adopted but\u00a0returned the next week for behaviors we hadn't seen in all the months he was with us for his vetting needs. Kodi presented with\u00a0threatening body language toward the adopter's company and on leash when encountering strangers with or without dogs. We had explained upfront to give him time to bond before introducing new people, basically the 'two week shutdown' for adjustment which we ask all our adopters, and\u00a0they in fact didn't do that, but still, it was so uncharacteristic of\u00a0him. We were stumped but\u00a0were fortunate to have him spend time in foster care in the home of trainers, Misguided Mutts Dog Behavior Training, who are also good friends of ours. We no longer felt like we knew this boy. What was going on?.\u00a0\n\n?Well, as we suspected would happen, we again saw the sweet Kodi we knew and loved. After a one week transition period to earn his trust, they began to introduce visitors. Kodi was slightly distrustful at first, but a quick verbal cue and he relaxed. Next came a walk where he would be immersed in an environment with triggers for them to observe any reactivity as seen by the adopter. Here are their exact words:\n\n\"He did great. The park was crazy busy. He was a gentleman on leash, walked past dogs and people fine. The one thing I noticed is that he got a little cautious when he was positioned on the side of the people but I just coached him along. No reactions at all. He saw doodles, a German Shepherd, two Rotties. Then we went to Starbucks to get him a pup cup and he didn't react at all then either even with the two ladies gushing over him at the drive thru. It's really fun to watch how young and carefree he acts or how he just wants to laydown, chill, and take in the sun\"\n\nSo here is our conclusion of his needs in an adoptive home!\n\n1. Kodi needs time to develop trust in his new family during an adjustment period. He is a submissive, moderately fearful boy until he has time to feel comfortable. Then, you can't contain his joy and capacity to love.\n\n2. After the adjustment, initially, his new family will need to be cognizant of his expression and body language which may be subtle. A quick verbal to him because of the trust that was built prior will give him confidence that everything is okay.\u00a0\n\n3.His new family must be sufficiently experienced in that they will recognize this sweetheart is just afraid, not mean.\n\n4. Kodi will take advantage of a gap in fencing or a gap under the fence between the ground and bottom of the fencing. He has been known to squeeze through the space where the fence gate attaches to the fencing. He has not challenged a privacy fence that does not have the 2 prior escape routes.\n\n5. Kodi is fearful of sticks. Brooms as well. If you pick a stick up to play fetch, he will cower. It seems he may have been abused as well as neglected.\n\nIf you feel that you can provide this senior, who has experienced nothing but neglect up to his being thrown out of that car on I 95, and then misunderstood by his adopter, with the loving home he deserves, please submit our application. Some patient, understanding person will be very lucky to enjoy\u00a0Kodi's loyalty and playful, fun personality.\u00a0\n\n**If you are serious about adopting , you must head to our website at www.kodisclub.org and submit a completed application. There are also additional photos!  We will not do anything without an app. Due to the small size of our volunteer-run rescue, only the approved adopter may be contacted. It is not first come first served, but the best match **",

My\u00a0 Owner passed away, & now I'm back to Twyla's Friends in search of a loving family that will take care of me until my days are done on this Earth.. The lump you see on the side of my shoulder is a fatty tumor, so it's not harmful, &\u00a0 It really doesn't bother me so far.. I'm in good health & heart worm negative, but I do take 1/2 of a Proin tablet Twice A-day since my bladder isn't what it used to be.. I really don't have any accidents cuz the Proin really helps.. My Foster mommy has lots of dogs around so I am used to other dogs...\n\nI can still jump up on the couch and lay on top to look out the window.. Overall, I am very loving & would like to find a Family that would love me\u00a0 For the sweet, older baby that I am. I can still go on walks, but I don't go very far.. I enjoy being loved on, Getting treats & hanging out with the rest of my brothers and sisters in my Foster home..\nHope to meet you soon, And thank you for your consideration...\n\n***Please note: All dogs are fostered in private homes of volunteers, so to meet a dog please fill out an Adoption Application on our website (http://www.twyla.org/adopt/our-adoption-process) so we may setup a private meetup with the dog or coordinate for an Introduction at the next general Adoption Meet  and Greet (as listed on our website: (http://www.twyla.org/upcoming-events), as not all dogs attend all Meet and Greets***",

He has a lot to learn, but he can melt your heart with his puppy eyes and very sweet and affectionate personality. He likes to be around his people and will sit/lean against your legs when he is next to you. He does have some energy but is a great couch cuddler once he's calmed down. He also seems pretty much potty trained and is very well behaved in his crate. He's very food motivated so that's very helpful with training him. He will play fetch for hours if you let him. He's a good boy, and would make an excellant jogging buddy/adventure companion. After a fun-filled day of play, he likes to curl up on the couch for a good cuddle (or sometimes try to sit on top of you to be as close as possible or nibble your ears).\n\nPAW places animals in the Washington DC and Baltimore Metropolitan areas only.",

He was an owner surrender from an older woman who was very sad but could no longer keep him as she was transitioning to an assisted living facility. When Howie arrived he was very out of sorts, it is possible his transition to his new home could also be rough but we hope not. He absolutely loves females but he isn't a fan of males and he doesn't seem to be budging on that. He doesn't attack or bite but he will growl and air snap as a warning that he's not comfy. This being said he is an absolute doll to women. He has the funniest personality and loves love! He also howls like a wolf, in his mind he's 100% wolf ! He also has a mohawk, which he feels, and we agree, makes him a total rockstar. We know his perfect home is out there and we would love to find it so he could spend the holiday in his FURever home!\n\n \n\nIf interested in adding this unique tiny lil dude to your home please contact us! \n\n \n\n $200.00 Adoption Fee \n\n(Which is considered a non refundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible. The fee itself is not negotiable, our vets don't negotiate and thus neither do we.)\n\nTo Contact Us\n\nMessage us through our website http://www.highplainspaw.org\n\nMessage the Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/HighPlainsPAW\n\nFill out our Adoption Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/adoption-application\n\nFill out our Foster Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/foster-application\n\nEmail us at highplainspaw@gmail.com\n\nCall our voicemail at (402)957-1578\n\nWE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY ALL OUR DOGS ARE LOCATED IN FOSTER HOMES.

Other than meeting our babies at events, we do require that you have an approved adoption application to schedule a meet and greet.

Red Collar Rescue rushed Conrad to the ER and then to the orthopedic vet for surgery.  Conrad spent months on medication and bed rest.  He\u2019s been healing with his foster parents and foster K9 siblings, and has finally been able to go on walks, play, and just be a happy boy!\n\nConrad is independent and strong willed, but loves to lean on his foster parents when he wants attention.   Incredibly smart and silly, he loves to make his foster family laugh with his goofiness and fun!  He plays hard, but also loves his cuddling and nap time!  Conrad is house trained, and will stand by the back door when he needs to go out.  He also loves to chase toads, which his foster mom does not enjoy, as he wants to bring them in the house!\n\nConrad has been through a lot in his short life, and still gets uneasy around some new people. Because he\u2019s been social distancing, he hasn\u2019t been able to socialize with new people and dogs as much as normal.   But, he\u2019s learning a ton from a trusted trainer who has helped numerous Red Collar Rescue  pups!\n\nWe know Conrad will bring joy, love and fun to his forever home. He deserves only the best after everything he\u2019s been though.  If interested in giving Conrad lots of TLC and a loving forever home, please submit the adoption application which can be found at www.redcollar.org\n\t\nAge: 2 years\nWeight: 45 lbs\nGood with Dogs: Yes\nGood with Cats: No\nGood with Children: possibly high school age +\nVaccinated: Yes\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nwww.redcollar.org\nwww.facebook.com/REDCollarRescue\n",

            "description": "Belle is a sweet, fun-loving, active, Redtick Coonhound.  She is about 2 years old, weighs 45lbs, is house broken, and loves to play most of the day, but knows the fine quality of a good nap.  Belle would do best in a home with a fully fenced yard, kids over the age of 12, and no cats.  She would also prefer to be an only dog.  Belle does have some separation anxiety and boundary anxiety but it is manageable as she becomes comfortable in a new space.  She is crate trained and prefers to sleep in her crate at night.  Her perfect situation is someone with Coonhound experience that is home most of the day and can give her the attention and continued training she needs.  She is smart, loving and very cuddly.  Belle listens very well to commands and she knows \"Sit, Stay, Leave it, Come, Down, and Off\".  She is going to do best with continued training and plenty of activity.  She is good on walks with a harness and could be a great running partner.  Belle's favorite thing to do is run around the back yard with her favorite toy in her mouth for a while, then sit by your side at night while you watch TV.  Belle is in MA and available for visits.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to apply to adopt, please submit an application using the link below.\nApplication link (please copy and paste into your browser's address bar)\n\nhttps://ws.ishelters.com/application.php?k=coonhOUnd&t=Coonhound%20Adoption\n\nAbout our rescue\nWe are a foster based rescue.

I am a mix of Husky/Malamute and a Pitbull according to my former owners. I am 3 years old, in excellent health and I am already neutered, vaccinated, dewormed and microchipped.\nI'm about 95 pounds of muscle and love, so I'm looking for an owner who knows how to manage me well and who will also have good strength to hold me down when I go for walks. However, I am used to wearing the Gentle Leader and have made a lot of progress in learning not to pull the leash too much. I can't live with children because I can be impatient with certain manipulations and can be possessive of my things. And yes, although I am very close to my favorite human, I am also grumpy in some situations. My new owners won't have to plan to have children in the years to come either, because I will still be here! I'm looking for a family with a house with a fenced yard, so I can play ball safely. I also love swimming in a plastic children's pool. However, since I am very reactive to other animals, it will be safer if my yard is fully fenced. For these reasons, I also cannot live with another dog or cat or have dog friends visiting. A family living in the countryside would be perfect for me, it will prevent me from barking because I am a very good janitor, especially if there are other animals around! In fact, if my new family is looking for a big, brave dog to keep wild animals away from their property, I am up for the challenge. However, I'm not cut out to live outside 24 hours a day, because I love the comfort of a sofa too much! I am housetrained and I am able to stay wisely alone (free in the house) while my humans work. I'm not a good dog to live in an apartment because of my big voice! I also have an average energy level. After a 30-60 minute walk and some ball games in the yard, I like to fall asleep on the couch next to my human and watch Netflix! My human will have to understand my limits and know how to respect them (I grunt to warn if I am uncomfortable in a situation), educate myself with lots of positive reinforcement and also know how to avoid situations that could put my safety or that of other animals at risk. I need some time to adjust to strangers, but once I am confident, I am a good dog who benefits from being known. I'm getting more and more depressed at the shelter, please help me find my family!  Max ??\nMax is currently in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Quebec. Please contact the person responsible for his adoption if you have any questions or if you wish to meet him. charlene.fournier@spamauricie.com\n\n\nBonjour \u00e0 tous, je m'appelle Max et j'attends depuis trop longtemps mon parfait propri\u00e9taire. Je suis un m\u00e9lange de Husky / Malamute et d'un Pitbull selon mes anciens propri\u00e9taires. J'ai 3 ans, en excellente sant\u00e9 et je suis d\u00e9j\u00e0 st\u00e9rilis\u00e9e, vaccin\u00e9e, vermifug\u00e9e et micropuce.\nJe suis environ 95 livres de muscle et d'amour, donc je recherche un propri\u00e9taire qui sait bien me g\u00e9rer et qui aura \u00e9galement une bonne force pour me maintenir lorsque je vais me promener. Cependant, j'ai l'habitude de porter le Gentle Leader et j'ai beaucoup progress\u00e9 pour apprendre \u00e0 ne pas trop tirer la laisse. Je ne peux pas vivre avec des enfants parce que je peux \u00eatre impatient avec certaines manipulations et \u00eatre possessif de mes affaires. Et oui, bien que je sois tr\u00e8s proche de mon humain pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9, je suis aussi grincheux dans certaines situations. Mes nouveaux propri\u00e9taires n'auront pas non plus \u00e0 pr\u00e9voir d'avoir des enfants dans les ann\u00e9es \u00e0 venir, car je serai toujours l\u00e0! Je recherche une famille avec une maison avec une cour cl\u00f4tur\u00e9e, pour pouvoir jouer au ballon en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9. J'aime aussi nager dans une piscine pour enfants en plastique. Cependant, comme je suis tr\u00e8s r\u00e9actif aux autres animaux, il sera plus s\u00fbr si ma cour est enti\u00e8rement cl\u00f4tur\u00e9e. Pour ces raisons, je ne peux pas non plus vivre avec un autre chien ou chat ou avoir des amis chiens en visite. Une famille vivant \u00e0 la campagne serait parfaite pour moi, cela m'emp\u00eachera d'aboyer car je suis un tr\u00e8s bon concierge, surtout s'il y a d'autres animaux aux alentours! En fait, si ma nouvelle famille recherche un gros chien courageux pour \u00e9loigner les animaux sauvages de leur propri\u00e9t\u00e9, je suis pr\u00eat \u00e0 relever le d\u00e9fi. Cependant, je ne suis pas fait pour vivre \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur 24 heures sur 24, car j'aime trop le confort d'un canap\u00e9! Je suis \u00e9duqu\u00e9e et je suis capable de rester sagement seule (libre dans la maison) pendant que mes humains travaillent. Je ne suis pas un bon chien pour vivre dans un appartement \u00e0 cause de ma grande voix! J'ai aussi un niveau d'\u00e9nergie moyen. Apr\u00e8s 30 \u00e0 60 minutes de marche et quelques jeux de ballon dans la cour, j'aime m'endormir sur le canap\u00e9 \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de mon humain et regarder Netflix! Mon humain devra comprendre mes limites et savoir les respecter (je grogne pour avertir si je suis mal \u00e0 l'aise dans une situation), m'\u00e9duquer avec beaucoup de renforcement positif et savoir aussi \u00e9viter les situations qui pourraient mettre ma s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ou celle de autres animaux \u00e0 risque. J'ai besoin de temps pour m'adapter aux \u00e9trangers, mais une fois que j'ai confiance en moi, je suis un bon chien qui profite d'\u00eatre connu. Je suis de plus en plus d\u00e9prim\u00e9 au refuge, aidez-moi \u00e0 retrouver ma famille! Max ??\nMax est actuellement \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Qu\u00e9bec.

They lost the only home they\u2019ve ever known when their owner could no longer care for them and decided to drop them off at a shelter where they had little chance of being adopted at all much less together.\nAt Paws4Rescue we love our seniors so much and are happy to help these sweethearts find a forever family.\nThese pups are quite spry for their age. They are about 11 years old and weigh about 75 pounds. They are spayed/neutered and up to date on all of their vaccinations.\nChaco is a the female and Oreo is the yellow male. His silly ears are enough to make your day! Chaco and Oreo are friendly with other dogs, love to play, and adore attention of course.\nPlease contact BigYellowDog.wendy@gmail.com if you\u2019d be interested in giving Chaco and Oreo a forever home and the best years of their lives.

(White)\n\n PHOTOS SOON! \n\n*With Adults: yes, good with adults.\n*With Kids: no experience with kids, protective of his food, will not be placed with children.\n*With Other Dogs: he was okay with other dogs at the shelter (not playing, but shared his space in peace). However, in former foster home, he seemed to have some issues, foster did not have another dog, whenever he would see another dog on walk, he would bark at them, and if another dog tries to sniff his bottom, he will growl. We will be working on this now that he is in the Chicago area.\n*With Cats: no experience. \n*Housebroken: yes, in former foster home, however, there will be a new learning curve when moving into a new home.\n*Energy Level: medium level.\n*Can he be handled/touched: he can after he gets to know and trust his people. He will do \"biting motion\" and jerk of his head when/if someone tries to touch his bottom. Care should be taken when grooming.\n*Barker: not a barker inside, but as said above, he will bark at another dog while on a walk, especially if relatively close. \n*Escape Artist: he has tendency to get excited and run out the door to go out for a walk, extra care, namely a held leash, needs to be place so that he doesn't get loose. \n*Food Aggressive: yes, he is protective of his food. He will go into a \"biting motion\" aka a warning (not actual strong bite though) if someone is messing with his food/bowl once it is given to him. \n*Walks on Leash: yes, enjoys his walks.\n\nIf you are interested in Danny, please complete an adoption application! Thanks!",

He is neutered, good on a leash and has all his vaccinations.  He likes to play too!  He's very smart, and learns super fast.\n\nTy is a mix, we think he has lab and hound dog in there, but he could have pyrenees also.  We think he will be a pretty good sized boy when he's done growing.\n\nCall Lori at 405-620-2411 if you'd like to come meet this charmer.  He's ready for his forever family!!!!",

The person that found me picked me up and took me to the vet to check and see if I was chipped.  Lo and behold, I was!!  How awesomely amazing!\n\nThen the unthinkable happened.  The vet came back and said that I had 4 different owners registered to my chip.  You know what happens next??  It's awful and not for the faint at heart.  Each of those listed as an owner kept passing me off to the next person and then ultimately I was dumped.  \n\nI just don't understand why???  I wasn't that bad of a puppy.  I mean I had a lot of energy because I was young, but geez...I wonder if they would do that to a hyper human child as well??  People, us pups need boundaries set and taught what we should do and how we need to act.  A little instruction, attention, and love is all we need.  It's so sad.\n\nI was so upset.  Here I thought I found my home and BAM, kicked to the curb like a bag of garbage.  Anyway, my finder was kind enough to keep me for a little while until Lucies could make a space for me.\n\nThe people here are wonderful and they have taught me all kinds of fun things.  As a bonus, I get to run and play with other dogs and make friends!\n\nI have a docked tail and it sure is cute!  I'd really love to be someone's running or hiking partner.  Oh yeah, and I love to swim!  Splish splash I was taking a bath.....sorry I digressed a bit :) Isn't music fun though??\n\nI am leash and crate trained and I'm super duper smart.\n\nSo, what do you say??  Come visit me and you'll see that I'm the dog for you!!\n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home. Phone interviews are required for all adoptions****",

Jess loves to run and needs a pretty spacious yard that is securely fenced with a six foot fence.  Hounds are very good at climbing short fences, so a taller fence for her is needed.\n\nJess loves to eat, and loves treats and is very well mannered.  She learns fast and is very bright and curious.  She is spayed, fully vaccinated, good on a leash, and looking for her forever.\n\nHer adoption fee is $150.  She is also microchipped.  Please call Lori at 405-620-2411 to set a time to meet this lovely lady!!!",

            "description": "Hi my name is Fluffer! I\u2019m 7 years old and 25 lbs!  When you meet me, you\u2019ll probably fall instantly in love. I know I\u2019m cute and I wag my tail and shake my butt happily to win you over even more. That\u2019s me....about 95 percent of the time. I walk great on a leash, get along with other dogs, and LOVE treats (especially peanut butter bones).\nBUT- there\u2019s another 5 percent of me that you MUST know about before you consider adopting me. I have a bite history. It is mostly food aggressive behavior, but not all the time. I\u2019ve been adopted 3 times by ODHS and each time I\u2019ve been returned for my biting. Not nipping, but biting. ODHS is committed to finding me the right home, but knows that my future people should be \n1) incredibly dog savvy\n2) be willing to feed me and let me sleep in a penned in area or separate room (like a laundry room, mud room, etc). I don\u2019t especially like crates and got mad and bit about that before too. \n3) be committed to not leaving human food out for me to access, including the garbage can. If I get a hold of something that I want, I will NOT easily give it up.\n\nSo that\u2019s me, Fluffer, in a nutshell. I\u2019m a happy guy who loves belly rubs and human attention. But it\u2019s very important you know all about me before we meet. \n\n\nHope to see you soon! \n\nEducational articles:\n3/3/3 Rule;\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturday from 12-2.  \n\nOur adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience.

I just don't get it though because I consider myself a lap dog. I'm just 92 pounds of love & pure fun - who doesn't need that in their lives??\n\nKilo/Crackers has now come back to 11th Hour Rescue because his family has unfortunately lost their home and sadly cannot keep their dogs. Willow & Fawn (littermates, adopted together at just 2 months old) have also been returned to us from the same home where they've lived together for several years. Kilo and his \"sisters\" were raised with kids and other dogs, so they are great with both.\n\nKilo/Crackers (and his sisters) are housetrained, good on leash and crate trained. They are all wonderful dogs who would love to find a new home asap.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Kilo/Cracker, please fill out an application at EHRDOGS.ORG!",

We love dogs like Enzo at the rescue because watching them thrive does our hearts well.  Love it when other people agree and ADOPT!!  Enzo was recently neutered, dental done and blood work is fine.  He loves to burrow and prefers life without other dogs but he tolerates by hiding out.  He is not very kind to his canine pals. They just avoid him.

            "description": "Hi there, I\u2019m Trixie! I\u2019m having some trouble finding my forever home but my foster family can\u2019t understand why! I am a female Bluetick coonhound around 40ish pounds, somewhere between 5 and 7 years young and I love to have fun! I am goofy pup who loves to run and play. \n\nBeing a coonhound, I am occasionally intense, especially around smaller animals but I promise I usually just want to play! I love doggie daycare! It helps release me energy & make me less nervous. \n\nI don\u2019t always understand what the tiny humans called kids are doing and that can stress me out, so I need a family without them. If your cats don\u2019t like to play with dogs then I don\u2019t think we would work out. \n\nI deal with some of the normal dog anxieties such as nervousness during thunderstorms and new environments. These anxieties can sometimes cause me to be a bit vocal (I am a CoonHOUND after all) but I am able to settle with some love and treats after a time. Maybe a home without shared walls would be best. \n\nI do know how to jump 4 foot fences, so a 6 foot would be necessary if my family has a fence! I enjoy long naps in the sun and also love long walks and taking the time to smell the flowers. Come take me for a walk maybe we\u2019ll be the perfect match.",

            "description": "CONTACT: dog.sos@yahoo.com to Helen G.\n\nMeet amazing Eloise! She is an active senior at 9 1/2 years young. Adorable and a lovely mix of a terrier with chihuahua to make for a cute and compact 40lb. medium-sized doll.\n\nEloise has such a bright spirit, is ready to go anytime. She will get you out for walks, make you laugh, give you love, and cuddle with you! If you have a more quiet household, that will work just fine for her. She doesn't need a yard if she gets her walks in. If you have a yard, she will love it.\n\nShe will do best with an experienced owner rather than a first-time pup parent. A quiet household with no kids is best for her.\n\nEloise really wants you to herself and is not into dogs and gets a bit overly excited, just as some people are more homebody. She is great on the leash, fully trained (and comes with a transition session!), and makes it easy to move to the other side of the street so she can enjoy herself and not be forced to go nose to nose when pooches are not her thing.\n\nThis cutie pie loves human companionship, will be your best friend, and will take ear scritches and belly rubs as often as you will give them. She will take time to settle into your home, and we will give you tips on how to ease her in.\n\nShe is in great health, well trained, and really fun.\n\nShe is now updated on all shots, spayed, and will be chipped.\n\nELOISE IS A COURTESY POST, follow the email at the top of this bio.\n\nWe cover the medical to prepare the pet for adoption and the adopt donations go directly to cover those costs and range from $295-$495. Thank you for stepping up to save a life!\n\nTo expedite to meet with this dog, please go to our site at www.savinggreatanimals.org and fill out an application. We look at the first applications to arrive, so we hope to hear from you soon!",

Spots would do best in a home that has a backyard for him to run around in and also a home that has an active family as he is a high energy dog, and needs a family that can match his energy. Spots will need to be the only dog in the home. He needs someone that is willing to spend time and train him. He is currently getting basic leash training and some other basic commands.",

I am in a great foster home but am longing for a home of my own,\n\nDon't let my gray hair fool you! I'm still pretty feisty and I love to snuggle! I am a little overweight, but my foster Mom got me on a great nutrition plan and best of all - I have a fenced in yard to run around in and explore!  \n\nI'm still a little reluctant to take the plunge of using the doggie door - but I'm getting there!.  My foster Mom says I listen very well.\n\nI like other dogs just fine as long as they aren't big dogs!  I will pester a cat to play a bit too much if there isn't another dog to hang out with.  I was recently on a trial adoption but the resident cat could not get used to me being there and wanting to play.\n\nI am not used to the activity levels of children - I'm an \"adults only\" dog!\n\nI have been spayed, am heartworm negative, and am up to date with vaccinations.  My adoption fee is only $100 - a bargain if I do say so myself!  \n\nTake a chance on me - you won't regret it!\n\nTo request an adoption application, please visit https://www.udranch.org/contact.  Please allow 24-48 hours for a response!",

I'm just so glad to be here! I love playing with toys, and taking walks. It's true, I'm no young pup, and I have better manners to prove it! I even got to meet a cat the other day and did very well they said. I'm a pretty awesome companion, and I'm looking for the perfect human to spend my forever with. Could you be it??\n\nPlease apply to foster or adopt online at www.corridorrescue.org\n\nDirect inquiries to: adopt@corridorrescue.org.\n\nThe adoption fee of $225 covers spay/neuter, microchip and current vaccines.\n\nTransport is available and can be discussed on an individual basis.\n\nThank you for considering a rescued former street dog for your next family member",

No chip and no tags. She was held for stray hold until 10/17 and was spayed, chipped and vaccinated, and now Ruthie is looking for a new home!\nWe're not sure what life was like for sweet Ruthie before she came to us. She has a large scar on her forehead that looks like an old bite wound sustained as a puppy, now healed. She was scared when she first came to us, but never nippy and was playing with the dogs within a few hours and trusted us by the next day. She gets along with all dogs big and small but can be food possessive with other dogs so needs to be fed separately. No food aggression with people.\nSee Ruthie's page here: http://www.causeforsbpaws.org/animals/browse\n\nApply here (available after 10/17): http://www.causeforsbpaws.org/forms/form?formid=3251\n\nEmail cause4sbpaws@gmail.com with questions.",

            "description": "Hello! My name is Felix and I am 14 years young. I have no grays though, because I am all white ? Don\u2019t let my age fool you, I am still a healthy, active boy. I love to go on walks, but I get very excited when I see other dogs or a cyclist and will pull on my leash. Mom says I\u2019m pretty strong, so make sure you are too. Traffic causes me anxiety, so I\u2019d prefer more leisurely walks without the hustle and bustle of cars. I\u2019m very loving and am great with kids and cats. I will bark at the neighbor\u2019s dog through the fence, but am not aggressive. I LOVE cleaning up the floors after my foster skin siblings\u2019 meals and mom wouldn\u2019t put it past me to counter surf, even though it hasn\u2019t happened yet. Stairs are a little rough for me, so I\u2019d prefer to not have to use them. I like to sleep in my crate with the door open, but please don\u2019t close it as it gives me anxiety. I\u2019d really prefer to be with someone who is home most of the time so I can snuggle and follow you around, especially since I don\u2019t like being in a crate. One more very important thing, I have selective hearing (I\u2019m deaf), but mom says I\u2019m smart and has already been able to teach me signs. I\u2019d love to find a family to call my own and live out the rest of my days with.\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting me, please fill out our adoption application to begin the process at http://savetheboxers.com/adoptionapp.php.\n\nIf you aren't able to adopt at this time, please consider making a much needed, tax-deductible donation to Legacy Boxer Rescue at http://savetheboxers.com/donate.php.",

            "description": "Hi there my name is Louie and I'm a 10-month old lab-pit mix.\nI have been at HALO K9 Behavior Center though the Shelter & Rescue Partner Program. The shelter thought I would be a good candidate for this program because when I was surrendered to the shelter, I was very fearful and showing fear aggression (growling at the shelter staff). \nAt HALO, I learned that people aren't so scary but actually very nice. I also have many, many dog friends who have helped me overcome my fear of people. I am currently working on: walking nicely on a leash (I am still afraid of bikes), respecting items in my room (I still chew on things I shouldn't), and greeting people properly (sometimes I bark at them). Even though I am a work in progress, I am the sweetest boy with the cutest personality. I would do best in a home with someone who has another confident, well adjusted dog who can teach me how to overcome my issues. I've only been at HALO since August and have made amazing strides. The people at HALO are confident that I will be a perfect companion given the chance. \n\nLove, Lou-Lou \n Primary Color: Tan Secondary Color: White Weight: 55.3lbs Age: 1yrs 1mths 2wks Animal has been Neutered",

            "description": "Meet Pickles! The biggest, slobberyist goober ever. Pickles is about 2 years old and had a rough start to life. This special boy needs an experienced handler, with mastiff experience and/or training experience to ensure he is set up for success. He is looking for a home with structure and NO children. He loves being outside, throwing his toys up in the air, and snoozing on the couch. A fenced in yard would be ideal because this baby beast loves to sunbathe and sit outside taking in the world. His facial expressions and goofy floor acrobatics will keep a smile on your face. \n\nBecause of his past, Pickles is fearful of men and strangers- slow introductions and an acclimation period are needed, but then he will charm your socks off! He has been through a board and train with Sit Means Sit and has a lifetime membership of free group classes. He is very well trained on the e-collar system. He loves playing with other doggos but is selective when it comes to his home environment and his humans. He may do better as an only dog, but its really on a case by case basis as he does enjoy a fur-sibling to play with. No cats for this boy. As a protective breed, P tends to guard his handlers until he feels safe and comfortable with new faces. This is something Pickles is working on in his current foster home where he is doing fantastic. He sleeps well in his crate at night, and this structure is really good for him. This angel is worth the wait to get to know, and deserves an amazing furever home. \n\nIf you think you may be a good fit for Pickles, submit an application using this link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfC2mVkqTTzPJQK74MJQWetUQUcMURow4gvuCxs1nVT4KYXvA/viewform?usp=sf_link\n\n*PLEASE READ: NC applicants only. Dog being rehomed through private owner, this is a courtesy post on behalf of Freedom Ride Rescue.",

            "description": "Rosie, oh Rosie - a sweet brindle Boxer girl who is looking for a pawsome home to call her own. For a girl who is just about 2 years old, Rosie's story is a very sad one. Her owner passed away and believed to have been alone in the home for several days near him when family found them. She was clearly stressed but our volunteers took tender loving care of her until she was placed in foster. She is doggie selective and likes to be in control so best placed as an only dog in her forever home. Our Rosie is crate trained, house trained, does okay on leash , likes to play with toys which keeps her busy. A stable, very quiet home without a lot of activity in and out of the home is best for Rosie. She can be nervous around new people in the beginning until she knows you. Rosie is not a companion animal that should be brought to dog parks, coffee shops, or a home with people in/out of often. She does best with her familiar home surroundings and people to call her own.\n\nRosie must be placed in the Phoenix area so that she can continue her BLR sponsored training. We will only place in the Phoenix Metro area and only with an experienced Boxer family who will commit to continue her training (already paid for)! Email us at info@boxerluv.org if you believe you're the right fit. 2/2/21 4:05 PM",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nI'm starting to wonder if I will ever find my forever home.. Can anyone help me?Date into Rescue: 2/28/20107\nReason for being in rescue: Lovingly surrendered by owners\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms in Pacolet, SC\nSpecial Needs? Brielle had surgery in February 2020 to remove some masses around her anus. She'd experienced challenges going to the bathroom that resulted in her rectum protruding. Brielle has recovered and is now ready for a home with a very experienced owner.\nWeight: 62 lbs\nHeight: 24 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? Yes\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Brielle needs a quiet, more reserved home with owners that have a soft spot for timid dogs. She is comfortable by herself and would be fine with another dog in the home. Brielle feels safe in her crate and needs to know she will always have a spot of her own. Brielle will trust the right people in her own way and her own time. She would like an owner who can meet her on her level and let her know the world is safe. Brielle will not be adopted to a first time dog owner or into a home with children under 10. Her ideal home has experience with timid dogs and has another dog that Brielle can continue to learn from.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Brielle arrived in rescue as an owner release with a few others. From day one she has always been timid and scared while her other siblings have come out of their shells and found homes. Brielle is the type of dog that will need plenty of one on one time to get her where she needs to be in life. Everyone at the rescue has worked with her and she will now take treats out of our hands, but she could really use help in a permanent home to help her grow. She has great potential with a sweet and gentle nature and just needs a special person to help her along her way.\n\nBrielle has come a long way since she first came to us. She is sweet and trusts the people she is with everyday. She does perfectly fine with all dogs, and they help her relax and learn that we people are not so bad. Brielle needs an understanding human that has a soft spot for dogs with troubled souls. Brielle is reportedly a 3rd generation Shepadoodle - German Shepherd and Standard Poodle, but since she looks so much more like a Labrador Retriever, we've put that breed instead. Brielle is ready for a home of her own after 3 years of learning humans are good.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Cautious but warms up\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Brielle's estimated birthday is 01/02/2010\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

            "description": "Shea is a fun, friendly, exuberant girl! Currently living in a foster home, we have gotten to know Shea as an active, smart lady. She would do best in an active household that would enjoy going on all sorts of adventures together! Shea loves to go for hikes and walks, and even has potential as a running partner. She LOVES the water and swimming! Shea can be a little shy and reserved at first, but once she settles in she shows that she is a cuddly, affectionate girl but not overly clingy, though she does have a bit of FOMO if she sees you having fun without her! Shea is a little picky with her dog friends, but seems to have potential to get along with many with proper intros. Shea has taken some lessons with Sits N' Wiggles Cleveland to polish her manners on leash and when excited and has shown she is really bright and good at picking up on routine. Shea seems to have potential to live with cats, again with proper intros. She can be exuberant greeting them and wants to give them kisses, but backs off when told. Shea would love to be the life of the party in her forever home and she'll certainly add loves of love and entertainment. She is around 3 or 4 years old and weighs 48 lbs.\nDue to COVID-19, CITY DOGS is currently doing adoptions by APPOINTMENT ONLY. Please visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog to request a meet and greet! \n\nQuestions? Email: citydogs@city.cleveland.oh.us | Call: (216) 664-3476\nVisit: 9203 Detroit Avenue Cleveland, OH 44102\n\nHours:\n10 AM - 3 PM Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday\n10 AM - 6 pm Tuesday & Thursday\n\nFee: $61 | Includes spay/neuter, shots, microchip, license, 30 days free pet insurance (when registered upon adoption)\n\nThe CITY DOGS mission is to increase adoptions from the City Kennel by changing the image of the pit bulls who make up the majority of the kennel population, by preparing all adoptable dogs in the kennel for lives in loving homes and by creating as many opportunities as possible for the public to meet and get to know our dogs for the terrific pets they are meant to be.\n\nOur Adoption Process...\nHere's a little about how things work:\nAll of the CITY DOGS posted for adoption are available for direct adoption from the kennel, unless noted otherwise. You must schedule a meet with a dog in advance - we are not currently accepting walk-ins. Please look online first to see if there are any dogs you think would be a good fit for your home before scheduling a meet. To get the process started, visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog and fill out the form. One of our adoption counselors will get in touch to schedule and confirm your meet! At the kennel, an adoption counselor will introduce you and your family to the adoptable dogs, share information we know about them, and discuss our suggested ways for successfully integrating a new dog into your home. You are welcome to meet multiple dogs. If the dog you adopt is already fixed, he or she may leave with you that day - otherwise, the dog can go home after receiving the spay or neuter surgery.)\n\nAbout Our Dogs: All available dogs have gone through a behavioral and medical assessment. This assessment is a snapshot of who the dog is at that given time. We cannot make any guarantees with regard to behavior, temperament or health of any City Dog once they are in the home. Most of our dogs are picked up as strays, so we do not know what kind of home environment they were living in (i.e. with kids, other dogs or other cats), nor do we know if most of them are house trained. Everything we know about them is based on volunteer and staff observations. We do have some dogs in foster homes, where they will have more information about how the dog is in a home environment. It is very hard to tell with certainty whether or not a dog will be good with kids, cats or another dog. If you have kids in the home or another dog, we do require that they be present for a meet and greet with the dog you are considering for adoption.\n\nHeath/Vaccinations: Dogs that are adopted directly from the kennel need to go to your personal vet within two weeks of leaving the kennel. All dogs receive their DAPPL, Rabies, and Bordatella vaccines, though you may be required to get follow up boosters. All dogs come microchipped and with a Cuyahoga County license.?  \n\n\n\n \n",

            "description": "Ok SAAP nation I must stop hiding this sweet girl. Meet Lilli, she is an adorable sweet senior, 8 year old, beagle who has battled and come out the winner of heartworm treatment. She is still learning to be an inside dog, so house-training is a work in progress, but she is getting there. She is a very low-key sweetheart, on the submissive side and would probably be good with kids who know when she wants her own space. She will need a fenced in yard because she loves using that beagle nose to explore. You never hear a sound out of her until the other dogs in her foster home start barking and even then, she doesn't bark much. She is available for adoption for adoption now and has no lasting ill effects from her heartworms. She doesn't have any teeth and will need to be on a canned food diet. She does great with other dogs but hasn't been around the cat yet. She is spayed, up to date on vaccines, flea and heartworm preventative and micro-chipped. She is taking applications now at adoptastray.com. Just ask for Lilli!All SAAP animals are vet checked, UTD on vaccines, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, and given flea and heartworm preventative as age appropriate.\n\nOur website is: http://www.adoptastray.com/\n\nTo check if this animal is still available visit our master pet list on our website at:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/adoptable-animals/\n\nHave questions:\nPlease email us at saap@adoptastray.com for more information about this animal or to answer any questions you may have.

She absolutely loves to lay on sofa and on my lap??And is so sweet!!! She also seems to like the dog bed( especially if it's next to me).....she loves to play with toys and she lovvvves the kong and enjoys peanut butter inside for sure.....easy to put leash on even sits for leash before I ask...and so far has been easy to walk... have only seen other dogs from a distance but she just looks but hasn't reacted otherwise. Does not seem anxious.... very chill while here thus far and just enjoying relaxing I guess. House trained for sure!! Doesn't gobble down her food she seems to be taking her time with that and of course loves treats! She is soooo beautiful and sweet and she hasn't jumped once... maybe a great fit for someone you know\" Maybe you? CHECK HER OUT ON YouTube https://youtu.be/e1-dglpIRTk",

So if you have kids over 14 or you don't have kids I could be your new best friend. I like to run, play ball, do food puzzles and spend time with you. I can jump a short fence so if you have a taller fence (like a 6ft privacy fence) or like long, leashed walks I would love that too. I can be a bit possessive of my food but the people at MLAR can tell you how to work with me on that and how to manage this.  If you're looking for a partner to be your buddy in life's adventures I'm here and ready to go.  Apply for me today.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting any of our adoptable dogs, please fill out an application at http://www.mlar.org/adopt/adoption-process\n\nE-mails regarding adoption are not considered an application. \n\n\nOut-of-state applicants will not be considered, unless there are special circumstances. Main Line Animal Rescue does local adoptions to families with excellent vet references and an installed fenced yard. You must have a secure traditional fence OR a professionally installed underground electric fenced area in which a dog can safely play without getting out). The fence must be securely attached to your house, dog pens, dog runs and a tie outs are not approved. \n\nPlease visit our web site for more detailed information on the animals in our care, our educational campaigns, and for helpful tips on adoption.  www.MLAR.org",

            "description": "Barry is a BEAUTIFUL husky and his temperament makes him even more handsome.  Barry and his Mom Sasha (also available) came to us when one of the elderly owners passed away and the other had to move in with family.  Barry, while he has the quintessential Husky looks with the beautiful coat and striking blue eyes, he has a much more soft, affectionate and attentive personality that alot of Huskies have.  He LOVES to be petted and will sit at your feet and lean across your legs to get as close as possible, and even when he is out running in our fenced in play yards he will check back in frequently with the volunteers.  Barry also doesn't appear to have the Husky \"escape artist\" trait - he doesn't try to jump our fences nor dig under!  Good boy!\n\nBarry is housetrained and walks pretty well on a leash (unless he sees a squirrel or cat running past - so no small critters in his home).  He lived with other dogs so could live with another dog in his forever home, he seems to like the females the best (maybe because he lived with his Mom and 2 female small Peke mixes in his prior home.).  Barry so deserves a safe, loving, active forever home.  Please come meet this handsome guy.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting any of our adoptable dogs, please fill out an application at https://www.mlar.org/adoption-overview\n\nE-mails regarding adoption are not considered an application. \n\nOut-of-state applicants (outside of PA/NJ/DE) will not be considered, unless there are special circumstances. \n\nPlease visit our web site for more detailed information on the animals in our care, our educational campaigns, and for helpful tips on adoption.  www.MLAR.org",

            "description": "Sasha is a beautiful Husky who has great energy for a 9 year old girl.  She is in great shape and LOVES to run in the fenced in play yards and hike on our trails.  Once she has had her exercise you get to see the affectionate side of her, she is so sweet and loves to be petted and will sit for treats too.  Sasha came in with her son Barry (also available) when one of their elderly owners passed away and the other one had to move in with family members.\nSasha is housetrained and walks pretty well on leash (except if she sees a squirrel or cat run by - so no small critters in her forever home please).  Sasha is a typical husky in one trait, she likes to challenge fences, so she will need a tall fence (we use the 6 ft high ones at the rescue) or privacy fence where she can't get over to keep her safe!\nSasha has alot of love and life in her and she so deserves a forever home where she can go for some good long walks or run in the fenced in yard and then snuggle on the couch to binge some Netflix with you!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting any of our adoptable dogs, please fill out an application at https://www.mlar.org/adoption-overview\n\nE-mails regarding adoption are not considered an application. \n\nOut-of-state applicants (outside PA/NJ/DE) will not be considered, unless there are special circumstances. \n\nPlease visit our web site for more detailed information on the animals in our care, our educational campaigns, and for helpful tips on adoption.  www.MLAR.org",

I\u2019m house trained and  eager to follow rules (especially if incentivized with a treat).   I love to give kisses and play all day. I\u2019m a good listener and know: sit, down and stay. I love to play with balls and squeaky toys but I like frisbees best of all!\n\nBefore I was saved by Red Collar Rescue, humans had not been kind to me.  My prior owners dumped me in a strange part of town, and I was alone and too scared to trust anyone.   Now I am in a loving foster home with a great foster mom and dad and a K9 foster sibling.  They are awesome!   Because of my past, I am a little shy around new people, but once I have some space and time to sniff and get to know people, I become very affectionate!\n\nI will make a great companion to an active person who enjoys taking walks and playing fetch!  I require a home with another dog as that makes me more comfortable. I'm looking forward to finding my forever home!  If you feel we might be a perfect match, please visit www.redcollar.org and submit the adoption application form!  xoxo!\n\n\nAge: 1 year\nWeight:  38 lbs\nGood with Dogs: Yes.  Another dog in home is required.\nGood with Cats: Unknown\nGood with Children:  possibly high school age +\nVaccinated:  Yes\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\nMicrochipped:  Yes \n\nwww.redcollar.org\nwww.facebook.com/REDCollarRescue\n",

Petunia is dog friendly and having a dog friend in her new home will help her adjust a little easier. This girl is nervous and will take some time to warm up! The adoption fee for all of our dogs is $250.00 + tax and that includes their vaccinations, spay or neuter, rabies and microchip. Our dogs are also heartworm negative (or we will cover their treatment).

He stays off furniture unless invited, knows many basic commands (sit, stay, come, etc.), doesn\u2019t bark when his foster mom is home and doesn\u2019t shed much at all. He\u2019s friendly towards all people and greets any visitors at the door calmly. His foster mom has been walking him about 4-5 miles a day. He seems happy and calmed by that amount of exercise, and he could probably hike 10+ miles easily.\n\nFrisko is working hard on his socialization skills with other dogs and is showing marked improvement. He has gone on walks with a few different medium/large dogs and does well walking next to them; he\u2019ll sniff/allow them to sniff him. He is also getting more comfortable walking next to smaller dogs but moves away from them if they get too close. He is prey-driven towards small animals so isn\u2019t a good match to live with cats or small dogs. He doesn\u2019t like to be left alone. Frisko willingly goes into his crate on command; he whines when his foster mom leaves the house and barks a bit when he hears her return. \n\nFrisko is smart, super loyal and cuddly. He will be a great addition to a family that\u2019s experienced with larger dogs (ideally huskies) and interested in training him. Frisko will thrive with adequate physical and mental stimulation. If you're looking for a stellar walking or running companion, here he is!\n\nFrisco\u2019s adoption fee includes neuter, basic vaccinations, rabies vaccination, and heartworm tested negative.\n\nYou can find his application here:\n\nhttps://forms.gle/5eSBjHrWv7pTEEzUA\n\nQuestions?

            "description": "Boris is a 7.5 year old Border Collie mix (and maybe shepherd) who weighs 45 pounds. He is up to date on vaccinations and neutered. Boris is house and crate trained.\n\nDon't let the premature gray fool you. Boris is smart, spunky, animated and has a young, playful spirit. He loves to play with toys and will toss them in the air and jump enthusiastically to catch them. He needs sturdy toys because he will completely destroy the soft stuffed toys. He loves a Kong filled with peanut butter and will run to his crate to receive his treat and gently takes them from your hand. He waits patiently next to his person for a good back rub and then rests peacefully on a dog bed. His favorite thing to do is to ride in the car and will eagerly hop in the car for a ride around town.\n\nTo understand Boris's needs, it helps to know a little bit about his history. Like many rescue dogs Boris was dumped by his owner. However, this happened to Boris twice. When he was a cute little fuzzy puppy of eight weeks old someone handed him to an employee in a pet supply store and never came back for him. He found his way to our rescue where he had dozens of interested applications and was adopted. Seven years later Boris was dumped in the parking lot of a shelter. It took the shelter a week to catch him. Fortunately he is microchipped and he found his way back to us. What happened to him in that time is a mystery, but we have some clues as to what may have happened. He most likely lived outdoors for some period of time. It is no surprise that he developed some anxiety issues from being neglected and abandoned. Boris needs time to adjust to his new environment and can be anxious and snap if pushed into something uncomfortable. This is very predictable and has been easily managed in his foster home.\n\nHis biggest need is that he must have time to get to know you on his own time frame and get to know his new home. He is comfortable in a crate and can use that space to decompress and adjust. A trip to the vet is going to make him anxious and he will most likely need to be muzzled and sedated for vet visits. He loves car rides and can be taken on rides, but he does not need to go in stores, friends' homes, dog parks or bars. Boris needs to be protected from situations that cause him anxiety.\nBoris has made great progress in his foster home and behaves like a normal happy dog. He is good with the routine and structure and behaves lovingly and sweetly. The situations that may cause him anxiety are very predictable and preventable. He has started to go on outings with his foster Mom and did great meeting a new human friend in their yard. He displayed no anxiety and was relaxed and happy.\n\nBoris deserves a chance to be in a home that is committed to love and care for him for the rest of his life. He needs a home where he is kept from situations that cause him anxiety and provide him with a structure within which he can shine and receive love. He is a funny and charming dog who is easy to love. He tilts his head to the side and flops his ears into awkward positions which will make you laugh often. He has a consistent routine in his foster home and his funny and loving personality has emerged. Because of his anxiety issues Boris needs a home with no other pets or children. He is not suitable for apartment life and will do best in a home with a fenced yard where he can exercise off leash in the yard.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Boris please submit an inquiry directly with Greater Charlotte SPCA by visiting charlottespca.org/adopt.\n\n***Because our rescue is composed entirely of volunteers and we require a home check for each of our adoptable pets prior to them going to their new homes, local applications will take precedence. We will accept out of town applications, but any family further than 60 miles from Charlotte is responsible for finding a representative of a rescue local to them that is willing to perform the home check. All out of town applicants will also have to be willing to drive to Charlotte to meet/pick up the pet as soon as the application is approved.***",

Buddy Boo has trust issues and needs someone to gain his trust again. He was neutered by Pinter Pets 09/18/2020, and he weighed 70 pounds at that time. He is a handsome example of a Catahoula but needs an experienced owner. He has lived with other dogs, but we do not know about cats or kids. These dogs were bred for hunting hogs and so typically have a high prey drive.   \n\nAll our dogs are spayed/neutered, de-wormed, vaccinated appropriate for their age, vaccinated for kennel cough, and micro-chipped. Puppies (under 6 months) are $225.00; puppies (6 months to 2 years) are $175.00, dogs (over 2 years) are $150 and senior dogs (7 years or older) are $60.00. \n\nOur application is on our front page of Petfinder, on the middle right hand side under our logo. Please send adoption applications to either pintler_petsmt@yahoo.com or pintlerpetsrose@gmail.com\n\nhttps://www.petfinder.com/member/us/mt/anaconda/pintlerpets-mt33/",

            "description": "Daffodil is a sweet, snuggly girl. Every time you kneel down to her level, she comes bounding over and cuddles up next to you while you pet her. Daffodil has the best, happiest doggy smile and will smile at you the entire time you're petting her. She also likes to give doggy kisses. One of Daffodil's favorite things, though, is water. She loves jumping into the puppy pool and lays right in the middle to cool off. Then she'll come and snuggle with you some more! Daffodil prefers hanging out in the yard rather than walking, and can sometimes resist going for a walk. If you start to jog for a few steps, though, the momentum gets her going and she walks well. Daffodil is looking for a home where she can be the only pet, and would probably do best with an adult-only home as well.",

My excitement and zest for life is contagious. You can't help but smile around me!\n\nSometimes my excitement gets the best of me and I go hopping and jumping around like a bunny rabbit. I just can't help myself because I love people so much! I've been working on my training though and learning how to be a well-behaved girl. I love the treats I get when I do a good job! For now, I'd do best in a home without small children that I might accidentally knock over.\n\nI can sometimes be choosy about my doggy friends. I like dogs around my size who will play with me and not take it too seriously. I just wanna have fun! I might be a bit too much to handle for smaller dogs or senior dogs, and I don't think cats would appreciate my antics either.\n\nI hope I find my family soon. I have so much love to give and just know I'll make a great pet!\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal.

He is currently heart worm positive, but undergoing treatment and getting healthy. Mater has also been neutered. He would make the perfect addition to any family that has love to give.

            "description": "Roddie is around 2 years old and weighs approximately 60 pounds. He was adopted from the Devore shelter and found to be overly playful with a smaller dog not possessing the same energy level. Not wanting to return him to a shelter and knowing what would happen to him if returned, he was relinquished to Poochmatch. His bunk mate is a female husky named Pearl (also available for adoption), who loves to play with him. Roddie is active and energetic. He likes people and playing with other dogs. He would do best with a medium or large dog who is able to wrestle and play with him to get his energy out, or adopters who are willing to refine his leash training and are active to take him on lots of walks/jogs and occasional hikes. He is loving and sweet and will make an excellent companion! Roddie's adoption fee is $385 and covers the cost of his neuter, all core vaccines (Rabies and Distemper/Parvo), microchip and microchip registration. If you\u2019re interested in adopting, the first step is completing an adoption application which is available on our website, Poochmatch.com, under the adoption tab. Please read the following paragraphs for additional information about our process.\n\nIf this listing is still posted, we are still accepting applications for him/her. We do not do out-of-state adoptions on highly adoptable dogs; we would only consider out-of-state adoptions for dogs that prove hard-to-place locally. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nUPDATE: ADOPTION EVENTS CANCELLED DUE TO PANDEMIC AND SOCIAL DISTANCING. If you are interested in meeting any Poochmatch dog at our weekly adoption event on Saturdays at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda, CA (5521 Mirage St.) between 1-5 PM, please fill out an application from our website, poochmatch.com, and submit it no later than 11 AM on Fridays. Upon receipt AND approval, the dog you are interested in meeting will be made available to meet on a Saturday. Due to the high volume of dogs and puppies in our foster homes, it is impossible to bring them all every Saturday. The only way to ensure that the dog that you are interested in will be at the adoption event is to FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AND BE APPROVED. Otherwise, we cannot guarantee that the dog you are interested in will be at our adoption event. If you cannot make the time frame of our events, appointments can be made at another time and location solely at the discretion of the foster parent. Please understand that private appointments will be coordinated to meet the convenience of the foster parent/transporter. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nAll adoption fees cover the mandatory and non-negotiable spay/neuter, rabies, microchip, microchip registration, full sets of core vaccinations (rabies and 1 set of distemper/parvo for adults, 4 for puppies) and deworming. Adoption fees vary based on age, breed, size and the costs incurred on the dog's behalf by us i.e. medical, behavioral training, etc. and they range from $225-$495.\n\n\nCOVID-19 PROCEDURE:\nIn an effort to create a safe environment for our potential adopters and our staff, we have changed our protocols and procedures during these difficult times. Starting immediately, our procedures will change from what\u2019s written on our website and other social media platforms. Our weekly adoption event at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda is temporarily cancelled due to COVID-19 and social distancing. The only way to meet one of the dogs/puppies we have available for adoption is through completion of our adoption application through our website, poochmatch.com, before 11 AM on Fridays. On Fridays when we review the applications, we will pick the best fit for each dog or puppy applied for and coordinate mutually agreeable appointment times for the applicants who are approved that week. Private appointments are currently only scheduled on Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday of each week. Masks or bandanas are mandatory; faces must be properly covered.\n\nWith the overwhelming desire of the public to adopt at this time, we have received as many as 30 applications for one dog in just one week. Working with a staff of volunteers, we are only able to reach out on Fridays to the people we have approved to adopt. If you have not heard from us by Friday, we have selected a different applicant. If you have multiple dogs/puppies that you are interested in, please indicate each dog/puppy of interest on the application at that time so we don\u2019t rule you out for another dog/puppy available for adoption.\n\nPlease understand, we have an influx of texts, phone calls and emails that makes it impossible to get to each and every one of you. Not just for adoption interest, but also from veterinarians, people who must relinquish dogs, people who have found a stray dog in need of pick up, etc. We are currently not in need of fosters. Due to the fact that there is such a high demand, we are sticking with strict protocol to not adopt out of Southern California. We apologize for this inconvenience and difficulty to be able to get in touch with us while there is an overwhelming desire and demand to adopt at this time. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we navigate through these difficult times with every intention to keep the public and our staff safe.",

MEET our little COUNTRY BUMPKIN, a super friendly, fun-loving and sweet, 10 month old, 35lb Houndy/Lab/Terrier mix looking for a loving forever home. She is in an awesome foster home working on all her puppy lessons. Her foster mom shares:\n\n\"Bumpkin is such a pretty girl with the most beautiful eyes. Fun-loving and active, she needs a friendly playmate to help burn off her puppy energy as well as mentor her. She is friendly with cats too. Smart and very treat and praise motivate, Bumpkin's working hard on good manners and basic commands. She is crate and leash trained and housebroken too. Bumpkin's favorite activities including playing with other dogs, taking long walks, making new friends, snuggling with her peeps and playing with her toys. She loves to squeak her ball while howling her own country song or two. She is a clever girl. She often ring her bells on the back door, not to go out for potty time, but to see if she can entice Maggie for a game of tug-o-war or chase in the backyard. She always rings the bells if the cat, Whiskey, would like to come back inside. She is a lovable pup who will steal your heart with her sweet, happy and loving demeanor.\"\n\nBUMPKIN is up to date on age-appropriate vaccines. She is spayed and her adoption fee is $425.00. Please note that training is highly recommended for all young dogs. As with all rescue animals, breed determination cannot be validated without genetic testing.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting BUMPKIN, visit WWW.LULUSRESCUE.ORG and learn about Lulu's adoption process and request an adoption application.\n\nThanks for adopting and saving a life!",

She's very low maintenance - housebroken, easy to feed, playful. She reacts negatively to being on a leash at all so a home with a fenced yard is a must. She loves other dogs, gets along fine with cats and she loves to lay in the grass on sunny days. Her safe haven is her kennel where she likes to hang out while you're gone. She only gets up on furniture if you pick her up and put her there. She is very shy around people she doesn't know and will retreat to her kennel until they earn her trust. It's going to take a \"one and only\" for her. She will bond closely to one person and will love and protect you every day.\n\nXena is 3 years old and 16 pounds.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Xena please fill out an adoption application on our website, wimberleywagrescue.org, and we will contact you.\n\nThank you!",

            "description": "*ADOPT ME!*\nSugar - 6 years old, located in Texas\nDog ID#: 201251-P-B-TX\nIntake Date: 09/06/2020\nAvailable Date: 10/20/2020 \n\nSugar is a middle aged girl (about 6 years) and weighs about 50 pounds.  She is currently located in Texas.  We don\u2019 know much about her previous life, except that Sugar has had multiple litters of pups.  She was more than likely kept in a kennel and bred for most of her life, so she has not lived in a house or been exposed to a lot of the finer things in life, until now. \n\nSugar gets along well with other dogs, although she prefers the company of people, and loves the foster family's cats.  She can be timid and anxious when exposed to new things, but seems to adapt quickly.  She will need patience until she gains familiarity and trust. \n\nSugar was heartworm positive and has completed the treatment protocol. She has been in foster care since the first week in September and is already making great progress. \n\nSugar is happiest and most at ease when curled up on the couch, relaxing with foster mom and dad or sleeping in their comfy king sized bed.  She has benefitted greatly from the influence of living with other calm, well socialized, and well-behaved dogs, but would do well as an only dog with an adoptive family that would love and cherish her. \n\nWe have been working on potty training and she is doing well. She likes to go outside for short periods and prefers her humans to be close by.  Sugar does very well on a leash and would enjoy slow, leisurely walks with her people.  She is good in the car, although you may have to pick her up and put her in.  Inside the house, she is calm and doesn\u2019t chew things or counter surf.  We are working on using the dog door, but have not pushed it because of her heartworm treatment required her to be supervised and calm.  She is fine in the crate, although you may have to coax her in at first.\n\nSugar is a wonderful companion and an easy dog to live with. She is exceptionally gentle, calm, and quiet.  She hasn\u2019t learned any of the typical obedience commands, but is well behaved.  She can be trusted to be left alone in the house for short periods of time. She has not been vetted with small children. Given time with a loving, patient home, Sugar will be an awesome dog.  She is a precious, sweet couch potato, but she still has a ways to go until he is fully socialized. She needs someone who has experience with timid dogs, or has a willingness to learn, and is 100% committed to Sugar, because she will love you unconditionally. \n\nWant to learn more about one of the dogs we have up for adoption? Fill out our adoption application (http://www.pointerrescue.org/adopt.html)!!\n\nTRANSPORT AVAILABLE TO APPROVED HOMES! (currently within 600 miles)",

Patches was lucky to have spent some time in a foster home but is now back at the shelter. Patches likes to run and play. Patches' favorite is tug of war and keep away. She's good at both! She's better at retrieving the Frisbee than catching. Patches loves a nice car ride and is great company as a back-seat driver. Patches has very good manners in the dog friendly stores. Patches like walks. If you use a proper training collar (for best results), she will snap back into her trained walking routine and behave. Patches is really smart. She picks up on training points very quickly. Patches makes human friends quickly. Patches can sit and be petted by adults and kids, aged 10 or above. Patches has not been around cats and may not do well with smaller dogs. Patches is not food aggressive or focused, except for the treats she earns performing her tricks of sit, shake, stay, and down. Patches is house trained. Patches love tummy rubs and although a bigger girl would love to sit in your lap. Patches enjoys laying around after her walk or playtime. She's just a regular couch potato. Patches would very much like to find her forever family.",

            "description": "Meet Bandit! Bandit is one of about 50 dogs rescued from a neglectful hoarding situation in South Georgia back in early July. Some of the dogs on the property had been living inside and were more socialized, able to be adopted quickly. But sadly, there was another group that had lived their whole lives outside with little human interaction. It has taken a couple of months of living in a foster home for them to start realizing that there are good people in this world who will love and cherish them. These dogs have come amazingly far since being rescued but do still carry the weight of their previous life with them. As such, they have very specific adoption requirements listed below. Please understand, we have taken 3 months to get to know these dogs and what they need to succeed. The adoption requirements are not arbitrary but are what is needed for them to lead happy, healthy lives and as such no exceptions to these requirements will be allowed. \n\n \n\nBandit is about a year and a half old and under 25 lbs. Hes a sweet, playful boy but still a bit on the shy side. He needs a patient adopter who is going to give him the time and space he needs to adjust and get comfortable in a new home. Given that the best teachers for dogs lacking confidence are other dogs, Bandit also must have other confident dogs in the home with at least one of them being under 30 lbs and playful. He is learning to walk on a leash but has yet to gain enough confidence to go to the bathroom on leash and does require a SECURELY fenced yard - solid wood privacy fence only (minimum 6 ft); chain link, wrought iron, or other types of fencing are not sufficient. Lastly, given that Bandit is still learning to trust people, he will not do well with the unpredictable nature of children. Homes with teenagers may be considered on a case by case basis, depending on the experience level of the family. \n\n \n\nWe do understand that the above requirements greatly narrows the pool of potential adopters and may even scare some people away. Bandit is most definitely a work in progress but we cannot even begin to explain how rewarding it is to watch the transformation of a dog like this who has never known love before. Once they learn to love and trust, they are so very very grateful and the amount of love they have to give and their loyalty knows no bounds. If you are interested in becoming part of Bandits continuing story, email adrienne@rescuemega.org or fill out an adoption application on our website- www.rmgdogs.org",

            "description": "Oliver, a 4 year old Boxer/Staffordshire terrier mix, is such a sweet happy boy who loves his people. He is a quick study, good on the leash but a strong boy. He is smart and knows several commands. He may be a tad shy initially but warms up quickly and makes friends whereever he goes. Oliver is fascinated by the tennis ball and will play fetch for hours! This is by far his favorite thing to do...and if the ball squeaks he will be in heaven! He enjoys going for long walks, a good game of fetch in the backyard and cuddling on the couch during a good show! \n\nOlivers ideal home would be as an only dog with a fenced backyard, someone who will take him on car rides and long walks to new places, and someone who is home more than not. His foster family works from home and he loves having them around. Oliver has his own FB page called Olivers BIG Adventures. Please join us there for more information and fun photos! \n\nRead more about Oliver and see more photos of him on his Blog.\n\nTo adopt Oliver visit our website for more details regarding our adoption criteria and complete the easy online no obligation adoption application at www.dsda.org/adopt. \n\n* Adoption Fees:\nPuppies (12 months and under) - $325 (includes tax)\nDogs (over 12 months) - $275 (includes tax) \n* Home visit is required.

She was initially rescued 5 years ago from a kill shelter in AZ while her mom was a grad student in Phoenix.  Sadly, due to circumstances beyond her control, Bella's mom can no longer keep Bella and needs to re-home her girl.  Bella is an incredibly loving and loyal companion who wants nothing more than to be next to her person.  She has been well loved & cared for and would happily snuggle all day if you'd let her.  She is medium energy girl, generally mellow, but loves a good game of tug-o-war or the occasional run/hike.  Despite her age, Bella is still active and ready for new adventures. She is very smart, eager to please, and HIGHLY food motivated!  Bella has some on-leash dog reactivity which is helped with daily anxiety medication so a home with an experienced owner & a fenced yard where she can explore stress-free would be ideal.  She'd be happiest as an only dog, with no other small pets or children.  Bella is spayed, up-to-date on vaccines & monthly preventatives, and is in good health.  Her mom can provide all her vet records to confirm.\n\nFor more information about Bella, please call/text Selena at 404-838-7555 or email her at svmakrides@gmail.com.",

Zoe is wonderful with children (big and small) and serves as a good barker when people approach the house.  Outside she does not bark and is friendly to all.  \n\nZoe was heartworm positive, but she is currently undergoing heartworm treatment to get rid of them.  She shows no adverse signs to being heartworm positive and the medication is only administered monthly.  \n\nZoe has a difficult time with new persons entering the home, especially adult males. She is not aggressive, but she is very timid and does not like the visitors in the home.  She would love a family or a single woman to bond with, but without a lot of activity in the home. Prefers quiet, stable and outdoor spaces to relax in. Zoe also loves to go for walks, hikes and appears to be drawn to water. She does like to fetch and run, but only in fully enclosed spaces as she can get distracted by squirrels or other dogs/cats.  \n\nZoe would make a good running buddy and she'll also be your tv and chill partner as she loves to just lay where the pack is.  Zoe will use a crate, but she prefers a bed where the persons are.  She also loves bones and stuffed animals to play with when left alone.  She would benefit from more training, but does adhere to many commands (sit, stay, off).",

He is looking for a new family that likes to play ball and get slimed with kisses. He does very well with obedience commands and he is learning to trust people. He is great with women but he needs a little time, space and play to be comfortable around men. Uncle Sam will need an experienced handler to help him be his best self. Uncle Sam very much wants a forever home that will continue his training and give him fun jobs. He has a face that will melt your heart and he gets so happy for attention. He is very good being left alone and out of the crate and is housebroken. He is not food driven, but will do anything for a ball. He is socially awkward with other dogs and will need a slow, proper introduction. He has been around chickens, with no reaction. His foster mom is also working on his leash manners. Uncle Sam is being fostered near Fayetteville. If you are interested in making him a part of your family, please reach out to your adoption coordinator. If you do not have an adoption coordinator, please complete an adoption application at www.freedomgermanshepherdrescue.org",

The Vet thinks I may be around 45-50 pounds once fully grown.  I\u2019m Fawn color with bit of white on chest and black tip on tail, Like a lion.  I\u2019m Friendly, like a wiggle worm on greetings; I need to be included as part of the family and would love to share the couch with you. I\u2019m a Bit of a talker, Playful, energetic, not fearless (bit uncertain in new situations) but have a sassy attitude.  I\u2019m Teething so I\u2019m a strong chewer Who Needs to be crated when not supervised to help with ongoing potty training and prevent me from chewing on things that may not be good for anyone including me.  I can be rambunctious, and tend to try to be bossy with foster dog mate.  Ones a chihuahua I\u2018m not let to play with due to my puppy roughness.  May not be best for homes with small pets, unless maybe a tough kitty, but not a timid cat.  I love to hunt grasshoppers and other bugs.  I would probably appreciate a canine playmate.  It would help me exercise, build my confidence and provide me some of the attention I need.  I Might be a good walking or jogging companion as I learn leash work, this would also help satisfy my energy needs.  I\u2019m not a dog that can be left outdoors in hot or cold.  My hair is short and thin enough I could sunburn if not provided adequate protection from sun via shade or access to indoors.",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Max, and I came from a Texas shelter. I am a healthy, active, playful, tiny 3-year-old guy who has some special requirements for a new forever or foster home.  You see, I was adopted for a while, but I became very fearful in the busy home with some really big dogs that were temporarily living there, so I became very bitey when the people interacted with me. So I came back to my familiar surroundings and people and relaxed again. So I'm ready to give it another chance to find the right home for me. Here's what I think will be best for me:\n\n- 1 or maybe 2 adult humans in a quiet home, but would love people who are not first time small dog owners\n- no children in the home\n- as much as I love running around with other small dogs, maybe if I could be the solo light of my person's life would be best\n- my new people need to be willing to give me a week or two to feel safe and comfortable before trying to do a lot with me. I promise I'll become happy, but I'm a little dude who scares pretty easily. Can you kindof ignore me for a little while and let me come to you when I know you can be trusted?\n- a securely fenced area for me is a must! I may become a walker someday, but I am fine taking care of business and playing in a little yard. \n- I'm fine in a comfy crate, that actually helps me feel safe. Or if you have a kitchen or laundry room that can be gated off, I would like that when you are gone, or if I need some relaxation time.\n\n?? Let me know if you may have room in your patient heart for a silly little guy like me. ?\n\nI am neutered, up to date on all my vaccines, and am microchipped.  My adoption fee is $350.00.  You can find the adoption application (required) here: http://cominischnauzerrescue.com/forms/vintage-dog-rescue-adoption-application/",

The vet reported that the nodules are benign, but they may occur again and they should be removed should that happen.   \n\n\nSasha is a very sweet and gentle little love bug with no signs of aggression whatsoever, even when my Cockatiel walked two inches from her nose, she didn't bat an eye.\n\nSasha loves to snuggle in bed and will not move an inch while receiving belly rubs.\n\nShe's very good about going outside to use the W/C. but will still need to be watched for subtle clues that she needs to go out, like looking out the patio door or window or pacing.\n\nShe does bark at the neighbors dogs as she feels they get too close to her fence but does not bark in the house at all.  Squirrels entertain her!  She can sit and watch them for hours.\n\nIt is important thought that she starts on dry food to protect those beautiful pearly whites she has since her dentistry.\n\nNB:  A fenced/locked yard or a perfect fitting harness and leash for walking is a must.  This little girl was originally from a puppy mill and even though she obeys most commands in the house and in the yard, if she sees an open door or gate she's gone forever, and all her obedience training goes out the window.   So please if you are planning on adopting this little angel keep these things in mind.  Do not be fooled by her willingness to please or you will loose her.\n\nPSBR is looking for a home where Sasha can be the only dog. She loves the attention!\n\nI am a: Female Pomeranian\nAge: 5-6 years old\nWeight: 13 lbs\nGets Along with Other Dogs: Yes\nHousetrained: In progress\nSheds: Yes\nBarks: Yes (but please read bio)\n\nADOPTION FEE: $600\n\nAll applicants must be 25 yrs or older \nApplicants must be within 3 hr driving distance from Hamilton ON, and reside in Canada\nPlease advise your vet and personal reference that we will be calling\n\nPomeranian and Small Breed Rescue is not a kennel facility, all of our dogs live in volunteers' homes. For their security, only approved adopters may visit the dogs at the foster home. Keep an eye on our website and Petfinder listings for upcoming meet and greet events that are open to the public.\n\nTo complete an adoption application, please visit https://psbrescue.com/adoption-application/\n\nTo make a donation and assist us with saving future dogs, please visit https://psbrescue.com/donate/\n\n\n***********************************************************\nPSBR is urgently looking for new Foster Homes, if you can help us, please visit www.PSBRescue.com and fill in a Foster Application \n***********************************************************",

I am a senior who loves car rides, long walks, hot dogs, and lots of pets and cuddles. I will adore you if you bring me home! I am a gentle mature lady who is calm and loving. I am obedient and I am great at sitting and shaking hands. I would be great with any age. I just want a home and a warm bed or couch to share with a nice human. \n\nI am so grateful to ACT I was found abandoned, starving and covered in ticks. Animal Compassion Team found me a foster home and took me to the vet. For six weeks I was on medicine. I was hopeful and happy the whole time. Want to know why? I LOVE HUMANS!! I was loved before and I know people are great. I am a favorite at ACT, but don't tell them other dogs.... I really am the best dog to walk on our daily Boss Walks. I can sit and shake on command or when I just want your attention. I am looking to be an only dog. I will adore you. I will be loyal, devoted, and easy going. I just want love, a warm bed or couch, slow walks, and treats. I would do well with a senior human or anyone else looking for a best friend to chill with. Please come meet me.... As you see in my photos I even smile!",

            "description": "As always, Duffy's Friends requires a vet reference in your name, not your parents, homeownership, fenced yard, and children if they live in the home, will be over the age of 12 years.  The adoption donation request for this dog is $200.00 for a completely vetted and sweet dog.  If you see this dog as available she is still looking for a home.  \n\nPoppy is a dog that is going to be matched with a home that does not expect perfection.  She is for adoption through PAWS of Long Island and Animal Behavior Specialities.  Duffy's Friends is acting as the media to place this dog.  \n \nTogether these dedicated people have pulled Poppy from a negative past and put her back together again so that she might have the most wonderful home that was due to her the first time.\n\nWe believe her to be a 20 lb Cockapoo with maybe something else.  This little girl is 4 years old and could be a poodle, Shih Tzu, Lhasa, or another small dog breed.   She is a young dog with a love of bringing back the ball, hiking, and swimming.  She would be too much energy for an elderly family or a senior.  \n\nWhat Poppy Needs:\nA home that does not expect perfection.  She likes dogs but would be better as the only dog as she is a dominant female. She likes kids but we want them to be over 12 to take direction and follow the rules.  What are the rules?  \n\nNo furniture, all four feet on the floor. Being a dominant female If you want her to move she may find the opportunity to tell you off.  What is that in plain English?  No furniture - no elevation, no sleeping in bed with you.\n  This could be a raised lip, a snarl, or an air snap.  To place this is in English - her reaction maybe a bite.   This is not unusual many dominant girls do that - this is not surprising. She also resource guards food so the solution is after she eats to pick up the food.  Now we have a future problem solved.    She is the perfect dog in every way, sweet, housebroken, spayed, up to date with vaccinations.  She is playful, likes to walk, and has first level dog obedience placed on her.  She is totally trained.  It's the furniture she can not be allowed to take over or your bed. \n\nDo you have the love to offer and follow the trainer's directions?  This is a great girl.  The groomer said she was so good for her professional spa day.  \n\n\nPlease apply on our website @ duffysfriends.org - if you have questions are email is duffysfriends@gmail.com.  Poppy has all her vaccinations and is spayed.\n\n\n",

            "description": "Hi, I\u2019m Destiny, but you can call me Miss Independent! I am 13.5 years young (born April 2007) and I weigh ten pounds.  CRT has made sure that I am up to date on vaccines, had my heartworm test, got my microchip and take my monthly heartworm preventative. \n\nI get along well with other small dogs as long as they are docile, but I am too feisty for larger dogs, cats, or small children. I\u2019m sweet, but I have a sassy side and will give you a little warning nip if I need my personal space. I prefer to dine alone so I can enjoy my food in peace, away from the other dogs.\n\nAs an older gal, I\u2019ve earned my share of pampering! I like to be carried up and down the stairs and will wait patiently for you to carry me across hard flooring to the carpet I prefer. I require a strict potty schedule to avoid accidents in the house. I\u2019m mostly crate trained, but I don\u2019t like to be left alone for long periods of time.\n\nI have a loud bark, and I\u2019m not afraid to speak my mind if I hear loud noises or see neighbors in the yard! I\u2019m told I\u2019m a bit hard of hearing, so my foster family supervises me in the yard to keep me safe.  I love it when they let me explore outside or take me for walks or car rides.\n\nI might take a little time to warm up to you, but once I do, I will be a loyal lap warmer and will curl up at the foot of your bed for a cozy snooze. I\u2019m currently living in Wixom, Michigan, but I\u2019d love to live out the rest of my years with you!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Destiny, please DO NOT SEND A MESSAGE TO OUR RESCUE GROUP.  We are too busy placing dogs in great homes to answer messages and inquiries through the listing site.  \n\nPLEASE GO TO THE LINK BELOW TO COMPLETE AN ADOPTION APPLICATION.\n \nwww.chihuahua-rescue.com/adoption-application\n \nCRT requires an approved adoption application and a home visit for all adoption applicants.  CRT transports to OH, KY, IL, MI, MN, WI. \n\n\n\n",

            "description": "Move over, Grumpy Cat; there\u2019s a new social media star on the scene, and it\u2019s me, Lucky!  I\u2019m 7 years old, weigh in at 12 pounds, and am fully vetted, vaccinated, neutered, microchipped, and on heartworm preventative. I\u2019m looking for a new agent, and I think you would be a perfect fit!\n\nMy foster mom says I have the most adorable grumpy face, and she\u2019s right, of course.  Add in a stylishly floppy ear due to a past incident (don\u2019t worry, it doesn\u2019t hurt a bit), and you have 12 pounds of star power, ready to rack up the \u201clikes\u201d on your Instagram page!  \n\nDon\u2019t let my trademark grumpy face fool you though; I am definitely a \u201cpeople dog\u201d and am always happy to snuggle up.  I get along well with other dogs too, but humans are my preferred companions.  When I\u2019m not cozying up to them, I\u2019m lounging in the sun to work on my tan or strutting through my Dayton, Ohio, neighborhood to greet my adoring fans.  When I\u2019ve had enough publicity for the day, I head home to burrow under the covers for a power nap with my favorite human...care to apply for the job?\n\nI\u2019ll admit that I can be a bit reserved at first; after all, those paparazzi just don\u2019t give up!  However, if you\u2019re patient and kind, my shyness will wear off and you\u2019ll have a loyal companion for life...and the place of honor in my entourage!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Lucky, please DO NOT SEND A MESSAGE TO OUR RESCUE GROUP.  We are too busy placing dogs in great homes to answer messages and inquiries through the listing site.  \n\nPLEASE GO TO THE LINK BELOW TO COMPLETE AN ADOPTION APPLICATION.\n \nwww.chihuahua-rescue.com/adoption-application\n \nCRT requires an approved adoption application and a home visit for all adoption applicants.  CRT transports to OH, KY, IL, MI, MN, WI. \n\n\n\n",

She already had several animals, so her intent was to get a little weight on him and find him his forever home.  He has been in a couple of different homes already and is hoping his next home and family will be for life.  He knows a few basic command and he is still young and very trainable, so professional training would be a plus.  He loves people and wants lots of love and attention.  Loki would thrive in an active home where he has regular exercise and a job to do.  He needs an experienced, strong, dog savvy owner.  He is looking for an inside home with a large fenced in yard to run off some of his energy and play with his new family. He has been neutered, vaccinated including rabies, wormed, tested for heart worm and micro-chipped.\n\nNote:  To adopt, you must live within approximately 100 miles of one of our adoption sites (Benld, O'Fallon or Springfield IL), and be at least 18 years of age.",

            "description": "Chula is a petite lowrider looking for her new best friend! Her owner was devestated to have to surrender her after moving and said this about her: Chula is protective over me. She's in tune with me when I'm sad and she's always there to comfort me . She's always playful and energetic. She's so silly and rolls around when playing. She is house trained and knows how to use potty pads. Chula does have some fears and insecurities, especially meeting new people and having her paws touched. It will take time, maybe even weeks, for her to become completely comfortable with a new person, especially men. She needs someone who can be patient and understand that she won't be ready to jump in your lap the first time you meet her. A quiet home with no little kids and few visitors will be the best place for her to feel safe and happy. She isn't the dog that wants to be the center of attention at a party - but she'd love to be your sidekick and give you all her love. She is working on feeling more comfortable around other dogs and has learned to tolerate wearing a muzzle to keep everyone safe if she needs to go to a vet or meet someone new and scary. If you have experience with insecure dogs, a quiet home, and are looking for a partner to grow with, learn with, play with, train and love, please make an appointment to speak with one of our virtual adoption counselors to get more information and see if you might be a good match here: https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=13142745andcalendarID=3751088 Check out my photos/videos!",

TIFFANY IS LOOKING FOR A HOME WITH NO YOUNG CHILDREN**\n\nTiffany is a 5 year old spayed female Alaskan Malamute who weighs about 78 lbs. Tiffany came to All 4 Paws from a commercial breeding facility when she was no longer needed for breeding purposes. After spending her life in a barn, Tiffany is so deserving of a wonderful family that will give her all the love and care she deserves. We have loved showing Tiffany just how great a dog's life can be! After everything she's been through, Tiffany can be a bit nervous with quick movements or loud noises. For this reason, she is looking for a quiet home without young children who may overwhelm her. True to her breed, she loves exploring outside, so her forever family must have a yard and experience with Malamutes. Tiffany has done well with the other dogs she's met with a proper, slow introduction. She excels when she has a job to do, and will bond with her people through training. Malamutes are working dogs and she is true to her core. She needs a family that understands the way to her heart isn't pets and hugs at first, it's requests and rewards. Tiffany is incredibly intelligent and eager to please. This gorgeous girl is so ready to join a loving home that will continue to teach her what it means to be a beloved member of the family. Please help us find Tiffany the forever home she deserves!\n\nInterested in adopting? Take the first step and complete an adoption application on our website: https://www.all4pawsrescue.com/\nWe are a foster based organization, so we do not have a facility to visit. Please read our FAQs to learn more: https://www.all4pawsrescue.com/faq\nFind us on Facebook for foster updates and a full list of our adoptable pets: https://www.facebook.com/all4pawsrescue/",

He is super affectionate and loves a nice soft couch to curl up in and space to dash around in.  His personality belies his age as he is active and loves taking walks, chasing geckos and fetching tennis balls.  He loves to cuddle and is very smart.  Major is intact, suffers from a heart murmur and color dilution alopecia (CDA) which is an inherited skin condition in dogs that have been bred to a diluted coat and results in permanent hair loss. His condition requires a committed adopter as he requires frequent medicated baths, a special diet and medication to manage his heart condition.  This guy deserves a second chance in a very special home to be loved and well-cared for and in return you\u2019ll be loved unconditionally and with great enthusiasm.  \n\nThis wonderful boy from the Big Easy needs your help.  If you can give Major the love and attention that he deserves so much, please complete and application, get your home visit done, and come meet him in Venice.",

Joey is found as a stray with another dog (see separate post for Ginny) and the owner has not reclaimed them.    He is all of 6 lbs, and 10 years old.  He is current on vaccinations and he is set to be neutered on 10/23/20.  He and Ginny are very bonded so only will be adopted together.  Adoption process: completion of a pre adopt ap, homeck, two week trial period, contract and followup visit.  We prefer that since Joey and Ginny are bonded they would do best in a two dog family, not join others but that can be determined on a one by one basis.  Adoption donation for Joey is $175 and Ginny is $225.  Both dogs will be groomed prior to placement.  They look well cared for so trust they are housedogs and housetrained but will start with crate training as we do with all rescued dogs.  Placement is limited to southern CA LA and Orange Counties.",

He is a 6 yr old, 18 lb pug mix (we believe Pug and Pekingese). \n\nHe is looking for a dog savvy forever home with time, patience and love.  This adorable little buddy is full of life and just needs the right home.   Like lots of old pugs, he does have rear end weakness.  He is what he is, he just needs a human who can love him in spite of the fact he is not perfect.   \n\nHe needs to be walked regularly to keep his muscle strength up.  He is currently receiving acupuncture treatments and we are hopeful he will benefit from them like a lot of our fosters have.   \n\nHe gets along with most dogs, but he is part Pekinese and wants to be the boss.  So best thing would be an only dog home or one with an old small dog that doesn\u2019t care if he\u2019s the boss.   He is afraid and anxious of small children and we are afraid he will nip them so no kids.  \n\nAs you can see from his original bio, he does love his humans once he knows they can be trusted.   What happen to this boy in the past, we will never know but he is adorable and he will do good in the right home. \n\nOf course, when we got Spanky we did everything we could for him to give him the best forever life he could have and he is a happy little toy playing boy.   We made two trips to North Florida Neurology in Jacksonville and paid for Spanky to have an MRI to determine for sure what Spanky\u2019s back issues were.  We were hopeful he could benefit from a stabilization surgery but after the MRI and discusses with the Neurologist, it was decided that the best course of action for Spanky was not surgery.  Therefore, he is receiving and will probably need to continue on a more holistic approach.  Exercise by his human and acupuncture treatments by a certified acupuncture vet.   Many regular vets have this service but not all are certified so we will be happy to help you find a good service provider in your area.\n\nIf you are the home Spanky is looking for PLEASE apply today to adopt him.  He\u2019s ready to be loved by his forever human.  Complete an adoption application today: https://pugrescueofflorida.org/adopt\n\nORIGINAL BIO - June 2020\nA few years ago he was one of our foster pups and was adopted by his loving mom. Unfortunately, his mom passed away -- the family tried to help by keeping Spanky, but it just wasn't a good fit, so they called us and we were happy to help. Since Spanky has been back with us we have worked to understand some of his issues and get him the care he needs. \n\nWe determined that Spanky had some problems with his back which caused him trouble walking with his back legs. \n\nWhen Spanky came into PROoF he was also fearful and had little trust for humans. During the first 2 weeks in his foster home Spanky would growl, snap, and attempt to bite anyone that came near him (even his fur foster siblings), especially if they came towards his face. He would not allow his humans to wipe or clean him.  With time and patience, Spanky slowly began to trust his humans, allowing them to even cuddle and touch him. He even began to bond with the other pugs in his foster home and now goes on short walks with them outside. Currently Spanky allows his foster family to cuddle with him and rub his face and ears. \n\nAs Spanky has started to trust everyone around him, his foster family as begun to see his adorable personality come through. He is a playful little guy -- he loves squeaky toys and chases them around the house. Despite his small size he has a big personality! He now enjoys belly rubs and rolling around on the floor to play with his toys. Spanky is very smart and quickly learns the house routine. With his short stubby Peke legs and stout Pug body, Spanky waddles along for short walks with his humans. He likes to sleep on the floor with all 4 paws pointing up in the air -- a very funny pose! \n\nSpanky's wonderful foster family is giving him the time and space to gain trust and confidence every day. In addition to helping him build his confidence it was critical that PROoF help with his medical care.  He will visit a neurologist soon to determine the best plan for helping him with his back end weaknesses.  \n\nIf you love me but can't adopt me please consider making a donation to rescue to help pay medical bills for not just me but my fellow foster brothers and sisters.\n\nMy Rescue friends are working very hard to find me and the other foster pugs new homes, so please be sure to submit an application before contacting them.\n\nMore information and  applications are available at WWW.PUGRESCUEOFFLORIDA.ORG",

She was adopted by someone who hoped to train them as livestock guardians but she decided that she liked living indoors rather than outdoors. Sugar made her way to New Jersey and was adopted, however Sugar never adjusted to \u201ccity living\u201d she is a country girl through and through.\n\nSugar is back in Texas and still looking for that perfect home. Her ideal home would be a farm environment without a lot of visitors. She is looking for a place where she can lounge outdoors during the day while keeping an eye on the property, then hang with her people indoors at night.\n\nSugar is around 1.5 to 2 years old and weighs 75 pounds. She is crate trained and house trained. Sugar does well walking on a leash and does well in a vehicle. We would be willing to transport her to NJ, but it really has to be the perfect home for her. She cannot be in a home with children or even young adults. If you are a looking for a mellow independent dog please apply now and be sure to mention \u201cSugar\".\n\nApply to adopt at bigdogrescueproject.org/adopt.",

Duchess is 10 yrs and is ready to show her new family a lot of love. \n\nDuchess is a happy girl who makes friends easily -- she is enjoying the company of the people and pets in her foster home. She would do best with older kids and gets along well with other dogs. \n\nShe enjoys car rides and is always up for a new adventure. She is also a fan of short walks when the weather is nice and true to her pug genes, is a velcro pup and likes to follow her humans around the house. She is happy lounging just about anywhere, but her favorite spot is on her dog beds (she would love to have one in every room!). \n\nWhen Duchess came into rescue, she was very overweight and had a honking cough which is a common condition with her collapsing trachea. The good news is that our foster families and vets are very experienced with these conditions and she is getting great care.  She is on medication to help control her cough and she is making strides to getting to her goal weight so she can live her best life.  Duchess is looking for a family that can continue helping her with her weight loss and cough management.  She is up to date on her vaccines, spayed, potty trained and is heartworm negative. \n\nDuchess would do well with other dogs, or she would be fine as an only dog so she can get all of the attention for herself.  If you are looking for a sweet puggle with a great personality welcome into your family, Duchess might me your love match!  You can complete an adoption application today at https://pugrescueofflorida.org/adopt\n\nIf you love me but can't adopt me please consider making a donation to rescue to help pay medical bills for not just me but my fellow foster brothers and sisters.\n\nMy Rescue friends are working very hard to find me and the other foster pugs new homes, so please be sure to submit an application before contacting them.\n\nMore information and  applications are available at WWW.PUGRESCUEOFFLORIDA.ORG",

            "description": "This sweet litter of 4 were rescued from a drainage ditch.  \n\nWith a guesstimated birthday in March 2020, these sweets ones have gone from scared to affectionate.  \n\nTag was adopted, but someone in his family developed allergies.  He's a happy guy and is enjoying the dogs at his foster home.  He doesn't seem to pay any attention to the cats.\n\nTag's becoming even more familiar with crating and leash walking.  He hasn't had an accident, but is being kept to a regular schedule of walks every hour to reinforce his manners.\n\nApril 2020:  We are not holding public adoption events at this time.  Qualified families are being invited to appointments to meet specific dogs.  There are currently no opportunities to view multiple dogs and adoption events aren't being held at Tractor Supply in Lenoir.\n\nWhether dogs / puppies come in as strays or owner surrenders, we usually have to make our best guess as to birthdate and breed.   \n\nIf adopted into a home with other animals, particularly cats, your new pet should be crated or secured when you're not available to supervise to insure a harmonious relationship.  \n\nA vet reference is required to confirm responsible pet ownership.  We suggest first time pet owners look for an adult dog for companionship and to gain experience through another rescue or your local government-run animal control..\n\nAdoption fee covers two vaccinations plus spay / neuter if using our local low-cost spay/neuter clinic (overnight stay required) and surgery occurs as agreed upon in the adoption contract.  Convenience fee equal to refundable spay/neuter deposit may be added if using our veterinarian.  Additional fees for 3rd puppy vaccination, refundable spay/neuter deposit, etc. may apply.  \n\nWe are an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue.  We receive no funding from agencies.  Available animals can be seen most Saturdays at Tractor Supply in Lenoir from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  We recommend interested parties contact us to pre-qualify for adoption so their new furry family can go home once paperwork is complete.  Fees are required in cash.  For more information on our organization, our website is www.petpartnersrescue.org.",

            "description": "Koala spent the first 5 years of her life tied on a chain in the back yard, being bred over and over and suffering from heartworm. Despite her bad past, she is a very loving dog. She absolutely loves other dogs and kids and will follow them around, just to be near them. She can be a little leery of adults, especially men, but she does warm up, especially if there is another dog around to show her everything is ok. Since she spent her first 5 years outside, she never had to worry about where she was supposed to go potty, so she will need someone to be patient while she learns to always go outside. She is doing well if taken out regularly. She loves to chew on toys and is very food motivated. She does know some basic commands and loves to give kisses to her friends.\n\nPlease visit www.handsheartspaws.org for an adoption application\n\nAll of our dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed/neutered, microchipped, fecal tested, heartworm tested, and they are all on heartworm and flea/tick preventative.\n\nThe adoption process is an application, a vet reference, a home visit, and a lifetime contract. The requested adoption donation for this dog is $350___.\n\nWe do not REQUIRE a fenced in yard (some dogs DO REQUIRE a fence.  Decide what is best for each dog), we do REQUIRE a means of safe outside containment.  We do NOT adopt to homes that use invisible fencing.  Invisible fencing is NOT a safe means of outside containment.\n\nWe are willing to adopt out-of-state, contingent on our ability to complete a home visit, but you must travel to Omaha to complete the adoption. We do not transport or ship our dogs.",

Bruce is a little timid with new people so he will take a little time to warm up, but once he does you will know it was time well spent.  He is also a possible fence climber and may be best with either a 6 foot fence or an invisible fence.  Bruce weighs approximately 50 lbs.\n\nIf you would like an application go to our website (https://humanesocietypc.com/) and download one and email it back as a Word or PDF document.

I'm very curious.I love every human I meet!I do have some anxiety when left alone, but mostly it'sspecific to being confined. I'd do okay if I'm able to be free in the home. I love to take walks and go on adventures. I'd do best as an only dog and in a home with older children, 8years and older. I'd do well with calmer cats or with cats that are okay with dogs.\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\n I love humans! I would do best as an only dog. Whileout on walks, I can be a bit reactive to other dogs if they are too close and bikes, scooters and things zipping past me can be scary.I'm working on that in my current homeand learning how to focus on my human.I'm a very smart girl!\n\nDoes Charlotte like other pets?\n\n I'd do best as an only dog. I'd do fine with cats that are calm and used to being around dogs.\n\nDoes Charlotte like children?\n\n I'd do best in a home with older children, 8years and older.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\n I love soft toys, crackle chew toys,puzzle balls andkongs.\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\n I'd love a family that can maybetake meto work, or works from home since I feel a little anxious when left alone. Although, I feel better at home when I'm not confined. I'd need to be the only dog, so I can be your one and only. I'd also need a family that is willing to continue to work with me.I'd also do best in a home with older children and I'd be okay with calm cats.",

            "description": "Meet Magic, a very handsome English Cream Golden Retriever. His birthday is March 11, 2020, so still a puppy. \n\nMagic went to a home with kids from the breeders house but when the kids would start screaming and running around, Magic had the reaction of biting one of the kids. He was returned to the breeders home where the same thing happened again when the kids got running around screaming like kids do. So of course the home we are going to require for Magic should have no children at all. \n\nMagic is a great example of why we have an age limit with children for the dogs we adopt into great homes. Kids are no matter what going to behave like kids and dogs do not always appreciate the kids behavior. For many dogs, fast movements and screaming can be scary. Dogs do not necessarily think it is cute when the kid lies on top of them or tries to take things out of their mouth. The result is the dog losing their home or worse and sometimes a child ends up with a lifelong fear of dogs. \n\nMagic is housebroken, doesn't try to destroy the house when left unsupervised, and is just a sweetheart of a boy. He hasn't done any counter surfing at all. He does need a little work on sharing toys if it is something he values but with training this can be resolved. \n\nMagic was doing great in his foster home. He was living with 8 other dogs, but this was just too much activity for Magic. He will also need work walking on a leash. The family who would like to adopt him will be required to take him to a trainer. This is not because he is so unruly or bad, but so we know the lucky family that gets to adopt this boy will be committed to making sure Magic is the great family member we know he will be. He will also need a physical fenced yard. \n\nMagic is now in a foster home where he is going to a trainer and is doing great! He is figuring out he is not the boss and is doing well being in a much quieter environment with only one other dog that is older. He isn't ready to be able to be adopted yet, but is making excellent progress. \n\nWe hope he will stay in his current foster home to be adopted finally when ready. If he becomes available for adoption, we will let you know both here and on our Facebook page. \n\nTo adopt a Golden that you see here, please go to the Golden Retriever Rescue Resource website at www.gr-rescue.org  Read our adoption policies. If you qualify for this dogs adoption and the adoption policies, please write us for an adoption application at grrradoption@yahoo.com  Please provide your city and zip code. Please note, we only adopt to select areas within Ohio, Michigan and Indiana where we can do a home visit by a trusted volunteer. \n\nPlease read our adoption policies on our website prior to inquiring for an adoption application. Thank you!",

Earl has been raised with dogs of all ages and sizes.   Although he loves playing with toys, outdoor adventures with his siblings and foster dogs are his favorite.  But by the end of the day, he'll be looking for some serious snuggle time that includes plenty of lovin' and belly rubs. \n\nWe believe all our pups would excel in an adoptive home with an active family or an equally active dog already in the home.  Pups benefit from the guidance of another dog who acts as a role model and playmate. \n\nEarl has wonderful qualities that mark the beginnings of a solid foundation,  It will be up to his furever family to guide and direct him, fulfill his needs and then reap all the benefits his unconditional love can give!  Applications are available upon request.  Our adoption donation is $175.  Earl  is being fostered in Noble.",

They are two of the sweetest and beautiful pups you may ever come across. These two will round out to be great companions and/or family dogs with minimal training and guidance. \n\nThey are both very loving and get attached to people quite quickly even though they and they love \u201ctheir\u201d people.\n\nMohawk: \n\nHe is very sweet, loves attention and seeks confirmation. He needs some training to teach him not to jump on you (which he has already improved on with just a little consistent correction) and needs ongoing socialization with other dogs. He is not outwardly aggressive but can be guarded at times. He has already improved in a very short period of time with his current foster.\n\n\nDakota: \n\nShe is twice as sweet as her brother.. She plants herself in the cutest little sitting pose in front of you waiting for your attention.  \n\nShe is deaf and has not been taught any sign language but is beginning to learn and picking up cues quite quickly.  She always looks for her people When she is out of your site line even if she is with Mohawk.\n\nShe will continue to blossom if her new owner would be continue training her with sign language communication. \n\n\nIdeal Home:\n\nActive family, they love to play and stay active and would be great hikers.  They like to be with their family instead of being left alone.  A family that would have 1 adult home daily for continued basic training.\n\nThey are both crate trained, eating well and settling in well. They had high anxiety in the beginning of being crated and separated from their handler, but are much more calm and settled now. \n\nWe predict this pair will develop into obedient and loving pups that will make great.  They would most likely be great dogs to take camping, hiking, lakeside, park and beach excursions as they like to stay close to their people and could most likely be off leash dogs in appropriately safe settings with the EXCEPTION that Dakota would need to wear a remote response training collar for her safety as she can not hear verbal QUES.\n\nThese two will make really great dogs with little effort just some consistency and patience. IF you meet this criteria, please don\u2019t hesitate to email to set up a meet and greet to further consider these two as new family members! \n\n\n\nDakota\nFemale \n**Deaf**\n10 months old\n35 lbs\nSpayed \nUp to date on vaccinations \n\nMohawk \n10 months old\n35 lbs\nNeutered\nUp to date on vaccinations \n\nEMAIL: Lassabrina@yahoo.com",

            "description": "Taco is such a silly and affectionate circus dog! He sometimes sits on his back two legs if you lift treats high above his head, and it will melt your heart. Taco is initially skittish and shy in the beginning, but once he notices you have tasty treats, he is ready to jump on you to get them. Once he knows you are friendly, he follows you everywhere and sits and shakes if you ask him. He definitely has the puppy dog eyes down and can thaw any heart with his gorgeous caramel eyes. Taco tends to be a quieter pup, even in shelter life. Many dogs could be barking around him and he will just rest his head on the kennel door. Once he is away from the kennel, he walks nicely, no pulling and he makes good eye contact. This curious boy is sensitive and in tune with the humans that he trusts. He is also a high energy pup who is goofy. Taco's perfect date would include treats, cuddles with his humans, nice walks and chasing squirrels of course! His ideal home would be in a low-traffic home with possibly a well-matched pup. Come meet this sweet boy, he's waiting to show you his tricks!",

This very curious boy will also watch TV with you, so get ready to load up on those Netflix shows you have been dying to watch. He'll put his front paws in your lap, give you kisses, and snooze right next to you on the couch. He may even chew his toys next to you. Noah is usually a quiet boy. He can be excited when meeting new humans, but soon he calms down, and lays down next to them. He is excited when he sees his people come home, jumping, kissing, and climbing in their laps. After he wears himself out, he's calm and quiet. He hasn't lived with any dogs yet, but he's done really well with those he's met when exploring outdoors. He's also crate-trained, and does well once he's inside; he just needs a little persuasion to enter it. Ideally, a home with a nice, big backyard would be perfect for him! He's still a bit hesitant about stairs, but he's getting there! Noah is simply a big boy with lots of love to give. Come meet him today!",

He was adopted as a puppy from a city shelter and dumped back at that same shelter a year later. \n\nHe is currently in a foster home with other dogs of all sizes and is doing great.  He loves to play with toys and play with his foster brothers (4-legged) He would make a great dog park/beach type of dog.

She has been treated and has been cleared of Heart worm disease but will need to be on Heart worm prevention for life, which is the norm for any dog in Florida. Because of her past traumas and uncaring owners, Gia is very sweet but has a dominant personality, and being a bully breed, it's also in their characteristics and also because she had to fend for herself on the streets, until she was picked up. Gia will make a good companion but needs an experienced adopter, who can show her, that she is safe and loved. Gia is approximately 6 years old but still enjoys running around the back yard and playing with her toys and burying her bones for later... Since she is an alpha dog and has the bully stubbornness, Gia will need to be the only dog and queen of her home,  no cats and children should be over the age of 10. Please help us give Gia, the loving forever home she so deserves and has waited so long for, will you be her Angel?",

He is such a sweet boy - a little shy at first but warms up very quickly.\n\nHe gets along good with adults and kids.  He should be an only dog - he has random issues with other dogs.  We have no cat but would guess it would be a no go on that too.  He is housebroken and crate trained.  He walks fairly well with a harness and loves attention.  He would love someone to cuddle with him.\n\nHis adoption fee is $225.00.  He is neutered, current on shots, wormed and micro-chipped.  He is heartworm negative.

With limited resources, the shelters are forced to put down 50-90% of the animals that come in the front door. OPH provides pet adoption services to families located in VA, DC, MD, PA and neighboring states. OPH is a 501(c)(3) organization and is 100% donor funded.

I may be a candidate for surgery, to improve my situation which will be covered 100% by HOPE. But I\u2019m happy either way. I get around great and love going to doggy daycare...they even let me run around without my diaper there.\nI\u2019m looking for a family to call my own or even a possible foster to adopt. \n\nNo cats or dogs smaller then me.\n\n\nAll dogs are in foster care and are not located in our office. If you are interested in adoption, you will need to fill out an application which can be found on our website www.hopesafehouse.org The application can be e-mailed, faxed , snail mailed or dropped at our office. As soon as we process the application we will contact you with the foster home phone number. Please note we have a 75 mile adoption radius on adult dogs and a 50 mile radius on puppies and those adults getting or scheduled for medical treatment Adoption fee for all canines is $250. There is also mandatory training classes of which Hope pays $75.00 towards. You will be required to leave a $75.00 deposit for training at time of adoption. This deposit is 100% refundable after completing a basic obedience class. Your dog will be up to date on shots, flea/tick preventative, and microchipped. They will need to be spay/neutered at one of our preferred clinics. This is included in your adoption fee. Thank you for your interest.",

She is bulldog through and through, thinks she runs the show, and needs a diaper, but she is sweet as can be and loves to play! Due to the diaper, she would actually be an excellent apartment, condo, or town house dog as she doesn\u2019t need to go outside for potty breaks. Any other dogs in the home would need to be larger than her, confident, and level-headed to keep her from trying to take over. She would even be super happy as the only apple of someone\u2019s eye! She absolutely loves snuggles and has a few really great doggie friends that she loves to wrestle and play with. Currently fostered in Racine, WI and available for adoption through Hope Safehouse.\n\n\nHappy Fall y\u2019all \nIt\u2019s just me Ms Bernadette aka Birdie\nI\u2019m a mini bulldog\nAnd if you were wondering Yep that\u2019s underwear.\nSee I was either born or injured which now causes me to be incontinent. I may be a candidate for surgery, to improve my situation which will be covered 100% by HOPE.

            "description": "We were alerted to a very pregnant mama that we believe to be abandoned. A nice group of neighbors came together to care for this pup and had been feeding her and giving her fresh water for the last few weeks. Unfortunately, none of them were able to allow her inside, and she had been living unsecured on a front porch for weeks. As her belly became more swollen, they realized that she was about to give birth and reached out for help. We knew we needed to get mama to Grace quickly so she can give birth in a safe and comfortable environment. Roxy was the name given to her by the kind people caring for her, and we think it fits her perfectly.\u00a0\n\nWe think Roxy is about 2 years old and, like most pups we rescue, is heartworm positive. But she won't be able to start treatment until after her puppies finish nursing for the safety of the puppies. Roxy has likely lived her entire life on the streets and is bow-legged in the front due to malnutrition as a pup. Right now, we won't be taking any corrective action because it isn't causing her discomfort. We will be looking into additional options to help her after the puppies are weaned. We are elated that she is off the streets and will deliver her pups safely, surrounded by the love from our Streetdog Pack.\u00a0\n\nOn August 25, Roxy gave birth to 8 perfect puppies! There are 6 girls and 2 boys plus #sdftopaz who crossed the rainbow bridge shortly after birth. She is obsessed with her babies and doesn't even want to leave them to go outside. She rushes right back in as soon as she can! She has started barking at other dogs that walk by her kennel to let them know to stay away from her beloved babies but isn't showing any aggression. The vet tech team let us know that she remains very sweet and trusts them to enter her kennel and care for her puppies. \n\nGirls:\n\nAmber\u00a0\n\nAmethyst\n\nBeryl (Beh-ruhl)\n\nGarnet\n\nJade\n\nMarble\n\nBoys:\n\nMica\n\nSlate\u00a0\n\n*Behaviors not listed have yet to be tested.",

Bruce is hearing impaired but hears fine if you raise your voice.\u00a0 He has done well in a home where he has other dogs to keep him company and someone home most of the time.\u00a0 He currently lives in the country and has a large fenced property to go outside in.\u00a0 He is good with the other dogs but ignores them.\u00a0 This is unusual for a Coonhound so it may be due to his hearing impairment.\u00a0 We believe regardless, he enjoys having other dogs around.\u00a0 Bruce is very sweet and loves to be cuddled and kissed.\u00a0 He is housebroken and prefers company when going outside in the yard, either the other dogs or the foster family.\u00a0 Thunderstorms do not appear to bother him.\u00a0 Bruce loves his mealtime and is fed twice daily both canned and dry.\u00a0 He loves going for walks and car rides.\u00a0 He is a creature of habit and will start barking if something changes in the schedule.\u00a0 We have found it best to sneak out of the house so he doesn't bark at the door.\u00a0 Bruce is a good boy at the vets.\u00a0 He loves children of all ages.\u00a0 He sleeps in an open crate but crating is not necessary for this boy.\u00a0 He is not destructive in the home at all.\u00a0 We are sure he has a typical Coonhound prey drive with cats but have not tested him with it.\u00a0 In his current foster home, the only time he barks non stop is when his meals are being prepared. The ideal home for Bruce is one where the family is retired or there is a family member home full time.\u00a0 Another dog is best but only for companionship as he doesn't have any interest in playing with other dogs.\u00a0 He is good with all sizes of dogs.\u00a0 Having experience with the Coonhound breed is an asset. Bruce is neutered, up to date with vaccines, 4dx tested negative, and has a dental cleaning scheduled Friday, October 9.\u00a0 He is on heartworm/flea prevention monthly. A fully fenced yard, another resident dog in the home, someone home full time, and a Veterinarian History of Compliance are mandatory in order to apply for our Bruce.\n\nOpen to Canadian Residents only.\n\nVisit barksandmeows.ca for an online application.",

            "description": "Seniors are the best! Meet Badger! Badger is an 8 year old male beagle who was relinquished by his owner with his buddy Missy (also available for adoption). Its taken Badger a bit to warm up to his foster family. He can still be very cautious and scared sometimes when approached too quickly or unexpectedly. Once he gets to know you he REALLY enjoys being loved on, petted and belly scratched. Badger may be a bit hard of hearing which may explain why he is easily startled.\n\nBadger may be 8 years old but he still gets the zoomies about once a day and flies around the yard or house looking to play. Badger likes going for walks and is good on a leash, but prefers a collar rather than a harness. Badger does well with other dogs and has been with his friend Missy for sometime. Both dogs could be adopted together as they are already good buddies.\n\nBadger is kennel trained but does fuss a bit when he is first put in the kennel. He does settle down after a little while. Pretty sure this guy had it rough before being rescued and you can tell he is just so happy to be loved and paid attention to. Badger is vocal, he grunts and groans and huffs and puffs. Its so cute.\n\nBadger likes to lay around and snooze, but he does need something to do throughout the day. If left unattended for extended periods or left out in the yard for a long time he will start barking. Mostly out of boredom. Once you call him or pay attention to him for a bit he will settle down. Badger would do good with a family that is around and where there is some action, but he is not your running dog, his older hips and legs just can't keep up for too long.\n\nBadger is neutered, microchipped, up to date on shots. He is fostered in the Omaha area and his adoption fee is $300.00. You can fill out an application today at https://www.bassetandbeagle.org/adoptionapplication/",

She was released to us in September 2020 by her owner when they could no longer afford to care for her, then returned in mid-January 2021 because her adopter's roommate's dog wasn't getting along with Suki.\nSo Suki is in need of a truly forever home \u2014 a special human/family who will understand how stressful it is for her to be left at the shelter twice. \nSuki is a real sweetheart who is coming out of her shell (again!). She loves to cuddle, but she is not super outgoing and sometimes nervous and will need some nurturing to feel safe again. \nSuki will do best in a home with children over 12 and with no cats. She would prefer to be an only dog.\nShe has been heartworm tested negative, spayed, and is current on vaccinations. She has a docked tail and weighs about 60 pounds. You will receive health records and a bag of Science Diet food upon adoption. Adoption donation $120. \n\nThe Clinton County Humane Society is a no-kill, nonprofit, volunteer-based organization. We do not receive county or government funding and depend on our adoption donations to fund the shelter. Please complete the pre-adoption questionnaire at clintoncohumanesociety.org. We will contact you via email.",

I would make a perfect K9 buddy for law enforcement. I would pass any test you have for me as a top student. I have lots of energy as I am a working breed who likes to be active, but I\u2019m also down for chilling on the couch with my person. I enjoy all the attention\u00a0 I can get. Due to my strong build and herding breed, I would not do well with small children, they would be much too easy for me to accidentally knock down. I would prefer a single person or a couple without kids and the only pet. Cats & small dogs are not my cup of tea, so I cannot be around them or live with them. I am not a candidate for dog parks as I want to be boss of all dogs (hey, I'm a big German Shepherd, I cant help myself!). I need an EXPERIENCED dog owner, preferably one with a history of German Shepherd or Belgian Malanois ownership. I also require a fenced yard so I can run & play to my heart's content! Please adopt me so I can start the next chapter in life with my very own home! Sam is a male German Shepherd (appears to be purebred), weighs 80 lbs and was born approximately 8/18/2017. He is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, given flea/tick preventive, dewormed. Sam has been given life-saving treatment for heartworm disease. He will need to remain on heartworm preventive for life, as is recommended for ALL dogs, and retested in 6 months to ensure he is heartworm free. Adoption fee is $300 to help offset the many expenses we have for vetting costs. We rely strictly on adoption fees and donations to continue to save the lives of orphaned & abandoned pets; 100% goes towards their care. If interested in adopting one of our available dogs or puppies, please complete an online adoption application at https://dollyslegacyanimalrescue.org/adopt/ You will be contacted by our adoption coordinator via email after your application has been reviewed & approved to schedule an appointment.",

Cooper came to Mutts from a home where he was kept outside in a pen and ultimately abandoned. Despite his rough start, Cooper is an absolute love bug and a gentle giant. He is very sweet, people and dog-friendly, affectionate, housebroken, and crate trained. Cooper loves taking naps, but he also gets bursts of energy when he gets to go on walks or jogs. He also really enjoys spending time around people, snuggling, getting treats, going outside, saying hello to other dogs, and watching people and animals from his foster home's front window. Cooper would love to lay back and enjoy life with his forever family! Cooper would do best in a home without children\n\n**BECAUSE OF OUR REQUIREMENT FOR A HOME VISIT, WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO ADOPT TO HOMES IN THE NORTHERN VA / MARYLAND / DC METRO AREA**\n\nWe have adoption events EVERY SATURDAY from 12-3 p.m. Please note that not all dogs can attend every event, so if you are interested in meeting a particular dog, please complete a no-obligation application on our website at http://www.muttloverescue.org/application.html OR write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nUpcoming adoption events:\n\nMutt Love Rescue is doing everything we can to ensure the health and safety of our volunteers and adopters while continuing our mission to find homes for as many dogs as possible.\n\nEffective immediately, we will not be holding our weekly adoption events. Dogs available for adoption can be met by appointment only. Potential adopters should submit an online application at http://muttloverescue.org/application.html. Once we receive your application, we will contact you to let you know the next steps.\n\nWe are always desperate for foster homes, now more than ever. If you are interested in fostering during this difficult time, please complete an application... unless you are a previous adopter/foster, then you can just contact us via phone (703-988-2608) or email (adopt@muttloverescue.org) to tell us which dog you want to foster!\n\nFor information on sponsoring this dog, please write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nWE NEED FOSTER HOMES! FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE EMAIL ADOPT@MUTTLOVERESCUE.ORG.\n\nVisit us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/muttloverescue\nFollow us on Twitter: @Muttlove_Rescue",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Golden Gate who is called \"Cash\" is one handsome boy. He was relinquished due to separation anxiety in that he just could not be alone. He is in a foster home with other greyhounds and doing well. He is not quite 2 years old. He will need a home with another greyhound and a fenced yard where he can relax and enjoy himself. He really is a very sweet guy.\n\nFoster Update, November 2020\n\nCash is a tall, very handsome boy who loves people and toys. He gets along well with cats (with mild correction when he tries to engage them in play).\n\nHe suffers from separation anxiety and general anxiety. He will require a quiet home where someone will be home most of the time. He will also need a home with other greyhounds. He pulls strength from their confidence and lead. He does not like non-greyhounds and has a possessive/protective side as well.\n\nCash loves to run and do zoomies, so a fenced yard is a must. He also enjoys his walks once he is slowly introduced to his route accompanied with his pack. Their confidence helps him in all situations.\n\nCash sleeps like a baby, eats very well and accepts calm, patient direction. He does not react well to loud noises, new situations, etc. He truly is a sweet, loving dog who wants so much to please. Patience, structure and calm, experienced leadership will bring out his best.\n\n___________________________________Original Posting_______________________\n\nGolden Gate is a very handsome, good-sized boy. He is the sibling to Golden Globe who arrived with Golden Gate. He is a calm boy who is slightly reserved at first but warms up and will give little kisses. He is a baby at only 17 months of age, so he will need some TLC and he will learn. He is a sweet boy and was described as a \"gentle giant\" which aptly describes Golden Gate. He is cat tolerant with supervision. He walks nicely on leash but is somewhat fearful to cross door thresholds--with some patience, he will learn to not be fearful.",

            "description": "Bichon Frise\nFemale, 14 years old, 10 pounds\n\nGraciela (aka Gracie) is the sweetest little thing! She will patiently allow you to pick her up and can meet just about any dog with no issues (other than quite a lot of eager excitement!) Gracie is clearly a dog who pines to be devoted to her human - she wants to know where you are and to be with you all around the house. She's the BEST snuggle buddy on the couch! Her foster mom says Gracie seems to be anxious when left alone, which may be related to adjusting to her new surroundings. This little pup is a perfect match for someone who is mostly at home and would like a devoted companion! \n\nShe loves having free access to a yard, and knows how to use a doggy door. If you are looking for an excuse to get fresh air and exercise, Gracie is what you need! She happily goes on 2 mile daily walks at a brisk pace. Because Gracie was hit by a car 3 years ago, she has just the slightest wiggle in her gait, but this does not slow her down. She does love to stop to smell the roses, too, and thinks she's a mighty hunter when she spots squirrels. Gracie's a bit too fond of chasing cats, so a kitty-free home is probably best for her. Gracie's foster says \"she sure doesn't seem like a 14 year old dog to me - I hope I age as well as Gracie!\" Maybe you two could age \"gracefully\" together? \n\nGraciela came to us because her senior guardian's health is declining and she can no longer care for a dog.",

            "description": "Olivia von Oelsnitz is a beautiful 1-2 year old Shepherd mix. This is a fun, happy girl with a positive outlook on life. She comes out of her kennel happy, wagging her tail, and ready for new experiences.  She does great on her walks with other dogs,  meeting new dogs well, though retreating from the pushy ones, whom she finds a bit scary.  Olivia has such an affectionate and easy going personality and so loves attention that she follows you around in search of more! With her medium energy, she does great in play groups, joining them relaxed and comfortable and full of optimism. She loves to play fetch and appears to be a water dog, since she went directly into the kiddie pool the first time in playgroup. With her adorable play bow, she invites other dogs to join her in friendly games. She has a great time with dogs and people, as is just as she expects, given her sunny, rosy view of life.  You too will make new friends with convivial Olivia on the end of your leash! ( No cats for Olivia please!)\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website and Facebook page!

            "description": "Skye came to us very skittish with a litter of puppies. She was a transfer in from Mohave animal shelter and was seized from a hoarder house. She was living in an airline crate for most of her life and when she had her puppies they were in there together. Having very little social interaction with others, she is very shy and nervous with new people and dogs. She does like other dogs but gets overwhelmed easily. Skye lacks confidence and needs guidance in her next steps. At the shelter, she has been through leash training and understands for the most part but will occasionally roll and flinch at loud noises. Skye needs a home with someone experienced who will be patient with her and be willing to walk her through everything and help her build her confidence. She would thrive better in a quiet home without a lot of people coming and going. One minor issue we have not been able to break her of quiet yet is she nervously pees very often, for this reason it would be better for her to have a carpet free home. She also must be supervised while in a yard until she is comfortable as she can and will jump a seven foot fence. If you still think this blue- eyed- beauty is a good fit for your home, feel free to come meet her at the shelter. She is very worth it",

A kind family took her in and cared for her as best they could before they reached out to GRRALL for help in finding her a forever family. Daisy, like many of our rescues, is heartworm positive. She is undergoing treatment and will be ready for adoption in a couple of months. Our vet thinks she likely had several litters of puppies before she was dumped by her previous owners. Daisy's foster family describes her as an outgoing and happy girl. She LOVES her humans and is always by their side and ready for snuggles. Daisy is currently in a home with another Golden, but we think she'd prefer to be the only pup in the home so she can be the center of attention.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Nora or any GRRALL dog, please read our FAQs (https://grralliance.org/faq/) and submit an application at https://grralliance.org/applications/adoption-application/\n\nGRRALL serves the Dallas-Fort Worth/North Texas area. We do not have the resources to adopt outside this region and do not ship dogs. If you are outside our adoption area please contact your local Golden Retriever Rescue, local independent adoption groups, shelters, humane society, or other group to find your perfect forever friend.",

See, Ace tries to intimidate new people but he us actually a goof!  He has some insecurities which is why he will bark or growl at times. Once Ace knows you are not scared of him, he is a big mush ball. \n\nAce is looking for a home to continue his training, socialization and confidence building. Ace loves his humans HARD.  We are looking for an experienced home for this boy.  One that has patience but also understands alpha dynamics.  Ace has really proven to be a great dog in foster care. He respects men more than women and needs a firm owner that can set boundaries.  \n\nAce is okay with female dogs, but he can be rude in his play. He will muzzle punch and play bow. The dogs in his foster home are older and are not appreciative of that. We would place him with a tolerant female potentially or as an only dog. Kids 15 and up for Ace. He is currently with children but is not very respectful of their boundaries.  Cats are a no go as this big guy has a prey drive. \n\nAce is going to make an amazing addition for the RIGHT home. \n\nApplication Www.zoeshouserescue.com \nAdoption fee $400",

Akela is excited, independent and active.  He seems to be good with strangers and engages in attention and petting.  He will be too much for little kids as he is over exuberant on his greetings and does protect items he feels are high quality.  Akela is ok with other dogs but would prefer a home with a female dog or as a solo dog. Breed experience is required as Akita and Nordic breeds are not for everyone.  Akela can be aloof and uninterested in training and learning so really needs someone committed to understanding dog behavior and the use of positive training.  Akela is house trained and should be crated/confined when no one is home.\n\nAdoption fee: $300\nDate of birth: 10/2016\nWeight: ~75 lbs.",

In the shelter I am very fearful in my kennel and will bark at the gate, for this reason I am not on the main adoption floor and am in a quieter place where I am less stressed out.

            "description": "My name is Juniper or Juni for short. I was found at Independence Animal Hospital one morning when staff arrived for work. Somebody threw me over the 6 ft fence after hours. I survived that physically uninjured and the next morning the nice people at the hospital found me and took me to the local shelter where I could be taken care of. The people who owned me had not been very nice to me as I was very shy and withdrawn. Thankfully the mean people did not come to get me and the shelter contacted my rescue to work with me on building trust so I would be ready for my furever home. \n\nMy rescue thinks I'm a Great Pyrenees/Husky mix. I have one beautiful blue eye and one that's part brown and part blue. My eyes used to look sad, but my foster dad has really helped me come out of my shell. I'm still on the shy side but I've made a lot of progress! I enjoy attention and if my foster dad stops petting my me I gently nudge him with my nose. I love other dogs and enjoy greeting them and am learning how to play. High energy dogs make me a bit nervous so I would really like a calm dog to play with in my home. I need my people to have patience with my shyness and to use soft voices when speaking. Loud voices scare me. My foster dad says I never have accidents in the house and I will sit on command. I also really enjoy going on walks and am great on a leash. I will come to you spayed, microchipped, up to date on vaccines, up to date on heartworm and flea/tick preventatives. \n\nApplicants must have a secure and visible fence. In order for your application to be approved you must pass a home check and vet check which includes having at least a two year vet history. I can be adopted in Missouri and surrounding states: Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and Arkansas. My rescue is able to transport me to those states. If you would like to give me a Furever home, please fill out an application on my Rescue's website. \n\nBeing fostered in Holden, MO",

This is what scrappy foster has to say about him:Scrappy is good with dogs and people. He does not live with cats or kids so we don't know about either He is mostly house broken but has had few accidents when he gets scared. He is a Very sweet dog with a big smile. He is not crated when the foster leaves the house and doesnt have an issue with chewing anything. He can sometime display some food possesion so a home with children is not ideal.

            "description": "INDIE\nDOB: 02.17.2019*\n\nIndie was found wandering alone on the 106-degree streets of Bakersfield.  She was skinny, scared, seeking kindness and a safe place to stay.  She is one of the sweetest dogs you\u2019ll ever meet and is always ready to shower you with affection.  She will happily sit her 65-pound body on your lap, cuddle up next to you on the couch and/or lay by your side in bed. She\u2019s had a tough life and deserves to be in a home with a person/people who will appreciate these endearing qualities and give her lots of love and affection in return.\n\nHer foster family fell in love with Indie but couldn\u2019t keep her because one of their dogs was reactive. Indie was a sweetheart to him, but he wasn\u2019t receptive.  Also, their 2nd dog was about to go through amputation surgery due to cancer and having a new dog in our home during her recovery would be too stressful for all involved. Indie stayed with this foster for one week, and then came to Paw Printz where she\u2019s been able to interact with lots of other dogs.\n\nHousetrained and crate trained. Good house manners (hasn\u2019t chewed on personal items, taken food off counters, knocked things over or dug in the yard in our care).\n\nGets along well with dogs but would also do fine in a home without other dogs because she loves people so much. Has done well with young teenagers. Not sure about smaller children because we haven't had her around them.\n\nShe is a Pitty mix, possibly mixed with Plott Hound or Rottweiler. When she was first found, she was extremely stressed from being abandoned. She expressed her anxiety by going in circles, chasing her tail. We have been able to help her get beyond this stress-based behavior by providing her with a stable environment and through positive behavior modification. She is thriving now and ready for her forever home!  This incredible pup is full of unconditional love and is anxious to share it with her future adopters!\n\nHigh energy, would be a good walking/hiking/running partner. Has a playful, goofy side. Loves to run around the yard and play fetch. Very smart, learns quickly, minds well.\n\nIndie is spayed, she tested negative for heartworms and is now on Sentinel Spectrum to prevent heartworms, has been microchipped, cleared a veterinary wellness exam and is current on her vaccinations.\n\nAs with all Paw Printz dogs, we will provide free training, if any is needed in her new home, and we will take her back at any time if it doesn\u2019t work out for any reason.\n\nIf you think Indie would be the perfect addition to your home, send an email to: PawPrintzRescue@gmail.com and request an application.\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\nAdoption Requirements: Application, Interview, Homecheck\n\nTHIS DOG IS LOCATED NEAR FRESNO, CA\n\n*Age is always a guess with rescue dogs but here at Paw Printz we believe everyone should have a birth day so when the vet guesses at their age, we work out what would be a good birthday for each dog and make it so!",

We have been unable to have her spayed, due to her being so underweight.  Her fecal showed that she had whip worms, which has taken quite a bit of her calories.  We have medicated her for the whip worms and believe we will be able to spay her in November.  She needs to be the only dog or can be with large dogs, no homes with small dogs or cats.  Tulip is current on all vaccinations, housetrained and heartworm negative.  She is healthy other than being underweight and worms.  Tulip has more of a short to medium coat, which is a wash and wear Saint as she is easy to groom.  She knows her name and will come to you when she is called.  We believe her to be approximately 5 years old.  \n\nIn concern for families with small children, we will not adopt a dog to a home with any child under the age of 5. This is due to the large size of Saint Bernards and the safety of your children. Our Saint Bernards are not aggressive or mean in any way, they can just knock down children easily. If you would like to visit our pups please contact St. Cloud's Rescue at www.stcloudsrescue.org or call 972-679-5319. The first step in adopting from St. Cloud's Rescue is to complete an application. The application may be found OUR WEBSITE at www.stcloudsrescue.org. Please click on the application process, complete and then email it. Once the application has been sent please call us to confirm that we have received it. St.Cloud's Rescue maintains the right to deny applications to anyone for any reason we see fit. St. Cloud Rescue is a non-profit 501-c-3 organization. St. Clouds Rescue requires new owners to purchase a one year supply of heartworm preventative from us, which is at cost. We require a home visit prior to all placements. All our dogs must be microchipped at a cost of $20.00. There is a $250.00 donation fee. All dogs adopted through St Clouds Rescue must be indoors. St. Bernards can not tolerate the Texas heat.",

Inquiries requesting additional information will not be returned, due to limited volunteers. Thank you for your understanding **** \n\nThis is Jax.\n\nJax came to us after being put on \u201cthe list\u201d at one of our local mandatory intake shelters that is constantly overcrowded. He is estimated to be about 4- 5years old, currently weighs 70 lbs, and is quite tall for his breed. He must be mixed with a dog that is traditionally taller than a staffy for sure!\n\nJax does well on a leash but will push his limits and accepts redirection like a champ, he is good with all people and female dogs, with a proper introduction of course and a bit of redirection if he gets over excited. He is a ladies man and says no male dogs please. He is not a dog park dogs but would do well with a semi-active to active family. Definitely not a couch potato but can be chill once his energy needs are met. Due to his size and energy, he would do best in a home with older children. \n\nHe loves \u201cplaying\u201d ball but prefers football vs fetch. I remedy this by having 2 tennis balls, 1 to throw and 1 to distract him with once he retrieves the first, so he will drop it. He is so much fun in the yard!\n\nJax does have storm anxiety but we can guide you on making him comfortable and keeping him safe during storms.  If he can be with you, he is fine. If he is in a crate or alone, he can be destructive and vocal. Wouldn\u2019t recommend and apartment dweller for this reason and would require that he be kept in a crate when unsupervised.\n\nAll PETronus Rescue dogs receive basic vaccinations (distemper/parvo, bordetella, & rabies), spay/ neuter, and microchip prior to adoption. We also treat any know medical issues, including heartworms.\n\nOur dogs live in foster homes while they wait patiently for their forever families to find them. This is beneficial in that they learn house manners, crate training, housebreaking, etc while they wait and we are also able to get a very realistic picture of their energy level, temperament, etc so that we can place them in a home that is the best fit.\n\nOur adoption fees are $200 for dogs over 1 year of age and $250 for dogs under 1 year of age. Puppies receive 3 rounds of puppy vaccinations.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our amazing dogs, please fill out our adoption application here http://bit.ly/PRAdoption and we will be in touch!\n",

He is Very friendly and still has some of his puppy energy. He would be good for someone looking for a loyal dog that wants a pal for a walk or play.  Interested in things around him and will come up and ask for a hug...or two.  We think he is part white dalmatian which is a rare breed because he has the faded spots of a white dalmatian.  In any case he is a handsome gentleman and such a loving soul. He came back to us from a trial adoption where he was staying in a RV.  They felt he took up too much space but they said he is a wonderful dog and a quick learner.",

We aren't sure how she would get along with children since her owner did not indicate that she had any experience with youngsters.\n\nHoney has some separation anxiety issues and is looking for a compassionate individual who will work with her on those issues through positive reinforcement training.\n\nHoney has been kept indoors and is housebroken.\n\nHoney weighs 42 lbs lbs and is accustomed to wearing a harness when she walks with her owner.\n\nHoney will be spayed before being adopted by her new family.\n\nUPDATE: Honey was spayed on October 19, 2020 and was also given rabies vaccine.\n\n\n",

Whoever wants to adopt them needs to realize they may not be warm and affectionate when they meet you.\u00a0 This is how they were with their foster parents at first, but with patience and time to settle in, they are an amazing, fun pair of dogs.\n\nThey would do best in a calm, quiet home.\u00a0 We will not place them further than an hour from Atlanta, or into a home with young children. Both have high prey drives and would probably not do well in a home with a fence they can see through, like chain link.\u00a0 They would want to chase everything they saw outside the fence.\u00a0 A wood fence would work much better for them.\n\nTheir adoption fees are $250 each.",

CJ loves to run all around the yard, go for long walks, play with squeaky toys, gets the zoomies regularly, and is just a great puppy. He is very food motivated and knows how to sit on cue, but will need a basic obedience class and lots of structure to guide him in good doggie manners. CJ loves car rides and would gladly jump into your car to join you on adventures. He has been a wonderful hiking buddy who loves to take in all the sights and smells he can. If you are looking for a fun and energetic doggo to play with, run with, and make memories with, this is your guy! Weight: 53lbs Housetrained: No Dogs: meet and greet Cats: Unkown Children: Over 12 years due to energy and food possession",

The vet has checked him over and given him the all clear. He is in great health and spirits. \n\nHe loves people and plays with the other dogs in his foster home. Just like any puppy he is learning the basics, 'no bite', 'sit', 'bring me the toy'. He is a sweet boy and eager to learn and please. Puppies take a lot of time and patience, and Rossi is no different. He has puppy energy that could wear down a 3rd grade classroom so lots and lots of playtime is needed. \n\nHis is almost done with all his puppy shots and will be neutered and microchipped prior to adoption.\n\nIf you think Rossi would be the perfect addition to your home, send an email to PawPrintzRescue@gmail.com and request an application. \n\nAdoption Fee: $200\nAdoption Requirements: Application, Interview, Homecheck\n\nTHIS DOG IS LOCATED NEAR FRESNO, CA\n\n*Age is always a guess with rescue dogs but here at Paw Printz we believe everyone should have a birth day so when the vet guesses at their age, we work out what would be a good birthday for each dog and make it so!",

She is a wonderful girl who gets along with all the other dogs in her temp foster home. \n Cocoa will be receiving HW treatment, so she could really benefit from being in a quiet, lowkey foster home (Leb/Lanc/Hbg area) to recover.   (10/3/2020)   Sweet senior girl, Cocoa, was going to be PTS yesterday because the southern shelter is packed.   Rescue friends jumped in to help her, and we were contacted to bring her to Angels Among Us Animal Sanctuary.   Cocoa appears to be about 12-13 years old.   She is a Lab/Shepherd mix and is reported to be very gentle and sweet.   Unfortunately Cocoa is HW+, so she will be examined by our vet to decide the best treatment option for her.   Cocoa will need a quiet permanent foster home where she can live out her life with lots of love and the best vetting care.   AAU will provide everything that this adorable senior girl needs.   IF YOU LIVE IN THE LEB/LANC/HBG AREA AND ARE INTERESTED IN FOSTERING COCOA, PLEASE EMAIL AngelsAmongUsRS@live.com.",

Just in the last month I have made a lot of progress however I need someone who will be patient and understand its an emotional struggle for me. In time, I will be your best friend and love you furever! Promise! Also I am housebroken.\n\nOur Furry Friendz are available for adoption through a screening process which includes but is not limited to: a completed application, 3 referrals, a home visit, and a vet referral prior to their furever home placement. The dogs are spayed/neutered, micro chipped, current on all vaccines and on heart worm/flea preventive. If you're interested in adopting, let's begin the adoption process by clicking the link below.\nhttps://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/FURF/Dog",

Canelo is shy meeting new people since he spent his life on a chain but warms up quickly. He's potty trained but still occasionally marks when he gets nervous. He's very good in his crate and sleeps in there at night. Canelo loves toys and playing with other dogs. He hasn't been around young children yet. He knows basic commands such as sit, stay, heel and lay down. If you are interested in adopting Canelo, please apply at www.hhfrescue.org. The adoption fee includes vaccinations, bordetella, deworming, rabies, spay/neuter, microchip, a lifetime registration of the microchip, and sales tax. If adopting a puppy, the rabies and spay/neuter will be done at the same time by our vet once they are 4 months old and billed to us. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.",

We do not do out-of-state adoptions and will not ship dogs to other parts of the country; please do not ask.\n\nCha Cha is the sweetest German Pinscher and is the most loveable pup you've ever met!! She loves to give kisses and going on walks.\n\nCha Cha came to us from an organization that removes dogs from horrible situations across the border in the Tijuana area. Cha Cha was living in a broken down shack with many, many other dogs. We believe she was kicked in the eye by someone and that is how she lost one of her eyes. Her eye has completely healed and it doesn't affect her one bit!!\n\nCha Cha has a best friend, his name is Kibbles and we would like to place both Kibbles and Cha Cha together. Cha Cha feels much more comfortable with other dogs around and Kibbles is definitely Cha Cha's boyfriend (please see Kibbles bio). These two love to play together and don't leave each others' side since they met. \n\nBeing  a German Pinscher, Cha Cha does not bark and listens very well.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Cha Cha and Kibbles, please contact us. Due to COVID, we have suspended dog adoption events, but we do do meet-and-greets.",

            "description": "Izzy is a 7 year old, female, 55 lbs, Boxer/Pointer mix. She's good with children and other dogs. Izzy is currently heartworm positive but undergoing treatment. She is still little skittish and I feel has some separation anxiety. For that I've given her a kong filled with frozen goodies to distract her and it's helped. She just wants to be around you. She doesn't necessarily need to be cuddled up with you all the time. She likes going on walks, sunbathing, throwing herself upside down on grass and wiggling in it. She is definitely not a run and fetch girl. She does this cute thing when she's excited where she'll tip toe on her front paws so it looks like she dancing.To adopt Izzy, please apply at www.hhfrescue.org.The adoption fee includes vaccinations, bordetella, deworming, rabies, spay/neuter, microchip, a lifetime registration of the microchip, and sales tax. If adopting a puppy, the rabies and spay/neuter will be done at the same time by our vet once they are 4 months old and billed to us. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.",

            "description": "Hi my name is Otoe and some very nice people at AHeinz57 Pet Rescue and Transport saved me from the spring floods in 2019. I have never been socialized with people, but was living on the property with 20+ of my furry brothers and sisters. I came to the rescue pregnant, but I won't have to do that again. \n\n\n\nI have been in a foster home since mid August and am learning about the finer things in life. I love my foster siblings and will need another confident dog in my forever home. If left completely alone I have some anxiety, but I do just fine if there's another dog with me. \n\n\n\nBecause I am still unsure about trusting humans I am considered a flight risk and require a secure physical fence. I have mostly overcome my fear of humans being too close and getting leashed up and can be leashed regularly. I have a fenced in yard at my foster home and now they let me enjoy being in the yard without a leash sometimes. Inside the yard I'm pretty comfortable and walk really nicely on a leash. I've been on a few walks/jogs and they are pretty scary still, but as long as we are in a quiet area I do pretty well.\n\n\n\nI've been on a few car rides and they are super scary! My foster parents say I'm doing better, but I really do not like car rides yet.\n\n\n\nI'm not ready to snuggle with people, but my foster parents are allowed a few pets once in a while. When they wake up or come home I will greet them at the door and like to sniff their heads to say good morning and hello.\n\n\n\nI am learning life and will continue to learn what my life should be. If you're interested in meeting me please put in an application at AHeinz57.com.",

            "description": "Hello, friends! My \"official\" name is Chucho, but I have lotsa fun nicknames. My foster mom calls me Tempo because I'm a reliably good boy. I'm looking for a home with loving humans, a big couch, and maybe even a fursibling to help me make the most of my second chance. \n\nYou might remember my story: I was dumped at the shelter with a gigantic, ruptured tumor on my belly. TLP saved me and rushed me to the vet, and now I'm cancer-free and as happy as I could be! Despite my past, I'm confident, trusting and super affectionate. I love everyone I meet. My favorite thing is to wiggle under your arm for a nap.\n\nI love other dogs, especially if they want to run and chase and wrestle with me! I don't especially like sharing my toys, but I'm trying to get better. I carry my ball around with me like a pacifier, and sometimes I fall asleep with it in my mouth.\n\nI know all my basic commands and I'm building up my leash skills. I'm suuuuuuper food motivated! Go ahead and buy a second (or third!) bag of treats for me. My foster mom says I can be \"opinionated,\" but I just say that I like to talk. Besides, who needs a doorbell when you got me?!\n\nAre you looking for a 70lb lapdog and cuddle buddy? You found me!! Apply to meet me now.",

            "description": "Chief is an 18 month old red merle Australian Shepherd and weighs about 50lbs. This lively, handsome boy is full of energy and personality. Like many Aussies, he really bonds with his person and he is a little hesitant when meeting strangers. Once you have his love and approval he greets you with a smile, a toy or stick in his mouth, and a great deal of happy enthusiasm.\n\nChief is smart, athletic, and needs an\u00a0active family that will challenge him by doing lots of training and fun games to stimulate that smart brain of his. We will require that his new family be experienced with herding dogs, and have no children under 12.\u00a0He is sharp, learns quickly, and will need lots of constructive playtime, training, and exercise.\u00a0Chief needs someone that will take him running, swimming, or play some dedicated fetch with him. A couple of long walks a day are not sufficient for his level of energy. \u00a0It's difficult for him to settle down if he doesn't get sufficient physical and mental exercise.\n\nChief's hips have been x-rayed and evaluated. They are not perfect but have only a slight malformation. He would be able to do any normal fun activities, running, hiking, swimming, playing fetch. Competitive agility would not be a good idea, but Chief certainly could do agility training for fun.\n\nHe gets along with other active dogs, better with females than males, is good with cats, but not good with chickens. He is crate trained and doing well with housebreaking.\n\nChief is a high energy herding dog and his needs are different than an average family dog. We will not allow him to be adopted by anyone who lives in an apartment or townhouse. He needs a big yard, with a secure fence as he is an escape artist.\u00a0\n\nPlease fill out an application if you think you can meet the activity\u00a0needs of Chief. Please note: we will not respond to inquiries or applications that do not meet our requirements.\n\nPlease go to our website for the adoption details: www.almosthomehdr.org\n",

She is very good with people and children. At just over 50 pounds, she can be selective about other dog friends. No information about cats. She is quite bonded with her special friend, Hydro, also listed for adoption.

I am a medium sized boy at 55 pounds, I am built for play. I need to be the only furry love of your life. I like to meet other puppies but I don't share! I am best with women, I have a real fear of men. Please take a chance on me!\n\nMace is a 55 pound, 2 year old pit mix. He is UTD, neutered and chipped. He's very dog friendly.\n\nMace came from an abusive background where he was used only for breeding. Due to this, he is leery with men at first and we do not recommend him in a home with children. He's very sweet but will need a minute to trust you since he has his guard up. He is great with other dogs, however can get protective over his toys. Mace has never been tested with cats. He is crate trained and house broken. \n\nAdoption requirements are as such:\n\n\n\tLarge breed experience \n\tNo kids (under 16)\n\tIf another dog (large dogs only), the owner must have experinece with resource guarding \n\n\nPlease note, Mace is part of Happy Trails Animal Rescues rehoming program. He has not been tested or evaluated and the information gathered is from the current owners personal statements regarding health and temperament. The owner is subject to placement outside of our organization. We cannot guarantee availability.",

            "description": "Tyler is a Lab/Pitbull mix, born 8/20/2020. \n\nSince this puppy may be too small to be altered at the time of adoption, the adopters will be provided with a voucher to have the puppy altered and microchipped by the time he is 6 months of age. This must be done at Nebraska Humane Society. If you prefer to take the puppy to your own vet, we will pay a PORTION of the cost ($69) to your vet of choice.\n\nBefore applying to adopt this puppy, you need to be familiar with your local breed-specific legislation regarding Pit Bulls.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for this puppy is $450. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

She loves learning new tricks. She loves playing and puzzles. Lizzo loves people and very few dogs (she'd like to be an only child - although she can ignore other dogs on walks.) Lizzo really loves cats, but not in the good way - so we're going to step in here and ask that her new home not have any kitties or small animals. Lizzo has been with us so long that we could write a BOOK about this peanut. This 50 (petite lb), 4 year old pittie is so incredibly full of joy - it's rather astounding that she hasn't found a home yet. We're so happy and grateful that she is now in a foster home while she waits for her forever to come along. She is reportedly the BEST houseguest (respectful, quiet housebroken) and is just looking for a family that wants an energetic goofball to be the center of their world. If you are interested in learning more about this foster pet, please contact our Foster Care Coordinator at fosterpets@talgov.com and reference the Animal ID number at the beginning of this post.",

He was adopted out but returned years later because the family could no longer care for him. Cash has a ton of energy and needs an active home. Cash is also affectionate, playful, and incredibly smart. He lived with children and a small dog previously but can be dog selective. For this reason we feel he should be the only dog in the home. He is crate trained, potty trained, and muzzle trained. Cash needs a home with experienced adopters who have handled Rottweilers and/or Pit Bulls before. He responds to commands in both English and Spanish. He is a sweet guy just looking for his perfect active family.",

            "description": "Honey is a sweet, sweet full Saint Bernard that is between 1-2 years old.  She was saved by some wonderful folks who kept her from getting hit as she was walking in the street.  As you can see from the pictures she has demodex mange.  This is due to the lack of proper nutrition and being completely covered in fleas and ticks.  She arrived at St. Cloud\u2019s Rescue on 9/27/2020 and she has made tremendous improvement.  With the help of Dr. Gray and lots of love, attention, good quality food and many medications she is doing much better. Honey is current on all vaccinations, housetrained and heartworm negative.  She will need to be spayed, but we are unable to do that until sometime in late November due to her health.  Honey weighs approximately 90 pounds and is one of the sweetest and most loving dogs you could ever find.  If you are interested in meeting Honey, we would love for you to meet her.  We will be accepting a deposit for her, but will not release her until the first part of December unless her health improves quicker. \n\nIn concern for families with small children, we will not adopt a dog to a home with any child under the age of 5. This is due to the large size of Saint Bernards and the safety of your children. Our Saint Bernards are not aggressive or mean in any way, they can just knock down children easily. If you would like to visit our pups please contact St. Cloud's Rescue at www.stcloudsrescue.org or call 972-679-5319. The first step in adopting from St. Cloud's Rescue is to complete an application. The application may be found OUR WEBSITE at www.stcloudsrescue.org. Please click on the application process, complete and then email it. Once the application has been sent please call us to confirm that we have received it. St.Cloud's Rescue maintains the right to deny applications to anyone for any reason we see fit. St. Cloud Rescue is a non-profit 501-c-3 organization. St. Clouds Rescue requires new owners to purchase a one year supply of heartworm preventative from us, which is at cost. We require a home visit prior to all placements. All our dogs must be microchipped at a cost of $20.00. There is a $250.00 donation fee. All dogs adopted through St Clouds Rescue must be indoors. St. Bernards can not tolerate the Texas heat.",

            "description": "We see that award-winning smile, Zeke - we know it's gonna land you your forever family soon!\n\nZeke was transferred to THS from another shelter. He knows he's adorable and a bundle of fun - on his most recent field trip his field trip partner said: \"I took Zeke out for a little trip today and couldn't have had more fun! He is a very sweet dog and instantly loved everyone he saw! He is such a good boy!\" Zeke is actually a rockstar of our Tails Around Toledo field trip program, and gets rave reviews on all of his field trips! Volunteers describe him as an active and energetic guy, but when he's had a chance to relax, he loves to snuggle up and be held! He thinks everyone is his best friend! He also rides great in the car, too!\n\nHe recently spent a few weeks in a foster home, and the foster described him as affectionate, active, and friendly. He met another dog while out in foster that matched his size and play style, and within 15 minutes both dogs were exhausted! Zeke walks very well on a leash but is still working on impulse control when he sees another dog from a distance. He is so excited to meet that dog, he will pull on the leash while barking. He will need a patient family that can work on his leash manners. Zeke was housebroken on a regular schedule and is also crate trained! Zeke needs an active family that can provide him with lots of enrichment and an outlet for all of his energy! Currently residing in foster care again, Zeke knows his new family is just waiting to whisk him away for adventures!!\n\nDue to his play style, Zeke should meet any resident dogs prior to going home to ensure they will be compatible. He should also meet any children in the home to ensure a good fit for you family! \n \nZeke was recently treated for heartworm disease and will need to go home with a year of heartworm prevention medication. THS requires all adopters of heartworm positive dogs to purchase a 1 year supply of heartworm preventative at the time of adoption. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Zeke please e-mail foster@toledohumane.org!",

Our behavior team has been working with Kickstand on his resource guarding. It takes some time and patience for him to trust new people around his stuff, but he has made significant progress in his foster home. Kickstand has also learned basic obedience skills and some cute tricks, including high five and sit pretty. He is house trained, crate trained, and loves going on walks or chasing squirrels in the backyard. Because of Kickstands behavior history, he would do best in a home without children where he can continue his training. He is dog selective and prefers calm dogs who will ignore him and give him space.",

For Susie, the best situation would be a single adult who is willing and able to put Susie away when there is company over. Susie likes other dogs & cats, but she can be protective of her food, so really should be the only pet. Susie would do best in a home with someone who has dog experience, preferably with Boston Terriers and their specific behaviors.\n\nIf you'd like to meet this sweet, funny gal please fill out an adoption application at www.ehrdogs.org & be sure to ask for her by name, SUSIE RM!",

If you are interested in this dog, please contact his owner Callie: 815-878-1719)\n\nMr. B is a sweet, loving, and super smart guy. He was adopted 8 years ago (he\u2019s 9) and has spent an amazing life with his family since then. Unfortunately he gets too nervous around his toddler human sister so he often has as to be separated from his people and it is taking a toll on him. \nMr. B only requires a 30 minute walk most days. He would still chase a ball for hours if his humans would let him but he will be very sore after. He has no problem going on a short jog or a long hike and the vet says he is in perfect health!  \nMr. B walks well on a leash, but gets a little anxious with strangers or in busy situations. He is VERY obedient and receptive to commands. In fact, he passed his Canine Good Citizen\u2019s test with flying colors and his previous trainer called him his \u201cpitbull ambassador\u201d.\nMr. B needs a home with no other pets or children. He does bark at delivery drivers and visitors at the door but does well home alone. He will thrive in an all adult home, with a fenced yard (not invisible fence) and where he doesn\u2019t need to be left alone regularly for long hours.  He needs a home with a family that will love him and understand that he really is the BEST boy ever when his environment is calm and steady. \n",

After 3 failed attempts to repair the problem, it was decided the vet clinic would keep onsite as an office dog. However, circumstances have changed and she now needs to find a new place to call home. It does not appear the she can not control when she has a bowel movement. She is otherwise healthy and only takes a joint supplement, heartworm prevention, and an inexpensive fiber food additive. Petra is a sweet girl but she is not always great with other dogs.

After 3 failed attempts  to repair the problem, it was decided the vet clinic would keep onsite as an office dog. However, circumstances have changed and she now needs to find a new place to call home. It does not appear the she can not control when she has a bowel movement. She is otherwise healthy and only takes a joint supplement, heartworm prevention, and an inexpensive fiber food additive. Petra is a sweet girl but she is not always great with other dogs. Please contact us if you can open your home to this elderly gal. ~*~If you've requested an application be emailed and you have not received it, please check your spam or junk mail folder since often our messages are sent there in error.~*~",

            "description": "Thank you Artful Gardener!\n\n'Named for the 7th Annual Cabin Fever Party at The Artful Gardener. Once again this year the awesome, fun-loving, kind-hearted customers of The Artful Gardener in Rochester came together to show their support for Joyful Rescues. In addition to their participation, seven local artists donated their time and over 20 local businesses donated goods and services to the Raffle for Rescue. Thanks to every one of them, the animals in this transport have found safe haven while they await their forever homes!'' Jean Westcott\n\nWinnie was born around August 19, 2019, and may top out in the 40 pound range. Winnie does wonderfully with the other dogs and is great with humans.\n\nUPDATE: Winnie was adopted into a home with a lovely older couple and was returned because her energy level was a bit to much for the household. They mentioned Winnie was fine with children but may knock smaller kids over. We will be looking for a home with a fenced yard and perhaps another playful dog or older kids to play with.\n\nThe Adoption Fee for this dog is $500.00\n\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general, our fees include spay/neuter, all age-appropriate vaccines, Home Again microchipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY. Joyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility. YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES We keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list. If a pet is still showing, it is still available for adoption. Can't Adopt Me? SPONSOR ME Look for the Link 'Special Instructions to Seller' if you want to note a particular pet\n\nBefore you seek to adopt a pet from Joyful Rescues, please read our Pet Adoption page http://www.joyfulrescues.org/pet_adoption.html.\n\nOnline Application",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

We are working on training for bringing the ball back and to allow it to be picked up and re-thrown easily. She needs an active family, LOVES PEOPLE, and a Secure fenced yard. She is a dog that we will happily send with her current training gear, and info to keep her working for her best paw forward. We will back her training for a month or so after adoption with the right family locally who can use her current trainer.\n\nShe is still working on her house training but is crate trained, and wear a bark collar occasionally to learn to settle down, as known with these breeds she is VERY high drive and high energy, would make a great RUNNING DOG or super long active hiker/explorer!\n\nLooking for a foster to adopt first for her.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nName: Prince Peach\nDOB: 11/14/19\nWeight: 45\nAdoption Fee: $375\n\nPeaches is an energetic, inquisitive pup who loves to explore the world. His favorite things include playing with other dogs, gnawing on bones, snacking on literally any food you offer him, and all the water in all its forms. Peaches is exactly what a puppy should be: happy-go-lucky and curious about everything around him. He'll be a great guard dog, as he catches all the little noises and movements in his neighborhood and lets you know (he's working on being less vocal). In fact, he's on the hyper-alert side but is working on it with some daily anxiety meds (taken orally). As he matures, he's most likely to grow out of any need for them, but for now, they help him level out. Peaches learns fast and listens very well for a pup. If he gets into something he shouldn't, he'll usually leave it when told to, and is a good sport about having items removed by hand.\n\nHe's fiercely loyal and tends to bond specifically to one human as his pack leader. He is particularly likely to bond with men, but his first owner was female and he was quite attached to her as well. Because he's so loyal and protective, it can be difficult for this pup to bond with others in a household, though he does well with adults in general. However, Peaches is not interested in being around children. His ideal home would be a single person or an adult couple with prior GSD experience and a big backyard to play in (bonus points if it's fenced, he's still learning to come when called). His favorite pastime is getting wet, and would love to play in the backyard with a hose and kiddie pool. He hasn't tried swimming yet but would probably adore it. Peaches would love to go on daily walks and even have another dog to play with, though he's also able to be independent. This pup is still learning not to chew on objects beyond his toys and bones, so will need kenneling or supervision until he fully matures. Luckily, he doesn't mind his kennel much and settles in within 5-10 minutes (though he's bummed to be missing out on any action happening while he's cooped up). Peaches is almost 100% on potty training and will let you know when he needs to go out by going to the door or staring at it. He's got some basic commands down, like sit, wait, shake and lie down, and will only improve with more practice!\n\nIn the meantime if you have questions or are interested in me, please fill out an adoption application at www.ruffstartrescue.org.\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal.\n\nPlease check out our website, www.ruffstartrescue.org for more details and additional pictures on any of our animals!\n\nAll Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs).\n\nRuff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue.

I'm such a snuggly, fun girl, once you give me time to trust you. You see, I've had a hard start to my young life, so I'm a bit shy and fearful. I would do really well in a quiet, calm home with a settled adult that has time to give me plenty of attention. I don't do great with extra people and a lot of commotion, so I would love to live without other pets or children.\nI love to be out exploring, sniffing all the smells, and getting some bursts of energy out, but I'm also a great lounger. I have some hip dysplasia, and a knee that gives me a little trouble, so my foster mom gives me lots of brain games that I love to do, and I don't have to be out in the scary world.\nThey say I am a mix of Lab and Pit, and a couple people that know Greyhounds, thought I look like that too. What a great combo-- but it will take a good leader and experience in my forever home. I have a high prey drive, and I am extremely fast, and can jump real high.\nAs I've been coming out of my shell, my foster mom says I'm becoming a \"real puppy\", because if I'm not lying right next to you, I'm into something, or wanting to play hide and seek.\nI'm a pretty good listener, but you have to be sure you're the boss, because sometimes I like to push the limits.\nBecause I'm still a bit fearful, I have a hard time telling my foster mom when I want to go out, but I try by climbing on top of her. We are working on bell training, but that's a little scary too.\nI know sit, come, and kennel-up, and we've been working on stay and down.\nI think if you're a bit of an introvert, and want a great companion pup, I would be the best girl for you!\nIf you want to meet me, reach out to Ruff Start, and let me show you my stuff.\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal.\n\nPlease check out our website, www.ruffstartrescue.org for more details and additional pictures on any of our animals!\n\nAll Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs).\n\nRuff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue.

Does your hermit shell include grassy knolls for a loving dog to play? I introduce to you the one who goes by many names, The High Snuggler, Lady Pillow Stealer, Miss Snacks-O-Lot, but best known as Sydnee. She's all about the snuggles and loves to give kisses to her humans. She will keep you warm right through the bitter cold of winter. Don't let Sydnee's bite history scare you away, she was just ensuring that the household was protected from strange humans. You never know about the two-legged these days. She will need her humans to work with her through these fear tendencies. Sydnee is rather friendly off the established homeland. You might say, \"But you said she's the perfect antisocial dog!\" I hear you, but she is well worth the minor inconvenience of small talk. Don't worry, she will want to be off and away again soon! Sydnee does get along with other dogs, but not cats. It may take a couple weeks to a month of crate rotating for her to accept a new barkmate, this is sometimes just how things go. She appears happy and excited at first, but this can quickly change due to her fear response in the first weeks of introduction. She takes a daily allergy pill with peanut butter and does shed a bit. Sydnee has a great love for food and she finds it highly motivating. In the mornings, she dances around excitedly for her meal, but then again, who doesn't?? Sydnee has a passion for squeaky toys and loves to boop them. She is a great companion, is working on muzzle training, is potty trained, and will be a loving addition to a new home. She may do better in a non-apartment setting as she does bark at new sounds and movement.\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal.\n\nPlease check out our website, www.ruffstartrescue.org for more details and additional pictures on any of our animals!\n\nAll Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs).\n\nRuff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue.

I'm an extremely handsome and lovable guy who is on the hunt for a forever home that can provide me with structure, stability and lots of love, that's not too much to ask for right?\n\nI'm a young energetic guy that loves to romp around outside and explore! I also enjoy taking a walk every now and then, but do tend to pull on the leash until I get into a rhythm so you'll need to remind me of my leash manners at first- I'm working very hard on them! I love to play with toys and I'm such a good boy that I don't even shred them, so feel free to spoil me with lots! I am looking for a home with a fenced yard, as I like my privacy from the other neighborhood dogs! I do need slow and proper introductions to other canines so having a fence will assure no unknown pups try to come for an unplanned visit, that's not my style. However, I have been working with an awesome team of people to try and help me feel more confident and comfortable around other dogs, I've started basket muzzle training and have been doing really great! I have some anxiety that causes me to feel uneasy from time to time, I take Fluoxetine to tone my nervousness down and will need a family that is willing to continue this for my well-being. Due to my anxiety, I will need a home without young children who may not understand my boundaries (16 years and older only). I am fully potty trained and keep my kennel clean! I also have some allergies that are easily managed by taking Benadryl in the morning and evening!\n\nI can't wait to start on a new journey with a family that will love me forever, quirks and all! I promise to make a great companion and just need a home committed to helping me succeed and be the best version of myself! Please take a chance and come meet me, you won't regret it!\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal.\n\nPlease check out our website, www.ruffstartrescue.org for more details and additional pictures on any of our animals!\n\nAll Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs).\n\nRuff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue. Animals are located in homes throughout Minnesota. We do not have a facility where animals are kept.\n\nRuff Start Rescue Adoption Policies: http://www.ruffstartrescue.org/info/display?PageID=11744",

            "description": "Welcome to the Wonderful World of Rescue Dachshunds. Look around and read their bios. Find a few whose personality seems to fit well. Consider one of our Well Seasoned Seniors who are truly wonderful and have so much to offer. Need help finding the best fit? We'll help with that too. Please fill out an application and let's get you all matched up with a loving new \"furever' companion and friend. You'll find the application on the \"Available Dogs\" page.\n\nNOTE:\n\nAdoptions to Central/South Texas residents only\n\nStandard Adoption Fee Adult Dog: $250 ea. Puppy Adoption Fee: $300 ea. Reduced rates for Seniors dogs (10 and up). Reduced rates for pairs (when adopted together). All adoption fees are subject to sales tax per the State of Texas. DDRTX only adopts in Central/South Texas.\n\nEmail: ddrtxinfo@gmail.com Primary Website: www.DDRTX.org\n\nWren is around 8 years old and weighs 12 pounds. He is low-to-medium energy, and a nice mix of couch potato and playful explorer\n. He enjoys his squeakies or playing fetch with you for a few minutes. He likes getting affection with a gentle touch. Short walks are ok. He loves going in and out of the pet door multiple times a day, and is house trained using it. Due to his interest in prey, living with cats would need to be tested first.\n\nHe is good with other dogs, just doesn't really play with them. He would also do fine as an only dog. He likes calm and quiet and a steady routine.\n\nWren is smart, sweet, and willing to please. He does have storm anxiety, and keeping him busy with a squeaky works well. Instead of a kennel/crate, he does well in a small room or baby gated area when left alone.\n\nWren loves to sleep on the big bed. He burrows under blankets and will tuck himself in!\n\nIf you can share the big bed, have a yard, don't mind brushing his teeth, and are looking for a lower/medium energy dog who likes best to take it easy and be a companion, he is your guy! He likes to feel safe and loved, and is so adorable, it's easy to do.\n\nMedical info: Wren has an auto-immune disease that can cause ulcers in his mouth if it's not kept clean. It is important that his people help him maintain his oral hygiene by brushing his teeth daily, and/or using a gel as a backup. He doesn't mind the brushings, and enjoys his flavored doggie toothpaste.\n\nLove dachshunds and not ready to adopt or circumstances won't permit having a dog? How about being a sponsor or making a donation. Every one of our dachshunds receives excellent medical care along with day to day food, love and housing. Being non-profit, we rely on generous individuals like yourselves to help save these fur babies. You can do this specifically for one dog with the sponsor button on their webpage or a general donation on our \"How To Help\" page. Easy and quick through Pay Pal or your debit/credit card. You generosity is sincerely appreciated by all and is tax deductable. Need other ideas? You'll find tons of them on the How to Help tab. All contributions are tax deductable.\n\nDiamond Dachshund Rescue of Texas is a non-profit 501(c)(3) volunteer organization with focus on rescue and adoption of pure breed Dachshunds. All dogs are fully vetted and housed on private property. Meetings are scheduled upon adoption approval. Thank you for your continued support to the rescue and shelter communities!\nOpt to Adopt!",

He is \n 55 lbs, of pure snuggles. He loves to walk and is good on a leash, hike or just play in the yard with his furry siblings. He does need a fenced yard so he can run and play and enjoy the outdoors. He is crate trained and lives with 4 other dogs and a cat, which he pretty much ignores. He is HW positive since his previous owners didn't love him enough to give him HW prevention every month, but the rescue pays for his treatment. \n\nAll of our Wigglers are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, hw tested/treated, and on preventatives. Most of our adoptable dogs need fenced in yards or an exercise regimen. We require proof spanning 3 consistent years of HW preventatives for already owned pets, UTD on shots, and spay/neuter in order to adopt. Please read their description above closely. Our adoption fee is $350. For an application to foster or adopt send us your number and email address in a message.",

He was originally adopted in 2015, but was returned on 3/3/20 because he was no longer getting along with the other dog in the home. The owner said Gulliver loves everyone he meets and is a playful and high energy dog. He can be a rather rough player, so would probably be too much for young children. He seems very mouthy when exiting his kennel and needs to be taught not to grab onto his leash when being walked. A metal chain leash attached to a training harness or martingale collar is recommended. Once hes had his exercise and calms down, he lies on his bed and chews on his nylabone toy. His former owner said he did well with cats. We dont know for sure that he is housebroken, but think it is very likely since he lived in a home successfully for 4 years.

            "description": "Karra is a lovely, young female pit bull terrier mix. She originally was a transfer from a shelter in North Carolina. Whether her timidity was due to being naturally shy or to not being exposed to lots of experiences while young, Karra was extremely shy when she came to us. Gradually, with kindness, patience and gentle handling by staff and volunteers, she has become more relaxed and social. She loves spending time with people and playing in the yard. In new situations, however, she can still become fearful, so she needs a gentle owner with the patience to teach her about the world and to help build her self-confidence. She still doesnt like fast, unexpected movements and quick grabbing makes her uncomfortable, so we recommend that she not live with young children. Young kids can act unpredictably and often lack the maturity to recognize a dogs signals that he is feeling fearful or uncomfortable.Karra has been up at the front desk for a few hours at a time and was quiet, well-behaved, housebroken and okay around our office cat. She did live with another dog for about 7 months and did well with him. However, here at the shelter, when another dog played too roughly with her, she reacted negatively out of fear. Karra has been spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, and negative for heartworm. Karra is a special girl who just needs an understanding person and a loving home to help her blossom and thrive.",

I've had a bit of a rough life and a kind samaritan found me wandering the streets of Apopka---and boy oh boy am I happy she saw me and opened her heart and car door to me...I was really getting tired and hot and I was all alone. You see, I am vision impaired ( and my foster mom thinks I am deaf too but I could swear I hear her when she unwraps cheese...yummmm...since I only weigh about 27 lbs she lets me have all the treats I want- she says I'm a skinny mini) and although that doesn't stop me one bit it's a little challenging trying to side-step cars whistling by---it was scary!!! All I know is that that is all behind me now and I am looking to settle down with someone that will appreciate my handsome features and my winsome ways---my foster mom says I am a really good boy!!! I get along great with other dogs and like head rubs, I enjoy a fluffy bed, soft treats and long afternoon naps.

I\u2019m missing a lot of teeth, (which is why my tongue sticks out). I was a stray for a long time and ate a lot of things I shouldn\u2019t (like rocks) which resulted in a lot of missing, fractured and impacted teeth. But, I\u2019ve recently had multiple dental surgeries to fix all that! What I lack in teeth, I make up for in personality. I\u2019m a total goofball and love to play and cuddle with my humans. I am house trained and crate trained. I really enjoy going on long walks/hikes but would love cuddling up on the couch with you even more. If you\u2019re looking for an awesome companion, and don\u2019t mind a little slobber, I\u2019m your guy!\n\nPACA is a foster based rescue with no shelter to view our dogs.

I came to SPCA Florida in 2019 and just recently came back, so I am still adjusting to my new surroundings. I would do best in a home without other pets or young children (16+). My previous owner described me as obedient and house-trained. I'm fairly high energy but after a good run around the yard I am ready to relax! I can be a little uneasy around strangers or loud noises (thunder, vacuum,etc) so I need someone to go slow with me. If you're looking for a loyal, cute new buddy call (863)577-4615 and ask for Scooby Doo!",

            "description": "FOSTER NEEDED\n\nWe are in search of a special foster for our very special boy Bernard.   Bernard is a rottie mix.  He came to us as a stray, found wandering the streets of Harrisburg.  He was a very skinny fella and a bit unsure of himself.   After providing Bernard lots of love and vet care, he was ready for adoption.  \n\nUnfortunately, we let him down.  He was in the home for two hours, being stressed out and not able to decompress, he was pushed and there was a bite incident.   The person sought medical treatment and said that she wanted to pursue dangerous dog charges.   We are appealing these charges, but Bernard sits in his kennel day after day just waiting with no clue of what is going on.  He is stressed and licking his leg to the point of sores.  It breaks all of our hearts to see him in that condition.  Bernard also suffers from allergies and is showing signs of hip dysplasia.   All vet care would be covered by CRCPA.\n\nBernard needs a local family that understands the breed and willing to abide by a few stipulations.   Bernard, or Big Bernie, or Nardi, as some of the volunteers call him, would love a quiet home without kitties or children and located in the country.  Bernard is good with most dogs, so another canine may be okay.  \n\nDo you have room in your home and heart for our Big Bernie?  If so, please email the pet placement team at adopt@crcpa.org or call 717-232-1644 and leave a message.",

            "description": "Meet Molly.  Molly is a one year old terrier mix from our shelter partner in Louisiana.  Molly does not like to share her food, after being homeless.  She will require eating separately from other pups in her home.\n\nMolly enjoys being affectionate with her people, but requires time to warm up.  No one likes people they don\u2019t know in their face.. and neither does Molly.  She prefers getting to know you well before she will give her affection.   Just like everyone, she has her limits on how much affection she is willing to give.  \nMolly is athletic and will need lots of exercise to keep her happy and stimulated.  She would prefer a home with a fenced in yard where she can have some independent time on her own.  Just like every girl needs alone time, Molly is no exception.  She will choose to spend time alone on her doggie bed chewing on one of her toys or nylah bones.  She would prefer to be left alone during this time.  \n\nMolly is looking for an understanding family with bully breed experience that is willing to continue her training.   She has resource guarding issues with her food, she will require eating separately.   She is a very loving girl that has soo much to give the right family.  She would prefer a home without children, as they might not respect her boundaries.   \n\n\nAdoption fees cover age specific vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip, heartworm/lyme/ehrlichia test, worming and transport fees. \n\nAdoption fees: \nThrough 6 months of age $450; \n7 months to through 5 years $400; \n6 years and under 9 years $325: bonded pairs are $500; \n9 years and older $250: bonded pairs are $300 \n\nFOR PUPPIES: PLEASE READ!!\nHomes considering Puppies must be prepared for:\nFlexible Schedules for Potty Training. Puppies can only hold urine for one hour per month of age. Crate Training for the next 10 months to keep them safe from chewing on everything in your home. Supervision with Children and Obedience training. \nSocialization; both with new people, children and other dogs outside of the home.\nHomes that want a well behaved dog, must be prepared to put the time, effort and costs associated to train a puppy. Well behaved dogs are not born, they are trained!  Please do not apply for a puppy if you cannot or do not have the time for a puppy.\n\nAlmost Home Rescue of New England is a 501 c 3 non-profit rescue; rescuing dogs since 2005. All Adoption applications are completed on line at www.almosthomerescue.net \n\nThis dog is available unless it is marked as Pending, meaning Pending Adoption. This dog is in foster care locally, ONLY if Maine or New Hampshire is listed next to the dogs name; otherwise, the dog is still waiting with our partner rescue for an adoption or foster home in New England. \n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior dogs have a history of being kept up to date on rabies and distemper, have had annual heartworm tests, and are on heartworm preventative at least 6 months of the year. Current pets must by spayed/neutered. \n\nImported dogs are transported on a USDA approved transport with a Health Certificate. All imported dogs are quarantined 14 days prior to getting on transport.\n\n",

Most likely he lived outside his entire life . He was brought to us right away and began treatment for his Bronchitis . The vet believes he\u2019s around 8 years old Since then, he has put on weight , and the meds helped his lungs . He can see,  , though his vision has some limitations.  He is great with the other dogs , but definitely has a  prey  drive,  so no cats !   He\u2019s doing better with the house training but still will have an accident . Someone who is home most of the time will be best  for him, to let him out as needed .  \nSoon he will be ready to go to his forever family",

            "description": "PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE BIO ON THIS DOG BEFORE REQUESTING AN APPLICATION.  MANY OF OUR DOGS HAVE STRICT REQUIREMENTS FOR THEIR ADOPTION.\n\nMidna is a 4 year old female Lab/pointer mix, about 45 pounds. Midna can be a bit of an introvert and prefers spending time at home with her family. Midna loves cuddling with her people when she gets to be on the couch or the bed and will let you know when she wants to play.\nMidna is potty trained and will stand at the back door when she needs to go out. She is crate trained and does well in the crate when left alone during the work day. She is great with people, but will bark at strangers until she gets the chance to meet them.\nWould do best in a home as an only dog or with a low energy or large senior dog who will give her space. NO SMALL DOGS as her prey drive is solid and no cats. Midna is reactive toward other dogs on walks and will need an adopter that has experience with reactive dogs or is willing to learn or train with her. \nShe can be energetic and needs exercise and structure to keep her happiest. Midna walks well on the leash and keeps excellent pace as a running partner. If you are looking for an adventure buddy, Midna also loves going on quiet hikes and walks and rides really well in the car.\nShe knows some commands and is very eager to learn new things. Would do best in a home with a solid fence and kids over ten years old. She was an owner surrender.\n\nAdoption contract and fee applies.  All adoptable dogs can be met at adoption events hosted every weekend. For a list of scheduled events go to: https://www.facebook.com/SmidgetRescue/events .  Smidget Rescue is not a shelter, and dogs cannot be seen at the Rescue location. All dogs are fostered throughout the Puget Sound area and are brought to the events where they can be met by prospective adopters. Additional pictures of adoptable dogs can be seen at: https://www.facebook.com/SmidgetRescue/photos_stream?tab=photos_albums.   All adoptable dogs are spayed or neutered at 6 months of age or older, and always before being placed in their new homes.  APPLICATIONS CAN BE OBTAINED BY EMAIL ONLY. Adoption process includes application, meet & greet, home visit and reference check. Email Jamie at smidgetrescue@hotmail.com or click on the CONTACT link on this page.  PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS BEFORE SENDING.  We get a fair number of incorrect emails and Jamie is not able to contact potential adopters.  Notice:  We do not ship dogs out of state.  If you live within a five-hour radius of Seattle, WA, (such as Portland, Vancouver B.C., etc.), we can arrange for a home visit.  If your home seems like a great fit for the dog you would like to adopt, you must then drive to meet the dog at one of our weekend events or at the fosters home.\n\n\n",

She greets everyone with a happy smile and a tail wag, and immediately launches into her signature full body lean when a person is nearby. She loves to walk on leash and does so beautifully, however, she is a very large dog and can pull hard if she sees something she wants to investigate. Bianca is not a huge fan of cats and dogs, and would much prefer to be the queen of the household. If you are interested in meeting Bianca, please fill out an adoption application (no obligation) online at www.satchelslastresort.org, and an adoptions counselor will be in touch.",

My name is Noodle, and I am a happy-go-lucky sweetheart who is ready for a lifetime of fun! I'm an energetic guy who would do well with an active family that also understands I am recovering from major leg surgeries and will make sure I don't overdo it. You see, I was hit by a car and have been on crate rest the past three months while I recovered from my surgeries. I am doing very well and healing nicely; my foster mom will be happy to explain about my recovery in further detail. I love to be outside and would appreciate a fenced yard at my forever home. I'm dog friendly and can be a bit excited when meeting new canine pals so I would do well with slow introductions to make sure our energies mesh. I love everyone I meet and my favorite activity is being near my people, but because I have puppyish excitement and manners (I am working on my mouthiness and bounciness) I would do best in a home without children. Speaking of manners, I need a family who will be committed to working with me on training to catch up on the stuff I haven't been able to learn yet because of my injuries and recovery. I'm a smart boy who is eager to please, so I bet we will be class valedictorians in no time! I am soooo excited to start my new, healthy life and I hope you are ready for lots of love and fun! \n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS, NO EXCEPTIONS:\n*ADOPTION FEE: $300\n*Be at least 21 years of age\n*Live in a 50-mile radius of Itasca, within the Illinois border\n*Have the knowledge and agreement of all adults living in the household\n*Have approval from owner of residence (written in lease)\n*Have a valid ID with current address (please provide proof of address if ID address is not up-to-date)\n*Be approved as a suitable adoptive home by Fetching Tails Foundation\n*Be prepared to make a lifetime commitment",

            "description": "This litter of little soda pops is hoping to fizz into a wonderful family.\n\nWith a guesstimated birthday in June 2020, these pups will weigh under 15 lb. \n\nMello is a sweet boy who loves his people - once he warms up to them.  He's suspicious of strangers and timid in new situations, so should be taken out in public to learn that new sights, scents, sounds, and strangers are curious rather than scary.  He's house-trained when kept on a regular schedule (currently every other hour).\n\nMello enjoys adventures and sniff walks as well as playing with polite doggy friends.  He's leash savvy and is comfy in a 36\" crate, which allows him room to sprawl and stretch out.  He will growl and snap at other dogs if they approach his food, so should be fed separately.  Considering they were left outside to fend for themselves at birth, this is understandable.  His foster feeds him in his crate.\n\nApril 2020:  We are not holding public adoption events at this time.  Qualified families are being invited to appointments to meet specific dogs.  There are currently no opportunities to view multiple dogs and adoption events aren't being held at Tractor Supply in Lenoir.\n\nWhether dogs / puppies come in as strays or owner surrenders, we usually have to make our best guess as to birthdate and breed.   \n\nIf adopted into a home with other animals, particularly cats, your new pet should be crated or secured when you're not available to supervise to insure a harmonious relationship.  \n\nA vet reference is required to confirm responsible pet ownership.  We suggest first time pet owners look for an adult dog for companionship and to gain experience through another rescue or your local government-run animal control..\n\nAdoption fee covers two vaccinations plus spay / neuter if using our local low-cost spay/neuter clinic (overnight stay required) and surgery occurs as agreed upon in the adoption contract.  Convenience fee equal to refundable spay/neuter deposit may be added if using our veterinarian.  Additional fees for 3rd puppy vaccination, refundable spay/neuter deposit, etc. may apply.  \n\nWe are an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue.  We receive no funding from agencies.  Available animals can be seen most Saturdays at Tractor Supply in Lenoir from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  We recommend interested parties contact us to pre-qualify for adoption so their new furry family can go home once paperwork is complete.  Fees are required in cash.  For more information on our organization, our website is www.petpartnersrescue.org.",

They are bonded senior ladies looking for a home to spoil and love them. These sweet ladies are avid snugglers and insist upon a lap while you are watching tv and at night love cuddles under the blankets. Pearl and Diamond are both on a daily joint supplement as one of them does have luxating patellas, currently she isn't painful but may be in the future. The ladies are beyond sweet and enjoy their person's company. Both ladies enjoy car rides and currently go everywhere with their foster mom. They especially like when they get pup cups at Starbucks. Both ladies are very easy going. They enjoy the back yard and exploring. While not at home their foster mom pens them and they do well. Due to their teeth they are currently on a soft foods diet. Both have lost some weight since arriving to Heartland, which is much better for their joints. \n\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm tested negative (age 7 months and older) and microchipped. A senior dog's bonded pair adoption fee is $200. There is a $5 fee for credit/debit cards.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please fill out an online application here: www.heartlandsmallanimalrescue.org/canine-application.html",

BLUE\u2013 Dogs in the BLUE category will need experienced adopters. Ideally, adopters of dogs in the BLUE category will be knowledgeable in the area(s) the dog will be challenging; therefore, adopters should be willing to participate in a training plan to further the work staff and volunteers already have started\n\nDogs are assigned to color categories using any previous owner notes, general handling, as well as staff and volunteer observations. As we continue to get to know the dogs and gather further insights into their personalities, colors may be adjusted accordingly.\n\nRancho Coastal Humane Society remains temporarily closed to the general public, but we have companion animals in our care that are ready for adoption BY APPOINTMENT ONLY, and our staff is ready to make that happen! Please visit our website for updates and more information. Thank you for your interest. \n\nAdoption Hours: Wednesday\u2013Monday; 11 AM to 4:30 PM  (Closed Tuesdays)\n\nAddress: 389 Requeza Street, Encinitas, CA 92024",

Jenny's foster mom reports that she is playful, affectionate, social, curious and good on a leash! She loves walks and snuggling! She also reports that Jenny has a very even temperament and energy level for a pup her age.  Jenny is about a year and a half and was rescued from a shelter along with her 4 month old pup. She is now spayed and is also house trained and crate trained. Like with every dog we recommend following a two week shutdown to help ensure success in your adoption. \n\nJenny has been vet checked, is UTD on shots, dewormed with Drontal, on Heartgard and Flea/Tick Prevention. She is also microchipped. \n\nIf interested in applying to adopt with us please fill out an application and one of our application processors will contact you as soon as possible. We appreciate your patience.\nhttps://goo.gl/AzrASu\n\nThank you for saving a life by choosing to adopt :)",

She enjoys her walks and is also happy to just chill in the shade.  She will learn to get along with some dogs, but she would probably prefer to be the only dog in her family.\nPlease come meet Destiny.  She is a sweet girl who just wants love.",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Beauty and I am about 7 years old, a bigger gal (shhh... about 34 pounds). I am a casual and low-key girl, looking for a home to spend my days relaxing and chilling with my people. Wherever I live, I might need to be the only dog, or be with very laid back others, and I will do just fine! I am very submissive with my people, and I live to please! I do well in a large crate if I need to be home alone. I had surgery to repair one of my hind legs and because of arthritis in that leg, I am not the kind to go for \"long walks on the 'beach'\" (er, I guess since this is Texas, it would be the sidewalk!), and I don't care for stairs or hard floors that might be slippery, but I make up for my special requests in my cuteness and great companionship! I can't jump up on furniture or get off of the couch if you have helped me up to lay with you. I do well in the car if you ever wanna take me places, though! I am on daily eye drops and also take CBD oil for my arthritis. I also have a habit now of walking on three legs as my one leg with arthritis hurts me from time to time. My medications run about $80 to $100 per month. I would love to find a home where my person or people are home a lot or can take me places with them. My adoption fee is $275. NEEDS TO BE AN ONLY DOG AND NO YOUNG CHILDREN.If you are interested in any of our Boston Terriers or would like to be eligible to adopt a Boston Terrier through our rescue in the future, please fill out an application. It can be found at www.texasbostons.com. Click on the Rescue tab and then on the Adopt Now! tab. Here you will find our adoption requirements along with a link for an online adoption application.

When it comes to showering her trusted friends with affection, there is no compare! Empress loves to snuggle into your leg, and would climb into your lap if more easily permitted (she's 62 pounds!) Always offering a toy to her human friends (she always has a stuffed animal in her mouth) as a sign of trust, she melts hearts with her gifts. If you're ever looking to say \"Hello,\" Empress spends most of the day snoozing in the Manager's office, or trying to get the staff to sneak her a secret lunch. \n\nShe is the idyllic partner for any family without children or other animals, who shares in her active lifestyle! Empress also loves learning new games and cues, so obedience-savvy adopters are idyllic for her, too. Due to a generous donation, her adoption fee has been covered already; so all she needs now is a home to call her own! If you're interested in this cutie, you must click \"Apply for Adoption\" to submit an online application.\n\nIf you're viewing this animal on Petfinder, please visit the animal's page on Bideawee.org and click on the \"Apply for Adoption\" button to submit an adoption application!",

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out our dog adoption questionnaire and e-mail it to adoptioncenter@homewardtrails.org\n\nDue to COVID-19 precautions, all animals for adoption through Homeward Trails can be met by appointment only. You can make an appointment to meet available dogs at our ADOPTION CENTER by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet and available cats at MEOW PALACE by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet1. \n\nFor animals in FOSTER homes, please submit an online application and an adoption team will reply with next steps. We thank you for your patience as we work to keep saving lives during this difficult time.\n\nPLEASE VISIT THIS WEBSITE TO FIND THE ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE: http://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-forms/\n\nRocky is a big boy with a lot of love to give. He loves to play fetch, loves treats and is happy for a kind word and a pet. Rocky endured neglect and mistreatment; he spent much of his life on a chain and then was at a rural shelter for over a year, before arriving at Homeward Trails. \n\nLike his namesake, years of hard knocks haven't kept Rocky down. Soon after moving into a foster home, his playful side emerged and he earned himself the nickname of \"Butt Wiggles\" for the excited, happy display he puts on when he greets his favorite humans in the morning. He has returned to the adoption center and is working with our behavior team. \n\nRocky is super sweet and affectionate but he is fearful of new people and loud noises. It takes him a little time to trust new people and he'll need help getting more comfortable with urban noises. He is making progress and he is looking for a loving home with a family open to helping him on this journey. \n\nHe will be happiest in an adult only home and as the only pet. Rocky gets nervous when other dogs get into his space so he will do best in a home as an only dog. He would LOVE a nice tall fenced yard to play in. Rocky is very athletic and can jump over a 6 1/2 foot fence! \n\nHe is ready for his second chance and looking for a loving home. Please reach out to make a VIP appointment during the week to meet him!\n\nRocky is part of the Go Fetch Program! His adoption fee is waived and he comes with free bonus items when adopted!\n\nAdoption Coordinator: Adoption Center Staff\nBreed Estimate: Hound\nGender: Male\nApproximate weight: 84 lbs\nApproximate age: 6.5 years\nLocation: Adoption Center\nCrate trained: Yes\nCoat Type: Short\nPersonality: Sweet boy \n\nINCLUDES spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\nWe also provide free online workshop with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria/Falls Church/DC area. Start your new dog out on the right foot with this valuable, expert guidance FREE!\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program",

She arrived to us terrified of just about everything and has been placed for several months in a foster home with several other dogs. She made huge progress, and is a happy and sweet cuddly girl when she is with her people, but if someone new walks into the room she is in, she will go hide in her crate. \nWe are willing to go for a long term foster, or foster to adopt, to leave her time to adapt to her new surroundings and her new family. She cannot stay where she currently is because they have too many pets to take care of. \nShe is very gentle with older dogs, would do wonderful with a person or a couple who will give her time to come out of her shell. \nTo adopt or foster, please submit a fully completed application on our website at www.nalasrescue.org/adoption-application.\nWe are located in Palm City, FL and we adopt mostly in a 30 miles radius. We always do home visit, and personalized meet and greet, to insure that your new companion will be a great match for your family.\n\n\n",

But as soon as she knows and trusts her people, she is a very cuddly and happy dog. She needs a very quiet home, 1 person or 2, without many visitors, and a fenced yard so she can play and exercise. It will take weeks or months before she is able to walk on a leash in the streets.  Penny is very happy to share her space with other dogs, and most likely cats",

Although Bentley is 11 years old he acts more like a 5 year old and has the energy of a younger boy. Bentley has been indulged and looooves to play with toys- his owner sent a bagful! Also, he enjoys being with other dogs but is quite independent minded and will counter surf if given the opportunity- he is very food motivated. Mr Bentley could stand to lose a few pounds but as you can see from his pictures he is quite the handsome boy...and he is housetrained too!

            "description": "Chico is 13 yrs old.  He loves adults.  His behaviour has changed and his foster parents see him getting along with other dogs at a distance. so him being the only dog in the family may be a good idea. He does have a loving side to him.  He loves being cuddled. The food is the point when he gets aggressive. The foster parents say he sleeps with other dogs on the bed.\n\n\nIf the animal is under the age of 3 years old or has health issues, a vet reference is required which means you must own a pet or have owned a pet in your name.\n\nAdoption fee of $250 covers all vetting including spay/neuter surgery, vaccines, microchip heartworm test and treatment if needed and any other medical that may be required while in rescue. \n\nWe only do adoptions on Saturday and not all animals are able to attend so if you would like to see a specific animal please let us know so that we can make arrangements for it to be present at the event. Event locations do vary so please check the homepage to find out where we will be this week. Please do not ask us to reduce adoption fees since all fees help us to cover medical expenses for all of our animals, some of which can be very expensive.  Saving lives is not cheap so thank you for your understanding and helping us save as many as possible.\n\nPlease email lowcountryanimalrescue@ymail.com for an application.",

She was found wandering the streets of Puerto Rico along with another dog who looked identical and appeared to be her sister. One of our wonderful volunteers took them in to foster until they could make their way to safety with us. Well when Luna arrived we noticed her belly looked a little too big and sent her for an xray where we found out she had 9 babies inside! She gave birth to 9 beautiful pups in a loving foster home and was an amazing mama.\nIt is now her turn for her forever home. Luna is quite young still, probably about two years old and since she most likely grew up in the streets she very much needs some guidance and leadership. She is an extremely loving, sweet girl but can also be pushy and try to push the limits, so she will need a strong leader who will be committed to her continued training and socialization. She has been in training with an amazing training team who has offered to do a couple free sessions for the new adopter! Doberman experience preferred.",

You will always be able to see a difference in the leg, but clearly it does not hold him back from doing his thing.  He is now about 7 months old, weighs about 40 lbs, is likely a bird dog/catttle dog mix.  He loves other dogs and is fantastic with older people, teenagers and up.  He has not been around young children and is honestly afraid of them.  He does have all the puppy energy you might find in a 6-12 month old if his breed mix, so he would do best with active owners and he would love nothing more than to have a canine playmate.  He has lived in a multi dog household, has been crate trained and rides well in the car.  \nAlso, because this is important...Calico Jack's super power is his stink eye.  He will literally always look at you like you just made the most ridiculous statement....and who knows....maybe you did!!!!  But he loves you none the less, because his other super power is absolute sweetness.   \n\nCalico is up to date on shots and preventatives and is microchipped.  His adoption fee is $250 plus any additional donation you feel appropriate.  Our adoption fee is set to a level to make adoptions happen.  They do not cover our costs. Thank you for your generosity and interest in our dogs!   \n\nAll dogs adopted locally through SGDR receive a free six-week session of obedience classes and a lifetime of behavior support through our Project REWARD program with trainer Charlotte Blake.\n\nYou must have an approved application before being able to visit a dog. Visit our website below for an adoption application https://www.snootygiggles.com/dog-application/\n\nIf you expect to leave the dog alone for long periods of time, please do not consider adopting a puppy.  Puppies need lots of attention and companionship.  Thanks.\n\nAll known information about the animal is listed above. We do our best to give accurate information, but most of our dogs are rescues and do not come with a known history.",

The gals at ARFhouse found me roaming around near the property; that happens a lot, people dumping their dogs near the rescue. I hopped right in the car and made myself at home here at the sanctuary. \n\nI am a really cool dude; I seem to get along with everyone and I love to play!! I am goofy and will keep you laughing all day long. I need a fenced yard to run and play, and I would love a four-legged companion, but that's not a must! All I really want is a family of my own. \n\nThe fee to adopt Buddy is $200.00; this includes spay/neuter, deworming, vaccinations and a microchip. If you are interested in adopting Buddy, please visit our website. www.arfhouse.org and fill out an adoption application. \n\n**Please Note: Buddy is currently located at our facility in Sherman, Texas. Adoptions are by-appointment only; if you would like to meet Buddy, please fill out an application on our website. If approved, we will contact you within 48 hours to set up a time to meet Buddy.",

            "description": "This handsome young fellow is Bolt, a 1 year old, 50 pound Husky mix with stunning blue eyes and fur as soft as a bunny's.  Bolt is deaf and navigates his world relying mostly on visual cues and his superior sense of smell. He is a confident and curious boy ready for any adventure you may undertake. He is a quick and eager learner and is highly motivated to understand his people and what they want to communicate to him. He has learned to pay close attention to hands and body language and has mastered many hand signals for polite doggy behavior.  Some of the hand signs he knows are: sit, down, wait, shake paw, touch,  go out, go in, look at me, put the ball in my hand, come here, and good boy!  Bolt loves to learn new tricks and would catch on quickly to any organized dog activity, such as agility or nose work, that you may want to explore.\n\nBolt has been in his foster home for the last 2 months and has been a model houseguest. \n\nHe is crate trained and sometimes chooses to take naps in or just hang out in his kitchen crate when everyone is in the room.  He sleeps comfortably through the night in his bedroom crate.\n\nHe is very reliably house trained and will wait by the door to be let outside.\n\nHe is affectionate but not needy or clingy. He loves to have his face and ears rubbed and can be instantly calmed, almost hypnotized, by ear rubs and shoulder and chest rubs.\n\nHe likes other similarly-sized dogs and really enjoys living with his resident foster brother. We think he'll do best in a home with another dog since he thrives when he has a companion dog near him.  \n\nHe has a medium energy level and enjoys fast trail runs, mountainous hikes, and long, sniffing walks and is learning to appreciate a good game of fetch. When he's not enjoying his outdoor fun he is happy to nap or watch out the window at the birds in the trees and the people walking in the neighborhood. Anytime after 6:00 pm he can be found curled up in a little white ball, asleep, until it's time for bed.\n\nHe has an intuitive sense of what is an appropriate object to play with or chew (dog toys) and what not to touch (shoes, furniture).\n\nHe likes meeting new people and is especially attracted to children, who seem to find him very interesting as well. He enjoys meeting them on walks and will sit politely to receive treats from them.\n\nBecause he may find them a little too compelling, Bolt would be best suited in a home without small animals, including dogs and cats.\n\nBringing a deaf dog into your life may seem like a challenge, but it's mostly just a matter of getting used to relying on other ways to communicate without sound.  We use verbal language with our dogs almost exclusively and it can get a little wordy and unclear sometimes. Communicating with a deaf dog keeps your signals more concise and clear and more consistent. Bolt is so eager to learn and understand what you want that his enthusiasm is contagious. Learning new things is his favorite game and will soon become yours, too.  Additional benefits of having a deaf dog include no distractions or drama from barking dogs, postal carriers and delivery trucks, thunder, fireworks, fire and ambulance sirens, doorbells, vacuums, howling cats and so much more.\n\nBolt is such a nifty fellow and is so ready to be someone's best friend and adventure partner.  If you want to see more of Bolt's daily life he can be found on Instagram @SoCok9fostermom \n\nPlease read up on the Husky breeds and on deaf dogs' needs (https://deafdogsrock.com/ is a good place to start) as Bolt will be placed only in a home who has breed experience or is willing to do the research and understand the needs of a typical Husky and deaf dogs in general and is willing to train, socialize, and keep him both mentally and physically active.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this handsome boy, please submit an adoption application online. https://www.rocketdogrescue.org/adopt/adoption-application/. A volunteer will contact you.

Adopters must complete an agreement (http://www.rocketdogrescue.org/adopt/adoption-application/) and a personal interview prior to adopting a Rocket Dog. There is a non-refundable $280.00 adoption fee which helps us defer the cost of spay/neutering, vaccinations and microchipping.\nhttp://www.rocketdogrescue.org\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Rocket.Dog.Rescue\nhttp://www.petfinder.com/shelters/CA534.html",

He is easy-going, fine with other dogs, super cute and unique looking. Sometimes Clifford cries softly to get our attention. Clifford will need a home without cats.\n\nHe loves his daily walks and will as always invert for belly rubs. We think Clifford is a hound/husky mix and he is probably 2-3 years old.  Like so many dogs this year he was Heartworm positive, but he has completed treatment is healthy and ready to go to his forever home!\n\nClifford is neutered, microchipped, vaccinated and up to date on heartworm and flea/tick preventative.  Our $300 adoption fee helps cover these expenses.\n\n",

I am a BIG boy with a BIG personality! I get along well with other dogs, love to play and I LOVE water!! I will need a large, fenced yard to run and play all day; I would not thrive in an apartment. \n\nThe fee to adopt Jagger is $200.00; this includes spay/neuter, deworming, vaccinations and a microchip. If you are interested in adopting Jagger, please visit our website. www.arfhouse.org and fill out an adoption application. \n\n**Please Note: Jagger is currently located at our facility in Sherman, Texas.

He is dog friendly as well.  Ryder is learning crate manners and is getting better every day. His foster mom is working on leash manners as well. Ryder has a very sweet and submissive personality.  Don't let this fool you though, he can still be very stubborn.  With continued training, he is going to be a great dog! Ryder has been great with people & kids of all ages. \n\nPlease note:  Ryder has shown signs of resource guarding while in his kennel with his toys and food around animals only.  Ryder has growled at the dogs when they walk by and he has his goods.  Foster mom is able to take away food, toys and things he shouldn't have just fine.  With professional training (required for all adoptions) he will be a great boy. \n\nApply here: www.4pitssakerescue.com",

EMAIL ONLY.\n\nMEET SCRAPPY! - AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION\n\nArrghh Matey! It's me, Scrappy! I've recently become a one eyed pirate and am looking for a family to give me a loving home for my golden years! \n\nScrappy joined our rescue end of August 2020 and is at least 10 years old & 20 lbs. He has multiple health issues but is a tough cookie! He was surrendered to a rural Texas shelter and flown to Idaho via Dog is my Copilot. He arrived with poor eyes that were clearly infected and one was bulging and very painful, he also has a heart murmur and skin issues with thin fur. We believe him to be an affenpinscher mix. \n\nScrappy was neutered and had an single enucleation (eye removal) surgery Sep 21, 2020, his heart did well under anesthesia! \n\nScrappy is looking for a calm home to retire in, full of love and ideally with a yard to explore! Scrappy does well with other dogs, has not been tested with cats. He would do best in a home without children as he is adjusting to life with one eye and could be startled by children's loud noises and quick movements. \n\nCharacteristics: one eyed, pirate, Sweetheart, heartthrob, gentle disposition, happy, \n\nBackground:  Pulled from Dallas Animal Services and joined our rescue August 22, 2020 via Dog is My Co-Pilot. Scrappy's surgery was sponsored by Stellas Shelter Fund. \n\nEMAIL US for an adoption application for Scrappy",

            "description": "Meet our handsome boy, Luke! Some might say his most distinguishing feature is the fact that he is three-legged, but we think it's his gorgeous smile. Being three-legged doesn't slow him down one bit; he loves exploring Long Island's beaches and racing around the Bideawee dog park! Lukey can be scared of strangers so it takes him a little time to warm up, but once he does, he's your friend for life! We think that Luke would flourish in a quiet home where it's just you and him. He bonds strongly to his person and wants to be your one and only. Once he feels safe with you, he quickly becomes a lap dog (just ask his favorite staff members and volunteers). He would do best with an experienced dog owner who is open to coming to visit him several times at the shelter so he can get to know you. Luke loves consistency and a routine, and we think he'll really thrive in the right home. Luke is a special boy who we have a real soft spot for because we know the companion he is capable of being if given the chance. Thanks to a generous donation, Luke's adoption fee has been covered; all he needs now is a home to call his own! If you're interested in this cutie, you must click \"Apply for Adoption\" to submit an online application.\n\nIf you're viewing this animal on Petfinder, please visit the animal's page on Bideawee.org and click on the \"Apply for Adoption\" button to submit an adoption application!",

Every bit as sweet with his beloved friends as he is irresistible, he encompasses only the loveliest qualities. A man who loves to follow his nose, he is also known to take the trails of Westhampton by storm! Walks with his people pals through the woods are quite a cherished pastime for him. Now and again, he'll also happily trot around our Park as well, to stretch those long legs and sniff about. When not out and about, you can expect to find him having a snooze on the sofa, or enjoying a dessert of tasty cheese or chicken. JP is a snack connoisseur! He is seeking a patient, loving home, with older children and no other animals, that will help him to feel comfortable and safe, as we all deserve to. Thanks to a generous donation, his adoption fee has already been covered; all he needs now is a loving family! If you're interested in this cutie, you must click \"Apply for Adoption\" to submit an online application.\n\nIf you're viewing this animal on Petfinder, please visit the animal's page on Bideawee.org and click on the \"Apply for Adoption\" button to submit an adoption application!",

She's also good with kids over 8 years old!\n\nFor more info please email dogs@illinoisvalleyanimalrescue.net  or fill out the adoption application found at www.illinoisvalleyanimalrescue.net.  The application does not commit you to adopting, just helps us find the dog that is the right fit for your family. We do not have open adoption hours due to COVID-19 so an application must be submitted and approved before we set up an appointment for you to meet any of our dogs! It can take up to a week for the Adoption Board to review applications and upon approval will contact you.\n\nAdoption fees are $250 which includes spay or neuter, vaccines- rabies, distemper and bordotella, AVID microchip and county rabies tag.

Sadly but not surprisingly Willie is heartworm positive and we have started his treatment.  Today Willie is a happy boy who has a definite spring in  his step.  He loves everyone around him and seems to do well with other dogs with proper introductions.  Willie does not need much to make his life complete and will make a fabulous companion for someone who is looking for an easy going and fun senior dog who still has lots of spunk and play in his heart!",

            "description": "I want you to meet a VERY SPECIAL rescue. This is Annabelle. She is a ten month old, beautiful chocolate brindle, Terrier/Basenji X. First, you need to know how much she has overcome and has learned in a very short period of time. Annabelle came from an abandoned house with very little people contact and no other animal contact. Her paw was injured, had a deep laceration and she needed immediate surgery to fix her wound.  She was leary at first but welcomed the kind touch of a person. Despite this beginnings and uncertainty, she has blossomed! Annabelle is a typical puppy with lots of energy. She thrives on being allowed to run in a supervised, controlled environment and lots of positive feedback. She does need daily active playtime/exercise.  She responds very well to her name, treats and lots of love. Annabelle needs a large fenced in area and an active individua/ family. She is doing well on leash training as it is work in progress. She has shown no signs of aggression with our persona dogs and would do great with another young, energetic playful companion or in \"only dog home\".. Due to her size and activity level, no children under 12 years old.\n\nAnnabelle is spayed, up to date on rabies, distemper/parvo and bordetella vaccines, heartworm tested, (negative), dewormed, current on heartworm and flea/tick prevention, and microchipped. Her adoption fee is $300. \n\n\n you would like to be considered in adopting our pet(s), you must FIRST complete an adoption application. To submit an adoption application click on \"More About Us\", located on the right (bottom) of the page. This will route you to our home page where you select the \"Adoption Application\" tab located on right side of the page. The application will open in a \"WORD\" document format where you select \"enable editing\" on the top of the application, then complete the form and email to rhonda4care@gmail.com. Please make sure you answer all questions on the application. If you don't have WORD format, email rhondad4care@gmail.com and use \"adoption application\" in the subject line.\n\nWe are not a shelter. All of our animals live in private homes in foster care. Upon approval of your application, you will be contacted by the pet's foster parent to ask questions and to set up a time to meet the pet of interest.",

            "description": "JAMES - 6 years old, 55 pounds. Shy/reserved. Afraid of men, can be skittish with quick movement/loud noises. No other pets or young children.\n\nJames is a scared boy, and rightly so. He was abandoned by his owner, and then was in a situation where negative reinforcement training was employed. He then landed at VBACAC as a confused and shut down dog. But as he gets used to the faces he sees regularly, he has started to come out of his shell.\n\nUnderneath that nervous outer layer is a goofy, sweet boy! He is a decent size, sports a deep copper color, a cute underbite, and expressive brown eyes. When out in the yard with a familiar face, he shows that he is responsive to treats/food, and likes playing with toys! Throw a toy over his head, and he'll jump in the air before he realizes he can't reach it. Then he'll turn around and run after it. He loves to chase, but doesn't always bring the toy back, so it is good to have a couple toys handy to keep him engaged.\n\nJames is slow to warm-up to new people. Potential adopters should be prepared to have a prolonged meet and greet with James before he will approach them. He may require more than one meet and greet. It will also take time for James to get used to a whole new home and family. He will need his own safe space in your house that he can retreat to when scared. As he gets used to a new environment, he will come to you when he is comfortable. He would do better in a home that doesn't have frequent visitors as this is likely to cause him some stress. He is afraid of men. Small kids will also likely scare him as they can be loud and move too fast for his liking.\n\nIf you're willing to give this sweet, scared boy a chance, call us at 385-4444 or go to our Facebook page and make an appointment to meet him! We are open daily except for Tuesday's. Thanks for choosing adoption",

Dallas does ask that she get yummy treats from new people before she invites them into her circle but the work is totally worth it! This lovely gal has been known to be a little protective of people she is bonded to so would need an understanding owner and some continued training once in her forever home. However, she totally loves people and enjoys going for hikes and lounging on the couch. She will match your energy for the day and just wants to be by your side. Please ask about Dallas today!",

She is so energetic and loves being outside! She has been through a lot, she needs someone who is patient and gentle, give her confidence and consistency. She loves cuddling on the couch. She absolutely adores car rides and hikes. she plays well with multiple toys and loves the color orange. She loves getting little training treats and is grasping commands such as (sit, wait/hold, lay down, and gentle). Dior would thrive in a home with NO other pets! Her current foster has smaller animals such as gerbils and reptiles, she has no issue with them in her space. But cats get her too overstimulated. If introduced properly and given the time she could live with one other dog her size, but that dog would also have to be submissive. Dior is potty trained as well as crate trained. She is a resource guard, but responds well to WEER DONE (with her attitude)! She is so sweet, she loves belly rubs. She loves kids. Loves walking in creeks, but does not like the hose. This princess can not wait find her family! Can you be my hero?

            "description": "Bruiser is a beautiful, approximately 3 year old mix who absolutely loves to play!  He is in a foster home and doing very well with the two dogs he resides with.  \n\nHe is fine tuning his manners, and can now sit for a very short period waiting for permission to eat.  \n\nHe has a little toy possessiveness, but he is doing so much better with this already in his foster home. They are patiently teaching him that although he has never had things like toys, it is ok to share them with other dogs and that everyone should take turns. He is doing very well, and a new adopter would need to continue this patient instruction with Bruiser, teaching him how to be a dog!\n\nBruiser is a very happy, 52 pound bundle of love. He enjoys lots of love and attention, and his favorite thing is snuggling on the couch with his human foster Dad! He definitely thinks he is a lap dog when it is time to cuddle.\n\nHe would do best with a fenced in yard or with someone that has plenty of time for long walks to help him get out his energy. He does have lots of energy!!\n\nInterested in adopting? Go on our website, triadspca.org and submit an application or call us at 336-375-3222.",

Visit our FAQ webpage for commonly asked questions about our adoption/foster process.\n\nDid I hear someone say ball?? Hi I'm Cliff but I am more use to being called Monty. I have a passion for balls, my favorite are the green tennis balls. I would love to have someone who would throw a ball or two for me in the yard. If you have a fenced yard better yet. I love playing but once I'm done I want that couch to snooze on.\n\nI'm looking for a home where I am the only pet. Young children wouldn't be br best as I get very excited and could knock them over. I love car rides and walks. I am strong though so make sure you can hold me if we come across other animals. I am up to date on vaccines, crate and house trained, microchipped and neutered.\n\nTake a chance on me and let me charm you! Looking for a forever or foster home. I cannot wait to meet you!\n\nIf you would like to meet me or adopt me please fill out an online application. Questions to my foster at cbrookszy@yahoo.com\n\nClick here to watch a video of Cliff - Ql Litter.Last Day Dog Rescue now microchips all animals before adoption. Microchips are implanted between the animals shoulder blades and are a permanent form of identification. The microchips are registered to Last Day Dog Rescue with the adopter's info added once adopted. If the animal is ever lost and slips his/her collar/tags the microchip allows the finder to know who to contact if scanned for a microchip. Animals MUST still have a collar with tags on at all times. Per our contract, we take all our animals back if for any reason you can't keep your adopted animal.\n\nPlease understand the statements about this animal are based upon the foster home's evaluation of the animal. The animal might behave differently (negatively or positively) in your home. While the animal might be good with the current foster's dogs, cats, children, etc., it may not be with your animal(s) or children. The animal may be housebroken or litter trained in the home of the foster but may relapse in your home. The animal is represented to the public as it performs in the foster home and any statements made regarding the animal are conditional to that foster home setting. Please understand that statements made regarding this animal are simply overviews and are not guaranteed.\n\nThe Petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our animals. Visual breed identification in animals is unreliable so for most of the animals we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each animal as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our animals based on personality, not by breed label.\n\nThank you for looking through our list of animals needing forever homes and choosing rescue first. We appreciate you stopping by.",

            "description": "Name: Hank\nSuspected Breed: German Shepherd Mix \nApproximate Age: 1-year-old\nApproximate Weight: 60lbs\nPersonality: loyal and playful \nObservations with Dogs: Reactive on leash, but has done well with other dogs with proper intro\nObservations with Cats: not good with cats\nObservations with Kids: Best in a home without children\nCurrently Living at: Foster Home in the DMV area\n\nCheck out my adoption video here: https://youtu.be/LX61iUsMziE\n\nHank is a handsome German Shepherd mix from South Carolina who is approximately 1 year old. At 60 lbs, he is smaller than most male German Shepherd dogs and we think that he's a mix. Hank finished 2 months of heartworm treatment and is ready to get back to business (aka playing). This fun-loving guy still has some puppy energy and absolutely adores playing fetch - any toy that you toss he will happily chase and bring back to you so you can throw it again and again. And again. And maybe one more time. He also loves chewing on bones and if you smear a little peanut butter on one... *chef's kiss*\n\nHank is a sweet boy and has a lot of love to give. He enjoys snuggling but sometimes he will use his charm and good looks to try to turn a cuddle session into playtime, which his foster finds hard to resist. During work hours he will sometimes press his forehead against your leg to ask for pets, and if you give in (editor's note: how could you not?) he will often flop over to encourage additional belly rubs. Mostly he is content to nap nearby as you work, although as soon as you get up from the desk he's checking to see if it's playtime again. Or snacktime. Either is cool with Hank.\n\nHank is a very smart boy who is eager to please his human. He responds very well to commands, although when he's excited it's a little harder for him to maintain his focus. Hank also learns new commands and tricks super quickly: he picked up \"\"paw\"\" in only one morning! His foster thinks that the sky's the limit with what you could teach this smarty-pants to do. After some time to adjust to a new home, Hank also does very well in his crate. He gets in willingly (excitedly, even, if treats are offered!) and will hang out quietly while you're at home or when you head out for a bit. He will sometimes choose to hang out in his crate even when the door is open, and you may even see him sitting in there quietly with his paws crossed ever so daintily - what a gentleman!\n\nHank's biggest challenge is his leash reactivity on walks. Currently, his foster uses tasty chicken pieces to distract him when he sees other dogs. It works pretty well, but Hank will need to work with a trainer to make sure his leash reactivity is managed over the long run. Hank has also displayed some protectiveness of his foster when people come over (which admittedly is less of a concern during COVID-19). DC Paws has a trainer who will be working with Hank and his foster on both of these issues, and we have confidence that his perfect person is out there and that Hank, with love, patience, and dedicated training, will be a truly wonderful dog.\n\nHe is very protective of \"\"his\"\" human and may lunge/bark at visitors and other people who enter the home. He is also sensitive to noise and frequently barks if he sees people in the hallway of a building or hears them walking by. For this reason, Hank would do best in a quiet home that is strongly committed to working with a professional trainer and who understands that he needs to be introduced to new people slowly. Hank will need help to learn that it's ok to have more than one human friend and he has been working with our trainer on this. He also will need lots of playtime and exercise - we have found that leashed walks are not enough for him and that he needs to get his heart rate up each day. With the right support, we believe that Hank will make a great family member and friend for a lucky adopter. \n\nSince Hank was previously treated for heartworm, he will need to be retested in 8-10 months to confirm his treatment was successful in eradicating all heartworms (treatment rarely fails). And like most shelter dogs, Hank may need a refresher on housetraining and crate training. We ask all of DC PAWS' fosters to work on both house and crate training with their foster dog.\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $350. If you are interested in adopting Hank, please submit an adoption application at http://dcpawsrescue.org/adoption-info/.ABOUT US & IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES:\n\nPlease note that you must use our official adoption application in order to be considered for adoption. Applying through other sites (i.e., Petfinder) will not work. The following are our applications:\n\nDog application: https://service.sheltermanager.com/asmservice?account=bg0781&method=online_form_html&formid=1\nCat application: https://service.sheltermanager.com/asmservice?account=bg0781&method=online_form_html&formid=6\n\nDC PAWS Rescue does our best to provide accurate and complete information about our adoptable animals. Please note that we cannot make any guarantees about age or breed; we rely upon our rescue partners and their veterinarians to make those assessments. We also cannot make any guarantees about housebreaking and animal temperament, as animals can behave differently through transition and in different environments.\n\nOur shelter partners provide a basic vet screening for each animal we rescue, which includes necessary vaccinations, deworming, microchipping, and spay/neuter (unless the animal is too young or otherwise deemed by the vet to not be a good candidate for surgery). Please note that this is not a comprehensive medical exam and as such, may not identify any and all medical issues, though our goal is to flag any obvious health issues through the basic vet screening. We share all medical records with adopters and are completely transparent about any known issues prior to adoption finalization. \n\nABOUT DC PAWS RESCUE\n\nOur rescue is an all-volunteer, foster-based dog and cat rescue in the DC area. We rescue locally from Prince Georges County, MD, and from rural shelters in the south (presently Pickens County, Anderson County, and Greenville County in SC, and Raleigh County, WV).\n\nWe partner with a local rescuer in Pickens County, SC, who saves adoptable cats and dogs from the three area shelters. For the animals in this rural area, rescue is a critical lifeline, and often the only lifeline. Our rescue partner not only works with DC PAWS to save as many dogs and cats as possible, but she has also established a successful spay/neuter program in the community to decrease the number of homeless and unwanted animals over the long term.\n\nFOSTER AN ANIMAL IN NEED\n\nFosters make it possible for DC PAWS to save and care for homeless, neglected and abandoned animals! To learn about fostering dogs or cats for DC PAWS Rescue, please visit: http://dcpawsrescue.org/volunteer/fostering/foster-application\n\nSPONSOR AN ANIMAL IN NEED\n\nFor any of our animals! Sponsors help us provide critical medical care, food, boarding, and other support for animals facing euthanasia. Individuals who sponsor a dog or cat receive special recognition on the animal's profile. Sponsorships can also be made in honor or memory of a loved one, and you may designate to whom DC PAWS Rescue should provide notice of your gift. Sponsorship levels of $250 and $150 include \"\"naming rights\"\" for a future dog or cat (respectively) that we rescue.\n\nTo learn more about sponsorship, please visit: http://dcpawsrescue.org/donate/",

            "description": "6 year old female Chihuahua mix, about 7 pounds. Ky was formally Pearl who was adopted out as a puppy. Hi! My name is Ky! I have some special needs but let me introduce myself first! I love my people. I want all of the attention that you can give me! I also love giving kisses and hugs. My favorite places to be are on the back of the couch, curled up under a blanket, or laying in the sun! The occasional toy is good fun too! Im currently being fostered with another small dog and a cat, I mostly ignore the cat, but I have tried to play with the dog on rare occasions! I can be a bit growly when the dog gets too close to my stuff, but it is mine after all! Im also good with kids, but only if they know how to treat me respectfully and move carefully so I dont get scared. Older children would be preferred. Im really just a happy and sweet little girl looking for a home. Unfortunately, I have narrowing discs in my spine that make me very sensitive to certain things like being picked up or squatting. I can also be a bit timid, especially around new people, and I may scream out and submissive pee in anticipation of pain. Currently, I am on pain meds that help me feel normal and let me do zoomies pain free! These will need to be given intermittently for a while, and my adopters will need to provide me with continued vet care for my condition. It takes a while to gain my trust, and certain actions like putting on my leash or my harness can make me feel tense and scared. Once you do gain my trust I will feel much more at ease. Im very adjusted to my foster home now but it can take some time before I settle in. The more I trust you, the better I will get, and the sooner I will blossom into the wonderful pup that I truly am! All that I ask is that my adopter is willing to give me lots of time, care, and love, because I really am a special little girl and my foster mom says that I deserve the best of the best!\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS FOR KY:\n\nNEEDS DAILY MEDS, POTENTIAL EXTRA VET CARE.\nNEEDS SOMEONE WITH PATIENCE WHO GIVE HER THE TIME AND SPACE SHE NEEDS TO SETTLE IN AND TRUST.\nOLDER CHILDREN OR ADULTS.\nNEEDS DOGS SMALLER THAN HER SO SHE WON'T GET HURT, OR NO DOGS AT ALL.",

No one ever came looking for me so now I am in the market for a new home. The nice man who found me says I can hang out with him until that happens. I like it here because I have 2 foster sisters that I love and he's really good to me. I am housebroken and crate trained. I stay there when we are home alone so I don't get in to mischief. I am still young and learning what is mine to chew on and what isn't. I am not a big fan of cats so none in my forever home. I like kids but probably older ones because of my size. As you can see in my pictures I am just a goofy boy looking for a break.\nIf you would like to meet me send an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back with you as soon as we can.\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting...neutering, all vaccinations, a heart worm test, deworming, flea prevention and a wellness exam",

Happy has been in and out of the shelter several times in his young life due to his humans\u2019 lack of experience and training...this is likely to be Happy\u2019s last chance.  If we can\u2019t find him a foster or adopter, there\u2019s a very good chance that he won\u2019t make it out of the shelter alive.  PLEASE READ ENTIRE CAPTION FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\n \nHappy has been wonderful with everyone at the shelter, but two of his previous families have stated that he can get protective of people in the family.  The families didn\u2019t know how to stop that kind of behavior, so they allowed it to continue unaddressed until they decided to dump Happy back at the shelter and now Happy\u2019s life is in the balance. \n \nHappy has never hurt anyone or even come close; he gets defensive and fearful so he just needs a patient, loving family willing to work on his confidence and socialization skills.  He doesn\u2019t deserve to languish away at a shelter until he\u2019s euthanized because his humans have failed him.\n \nAt this time, Happy needs to be the only animal.  He lived with a baby in his last home and did great with her, but she was one of the people that he was very protective over, so until he receives more structure and training, older children would be preferable.\n \nHappy is currently at Front Street Animal Shelter in Sacramento.  Approved fosters/adopters may have to provide transportation, but the shelter is willing to help in any way that they can to ensure Happy gets another chance at a long, HAPPY life.  Please help us rescue him before it\u2019s too late. \n\nPlease help us get sweet Happy into a safe, loving forever home!  If you're unable to help by adopting, sharing this post or donating is always appreciated.  Don't forget, Passion for Pitties is a 501(c)(3), so all donations are tax-deductible!\u2026every little bit helps!\n \nIf you would like to adopt loving Happy, please fill out an application at www.passionforpitties.com under the \u201cAdorable Adoptables\u201d heading.",

Some volunteers networked him to help him get seen and a volunteer for Pup Patrol offered to foster so we got him out! Rocco is around 2 years old and weighs a little over 50 lbs. He has undergone heart worm treatment and is  now healthy and ready to find his forever home! He is a pretty laid back dude for the most part, but he does suffer with containment phobia and hates to be crated. Currently his foster mom leaves him loose in the house while she\u2019s at work and although he likes to check out what\u2019s in the trash can, other than that he does fine. Rocco has been introduced to other dogs and really doesn\u2019t pay them much mind. He will be fine in a home as an only dog or with other doggy companions. No cats though...he is not a fan. Rocco is good with children although he doesn\u2019t respect their space and might knock little ones over. He has been working on his manners and will even sit and wait before going outside. He loves his walks and does pretty well on leash. He is a super sweet guy who loves attention and will whine to get it.\n\nIf you are interested in adding this pup to your family, please click here (or copy and paste https://www.dfwpuppatrol.com/info/adoption into your browser) to view our adoption info and where you will find the link to fill out our online Pre-Adoption Application.  Any questions can be directed to us at info@dfwpuppatrol.com.  All of our adoptable pups have a minimum requested adoption fee of $250 + tax  (pups 6 months and older) and $350  + tax (pups under 6 months old), regardless of our expenses, and it includes vaccinations, spay/neuter, heartworm test for pups 8 months and older, heartworm treatment if tested positive, deworming and/or fecal test, parasite treatment if tested positive, microchipping, any immediate known health issues, and pups 3 months and older are kept current on monthly heartworm prevention.\n\n INTERNAL\nPSTD 09/30/20 TSELF\nCNTC DFWPPR",

            "description": "Dory came to us after the hurricane from a Louisiana shelter. She has made so much progress and is ready for a place to call home. Dory is an 8 year old yorkie with special needs, so she will need an experienced adopter. She has type1 diabetes which is well controlled with a strict diet and Insulin injections twice a day. She is also heartworm positive but has already begun the process of slow kill treatment. She came to us weighing only 4lbs and is now up to 6lbs of pure sweetness! She also has cataracts and mild vision loss. Dory is potty pad trained but she will also do her business outside. She does well in a kennel, but truly prefers to be right next to her person at all times. A nice warm lap is her favorite place to be. \n\nALL adoptions require a completed application, vet check, home check and final contract.  The application to adopt can be found at www.camorescue.com.\n\nAdoption fees are variable. Up to date vaccines, microchip, spay/neuter are included in the fee.\n\nOnce your application has been approved, we will put you in touch with the foster to set up a  meet and greet. We are a foster based RESCUE, not a shelter. All of our dogs are in individual foster homes. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We select the best applicant for each dog, based on the dog's needs. \nFor the safety of our small breed dogs and based on our past experiences, we will not place our dogs in homes with large breed dogs.    \n\nCAMO rescue is a 501c3 whose primary focus is rescuing small dogs from the euthanasia list from high kill TX shelters.   \nEIN # is 46-5486022\nWe rescue 800+ animals a year.\n\nFollow us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/camorescue\n\nOur donation link is http://www.paypalme/camorescue \n\nWe are strictly volunteer based, no salaries are paid and 100% of donations go towards rescuing dogs.",

            "description": "*SPECIAL ADOPTION PROCEDURE* *6 FT FENCE REQUIRED* Birdie is considered to be a feral dog. Through the crucial developmental period she was not exposed to things that normal pet dogs get exposed to. She lived in an shed with other dogs and had very minimal exposure to humans other than feeding time. Here in the shelter she has found a couple people that she tolerates being around but has no real interest in interacting with them. She follows the lead of other calm, mature, stable minded dogs. Birdie can not go to a home with cats. Birdie's family should understand that she may never be a normal family pet and may never bond to the people around her. She will need time, patience, and working with her will be a very long, slow process. Working with feral dogs can be rewarding but can also be frustrating and requires great dedication. Birdie's potential family also needs to be aware that she may have an issue with her lower GI tract. Her foster mom found a food that is good for keeping Birdie's stool formed and she will need to stay on that food after she finds a home. She also needs frequent potty breaks. If she gets too excited when she hasn't been outside for a while she can't seem to be able to hold it all in! Otherwise, she is housebroken and has not had other accidents in the foster home. *Preferred: A secure 6 foot fence is a must as Birdie is a flight risk. Another calm dog in the house would be preferred to help Birdie adjust. A home with no children would be the most successful. Birdie would probably appreciate a family of homebody introverts who understand her personality! The Adoption Fee Includes: - initial canine distemper combination vaccination - first worming or stool check - rabies vaccination (for animals over 3 months of age) - AVID microchipping - flea treatment/preventative - spaying or neutering Adoption fee: $175.00 Per state law, ALL ADOPTERS must purchase a non-refundable 2021 dog license at time of adoption for any canine three months and older. The cost of the license is $7.00. (Senior Citizen or Person with Disability-$5.00) All dog adoptions come with free leash and collar.",

He was found abandoned hiding under a wood pile with his mom and litter mates, and was afraid at first.  He and his siblings quickly warmed up to their rescuer and they all love to play with each other and with their foster mom.  Tiny loves to snuggle beside his foster mom and watch television and when he gets tired he burrows under her comforter and lets out little sighs of comfort!   If you would like to meet Tiny, please text 778-896-1439  (preferred)  or call same number .... or email   cherrybim@shaw.ca",
