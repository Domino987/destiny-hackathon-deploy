I lived on scraps thrown to me by the homeless people who lived by the river. I was very scared but some nice people caught me and took me to their home. I saw the vet and got all of my shots and I was neutered (OUCH!) and microchipped. I had a very bad start but I am working on my personal skills. I am very afraid of men and people that I don't know. I love to play, get pets, snacks, and cuddle on the couch. I just want someone who will be my one and only. I'm good with other dogs. I like to chase squirrels, rabbits, and anything that thinks it is too fast for me to catch it. I like to smile when I'm happy to see you and I will wiggle and squirm. I lay down and sleep if I am kept in a crate even if I don't like it. Are you looking for a great hiking buddy? Can you give me the perfect couch to sleep on? If you think you have what it takes to be my perfect furever home, feel free to fill out an adoption application.\n\nAt Wags and Whisker's Pet Rescue:\n\nFor foster, rescue, or adoption: Call (530) 895-8888 or email info@wwprca.com\n\nVisit our websites:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/willowswagsandwhiskerschico/\n\nhttp://www.wagsandwhiskerspetrescue.com/\n\nhttps://www.petfinder.com/pet-search?shelter_id=CA2413\n\nhttp://www.adoptapet.com/adoption_rescue/91606.html\n\nhttp://instagram.com/wagsandwhiskerspetrescue",

One that took her spirit, one eye, and left her malnourished.  With the love of a very special foster couple, Irene has healed physically, but still bears some of the emotional scars of her abuse. \n\n She went from cowering in a corner to sitting on her foster dads lap for comfort.   She needs a very special home that will help her continue to flourish. \n\n She does need a buddy for support, so a calm pal would be ideal for her.  A very quiet home is a must.

            "description": "PATRICK: 9 months old, lab shepherd mix, 40 lbs (around 55 lbs full grown), NEEDS home out of the city\n\nHe doesn't make the most amazing first impression. On the street, he freaks out all over the place noises and commotion and, like, society in general scare him shitless. At home where he's comfy, he'll hide when you first walk in, he may bark once or twice, then he'll plaster himself to a wall and will only move sideways along it. It doesn't take Patrick long to warm up though. Give him an hour, maybe two, and he'll consider you his new BFF. This 1-year-old shepherd mix is a great big baby, but if you're patient, he's every minute worth it. It's not his fault he came from a hoarding situation in TN a few months ago where he and his litter mates barely had human contact and lived in decrepit filth. He's the shyest of the bunch and the last to find his forever family. Patrick is about 50 lbs, amazing with other dogs and cats, and loves to play fetch and leap through snow. He's a super snuggle muffin and totally gentle. He'll need lots of exercise and an experienced home out of the city with a confident doggy pal and a fenced yard.\n\nHis foster mom says: Patrick is a playful, fun-loving pup that would do very well in an active home that has some space for him to run around and expel all his puppy energy. He loves his toys and doing zoomies in the yard.Cuddle bug doesn't begin to describe this baby boy, so when not playing with his foster siblings, he is cuddling with his foster humans and pretty much wants to be on top of them wherever they are stationary.Patrick is still skittish and will hide around any people he doesn't know that are entering his space, but will warm up to anyone his humans welcome into the home consistently. He is a gentle and sweet pup with no signs of aggression to children or other dogs/animals of any size or breed. He doesn't seem to have any interest in being the alpha male in a pack; just very happy to be included and loved.Patrick is house trained and is doing very well with name recognition and recall as well as his leash work. With continued love, patience and guidance, Patrick will be the perfect addition to any family.Patrick will do best in an active home with parents who will continue his training. He is incredibly bright and a very sensitive guy who's only desire is to love and be loved.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This animal is not at the Social Tees office all of our dogs and cats are in foster homes while they wait to find their forever families. :) If youd like to apply to adopt this pet, please complete an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org. Because we are a small team and receive hundreds of applications each week, we are unable to respond to every application and every inquiry email, but we do our best. Please have patience! If your application is approved, you will for sure hear from us. If you have questions, please take a look at the Adoption and Fostering FAQs etc. on our website as all common questions are answered there. Thank you for your understanding and flexibility as we work to save these innocent lives!! \n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT US: socialteesnyc.org; Instagram via @socialteesnyc; Facebook.com/socialteesanimalrescue",

            "description": "SPECIAL NEEDS. Sparky has an enlarged heart and heart murmur. He occasionally has fainting spells. He is currently on medication. He is a friendly guy. Sparky loves spending time in the fenced in yard. Since he has a heart condition, having a yard is preferable. Sparky does enjoy short walks but can't tolerate the heat. He loves squeaky toys. Sparkys favorite treat is a dentastix. His favorite day would be spent in your lap or snuggling with you in bed. He is dog friendly but NOT good with children. He is house broken. The best home for Sparky would be with a retired person or couple who would enjoy his companionship and give him a loving place to live. DOB 03/21/2013 - 9lbs \n\nAdoption fee is $250 and includes DHPP & rabies vaccinations, heartworm testing, spay/neuter surgery, deworming, and microchip. All animals are examined by a veterinarian. Please fill out our application at https://gkarma.wufoo.com/forms/good-karma-pet-rescue-dog-adoption-screening/ if you would like to adopt or meet this dog, and we will be in touch right away!",

These are truly delightful creatures who just love romping and playing in the wooded hills at our Sanctuary! They have two delightful girlfriends in their pack and the foursome immediately took to each other like long lost friends (or family members!) Blue-eyed Sinatra is not a dog who chooses human company, though he is sweet, sensitive, curious and does engage, but chooses dogs over humans. We respect that choice and give him and the others the time and a big space to call home - eventually in the right circumstances with the right kinds of people and other dog(s) we can consider placing them, or they'll stay here and have their friends and good food and a happy life!\n\nThank you for considering adoption of a Milo Foundation Sanctuary dog.\nOur Sanctuary is where our rescued dogs who have had difficulty in a home in the past, have behavioural issues, or too much energy, or for some, aggression issues with other dogs, or intense stranger danger that make them more difficult to safely and happily live in urban environments.\nThese are not beginner dogs or for the most part nor are they for families with children. IF you are looking for an easy dog to add to your family, we suggest looking at the dogs at our Adoption Center, Milo Pt Richmond. \nBUT, if you can offer a safe and nurturing home to a dog with some behavioural \"quirks\" please do send an application today. Thank you.",

            "description": "Roach is finally accepting applications!\n\nMany know this boy's history but if you do not here is the short version. Roach's previous owner had to move in with a friend and was unable to bring Roach so he went to stay with a friend for a while. Unfortunately the friend's neighbor was not keen on Roach or likely any dogs. Somehow he ended up throwing a machete at him and severing a large portion of his back. It went down to the spine but thankfully did not damage any major spinal nerves or the cord. He was thankfully surrendered to our friends at Turtle Mountain Animal Rescue.\nWe had just finished Petey's (our tilapia fish graft dog) recovery and when we heard about Roach we reached out to offer any help they needed. Roach was ultimately transferred to our care due to the lengthly drive to the nearest vet to TMAR and the many visits he would have needed. We were happy to help. We started him on medications and special topical concoctions for his bandage on his back along with cold laser therapy. He healed extremely fast.\nWe did notice that he continued to be both urine and fecal incontinent and we wondered if the machete had actually done damage to his spinal cord so we took him in for an MRI. That revealed that thankfully the machete wound did not damage anything internal. However, it also showed that he had a healed fractured vertebra in his pelvis. This was not related to the machete incident and we later found out that his tail/rear end was run over by a car 9 months prior to the machete incident. The vertebra healed but was still causing nerve damage. It was part of what helps wag his tail. Every time Roach would wag his tail he was potentially causing more nerve damage. If we wanted to preserve what function he had left of his bladder and bowels we needed to remove his tail as far up as possible.\nWe have also placed him on a urinary incontinent medication called Proin that he takes once daily (about $25per month). He will likely need this for life. He can go out and empty his bladder but he will continue to drip little drops. For this reason we have some belly bands that he will wear inside the home. They do not bother him a bit. As for the fecal incontinence, this is a little more complex. There is not medication to help this but it is not out of control. He doesn't purposefully defecate like he urinates so it will just fall out. He has wonderfully formed stool so it is not diarrhea at all.\nHe will need to remain on a specific brand of food called Hills Biome (prescription $63/bag which lasts about 4-6 weeks) that will keep him regular as his gut is not able to move things through like a normal dog. This food has probiotics and prebiotics to help keep his gut happy.\n\nWe know that it will be difficult to find a home that will accept an incontinent dog. His personality makes up for it ten fold. This boy has been through so much! We think that a home that loves spending a lot of time out side would be best. He would love to be a farm dog and keep things in line, however we require that they live inside. He gets along with most dogs but does not appreciate intact males nor does he like in your face dogs. He doesn't seem to mind cats.\n\nIf you think you have the right home for Roach please send in an application at RPAW.org\nAdoption fee is $300",

Seems very sweet and a little timid, but given the difference in behavior as described by prior owner, should probably not be in a home with young children.  Not available yet - further evaluation and updates after quarantine period is over.\n**Passed Quarantine - took her out on leash, only behavior I have noticed is she jumps  up and wants to mouth you, but it seems like it is all in play and with some training that will be resolved.  By the end of our walk she wasn't trying that anymore, and was still happy with me.  Not used to a leash.\nFirst shot given on 9/11/2020",

Mike loves to run and play outside with other dogs. He is a sweet boy with a gentle nature, but he is shy with people and takes a long time to warm up. To help him feel more comfortable with his new family, we are looking for a home with another dog. Mike needs a cat free home because he likes to chase them. He will need some socialization and obedience training.\n\nFor more information on Mike, call AWS at 860-354-1350 email animalwelfare.socty@snet.net or visit our website aws-shelter.org for a pre adopt application. Adoption fees for Dogs (8yrs and up) is $150  Adult Dogs is $350 and Puppies under a year is $400 .",

Filling out an application does not obligate you to adopt, but merely begins the process. SEPR DOES adopt out of state!\n\nAdoption fees:All SEPR adoptions are $300.  This includes: adoption fee (spay/neuter, utd vaccinations, micro-chipping), microchip registration, Gentle Leader, and two tie downs for use in your home. \n\nSEPR requires all adopted dogs attend a training class with their adoptive family within 90 days of their adoption. If an adoptive family completes this training class, they will be refunded $100 of their adoption fee with proof of licensed certificate. SEPR even offers an obedience class called Train-A-Bull to alumni over 1 year of age on a seasonal basis.  These classes are currently free!\n\n*All other pets in the residence must be spayed or neutered and all pets up to date on vaccinations.\n\n*SEPR requires all applicants must be 21 years of age.\n\n*SEPR dogs are adopted to be inside the home, \u201cpart of the family\u201d dogs only.\n\n*Families with children 4 years of age and under wanting to adopt puppies will be reviewed on a case by case basis.

His life started out so sad...won't you give him the love he needs and wants. He has been neutered, up to date on shots, microchipped, Heart worm negative, and ready to meet his new family.

I am a shy boy currently in foster coming out of my shell. I am scared of commotion so would do best in a home without children. I've even started on my monthly flea and heartworm preventatives - what more could you ask for? If you'd like to meet me, please fill out an online application at PawmettoLifeline.org.\n\n\nMy adoption is considered \"Best Match\". This means that I am looking for a specific type of home or certain qualities in my new family. I am not first come-first serve for any approved applicant. Pawmetto Lifeline's adoption advocates and my case managers would love to review your application to see if we are a good fit. I appreciate your patience as the Adoption team discusses your application with my case managers!",

I was adopted out as a puppy and kept outside with little to no socialization for my entire life. Adults only please! I am looking for a family to show me what love is and let me be the indoor family member Pawmetto Lifeline knows I can be. My adoption is considered \"Best Match\". This means that I am looking for a specific type of home or certain qualities in my new family. I am not first come-first serve for any approved applicant. Pawmetto Lifeline's adoption advocates and my case managers would love to review your application to see if we are a good fit. \n\nMy adoption fee of $200 includes my up-to-date vaccinations, microchip, deworming, and I come home spayed/neutered. I even started on my monthly flea and heartworm preventatives - what more could you ask for?\n\nIf you'd like to meet me, please fill out an application on our website, PawmettoLifeline.org, and an adoption advocate will be with you shortly. Thank you!",

Cane Haven Rescue pulled her from the shelter to give her another chance at life. Maya is approximately 5 years old, up to date on vaccinations, spayed & microchipped. \n\nMaya has had quite the rough life before she came into rescue. While she was at the shelter, she was suffering from a horrible skin infection, bite wounds and much more. Despite her past life, Maya is forgiving, loving and trusting of all humans. She is the total package. \n\nMaya is house trained, kennel trained & knows her basic commands/manners. \n\nInterested adopters can fill out an application at canehavenrescue.com. \nAny possible questions about Maya, please email canehavenrescue@gmail.com \n\nCane Haven Rescue will transport any of their adoptable dogs to the right home. We do require adoption fees that are based on the age & health status of the adoptable dog.

I need someone who is experienced with my breed, and has no other pets. I would do best in a single adult home with no children. I don't like to be left alone, and require lots of attention. My friend, at the shelter who loves me, tells me I'm an \"\"incredible boy\"\"! I absolutely LOVE to play fetch with tennis balls, catching them in the air, on the ground or in the pool! I would need a fenced-in yard so I can run and play. So, if you think we would be great buddies, please call the shelter and make an appointment to come meet me. Hope to see you soon!!!",

            "description": "Ruger IS AVAILALBE (updated 02-02-2021).To meet any of our dogs you must first complete our online adoption application on our website. For more information and the adoption application for Ruger, please visit our website belowhttp://www.coastalgsr.org/dog_profile.php?ID=22258&name=RugerAs a puppy, Ruger turned up at the shelter after seemingly having been hit by a car. We rescued him and immediately sent him to our vet, where we discovered that he'd sustained four fractures, including one to his pelvis. He had multiple surgeries and then left the hospital to recover in a foster home.Since his rescue, he's more than doubled in size! Just over a year old, he now enjoys running and playing with his foster siblings and having a grand old time, even though he still has a little 'kink' in one back leg. Ruger is crate trained, potty trained, and good with other dogs, but he can be overly rambunctious for little dogs. We are unsure of Ruger's mix... maybe GSD and Basenji? Whatever it is, he's a medium sized boy who is very sweet, has tons of puppy energy, and likes to have a toy in his mouth at all times. If you're looking for an active boy who walks a little funny, but isn't in any pain and is looking for a fun household to call his own, this curly tailed boy is your dream come true! The minimum adoption donation for adults is $375 and the adoption donation for puppies is $500. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is tax deductible. The adoption donation provides that all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis ( i.e., puppies who will need to be altered by 6 mos old). Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.",

            "description": "COURTESY POST...NEW ALBANY, OH\n\nMeet Waylon\n\nThis adorable boy is a 5 year old Bluetick Coonhound who loves going on walks and snoozing on the sofa. He likes a mix of active and chill time, and would never say no to someone who wants to pet him! Like any introvert, lots of new people and places are tiring, so Waylon would do best in a quieter home where he is the only pet. Young, active children won't be a good fit. No cats please.\n\nWaylon is a classic example of a hound with a strong nose for smelling. Because of this, he needs a fenced-in backyard and someone to continue working with him on his leash manners. He'd love to have a job if you're up for teaching him new tricks. Currently, Waylon is a bit overweight and is working hard to shed some of those extra pounds.\n\nWaylon's adoption fee is $300 US funds. If he sounds like a fit for your home and you'd like to meet him, apply today at rescuedohio.org!\n\nPlease note this is a courtesy post and Gentle Jake's is not accepting applications for Waylon directly. Please visit www.rescuedohio.org for more information.\n\nPlease Note:\n\nWe are all volunteers and busy taking care of our foster dogs so please take the time to fill out our on-line adoption application if you are interested in more information about any of the hounds that we have for adoption. Filling out our application does not obligate you to adopt in any way. It does, however, help us to determine if the dog that your interested in would be a good match for your family and lifestyle.\n\nAll of our dogs are fully vetted. They have been vaccinated, altered, microchipped and heartworm tested and on prevention.\n\nVISIT COONHOUND COMPANIONS WEBSITE TO SEE WHY ADOPTING A COONHOUND CAN BE A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!\n\nwww.coonhoundcompanions.com\n\nADOPTION FEE: $300.00 US funds\n\nLOCATION: Waylon is currently in foster care in New Albany, OH. With the help of volunteers, transportation to his forever home can possibly be arranged. Don't let distance deter you!\n\nIf you would like to give this handsome boy a forever home please fill out our on line adoption application at\n\nwww.rescuedohio.org",

She is one of sixty dogs from a Santa Rosa County hoarding case. For the last few months, she has been experiencing a more respectable pet life in her foster mom's home. Now, after the building up of her health and trust level, it is about time that Sweet Milk gets to be that one-in-a-million companion dog she was always meant to be. She's got the typical Lab temperament - desiring to please and be obedient - and she truly wants nothing more than to be with her person. Her ideal family would be one who is mostly home, who's also gentle in nature themselves, and who deeply enjoys a close relationship with their pets. Other mature pets in the home and going on outings are good options for Milk, but they are also not necessary. Because Milky Mae May's understanding of a safe world is still evolving, busy households or ones with young children may be a bit too much stimulation for her at this stage of her learning. If you feel a possible connection with this sweet soul and have a tender, loving home to offer her, then please contact us for more information. With having lived for so long with so much neglect in the past, we are committed to pairing Milk with a family who can make the rest of her life her absolute best life. Might that be you?\n\nAmazing Grace Bully Rescue is a foster based rescue in the Pensacola, Florida area. We do not have a physical building. If you would like to meet any of our pups, the first step is to fill out our online application so we can contact you.\n\nOur adoption fee for is $150/$175 and includes four sets of puppy shots, two dewormings (done prior to adoption) his/her spay/neuter, current shots, rabies vaccine, and a registered microchip.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this Amazing dog, please fill out our online adoption application at www.amazinggracebullyrescue.org\n\nIf you have any questions, please text your question to 723-2037.

He came to us covered in ticks and is still severely underweight, but is now a heathy boy. \n\nJames is a wonderful and amazingly sweet dog even after all he\u2019s been through. He holds no grudge against people even though he was spent most of his life severely neglectd and abused, he still loves all people. James is a very easy going boy who would make a great family dog but wouldn\u2019t mind living in a home with just one or two people either. He loves affection and enjoys to spend time just hanging out with his humans. He really loves going out for walks and going out for adventures! (Does great on car rides). Despite his older age he can still handle pretty long walks and easy hiking trails without a problem as long as they are nothing to intense. He is frequently taken out for 1 hour walks and easily hiking trials by our volunteers. James would need to be a only dog, he doesn\u2019t seem to enjoy the Company of other dogs or do particularly well with other dogs. He is a people dog. He could use a little bit of leash training but doesn\u2019t need anything major (pulls a little bit). He also loves very much loves toys. We have seen a few minor instances of him being a little possessive over his food/toys. This is probably due to the fact that he was starved and came to us as a complete skeleton. We don\u2019t think we would be great with younger kids that might yank on him or not no how to respect his personal space, but would be fine in a home with older kids (preteens and up). Over all James is such a wonderful easy going and loving boy who just needs someone who love him through the rest of his days. He is a fan favorite by most of our volunteers and staff.\n\n\n\nApply to foster at:\nhttps://www.animalhopeandwellness.org/fosterprocessandapplication\n\nApply to adopt at: https://www.animalhopeandwellness.org/adoptionandfosterapplication\n\nWe are by appointment only. You must submit and have an approved application before meeting AHWF animals.\n\nFor General Adopt/Foster Inquiries: adopt@animalhopeandwellness.org\n",

            "description": "We will start with Rojo is not animal friendly. He doesn't like other dogs, he doesn't like cats, so far we haven't found any animal that he likes. Rojo is young. He's about one and a half years old. He had a family once. Then he started trying to get the dog on the other side of the fence, so his family decided to rehome him. Well as usual with rehoming to just anyone, Rojo was found wandering the streets a few months later. Rojo has been at animal control for about 6 months. No one ever came for him. Rojo will take a very special adopter. One that doesn't have animals around their yard. One that has a very sturdy privacy fence and one that we don't have to worry about him escaping from the house. Rojo is good with people. He is very high anxiety in animal control. This is understandable because he gets very little socialization other than a walk once or twice a week and a few car rides. I do try to take him to the dog park a couple times a week just to give him a little time away from the shelter to decompress. Rojo is about 70 lbs. We do not recommend children at this time because of his anxiety and he would need time to decompress. He does get overly excited at times. Rojo has been evaluated by a trainer and will be beginning a training program in the near future. If you think you could be the right person for Rojo, please complete an application located here. If Rojo is adopted before his training sessions, they will be included in his adoption.\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/31997643682166",

            "description": "Jesse is strikingly handsome 7-9 month old, 35 lb. Lab mix. He is very connected to his people and likes to be with them, even if it's quietly laying at their feet. This sweet boy is just beginning to learn the real joys of a loving home, and he's loving it! Jesse is good with other dogs. Jesse would really like a canine buddy.  He can be a little timid in new situations and takes a little while to bond with his people, so he would prefer a home without young children.\n\nJesse walks well on leash, is housetrained, sleeps through the night, and is working on his basic commands. He is highly food motivated and very eager to please, making him a quick learner. You know you want some of Jesse's delightful tail wags in your life!\n\n\nThank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (https://anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible organization. ANCAR is a foster-based rescue, and we adopt within a 90 mile radius of Bedford Hills, NY.  You will find the adoption application here: (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/).  All fields on the application must be completed.\nPlease read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) so you'll know what to expect when you submit.   \n\nOur dogs are in foster care and we do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. This is a firm policy. Our busy volunteers are not able to respond to questions about the dog or dog meeting requests in the absence of an application.  We know these dogs very well because they are in foster care. Please read the profiles of the dog(s) you are interested in prior to submitting an application.  If there are specific requirements stated (ie: Fenced Yard or Canine Friend Required) these are included because they are vital to the happiness, health, safety and adoption success of that dog. \n\nWe are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering and microchipping before transporting our dogs. We provide all supplies, preventatives and any follow up vet care necessary while they are in foster care. These costs are high and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you.  We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources. If you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through the kindness of supporters like you that we are 'changing lives...one tail at a time' by providing our dogs with 'A New Chance.' (https://anewchancear.org) \n\nThanks so much.",

I am the biggest couch potato you will meet although it doesn't take much to get me off the couch and play with you. My foster family says I am extremely smart! I didn't know my name till 3 weeks ago, now I know sit, stay, down, paw and leave it (yeah ok - have trouble doing this sometimes!) I love my kids - I live with a toddler and a teen and I am very protective about them. I am a little weary if strangers but promise I warm up quickly! Once you gain my trust I will make sure you never run out of hugs and kisses. I am fully house trained and am improving on a leash. I love my food and treats very much, and need many toys, which need to be hard and tough, because I have a thing for pulling feathers out of stuffed animals. I'm not the biggest fan of cats, but if you have a dog, I'd love to meet them to see if we can be best friends. Take me to my \"Furever\" home and you will have a friend for life!",

His favorite thing is to be in his special person's lap. His other favorite things are to go for walks and to bury himself in his blankets. He is very well behaved in the house-- not a barker, etc. Goliath will not be friendly with you until he gets to know you, and therefore he would prefer a home with no small children.  HE IS GOING TO NEED A PATIENT FAMILY THAT WILL WORK WITH HIM UNTIL HE FEELS COMFORTABLE ENOUGH WITH YOU TO BOND. He is doggie-door trained, current on shots, heartworm negative, and recently had bloodwork done and his teeth cleaned.  He is in great shape!\n\nFor more information, call or text Anita at 817-929-6576.\n\nPLEASE DO NOT SEND AN EMAIL INQUIRY!\n\nDFW  AREA  ONLY!",

I'm a pretty active girl, so an active home would be ideal---especially if you're a runner or hiker! I'd make the best companion for some off-roading!\n\nI am great with with adults, but i don't do well with smaller kids, cats or other dogs. I will need a home with no other animals, and people over the age of 18 only.\n\nMy doggy toys are my faves, and my favorite hobby is playing fetch; I'll run for the ball as long as you will throw it for me! I would make an awesome water dog, as I just LOVE lounging in kiddie pool! Rides great in the car.\n\nWon't you consider adding me to your family?\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this dog, please visit our website for our online application www.underdogaz.com",

I love all dogs. In fact I will need to live in a home with at least one other confident dog to live my best life.

I do not jump on people or loose my mind when someone knocks on the door; that's for amateurs.\nI am walking very well on the leash when not startled. I no longer pull or zig zag like a drunken sailor; foster mom said I was better than that and I agree. I don't even react to squirrels.

We heard her bark for the first time the other day while playing in the back yard, we were beginning to wonder if she could. She loves playing chase with our 5yo daughter and has started playing tug of war as well. She has finished her doxy for hearworm but got use to getting a little cheese twice a day and seems to like that routine. She loves being outside and really likes the short walks we have started. She is starting to learn how to walk on a leash but is still easily distracted.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\n8/17/20: Jackie is the sweetest girl. We think she was mostly kept outside where she prefers to be most of the time, unless the sky rumbles then she is ready to come in. She appears to be house trained as we have not had a single accident since we've had her. She is very shy and quiet, we still dont know what her bark sounds like. She is Heartworm Positive and is being treated. Jackie is very independant but is warming up to us every day. When she arrived she was very thin and we looking forward to seeing her at a healthy weight.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

He's just so darn happy! \n\nMoney is a sweet, confident, good-natured boy that likes people very much. He is an even tempered boy that would make a great family dog! \n\nMonty came to us after being found in horrible conditions as an unclaimed stray. Months of working on multiple skin infections later, Monty is finally ready for a forever home! Monty is fluffy, obedient, and happy to take on the world with you.\n\n\n\n----\nPeach County Animal Rescue is a rescue located in Fort Valley, GA. Our adoption fees range from $250-350+. Although our rescue dogs share a common bond with one another, no rescue story is the same (even when similar). Vetting costs vary depending on their health conditions. All of our dogs are fully vetted: up-to-date on annual shots, spayed/neutered and microchipped with a lifetime registration. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nIf you would like to send in an application for this dog, please use the link below! https://peachcountyanimalrescueandrehabilitation.org/apply-now-2/",

            "description": "Meet Ziggy! Sweet Zigglet came in to rescue from living in a car after having to leave her home due to a messy divorce. She is a gorgeous blue brindle American Pitbull Terrier, about 3 years old and spayed. She\u2019s up to date on vaccines and heartworm negative. Ziggy loves humans- every adult and child she meets is her best friend!  She really just wants to cuddle and spend time with someone, affection is all she needs to be happy. She is very well trained; she knows sit, stay, down and is working on her leash manners. She is kennel and house trained, as well. She is kenneled when left alone, but would probably be fine out and about. The kennel is a precaution as there are other dogs in her foster home currently. She's easily entertained with ANY toy, she'll take whatever you give her, as long as she can chew it and carry it around- if it has a squeaker, you just made her day! She also likes to chase her balls, but she's working on bringing them back ha! She's got the sweetest, most telling eyes and they are a true reflection of her good nature. \n\n\n\nZiggy does need to be the only animal in the home. She was not socialized at all and came from a very hectic, stressful household. She can be unpredictable with dogs and will require an owner that can adhere to those needs. She just needs someone that will be responsible and stick to her training, Ziggy thrives on a routine and discipline. Even so, this girl is absolutely worth it. She will bring so much light in your life and has just been a joy to foster. She is the complete package, she's got to have one little flaw right?! If you're searching for a precious little pittie, with a slight under bite and a huge heart, Ziggy the Piggy is your girl!\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our dogs are healthy, spayed/neutered, vaccinated and on heartworm preventative. They live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. Many have basic obedience skills and all have been temperament tested. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, please visit our website to complete an application: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt\n(please note: app cannot be done on a mobile device)\n\nFor additional information see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

Gratefully speaking my middle name is resilience so I\u2019m not beating myself up about it. But, I did figure we can use this platform or a moment to talk about who I am. For starters, I am awesome. Ha. I am though. I survived a fairly dark time of 6 whole months in a shelter with the help of my friends at @next.stop.home.chicago. I made into this Pack of Rebels because I was one of the last left behind when our friends were asked to not return to help dogs at the shelter. MCP didn\u2019t have a foster so I went straight into a board and train at @seespotrunchicago and gained more incredible humans into my life. I crushed leash skill and commands. I yearn to learn, baby! That\u2019s me. For real. I was so board for so long, given the opportunity to learn is heaven on Earth as far as I\u2019m concerned. I\u2019m now being fostered at @lovepacklife and have EVEN MORE FRIENDS! I have so many dog friends and so many human friends. I\u2019m extremely grateful. One thing I don\u2019t have is someone who sees me as a Forever plus one. I will make an AMAZING adventure dog! Best friend? Whaaaat?! I was born to be the bestest friend. I have what they call a LUST FOR LIFE. Do you? I\u2019m that ride or die type of love. I cannot wait to share all my treasures with that human willing to call me Home. I promise I will not disappoint. Till then, my friends, stay safe and keep your hearts open. - Mellow\n\nPS. I EVEN beat heartworm!! \n\nAnimals can be viewed by appointment only.

I'm going to need some obedience training to make me easier to interact with because I'm SO excited about life, walks, nature and everything around me. \n\nI came to the shelter very skinny and have enjoyed all the food and treats that they have here. I can get a bit possessive about my food so they are asking for a home with no children or other dogs to start me off on the right foot. \n\nPlease contact the shelter to set up a meeting with me soon!  It's s'mores season and this marshmallow doesn't want to be left behind! Our behavior manager will be happy to contact you with more details.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting any of our adoptable dogs, please fill out an application at https://www.mlar.org/adoption-overview\n\nE-mails regarding adoption are not considered an application. \n\nOut-of-state applicants (outside of PA/NJ/DE) will not be considered, unless there are special circumstances.\n\nPlease visit our web site for more detailed information on the animals in our care, our educational campaigns, and for helpful tips on adoption.  www.MLAR.org",

He is a play group all star and always winds up rolling around on the ground while everyone else plays around him. Hearing all this and knowing he had been waiting for over seven months we couldn't help but pull him from there. Vinnie is doing amazing at his foster home but would really love a family to finally call his own. He is 5 years old 78lbs and full of love and affection. He takes a little time to warm up but once he gets to know you you will have a friend forever. No kids. DOB: 10/07/14 Weight 78lbs.\n\nAdoption fee is $175 and includes DHPP & rabies vaccinations heartworm testing spay/neuter surgery wellness vet visit one month petinsurance deworming and microchip. All animals are examined by a veterinarian.

            "description": "Location: New Orleans, Louisiana \n\nStella was a owner surrender to a shelter in North Louisiana. Cane Haven Rescue pulled her from the shelter to give her another chance at life. Stella is approximately 3 years old, up to date on vaccinations, spayed & microchipped. \n\nStella was at the shelter since December 2019 when her owners decided they no longer wanted her anymore. When her owners found out that a rescue stepped in, they became very irate. We are unsure why they would want Stella locked behind bars, especially since they did not want her. Since December, the shelter staff was weary of Stella because she was extremely scared and the shelter life started to wear on her. She had ZERO human interaction for months. Stella had an angel on her side.. a volunteer took to Stella and started working with her. Stella does take a bit to warm up to new people and her surrounding, but we do not blame her. A meet and greet with any other dogs in the home is mandatory. Stella is also going through a training program to help socialize her back into life. Any new owner must be willing to participate in these sessions. \n\nStella is house trained, kennel trained & knows her basic commands/manners. She is an extremely strong girl who sometimes does not realize how strong she actually is. When walking, Stella needs someone who can control her on a leash.\n\nInterested adopters can fill out an application at canehavenrescue.com. \nAny possible questions about Stella, please email canehavenrescue@gmail.com \n\nCane Haven Rescue will transport any of their adoptable dogs to the right home. We do require adoption fees that are based on the age & health status of the adoptable dog. The adoption fee covers every single dog in CHR with vaccinations, heartworm test, deworming, microchip, spay/neuter & medications. All CHR adoptable dogs are current on their monthly  heartworm and flea medication. A CHR representative will do a home check to ensure the pets are placed in a secure and loving home. \n\nwww.canehavenrescue.com",

She is fully potty trained, and in her previous home learned how to ring a bell to go outside. She does love to play with other dogs but will need to be supervised. True to her heeler breed, she has a tendency to rear up on hind legs nipping at nose, neck and heels of other dogs.\n\nRiley has the potential to be an amazing furbaby, she is looking for the right person and home to call hers.",

            "description": "\"If you're lucky, a dog will come into your life, steal your heart, and change everything!\" Meet Oscar, a 3-year-old good-natured Great Pyrenees. This stunning, tall, predominately white Pyr stands out in a crowd with his regal appearance.\n\nHe greets people with his charming and kind disposition. This easy-going Pyr would thrive with an active family with older kids, an energetic resident canine who enjoys walks, hiking, and adventures. He requires a home with a fenced yard to play, run, and exercise. He will do best in a family with no cats and no little children. Oscar is cautious when meeting other dogs.\n\nOscar is housetrained and has had some basic training. He needs a confident leader who can provide firm but loving boundaries because Pyrs are exceptionally smart and need to be challenged.\n\nOscar has all the traits and qualities to become a loving, devoted family companion. Will Oscar be the one to steal your heart and change your life? If you think he would, please complete an application today.\n\nAll dogs and puppies require VISIBLE fencing\n\nAdoption Fee: $300 (Adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm test, rabies, distemper, parvo and health certificate for travel). Adoption applications can be found on our website at https://www.greatpyreneesrescuesociety.org. Northwest adopters pay the cost of transport to independent transport service ($225).\n\nADOPTION, FOSTERING, AND DONATIONS are just some of the ways you can help a rescued dog. We have worked hard to cultivate a large network of volunteers to save this majestic breed. While monetary donations are always much appreciated, you can also help by donating your time as a GPRS foster or volunteer!",

I was rescued with my brother who is also up for adoption, Harry is my name, but I am not as big as him. I am about 60lbs and am super sweet and sociable. I would love to have a house with a yard that I can frolic in and be myself. I am your typical dog, that he enjoys, playtime, eating, lounging, and then repeat!\n\nJake is already neutered, hw negative, vaccinated, microchipped, wormed and ready for a forever home.\n\nIf you are ready to meet this super boy, please fill out our online application https://shelter2rescue.org/DogAdoption.html",

Casanova is an incredibly sweet dog once he knows you. He enjoys cuddling on the couch, playing in the backyard, and hanging out with his foster mom and the other foster dog in his foster home.\nCasanova is timid of new people but given a little time to meet you, he'll become one of the best friends you have! Once he's your friend, you have a friend for life! And once he loves you, he doesn't want to see you go. He does best in a travel crate when you're gone from the house, but has shown some ability to be left out while his foster family is gone from the home.\n\nAre you more of the type that likes to watch the latest releases on Netflix than going on a big grand adventure? Casanova would LOVE to join you! Casanova thrives when he knows his environment & structure, and can stay at home in his comfort zone.\n\nThis adorable boy is potty trained, neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, and heartworm negative. His adoption fee is $200.\n\nInterested in becoming Casanova's forever family? Shoot us an application to start the adoption process!! http://mhrindy.org/adoption-inquiry/***Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.***",

I need very extensive leash training because I was never properly socialized until now. I've been kept in a backyard until my foster mom came to my rescue. I would prefer a quiet home and someone who is willing to work with my shyness. I also prefer not to be picked up and will wiggle until I am on the floor. My previous owners never showed me affection but I am getting use to it now. I love pets on the head and back. I am a great listener and am crate and house trained. I am also great with other dogs and off leash! If you think I'm the pup for you then contact my foster mom at (559)267-3607 for more information.",

He has a very sweet, loving personality, and is very food motivated, so he will be easy to train.  He has been neutered and treated for heartworm, he is now in 'Rest and Relaxation' mode.  He seems to have a skin allergy, so he's on a 'fish' based dog food.  \nHe'll be ready to meet new people, and hopefully find a family to love him.

See, my foster momma says she \"integrated\" me into her \"ZooCrew\" which are her special doggies and I'm pretty special so that's where I needed to be. Before that I was always outside, with my brothers who have been adopted or are in a foster away from me. I like it and get to meet new doggies often and I have 2 buddies named Lucky and Hemi that I just LOVE!!! I lick their faces, am all wiggly when I get out of the crate to go outside for a while. Hemi don't like it much and sometimes he chases me away and then we wrestle and run around. I get into trouble with Lucky cuz him and I are bigger and we get running, jumping and tearing through the house we have so much fun we forget that we're inside. Sunday I laughed so hard when Lucky fell off the bed but then I forgot and I fell off the bed which wasn't as funny but he thought so. I like it here a lot but I think it's time to free up a spot for a dog in need and that means I need adopted.\nNow foster momma says I'm whatever a \"diamond in the rough\" and with some training I will be the bestest dog ever. I do know how to sit, I can be lured into a crate with special treats and will go to sleep but I would rather sleep on the bed with you. I do have a bad habit or two of pulling things from the garbage or sampling shoes or dirty laundry on occasion but it smells like you so how can you blame me, right?\nI need time to get to know you when we first meet and I'll need some practice going places, being on leash, riding in the car, your friends need to give me time to get used to them and I will because foster momma says I'm a \"rock star\" and that I can do anything!!!\n\nFreckles is a 1 year old heeler/border collie mix. He is current on vaccinations, neutered, microchipped and ready to love you. He is a little shy at first, but once you earn his trust, he will be your best friend!",

I enjoy going on walks and getting lots of sniffs in and seeing new things. I listen so intently with my ears, they sometimes come together completely! I'm just so stink'n cute! I like to play with toys, especially the stuffed squeaker toys that make funny noises when I chew them. I'm even good about only chewing on my toys instead of other things around the house. I enjoy hanging out outside and love to run. I also like to snuggle inside with my family especially when I've run all out of my puppy energy. I love getting petted and giving kisses in return! I am super smart, and have already learned how to sit, lay down, shake, and stay. I also am crate trained and sleep in my crate all night.\n\nIf I sound like the right fit for your family, be sure to send in an application at www.soca-fbc.org/adoptables. My adoption fee is $350 locally or $550 for Bellevue, WA (includes health cert and travel fee). I am up to date on all my shots, spayed and microchipped. I can't wait to meet my new family, and hope to give all my love to them soon!",

            "description": "Meet this adorable Sweetie Pie. She is Sammie Sweetie Pie our senior beauty. Sammie Sweetie Pie has been incredibly lucky. She was hit by two cars in 24 hours. She didn't have any internal injuries!! A true miracle for her\n\nSammie Sweeite Pie will take a little bit to get to know you. She will love you if you hold some sweet potato chips in your hand. Once she feels safe then you can see how truly amazing she is. She loves to play with other dogs once sure they are ok to be trusted. She does a lot better with Small Male Dogs. \n\nSammie Sweetie Pie does well in a household with a backyard. She really enjoys her time in the sun. She is housebroken and leash trained. We are working with her on crate training. She doesn't want to miss out on anything thats going on in the house. \n\nSammie Sweetie Pie's foster says she is kind and calm. She takes a moment to open up, but loves the dogs that are her friends.\n\nCovid 19 has changed everything including animal adoptions. We are no longer having meet & greets to keep us safe. We are not conducting home checks for the same reason. We had to keep all our available dogs with our Houston Fosters until adoption. We do everything via video chat, phone conversations, photo sharing, and whatever else we have to do to make this a successful adoption. We are excited to say our adoptions are more today than before the pandemic.\n\nWe have a transport service that leaves Houston every 2 weeks. We only use 1 transport service. The owner drives the truck and takes excellent care of our animals. We love those happy relaxed rescue babie's pictures when they arrive and meet their owners! They arrive calmed. The additional fee if adopting outside of the Houston area is $200.\n\nOur adoption fees for Cats & Dogs are: Up to 1 year Old $400 / 13 months and Up $300 \n\nOur adoption application is located at www.springbranchrescue.org Please send any adoption questions to us springbranchrescue@gmail.com",

My name is Maddie, I've been spending time with my friends healing and I am eager to meet my forever family. Something you might not know about me is that I am called Maddie the Magnificent! I got that nickname by overcoming different medical issues after being brought to the London Sanctuary. They took me in and treated me for demodex (its not contagious!) and a few other things. I'm well on my way to recovery and I'm looking for a family to love on and give me all the belly rubs! While I walk great on a leash, I can be curious to see other dogs we encounter on walks. I'll bark to let foster mom know I want to say hi! Everyone is super surprised that I don't bey like a \"normal\" hound. Don't they know we are all unique?! I am also a master at commands like Sit, Come and Paw. Next to belly rubs, playing with my stuffies is another favorite past time. But then again, so are long walks with my foster family! I love my foster siblings, but I think I'd enjoy a quiet family that loves relaxation as much as me! I'd love to meet you and show you how magnificent I am in person.\n\nAbout Me:\n\nLoves humans and attention from them\nGets along with other dogs but would prefer to just be single and mingle but plays when she wants to\nHas a calm nature\nLoves belly rubs\nNot a fan of thunderstorms\nHouse trained\nLeash trained\nKnows sit and paw\nNot cat tested\nCheck out my transformation from Caterpillar to Butterfly at Maddie the Magnificent - From Caterpillar to Butterfly on Facebook.\n\nMaddie is spayed and micro-chipped and up to date on her vaccinations and deworming. She is fostered in Jacksonville; to set up a meet and sniff just send a msg to The London Sanctuary. Her adoption fee is only $250, which includes the above-mentioned vetting. Home visit and reference checks are required and are NOT negotiable. Note that we cannot adopt to those in apartments or other attached housing. Our apologies for the inconvenience.",

Stay tuned for more information!\n\nGertie Girl came into DRM through our rescue partners in the South. She was brought into the shelter unable to walk and severely emaciated. Her not being able to walk was most likely due to not getting the proper nutrition or food and being combined in a kennel too small for her. The good news is that she doesn't have any muscular or skeletal issues and with structured and continuous physical therapy she will regain the use of her legs. She is such a sweet girl and is just a love bug. Stay tuned as her foster family helps her get healthy!\n\nThis fabulous foster is a Doberman Rescue Minnesota foster dog.\n\nPlease read all adoption steps and policies carefully on our website. http://dobermanrescueminnesota.com/adoption-steps/\n\nQualified adopters are within the approved adoption area, and Adopter will be requested to visit this foster dog at the foster family home. Our foster families are generally located within a 250 mile radius of Minneapolis, MN.\n\nAll DRM dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, health checked, microchipped, 4DX tested, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention.",

I was running on a highway in Nevada for a long time and quite scared.  A very kind soul stopped and spent 3 hours sitting with me until I trusted him enough to let him touch me and take me for a ride.  We got to another place that was kind of loud and scary, but the wonderful people at Moonsong sprung me!  It takes me a few minutes to learn about new people and know that they aren\u2019t scary, and I really like the other dogs that I\u2019ve met!  Since I\u2019ve been at my foster home, I\u2019ve been pretty happy and content, the only thing that I DON\u2019T like so far is when I can SEE my foster mom but I just CAN\u2019T get to her!  Then I bark, bark, bark till she comes over.  She will put me up in my kennel and them I am a good quiet boy, because I can\u2019t see her anymore.  I THINK she\u2019s trying to teach me something, and I\u2019m pretty dang smart she tells me, so I must be right!  I\u2019m also learning the only other bad habit that I have is when I see her or the little human that lives with me, I JUMP, JUMP, JUMP!  She taught me to sit and said I learned it REALLY FAST, I think this must be to help me with the jumping, because whenever I JUMP she says SIT and I get a treat and a GOOD BOY when I do!   It\u2019s pretty easy for me to train humans\u2026\u2026  I DO have a lot of energy and like to RUN ( I was found running and running after all!) so I will need some humans that can take me on a lot of adventures, play with me and let me keep working on training them, good thing us young pups are around to do that, those older ones just don\u2019t have the energy to be diligent at training their people!  Do you need some training that I can help you with?  Oh, one more thing.  My foster mom said she really loves me and doesn\u2019t want me to be running out in the big scary world on my own again so please make sure you have a safe and secure yard for me to be in!",

I am 3 years old,  I can startled easily by loud noises and quick movements. This means I'd be best in an adult home and without kids. I am housebroken. Now you know that doesn't mean I'll break the house! It just means that I know good puppies know to go potty outside! I am not much of an animal person. OOPS! I meant dog! But some things I do love is treats and snuggles on the couch and also hanging out with my favorite human which happens to be YOU! Please just give me lots of snuggle time and in return I will give you, well MORE SNUGGLES!\nLove, Nia and Mia \nWhile our shelter is closed to the public, we are conducting no-contact adoptions! As always, if you have any questions about our pets available for adoption please call the shelter at (989) 348-4117 and speak with the shelter staff.",

She was a wonderful mother to her puppies and they have all been moved to adopters already. Now she has recovered and been spayed and it's her turn to find a wonderful family! Linda is a very sweet and fun loving girl. She really loves her people and would ideally have them all to herself so a home with no other pets would be best for her. She loves to go for walks and snuggle on the couch. She is crate trained, rides great in the car and does well for bath time and nail trims. If you would like to add Linda to your family, she will repay you with lots of kisses and cuddles! We estimate she was born around July 2017 and she's about 55 lbs.\n\nHere's the link to learn more about our adoption process and turn in an application: https://www.thestreetdogproject.org/adopt Linda's adoption fee is $225 plus tax and that covers her vaccinations, spay, microchip and she's been heartworm tested and is on prevention. Please email placement@thestreetdogproject.org if you have any questions, thanks!",

Blaine is a spirited and energetic boy who loves to go for walks and loves cookies even more. He loves chasing tennis balls and would love to join you out on the trail for a nice, long hike. Blaine is as spunky as they come, and he'll bark to let you know he wants to hang out with you! Call today for an appointment to meet Blaine. If you have another dog at home, please bring her/him in for a Meet 'n Greet. Blaine's adoption fee is partially sponsored - his fee is only $70. He is neutered and microchipped, has age-appropriate vaccinations and is eligible for 30 days of complimentary pet health insurance.

My names Sully and I'm looking for a home that enjoys three things: play time, snuggle time and nap time! I am a pretty easy going pup who loves attention! I love my new foster brother. He's a big pup just like me, as I have a high prey drive and only should be in a home with larger dogs and no cats. If he decides to stop playing though, I can get bored and decide to go on my own adventure, so I either need a long chain outside, or a tall fence that I can't climb. If I'm not playing with my foster brother, I am either enjoying my kong filled with treats and peanut butter or taking a nap next to my foster mom. My foster parents say that I am potty trained and have great manners! I don't beg for food, and I know sit, lay down and shake (this one is my favorite). My foster parents also say I am trying to work on my crate training. I like to 'talk' when I'm in my kennel and need a strong kennel so I can't escape. I am training on this and it is getting better! I'm not a chewer however, and most of the time I don't even need to be in it! I hope I find my forever family soon! My foster parents say my sweet personality and willingness to always give snuggles will give me an edge up on finding my forever family.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSully\n\nAdoption fee includes: Full veterinary exam, alter, prepaid microchip, dewormed, Rabies vaccine, DAPP vaccine, Bordetella vaccine, 4DX\n\n, flea/tick and heartworm preventative while in rescue.

This has affected her ability to control her bowel movements. She is wearing diapers like a champ and loves getting dressed up! She has no idea she\u2019s different and she shows us that every day! Millie is also always running the show and will let everyone know it with all of her cute happy puppy sass. .  She loves playing and wrestling with her bigger fur foster brother, is respectful to the other doggies in her home who aren't interested in rough housing, and generally ignores the resident cat. Long term, she will not only need someone able to change her diaper (and the care that comes with this) and give her ample 'nudie booty time,' but also be able to financially provide for her bulldog needs -- regular vet visits, cleaning in her folds, and a proper diet.",

She is an older gal that just simply does not want to be pestered and may correct a young child or a dog pestering her. Since we want her remaining years to be full of love and happiness, we recommend that she find a home that fits her best. \n\n*Friendly with adults\n*Rides well in vehicle\n*Can jump up into a truck\n*Children over 12\n*No small dogs Or dogs that will pester her\n*Unknown how she does with cats\n*Walks well on a leash, loves walks\n*Potty trained\n*Crate trained\n\n<br><br>Adoption fee is $350.00  Dogs and puppies adopted from Homeward Bound come from home environments, as we utilize foster homes rather than operating a shelter. The animals are always vet checked, dewormed, microchipped and vaccinated, and all are spayed or neutered. Excellent pre and post adoption support is available to answer any questions you might have regarding care, behavior and training. <br><br>\n\n\nI you would like to meet Maggie, call Homeward Bound at 322-7888.  If you leave a message, please speak clearly.  Thanks!  \n\n\n<br><br>Can't adopt a dog? Like to make a donation?  We are a 501(C)(3) non-profit and your donation is tax deductible!

            "description": "Tundra was surrendered due to a breeder downsizing their operation.  He was born April 7, 2018.  He was kept in a small pen with his mate, Gabby.  Tundra is a large boy and very friendly.  He has a calm and gentle temperament. He is fine with other dogs, and good with cats too.   He will benefit from some simple training.  Due to limited socialization, he is not used to a lot of sounds and experiences most dogs have.  He can be protective of his space.  Someone who can be patient with him, as he learns new things, would be best for him.  We recommend obedience training for all newly adopted pyrs, to help you create a special bond with you and your new friend, and so you have a well behaved canine. Great Pyrenees are willing to learn, but are not as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds. They are bred to be independent thinkers. Applicants must be over 25, own their own home and all children in household must be over 6 years old. Your resident pets must be up to date on vaccines, sterilized, you must have a good history of vet care for them, and you must have used heartworm preventative year round for your dogs. \n\n\nTundra will be placed as an inside pet with outside privileges. You MUST have a securely fenced yard accessible from your home. Invisible fencing does not work with this breed and they will take the shock for the freedom.  Great Pyrenees are bred to roam and will create their own territory if not secured, which can led to them being lost, hit by vehicles or shot by people who see them as a threat. The breed is not a good off leash dog, and cannot be trusted to not run away.  A Great Pyrenees off leash is a \" DisAPyr.\" \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please complete the appropriate application on our website, www.igpr.org under the Adopt tab. \n\nAll of our dogs marked as needing foster homes are also available for adoption.  If a dog is listed on this site, it is available.  No need to contact us to see if it is,  We do require you  complete the adoption application prior to meeting a dog.\n\nWe also offer a foster to adopt program. You foster the dog, and have first right of refusal on them if an approved application is submitted for them. \n\nIn fostering a dog, the dog comes to you fully vetted. and groomed. You provide good quality food, grooming, and we provide the heartworm preventative and medical care, if needed* .(*Based on approval from IGPR.)\n\nAdoption fee is $350.",

She is affectionate and attentive, but also silly and independent. \n\nSage had puppies with us, and one of the puppies had a DNA test done. We therefore know that she is a makeup of very many breeds, predominantly Pitbull and Chow. \n\nSage is super duper clean, and very food motivated. She will fly through the air for as little as a kibble. Sage is a lot of fun to train, she follows a lure great, and knows commands like 'jump' 'down' and 'crawl'. \n\nSage is dog selective, but leash reactive. She should be the only dog in her household.\n\nSage is not getting any applications because she is ugly. She is a soft, snuggly dog who will make you laugh every day. She has humble expectations of what a great life is!\n\nApply here for our favorite: rebeldogsdetroit.com/applytoadopt",

We hope we can find them their forever home soon. They were dropped-off at a high-kill shelter when their family situation changed recently. We rescued them just as soon as we could. They arrived at our shelter on August 8, 2020. They are incredible and will fit into any home. The situation they are in now is really tough on them.   Let us tell you about them. \nBuddy is a retriever mix. He\u2019s seven years old and weighs 62 lbs. Like his best mate, he\u2019s also amazing. He\u2019s calm, quiet, well-mannered, obedient, walks well on a leash, friendly, affectionate and so gentle. He\u2019s most likely house-trained. We expect he\u2019s dog friendly and we\u2019ll test with cats for potential adopters. \nDixie is a Beagle/Dachshund mix. She\u2019s four years old and weighs just 25 lbs. She is incredibly sweet and gentle. Well-mannered, most likely house-trained. She is calm, quiet, walks well on a leash and welcomes any attention. Dixie is affectionate and friendly. She seems dog friendly, and we\u2019ll test with cats for potential adopters.\nWe can\u2019t say enough good things about Buddy and Dixie. Whoever had them before must have loved them a lot. These two do everything together and are very companionable. They are incredibly well-behaved and we can tell they just long to be in the quiet and safety of a home. They have become shelter favorites. They will make for incredible and loving companions. They\u2019ve been through a lot, but are holding up like champs, always with a ready tail wag and doggy kisses. If you\u2019re looking for two wonderful and easy-going dogs to open your heart and home to, Dixie and Buddy may just be the ones you\u2019re looking for. \nCall 706-865-4135 for information on additional health services provided as part of the adoption fee.

He was brought to us after being surrendered to a shelter in rough shape. Only 5 years old, he had advanced heartworm disease that had never been treated and was the victim of severe neglect. Despite his rough start to life, Leo is a wiggly ball of curiosity and love. His inquisitive eyes are always asking the same two questions: \u201cHey, watcha doing? Can I join?\u201d Leo is fascinated with toys. He loves anything he can chase down and chew on (bonus points if it squeaks). While his heartworm disease makes it difficult for him to play for extended periods of time, he\u2019s perfectly content to snuggle up next to you on the couch for an afternoon of TV and snuggles. But be warned, inviting Leo onto your bed at night is an invitation for him to lick your face and take up half the bed. If you\u2019re looking for an adorable little bed hog who will give you unending love and an ever-wiggling tail, then this gentle soul will have you falling head over heels.",

That\u2019s pretty awesome!!!\n\nIn some cases, and for reasons beyond our understanding, some dogs get stuck for a while longer.  It's the case for our longest resident, Cooper, who has been with us since early August.  He is such a great boy, we don\u2019t understand why nobody has snatched him up yet.  If you\u2019re having a hard with how 2020 has been going and you need a pick-me-up, he is your boy.  Cooper is ALWAYS happy to be around his humans and would make a dedicated and faithful companion.  Just look at that face and heart-shaped markings.  Even though he hated the hat and is about halfway through his painful heatworm treatment (costs covered by Friends of Marshall County Animals), he still put on a smile for the pictures.  If you need happiness in your life, you need Cooper.  Please call Mary at 256-960-1408 to schedule a time to meet Cooper or help us share his story.",

A witness watched in horror and disbelief as Adeline was shoved out of a moving van on a heavy industrial road between several big truck logistics companies in Conley, GA.  Adeline was almost hit by multiple mack trucks! She was still shaking when we rescued her. We soon jumped in to rescue Adeline and show her what real love feels like!\n\nAdeline is loving and re-blooming into a happy, gentle, trusting and sweet dog. She is about 1 year old, is great with other dogs and kids!!\n\n*Please note that a fenced yard is required for Adeline\n\nApply to adopt sweet Adeline at www.twotailzrescue,.org!\n",

Please read the bio before sending questions - we answer all we know about the dog here.\n\nHi everyone...my name is Lillie - I'm a 5 yrs old American Bulldog. I weigh approximately 65 pounds. My family believes it's best for me to find a home I'm not as stressed out in... They weren't able to give me enough time and attention.\n\nI am house-trained, spayed/microchipped, UTD on vaccinations and on flea/he preventative. My current family gives me cosequin also daily because my previous brother developed joint problems as he got older so they thought they would be proactive. They take really good care of me they just know it's best for me to find another home.\n\nI'm a really loving girl and can't wait to find my new family. I'm cautious around new dogs I am a complete alpha I like to be the queen bee.\n\nI've never been around cats and ok with mature older children\n\nI will be your protector You will come to love me as I will love you. I do bark when somebody rings the doorbell or when somebody knocks on the door. I'm not a big fan of people wearing hats. They seem kind of weird to me. I'm also not a fan of cigarette smoking but you really shouldn't be either...It's not good for your health.\n\nI really like food a lot I don't recommend you put your hands near my food dish... Sometimes I act like I've never been fed before. I'm crate trained and leash trained. I know some basic commands like sit, come, bed and no.\n\nIf you think I would be a good fit for your home and would like to make me your new fur kid please fill out the application on the Heidi's Legacy website.\n\nHeidisLegacyDogRescue.com\n\nLillie's adoption fee is $300 - obedience/behavior training is required\n\nObedience training is also required for all our pups.

I'm a sweet loving girl who rides a little lower on the energy scale! I do love dogs and even those dicey cats are cool! Walking and being your shadow that's my goal, though I'm probably best with older kids as my svelt 50lbs and happy go lucky demeanor can be too much for little ones! Im ever the lady on a leash and love a good cuddle at home! Who's ready to paint the town red and dance the night away? Or... watch movies and maybe drop a snack my way.\n\nRoxy is a 3-year-old, 50-pound pit mix. She is UTD and spayed. She is housebroken and crate trained. Roxy has lived with dogs in the past but would do best with a slow intro. She likes cats and people but has never met young kiddos. Roxy does have severe allergies, however, her mom is in an emergency situation and is praying to find her forever home ASAP. \n\nRoxy doesn't understand why she can't stay with her current owner and has some anxiety. It will take a little patience (and treats certainly won't hurt) for her to warm up to her new family. Shes a sweet girl that is unsure of the world and needs to know its all going to be okay!\n\nAdoption requirements are as such:\n\n\n\tDog experience \n\n\nPlease note, Roxy is part of Happy Trails Animal Rescues rehoming program. She has not been tested or evaluated and the information gathered is from the current owners personal statements regarding health and temperament. The owner is subject to placement outside of our organization. We cannot guarantee availability.",

            "description": "1/19/21 update: Magoo is doing very well in his foster home and enjoys sticking to his schedule. He is a vocal boy so an apartment would not be a good match as he might disturb the neighbors with his whining when he wants to go outside. He rarely barks. He enjoys going outside and being with his human. He is not a lap dog but likes to be next to his human and being pet. He is a very good and sweet boy. \n\n7/1/20: Magoo is a sweet older Chiweenie boy ~11 yrs old that was surrendered to us by from a domestic violence case.  His family loved him very much, but were unable to keep him so they reached out to see if we could help find a home for their special boy.  Magoo has hearing and some vision loss but loves to stay near his human and seems to find a way. He shys away from active dogs and activity in general, so he would do best with a quiet home and maybe a senior dog or two for him to retire in. He likes to lay near his human, but is not overly a lap dog. He does insist on following his human around the house or he will cry for your attention. He's housebroken, and sleeps in the bed against his foster mom... he will not jump off the bed due to mobility issues but will wake up his mom for assistance (normally because he is thirsty).  He enjoys short leash walks and likes to prance around.  He also likes to be carried, but can be a bit heavy at 12#. He is affectionate and likes to be petted and give kisses, but seems to have lost his bark. We want nothing more then to find this sweet older gentleman a home to call his own for whatever time he has left.  A reduced adoption donation of  $75 is being asked to cover a portion of his veterinary and care fees.  \n\nHe has been neutered, examined, treated for internal and external parasites, vaccinated and 4dx tested. For more information, please fill out an application from our website at allcreaturesbigandsmall.org or allcreaturesbigandsmall.petfinder.com!\n\nPlease copy and paste a completed adoption application from our homepage with your inquiry if you would like a response back. We get dozens of emails and phone calls each day with only an hour of \"free time\" to volunteer and answer them around our full-time jobs and family life...don't let your inquiry get passed by because of an incomplete application. Thanks in advance for your help!\n\nHelp our rescue by donating to our \"Spay the momma fund\". When adopting one of our babies, if each new family would contribute an extra $10 we can help out that babies mother by assisting with the cost of her spay. Help turn the momma into a pet rather than a breeding factory, donate today!\n\nAdoptions limited to a 1 hour radius of Pulaski, NY and pets must be viewed in person by all family members prior to adoption; animals will not be shipped to their new homes. Veterinary reference check and adoption donation also required. Check out our homepage for a full list of our adoption requirements.",

Michelle is a 6-8 year old pitbull terrier who weighs about 60 pounds. She is a quirky, smart and fun girl who knows what she likes....and doesn't! Michelle wants to be your only child, watch tv on your couch and look out your window to see what she can see! She has plenty of energy to strut around the neighborhood making you look good and is calm enough to snuggle up for a weekend of Netflix and chill! She is crate trained and house trained and has excellent indoor manners! \n\nA reduced adoption fee of $100 does apply for Michelle, our seniors, special medical and behavioral needs dogs and other \"slow to adopt\" dogs! \n\nAugusta Dog Adoptions is an all- volunteer, foster- based rescue. We take applications online and are scheduling individual adoptions in the Waynesboro, VA area during the pandemic.  A $175.00 adoption fee ($300 for puppies under 6 months old) helps us take care of all the dogs we rescue. All dogs are spayed/neutered, tested for heartworm and tick borne diseases (if old enough), microchipped, and vaccinated for rabies (if old enough), distemper/parvo and bordetella. They are also treated for internal and external parasites. Many dogs also receive extensive medical care such as dental work and major surgeries. For more information and to apply to adopt, please visit www.augustadogadoptions.org",

Boykin is such a sweet and loving old man, and he still has plenty of spunk left in him. He loves to fetch and play with balls and stuffed toys. He isn't the best at bringing a ball back and loves to pull all the stuffing out of toys. He does appreciate a comfy dog bed or couch for lots of naps throughout the day. Boykin does well with other dogs. He is scared of cats but does well with them. He is even good with pot Bellied pigs. Boykin\u2019s adoption fee is $175 and includes age appropriate vaccines, neuter and a microchip. He is heartworm positive but has started slow kill treatment. If you would like to meet him, please complete the application below.\n\nhttps://toolkit.rescuegroups.org/of/f?c=DMBCNVST",

A tragic accident took Dr. Boelter\u2019s life in December of 2017.  As a tribute to Dr. Boelter, a very special Canine Castaways supporter will pay the adoption fee for this dog's adoption..   For more information on \"Boelter's Bunch\", please visit http://www.caninecastaways.org/special-adoption-programs\n\nPlease consider opening your heart and home to a senior dog!\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THE FIRST STEP IS TO FILL OUT AN ADOPTION APPLICATION ON OUR WEBSITE AT:  \nhttps://www.caninecastaways.org/adoption-application\nIF A PET IS LISTED THEN THEY ARE AVAILABLE - WE KEEP OUR LISTINGS UP TO DATE AND REMOVE AS SOON AS ADOPTED.\n\nNAME:  Pepper\nBREED:  Chihuahua mix\nSEX:  female\nCOLOR:  black\nAGE:  10 yrs as of Aug 2020\nWEIGHT:  9 lbs\n\n\nFOSTERED BY: Nancy\nLOCATED IN:  Arcadia\n\n\nNOTES FROM FOSTER FAMILY:\n\nPepper is a very lovable girl.  She gets along great with other small dogs and cats. She loves to go for walks, look for squirrels and chase bugs. She also loves to pick out a comfy spot on the couch. She does well in a crate and does well in the house. She's  great with gentle kids and loves being petted.\n\nIt was obvious that Pepper had some allergy issues so we did all the testing to find out what was causing the problem.   She definitely cannot eat Chicken, duck or lamb in any form and is also allergic to storage and dust mites in addition to beet pulp.   \n\nShe is currently eating a fish based can diet but she could have some pork or beef in limited capacity since it is good to rotate foods/proteins around so that they get a variety of nutrients.  She CAN NOT eat any dry food or dry treats due to the fact that she is allergic to the storage mites - they are in all dry dog products.  This is a fairly common allergen and dogs with this allergy will need to eat canned, frozen food or could have home made balanced food as long as none of the items she is allergic to are in there.\n\n\nDue to COVID-19 we are a little more limited on volunteers and the availability (and safety) of home visits.   Local applications are given first priority and some out of town areas will not be able to be processed.\n\nAt this time, we will only be able to process applications that have an excellent current vet history.  If you haven\u2019t had a pet or verifiable vet history we will not be able to process your application.   \n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please complete our Adoption Application by copying and pasting the following link into your web browser: http://www.caninecastaways.org/adoption-application\n\nFor a full list of dogs we currently have for adoption use this link:  https://www.caninecastaways.org/adoptable-dogs\n\n\nMEDICAL INFO: \nThe following has been or will be done for this dog...\n- Basic Exam by Veterinarian\n- Spayed or Neutered\n- Heartworm Tested\n- Placed on heartworm preventive\n- Geriatric Bloodwork\n- Microchipped\n- Intestinal Parasite Exam and medication\n- Vaccinations\n- Placed on flea preventive\n- Dental, if needed\n\n\nADOPTION DONATION: \n$150 \n\nThis adoption donation helps to cover the vet expenses for this dog including heartworm preventive which is dispensed at the initial vet visit and then goes with the dog at adoption. All vet records will be provided to adopter.\n\n\nVisit us at www.caninecastaways.org",

He might run away a few times and try to hide under furniture that clearly doesn't hide him, but that's just a reflex, and a bit funny to watch. Among the cutest things you can experience is when he hears the food dish because he dances around the kitchen in excitement. Breckenridge would thrive in a gentle, low traffic home with patient humans. Follow is antics on Instagram @heckin.breck, and come meet this gentle guy, he wants to show you his adorable dance!",

This sweet 11 year old pup Molly needs to be fostered while the dust settles or indefinitely.\nMolly is a friendly girl but like many pitties is not great with other animals so is looking for a spot in a pet free home. Molly is up to date on her vetting and is healthy.\n\nPlease email us at AlmostHome4Dogs@yahoo.com to find out if Molly is the right one for you! (Local adoptions preferred - Philadelphia and tri-state area [South Jersey and northern Delaware] only.)\n\nPLEASE READ BEFORE CONTACTING US!\nWe are NOT a shelter: All of our dogs live in private homes with foster families. Come and meet the Almost Home dogs and their fosters at our Meet & Greet events, where you can learn more about our wonderful dogs from the people who live with them, find out which dogs are on their way and when they'll arrive, and fill out an application to adopt or foster.\n\nWe cannot adopt to homes where electric-shock fencing systems or training collars are used. For more information on the dangers of electric-shock collars, please visit banshockcollars.ca/studies.php and http://www.hollysden.com/say_no_to_shock.htm (scroll down and click on the \"Invisible Fencing Systems\" link).\n\nWe do not have an online adoption application; to request an application, e-mail us at AlmostHome4Dogs@yahoo.com. To speed e-mail processing time, be sure to note the name of the dog you are inquiring about in the Subject line. For Meet & Greet times and locations, visit our home page, where you also will find information on our adoption process and fees.\n\nFOSTER FAMILIES ARE LIFESAVERS!! Can you open your heart and home for a few weeks to homeless shelter dog? Remember, by fostering a dog, you save TWO lives - that of your foster dog, and that of the dog who takes his place in the shelter! Come to a Meet & Greet and find out if fostering is for you - there's no reward quite like the feeling that you've saved a life ... or two!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nMarley is such a special puppy! At just 2.5 yrs. old, this handsome, smart, sweet, affectionate, Labrador/ Hound mix boy has been waiting patiently in his kennel at Rescue Ridge in Monmouth County NJ. He walks very nicely on a leash, takes toys, treats, food gently, keeps his kennel clean, and just needs an active family or person. Best in a home with older children because Marley might knock the little ones down. He needs an experienced owner who will keep up with his training, particularly with his leash grabbing antics which he thinks is a game. He stops and listens when you let him know that leashes are for walking LOL. Marley is great in the car and is an active boy who is up for adventures. He also loves to sunbathe. Marley likes to pick his doggie friends so if you have one we would have to see if he is a good match. He would be just as happy as your only pet. Marley is a great dog who clearly had someone love him at some point. Will YOU love Marley and take him home in time for the Holidays? Please apply to adopt Marley at Rescueridge.com and if your application is a possible match a volunteer will get back to you within 72 hours. Please share.\n\nHere is Marley in his newest video\nhttps://youtu.be/rOrS9lNujCo\nHere is Marley in his previous video debut\nhttps://youtu.be/WNR7tXGxPFU",

I am afraid of loud noises especially thunderstorms. I like playing fetch, getting belly rubs, and bones. I do like playing and exercise but I also love my naps! \n\nI am currently looking for a new home as I don\u2019t get along with my littler siblings very well. I am an Australian cattle dog mix. We are known in the Guinness Book of World Record for the longest living dog. So, don\u2019t let my age scare you (I\u2019m about 10) I have lots of love to give! \n\n35-40 lbs, 10 years old, potty trained. \n\nhttps://www.jotform.com/luckymutts/adoption-application",

            "description": "Arlo is about two years old and came to us from Waukegan Animal Control. He came to us with kidney issues and is on medication to control it. Luckily, if you wrap his meds in cheese, he will gladly shake your hand for the honor of taking his meds. \n\nThis guy really loves his humans and spending time with them! He will sit with you on the couch or play fetch with his favorite squeaky pig toy or happily walk with you to the ends of the earth. He is super smart and already knows sit and shake and is working on being comfortable in his crate. \n\nArlo enjoys seeing other dogs on walks and greets them happily. He gets along with other dogs but would do fine as an only dog. He would do best in a home without cats or small children as he has exhibited a bit too much enthusiasm around cats and becomes protective around children. \n\nBlack dogs often get overlooked, but one great thing about black dogs and Arlo in particular is that his shiny black coat stays shiny and black even after a roll around in the dirt!\n\nThis guy is a total lover! He looks like a croissant when he sleeps and has the craziest bark that sounds like he swallowed a whistle. He looks forward to taking his human on tons of adventures. If you\u2019re interested in meeting Arlo, fill out a survey today at www.playersforpits.com/adoptionsurvey!",

Just like some people, I'm shy around strangers and I would love a buddy who can spend time with me and help me build confidence to feel more comfortable with new people and new situations. My special talent is fence climbing so the shelter staff is teaching me a new trick: how to walk on a leash.!\"  ~ Dodger\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIf you would like to meet, foster or adopt this pet, please fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser. EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

            "description": "Berkeley - Male - ~10-years-old - #0800\n\nHello Berkeley! Our new boy Berkeley was found as a stray, fending for himself with the help of his buddy Bentley. The boys had been on their own for a while; we believe they were living together before being abandoned. Berkeley is adorable, only 40 pounds, with a very unique coat. Age hard to define so conservatively we are listing as 10-year old for both boys. Thankfully he tested heartworm negative. Ber\nkeley is very sweet, dog and cat friendly, rode great in the car, just snoozed with his pal. He is house and doggy-door trained. Berkeley had the normal neglect issues but also chronic ear infections and a wound we are treating. Berkeley definitely likes to be with humans, the shelter learned if left outside alone he can unlock the gate, a very smart boy who tells you what he wants.\n\nBoth Berkeley and Bentley are thankfully in the same foster home, thanks to an amazing Foster Family. We would love for the boys to be adopted together if at all possible.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Berkeley or any GRRALL dog, please read our FAQs (https://grralliance.org/faq/) and submit an application at https://grralliance.org/applications/adoption-application/\n\nGRRALL serves the Dallas-Fort Worth/North Texas area. We do not have the resources to adopt outside this region and do not ship dogs. If you are outside our adoption area please contact your local Golden Retriever Rescue, local independent adoption groups, shelters, humane society, or other group to find your perfect forever friend.",

The boys had been on their own for a while; we believe they were living together before being abandoned. Bentley looks like a pup, age hard to define so conservatively we are listing as 10-year old for both boys. Bentley is very friendly, loves humans and other dogs, and cat tested wel\nl at the shelter. He is house and doggy-door trained, medium sized, 55 pounds. Bentley had the normal neglect issues, plus an eye-lid issue easily corrected by a quick procedure; unfortunately he is heartworm positive. Bentley will undergo heartworm treatment and then be ready for adoption.\n\nBoth Bentley and Berkeley are thankfully in same foster home, thanks to an amazing Foster Family. We would love for the boys to stay together if at all possible.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Bentley or any GRRALL dog, please read our FAQs (https://grralliance.org/faq/) and submit an application at https://grralliance.org/applications/adoption-application/\n\nGRRALL serves the Dallas-Fort Worth/North Texas area. We do not have the resources to adopt outside this region and do not ship dogs. If you are outside our adoption area please contact your local Golden Retriever Rescue, local independent adoption groups, shelters, humane society, or other group to find your perfect forever friend.\n1/30/21 11:58 PM",

We sprung her out of there but her foster home couldn't keep her due to a management change. She is currently in boarding with some great people but Sofia is looking for a foster or adoptive home of her own. She would do best in a quiet home with no other pets. She can be a goofy girl and can knock over smaller kids but she'd love to have a teenager to hang out with. She is a lover and enjoys all the petting and scratches! \n\nSofia loves rolling in the grass and soaking up the rays. Some days she's chill and other days she's silly. Even though she's an older gal, she's very spry and likes to bounce around sometimes. She loves to lean in to you for all the love.\n\nShe is housebroken, crate trained and great in the house. \n\nCan you help our golden girl enjoy her golden years?\n\nComplete the application at www.cbbr.org!",

Upon entering into our program, it was obvious that Jasmine has been neglected and has had many litters of puppies.\n\nJasmine is recovering and adjusting in a loving foster family and is ready to find her forever adoptive family.  She loves to play with the family's teenage children, is very gentle with everyone while doing that.  While her temperament is calm and laid back, she loves to go for leisurely walks, roll in the grass and smell the roses in her foster family's backyard,  Jasmine is housebroken and will do best in a quiet home where she will receive all the love and cuddles she so deserves.  While she gets along with her foster family's small dog, she would do best in a home without other big dogs or cats.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting sweet Jasmine and would like to learn more about her, please send us an email at contact@weimaranerrescue.org .  We are happy to communicate with you by email before asking you to submit an online application form.",

Some were dumped, abandoned in an empty house, left tied to a tree, picked up by animal control as strays, or simply unwanted by their owners. We ask that only serious and committed adopters apply as these dogs have suffered enough.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet please apply to adopt at\nhttp://www.wagsandwhiskerspetrescue.com/adopt.html\nif the pet is still available for adoption and you are approved to adopt we will contact you.\n\nCalling and checking the status of your application will not increase your chances of adoption",

Unfortunately Mama became pregnant and she had Mack. For the last two years they have been living under a semi truck in a business where the owner let them be security. Unfortunately the owner of Mack and Mama had to leave town. Mama is actually very well rounded and sweet but Mack has only know living under a truck for the 1 year of his life and he was actually abandoned their by himself for several months so he was frightened to new surroundings. Now that he has been reunited with Mama he is doing great but right now he does need to stay with Mama. Adoption fee is $200 for the pair. We would love to find a real home for these sweet dogs. They do great with other dogs and people although Mack may be frightened of children at first. Please contact AdoptAnimalNetwork@gmail.com",

            "description": "Oh hai, Manchego here! Just hanging out, looking handsome, doing what he does best! Manchego was in a foster home for several months and we learned ALL the things about him! He LOVES being with humans. and is very much a velcro dog. Manchego is well-behaved inside the house - he knows he has to wait to be invited on the couch, and he will wait adorably and patiently until you invite him. Manchego is house trained, crate trained, and very quiet - he rarely barks. He is also a quick learner and has mastered sit, shake, rollover, high five, lie down, and go to bed. (Check Manchego out in action here: https://youtube.com/watch?v=mC-T6w-9Ih8) Manchego is an affectionate, sensitive dog... cuddles are his favorite! He thinks he is a lap dog, and once he fully trusts you, he will try to give you one of his famous Manchego hugs. He also takes treats gently... peanut butter is his favorite, nom nom! Manchego is easily startled by joggers, cyclists, and scooters, so he'd prefer a lower-traffic area so he can enjoy his walks. Manchego's ideal home would be adult-only, quiet, and have a fenced yard. He is fearful of other dogs so he needs to be the only pet for now. The Orange Dot Crew (a volunteer advocacy group at Austin Animal Center) will be there every step of the way to make sure that Manchego is set up for success! I weigh approximately 62 lbs.

            "description": "UPDATE - Winston was adopted in August and returned because he needs training. He can be jumpy on people and has has accidents in the house.\n\nWINSTON - 2 years old, 60 pounds, house trained, good with kids, cats, dogs, a snuggler, very high energy, loves to run and play, always by your side.\n\nWinston ended up in the Virginia Beach Animal Care and Adoption Center along with his sister, Nala, after their family got military orders to move to Japan. The dogs were with this family for a while now although both are still young. Winston is a player. He loves to play. He has very high energy and will definitley need lots of daily activity including exercise, playtime, and attention. He is the dog who will follow you around. You go to the kitchen, he will go to the kitchen. You run upstairs for a blanket to snuggle under while watching Netflix, he will run upstairs following at your heels and then he'll be that dog who will snuggle with you on the sofa. Winston is a friendly boy who will take lots of your time so if you enjoy free time and not having to answer to anyone, you might want to try another dog. Winston is a lover and a leaner. He is already house trained and good with everyone! Bring your crew in to meet him and let's see if we have a good match! Remember just because a meet and greet goes well at the shelter, chaperoning at home is vital to the successful integration of a new dog into a home. Winston is available for appointments; call 385-4444 or go to our Facebook page to make that appointment. Thanks for choosing adoption!",

Lucy and Winston are a bonded pair and will NOT be separated.\n\nLucy (brown/tan) is a 2 yr (DOB 2018) old little girl who is very shy with new people and can be a barker with new people.  She can nip if she feels threatened therefoere several visits with a portial adopter is a MUST.  She loves her little buddy Winston and loves to play fetch with her toys.  As long as  you are willing to throw, she is willing to run and fetch.  Once she knows you she is very loving and a good girl.  She is like a big sister to her buddy Winston.  \n\nWinston is a 1 yr old (DOB 2019) long hair chi boy who is so loving!  He is high energy too!  He is always on the move and loves his big sister Lucy.  This little guy has to kiss, kiss, kiss as long as you let him.  He is also very very fast so extra precaution is a MUST to keep him safe.  He and Lucy get into tug of wars with toys.\n\nThis little couple came to our rescue when their owner passed away. They have never been around children.  They are very bonded and together at all times.  They love to run and having a secure fenced yard with no escape routes and gate are a MUST.\n\nBecause Lucy is very shy with new people, we will do more than one visit to help her feel comfortable.  Winston loves everybody!\n\nThese two are adorable and will bring so much joy to the family they choose.\n\nAdoption Fee - $800\n\nPlease submit adoption application here - www.ckanimalrescue.com \n",

            "description": "My name is Ginger. I am a gorgeous little red headed angel....but sometimes my halo may get a little bit tilted....BUT DON'T let that stop you from coming to see me because we really could become the best of friends. I get along with some dogs, I just am dog selective. I also hear that some hooomans are the same way with other hooomans. I just need a home that will give me a chance to be your best friend. I have so much to offer the right family! So much love! I just haven't been shown it a lot in my past, until I moved up here to WI and met these great hooomans at the Forest County Humane Society. They showed me its ok to let my guard down and that all hooomans are not bad! Once I see that you are one of the good hooomans, I will love you forever and do anything I can to show you how big of a heart I have. If you want to go for a walk with me, please call the FCHS so they can talk to you about meeting me. They understand me, so I trust these hooomans will help me. Please let them help you too! Please give me a chance! You won't be disappointed! \nIf you would like to see a video of me please go to http://bit.ly/AdoptableDogVideos\nSL # 268240For best response to an inquiry about this animal, please visit www.forestcountyhumanesociety.org, fill out an application and return it to us.

Sweet, loving and beautiful with those gorgeous blue eyes. She is a beauty and would make a great pet with patience and love. She weighs about 55 lbs and is 2 to 3 years old. She is very playful and needs another dog to play with and be with. She is shy but will be a great addition to a family who's looking for a sweet, playful girl like her.",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Paco!\n\nI'm a 19-month-old American Staffordshire Terrier. My foster mom says I'm the sweetest Staffie she has ever fostered (and she has fostered many). Inside the house, I'm very polite. I've already got a bunch of commands (sit, stay, leave, place...) down. I'm not possessive with my food, toys, nor my bed, and I only do my \"business\" outside the house. I also never bark! I usually go along with the rhythm of the household. If everybody is out working I will patiently wait and chill but oh boy, if they get back home and they want to play, I'm ready to give it my all.\n\nMy foster mom also says I'm a great cuddle buddy. We can just veg out and watch movies together on our couch. I'm very friendly with humans and any visitors that come to the house. My only downside is that I'm reactive to other dogs when walking on a leash. I need someone very strong and attentive to keep up with me. The good thing is, I've been training with an E-Collar and it seems to be working out great.\n\nI can't wait to find my forever home. Ideally, my dream home would be a home with energetic and adventurous adults and maybe some teenagers to play with me and help me release some of my energy, and of course, a family that's willing to give me lots and lots of love, just like my fosters do.\n\nAre you ready to receive Paco's love and affection?\n\nIf so, please submit a completed\nadoption application found\nat www.doggiebonez.com so that we can schedule a meet and greet. He is also on all of our social media pages IG: @Doggie_Bonez_Inc_ and Facebook: Doggie Bonez.\n\nIf adoption isn't an option, please consider fostering one of our pups. We are a volunteer-run non-profit dog rescue and always welcome new short or long-term doggie foster families. We much appreciate the help and time of our fosters. You provide all the love, comfort, and safety of a home, and we supply you with everything else you may need, dog food, dog bed, toys, medical attention (if required), etc. If you are interested, please visit www.doggiebonez.com to see all of our available dogs who need a foster family while waiting for their fur-ever home and complete the foster application.",

I love my humans and I am protective of them. I really love attention from them. I am still a puppy, so I am working on not chewing things. I love to go on car rides and I am really good meeting new people while I am out. Like I said, I get really attached to my humans, so I will need someone willing to take the time for me to adjust to a new home. I should be in a home that does not have children. I love to play with other dogs - I live in a home with several right now! I can get a little jealous, so it would be ideal if I were an only dog. I am always happy, love belly rubs, long walks on a leash and cuddle sessions. Could I be your 'pawfect match'?",

She had 2 pups when she was turned over to the rescue and had a painful infection where her pups could not feed and had to be bottle fed. I am very sweet and love affection, i am good with other dogs. I love to give kisses and hugs. I am looking for my forever home.",

She was born in open desert and survived thanks to the kindness of strangers who left food and water on a daily basis. We were able to catch Olivia, her brother Oliver (aka Ollie) and their mother. A TOUGH CATCH! They are wholesome, healthy and sociable with other dogs. Her adoption fee is $450 which covers the cost of her spay, all core vaccines (Rabies and Distemper/Parvo), flea & tick medications, microchip and microchip registration. If you are interested in adopting, please complete an application, available on our website, poochmatch.com, under the adoption tab and please read the paragraphs below for more details on our process.\n\nIf this listing is still posted, we are still accepting applications for him/her. We do not do out-of-state adoptions on highly adoptable dogs; we would only consider out-of-state adoptions for dogs that prove hard-to-place locally. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nUPDATE: ADOPTION EVENTS CANCELLED DUE TO PANDEMIC AND SOCIAL DISTANCING. If you are interested in meeting any Poochmatch dog at our weekly adoption event on Saturdays at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda, CA (5521 Mirage St.) between 1-5 PM, please fill out an application from our website, poochmatch.com, and submit it no later than 11 AM on Fridays. Upon receipt AND approval, the dog you are interested in meeting will be made available to meet on a Saturday. Due to the high volume of dogs and puppies in our foster homes, it is impossible to bring them all every Saturday. The only way to ensure that the dog that you are interested in will be at the adoption event is to FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AND BE APPROVED. Otherwise, we cannot guarantee that the dog you are interested in will be at our adoption event. If you cannot make the time frame of our events, appointments can be made at another time and location solely at the discretion of the foster parent. Please understand that private appointments will be coordinated to meet the convenience of the foster parent/transporter. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nAll adoption fees cover the mandatory and non-negotiable spay/neuter, rabies, microchip, microchip registration, full sets of core vaccinations (rabies and 1 set of distemper/parvo for adults, 4 for puppies) and deworming. Adoption fees vary based on age, breed, size and the costs incurred on the dog's behalf by us i.e. medical, behavioral training, etc. and they range from $225-$495.\n\n\nCOVID-19 PROCEDURE:\nIn an effort to create a safe environment for our potential adopters and our staff, we have changed our protocols and procedures during these difficult times. Starting immediately, our procedures will change from what\u2019s written on our website and other social media platforms. Our weekly adoption event at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda is temporarily cancelled due to COVID-19 and social distancing. The only way to meet one of the dogs/puppies we have available for adoption is through completion of our adoption application through our website, poochmatch.com, before 11 AM on Fridays. On Fridays when we review the applications, we will pick the best fit for each dog or puppy applied for and coordinate mutually agreeable appointment times for the applicants who are approved that week. Private appointments are currently only scheduled on Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday of each week. Masks or bandanas are mandatory; faces must be properly covered.\n\nWith the overwhelming desire of the public to adopt at this time, we have received as many as 30 applications for one dog in just one week. Working with a staff of volunteers, we are only able to reach out on Fridays to the people we have approved to adopt. If you have not heard from us by Friday, we have selected a different applicant. If you have multiple dogs/puppies that you are interested in, please indicate each dog/puppy of interest on the application at that time so we don\u2019t rule you out for another dog/puppy available for adoption.\n\nPlease understand, we have an influx of texts, phone calls and emails that makes it impossible to get to each and every one of you. Not just for adoption interest, but also from veterinarians, people who must relinquish dogs, people who have found a stray dog in need of pick up, etc. We are currently not in need of fosters. Due to the fact that there is such a high demand, we are sticking with strict protocol to not adopt out of Southern California. We apologize for this inconvenience and difficulty to be able to get in touch with us while there is an overwhelming desire and demand to adopt at this time. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we navigate through these difficult times with every intention to keep the public and our staff safe.",

Private appointments are currently only scheduled on Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday of each week. Masks or bandanas are mandatory; faces must be properly covered.\n\nWith the overwhelming desire of the public to adopt at this time, we have received as many as 30 applications for one dog in just one week. Working with a staff of volunteers, we are only able to reach out on Fridays to the people we have approved to adopt. If you have not heard from us by Friday, we have selected a different applicant. If you have multiple dogs/puppies that you are interested in, please indicate each dog/puppy of interest on the application at that time so we don\u2019t rule you out for another dog/puppy available for adoption.\n\nPlease understand, we have an influx of texts, phone calls and emails that makes it impossible to get to each and every one of you. Not just for adoption interest, but also from veterinarians, people who must relinquish dogs, people who have found a stray dog in need of pick up, etc. We are currently not in need of fosters. Due to the fact that there is such a high demand, we are sticking with strict protocol to not adopt out of Southern California. We apologize for this inconvenience and difficulty to be able to get in touch with us while there is an overwhelming desire and demand to adopt at this time. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we navigate through these difficult times with every intention to keep the public and our staff safe.",

            "description": "One of a pair of hybrid type fellows who arrived via a small rescue in the Sacramento area. Cysco is smaller and likely perhaps to be part Coyote. These are truly delightful creatures, playful and silly, who just love romping and playing in the wooded hills at our Sanctuary! They have two delightful girlfriends in their pack and the foursome immediately took to each other like long lost friends (or family members!) Cysco is not a dog who chooses human company, though he is sweet, sensitive, curious and does engage, but chooses dogs over humans. We respect that choice and give him and the others the time and a big space to call home - eventually in the right circumstances with the right kinds of people and other dog(s) we can consider placing them, or they'll stay here and have their friends and good food and a happy life!\n\nThank you for considering adoption of a Milo Foundation Sanctuary dog.\nOur Sanctuary is where our rescued dogs who have had difficulty in a home in the past, have behavioural issues, or too much energy, or for some, aggression issues with other dogs, or intense stranger danger that make them more difficult to safely and happily live in urban environments.\nThese are not beginner dogs or for the most part nor are they for families with children. IF you are looking for an easy dog to add to your family, we suggest looking at the dogs at our Adoption Center, Milo Pt Richmond. \nBUT, if you can offer a safe and nurturing home to a dog with some behavioural \"quirks\" please do send an application today. Thank you.",

Speaking of the outdoors, I love to play fetch with tennis balls. You need two though as I havent mastered the release concept. While I love to play, I am not an all play all day kind of gal. My day is only complete once Ive curled up in someones lap for some serious attention. Im over the moon for belly rubs and ear scratches. Your reward - a kiss or two! Since someone is sure to tell, Im just going to say this up front. My nickname is the Squeaky Toy Terminator. Its true, no squeaky toy is safe from me. I would be the perfect tough toy tester. Tennis balls fair much better, but I can pop them too! Im good natured, have tons of personality, and would love to share my life with you. If your looking for a fun loving, loving gal then call the the shelter and ask for Charlie Blue.\n\n \n\nAttachments area",

            "description": "Gable is a little over a year and a half old and very handsome. He LOVES water. He will splash in a kiddie pool or get in a stream or pond happily. He can play with other dogs supervised. He's not aggressive but he plays hard. A big dog who also plays hard would be best if there is another dog but he needs guidance on what is appropriate. He's a bit rambunctious with cats- barks and tries to play with them so that may not be a good idea.\n\nHe is young with a high energy level. He loves to play fetch. He would make a great hiking buddy or running buddy (he can run really fats it's quite impressive). Even just a nice long walk would be okay with him. He will need daily exercise. He is food motivated so highly trainable and very smart. If he's had his play time or walks, he will absolutely be happy to cuddle up with you or lay down in his crate to chew on a bone. He is crate trained and goes in on command. It's his safe place to relax. He is house trained and also knows a doggy door. He has never chewed on anything he shouldn't. He sits and waits nicely for his food.\n\nHe does have some leash manners but can be distracted by bunnies and birds when out walking. He is scared of new people who come into his home so he would need a low traffic home that doesn't have a lot of visitors. His humans need to understand that he needs time to get used to new people at his own pace and not to force it. Once he's bonded to his humans, he loves them with all of his heart and wants to be loved in return. He adores kids. \n\nBecause Gable has bully characteristics, BSL restrictions will apply. Must own home & cannot live in a breed restricted area.\n\nEstimated DOB: 1/10/19\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

If you would like to try a Foster to Adopt trial, please fill out an Adoption Application.\n\nIf you are only interested in temporarily Fostering one of our rescues, please fill out a Foster Application.\n\nMeet Betty! UPDATE 1-17-21 : Betty was adopted in September 2020 and sadly, her family has relinquished her back to ARWOB. This was not Betty's fault, as her adopter stated that the family realized they are not ready to have a dog. They feel she would be better off with a family that can give her more attention and who has a bigger home with a yard. Here is what they have to say about Betty: 'I cannot emphasize what a great pup she is. Overall she is house trained, but occasionally will chew on a sock, sandal or a cord (but the cord thing was our fault because we should have kept it out of reach). She will use the pee pad when the family is home with her, but she will hold it when we leave her alone. When she is home alone, she has access to the pee pad, but does not use it often. The longest she has been home alone is 5 hours. She sleeps at night in her crate without issue. However, she naps in the day on my son's bed or sofa chair. She just loves children and other dogs. She can sometimes be skittish around bigger dogs, but then she warms up after a while. We have traveled (by car) outside of San Diego county and she does great in car rides. And I am impressed how she is not a barker. She will occasionally bark but it's never continuous. We have taught her to 'sit' in Spanish and she will listen to 'stay' unless she gets really excited. We have her on a regular walking schedule of 3-4 times a day so she gets her exercise.' ORIGNINAL RESCUE STORY :\nBetty is an adorable terrier mix, who was rescued off the streets of Tijuana in early July and is a great little pup! Betty will likely be full grown in the 20-25 pound range as a typical small breed mix. Like all pups, she is very outgoing and will need an adopter who is willing to enroll her in dog training classes. She is already crate trained and is getting the hang of house training. She is not a very vocal small breed dog, which is great. She loves dogs, cats and kids. She is very sweet and a little nervous when first meeting new people, but quickly relaxes. Betty is scheduled to be spayed on 9/4 in the San Diego area, and as such we prefer adopters who are local to San Diego, as it will be a requirement for her adopters to be able to drive Betty to and from her spay appointment. Betty is ready to go home as soon 8/1 The meet and greet will be scheduled in the 92117 area and we are accepting applications now. Please submit online at www.arwob.org Don't wait...Submit an adoption application today! If you would like to meet one of our animals, PLEASE fill out an adoption application.\n\nDog Adoption Application\n\nCat Adoption Application\n\nPLEASE NOTE:\nIF YOU ARE IN THE MILITARY\nplease fill out a short questionnaire in addition to the adoption application.\n\nMilitary Questionnaire",

All 3 of her babies have been adopted. She is still very timid and shy. She would not do well with small children and she likely needs a home that is pretty calm. She needs an adopter with lots of love and patience who would be willing to come visit with her several times before taking her home.

Maia loves to spend time outside, thinks she's a lap dog and enjoys treats (especially cheese). When we get home Maia greets us with excitement and her tail wagging to the point her whole backside shakes. Maia is much better walking past animals during her long walks but she needs to be the only pet in her new home. Maia needs a family that will be patient as she adjusts. This little lady let's you know she wants attention by pushing her nose into your hand for some petting and affection. She will also roll over and enjoy a good belly rub when you're willing to give one. Maia likes to play with toys and her teenage foster brother even taught her to fetch. Although she doesn't always give it back. You should definitely make plans to meet this beautiful, 5yr old Kelpie mix in hopes of adding her to your family. 60lbs Born around 2016. \n\nAdoption fee is $175 and includes DHPP & rabies vaccinations heartworm testing spay/neuter surgery deworming and microchip. All animals are examined by a veterinarian. Please fill out our application at https://gkarma.wufoo.com/forms/good-karma-pet-rescue-dog-adoption-screening/; if you are interested in meeting or adopting this dog and we will be in touch right away!",

            "description": "Say hello to Maia. She still has a few quirks from spending time in boarding but she is very affectionate and a great dog!! Maia loves to spend time outside, thinks she's a lap dog and enjoys treats (especially cheese). When we get home Maia greets us with excitement and her tail wagging to the point her whole backside shakes. Maia is much better walking past animals during her long walks but she needs to be the only pet in her new home. Maia needs a family that will be patient as she adjusts. This little lady let's you know she wants attention by pushing her nose into your hand for some petting and affection. She will also roll over and enjoy a good belly rub when you're willing to give one. Maia likes to play with toys and her teenage foster brother even taught her to fetch. Although she doesn't always give it back. You should definitely make plans to meet this beautiful, 5yr old Kelpie mix in hopes of adding her to your family. 60lbs Born around 2016. \n\nAdoption fee is $175 and includes DHPP & rabies vaccinations heartworm testing spay/neuter surgery deworming and microchip. All animals are examined by a veterinarian. Please fill out our application at https://gkarma.wufoo.com/forms/good-karma-pet-rescue-dog-adoption-screening/; if you are interested in meeting or adopting this dog and we will be in touch right away!",

I came from a really bad hoarding situation where the breeder got shut down by the state. Since I wasn't socialized much, i am very timid and shy. I need a patient family with lots of knowledge and love on helping me to become a strong member of the family. I can do well with the right family, i get along with other dogs and people and still learning life outside of a kennel. My rescue would like to keep me and my sister together, since we are so bonded.",

            "description": "Little Tessie is the cutest little girl around. She is around 2 years old and only weighs about 20lbs. She came to us from a high kill shelter from Texas and she is definitely one shy pup. Tessie does take a bit to warm up to her human family (she is especially timid around men) but it seems like other dogs really help her to come out of her shell (she would thrive in a multi-dog home). According to her foster family she is super sweet when she becomes comfortable in her surroundings.\n\nWe are requiring that Tessie's future family have a fenced in yard to help assure her safety while she becomes comfortable and confident in her forever home.\n\nTessie is dog friendly however with any multi-dog families we recommended following a two week shutdown to help ensure success in your adoption. \n\nIf interested in applying to adopt with us please fill out an application and one of our application processors will contact you as soon as possible. We appreciate your patience.\nhttps://goo.gl/AzrASu\n\nThank you for adopting and helping save a life!!",

I'm looking for an active home that can keep me busy but the most important thing to me is to be able to be around my people who I love to cuddle with on the couch, watching t.v., at the end of the day.  \n\nI get super excited around other dogs so the great folks at MomsVA think I would do best as an only dog or in a home with a young, very playful, middle- to large-sized male dog. My forever home should not have cats as I have a very strong prey drive. I\u2019m kinda bouncy, so young children would not be best right now because I might accidentally knock them over in my excitement.  \n\nEven after my rough start in life, I am still full of joy and silliness. I make my foster family laugh every day!  If you are looking for a loyal and loving furry family member and think we could be a match,  go to www.momsva.org and complete an application.",

Unfortunately Mama became pregnant and she had Mack. For the last two years they have been living under a semi truck in a business where the owner let them be security. Unfortunately the owner of Mack and Mama had to leave town. Mama is actually very well rounded and sweet but Mack has only know living under a truck for the 1 year of his life and he was actually abandoned their by himself for several months so he was frightened to new surroundings. Now that he has been reunited with Mama he is doing great but right now he does need to stay with Mama. Adoption fee is $200 for the pair. We would love to find a real home for these sweet dogs. They do great with other dogs and people although Mack may be frightened of children at first. Please contact AdoptAnimalNetwork@gmail.com",

            "description": "This fine lady is Linda! Linda is a young adult (probably around 2 years old) and she's an Anatolian Shepherd. Linda's trying on her holiday outfit, and we must say she looks smashing!!! Linda has been with us for a while now, and we are committed to finding Linda the wonderful home that she deserves! Some info on Linda: she was found as a stray and it was discovered that she had an old injury that required surgery and removal of her leg. Linda stayed with us through her surgery and rehab, and she's adjusted quite well to her \"new normal\" (2020 was \"a year\" for everyone!). Linda loves her people and she did have a stint in a foster trial, where we learned that she is SO excited about other dogs, that she needs a handler who can help channel that excitement. We've worked with Linda to socialize her and give her lots of positive experiences with dogs, and she has made a number of doggy friends here. The challenge is actually limiting her play, since her one hind leg can only handle so much (she's a very large girl, so her handlers must be mindful as Linda would easily over do it!). Linda is only around 2 years old, and we think she's an Anatolian Shepherd (or mix). Linda needs a home with no cats, and preferably some non-slip floors! Due to her size and need for continued socialization, we think she'd do best in an adult only home. If you have the experience and time to devote to this sweet girl, please send us a message today!",

            "description": "(Version fran\u00e7aise disponible ici: \nhttps://www.sitwithme.ca/fr/dogs/sprite/ ) \n\n\nSprite\n\nAmerican Bulldog / Terrier mix\n\n1,5  year\n\nFemale\n\n \n\nDogs: Yes to a friendly, similar sized and non-confrontational (playful) dog. Meet and greet near Ottawa required.\n\nCats: Not sure, we will update when we know but for now, no.\n\nKids: No, thank you.  She actually is friendly with kids but a kid-free home life is needed (keep reading).\n\nHousing: Detached only \u2013 no attached housing!\n\nFenced-in Yard: Required  or a private country setting where she would be always supervised (ie. never left out alone) on a long line could work too instead of a fence!\n\nSpecial Needs: Sprite has separation anxiety.  We have discovered that an empty room with an open crate and lots of puzzles and bones does the trick!  She can now be left successfully but we are looking for a home where someone is home more often. To apply, you must have a designated room in the home for this muffin.\n\n*Sprite has bully features and as such, we will only place her within Ottawa or outside of Ontario within 2 hours of Ottawa where there is no breed specific legislation.  She needs a meet and greet before being matched and so the home must be within driving distance.*\n\n\n\nSprite is such a sweet dog.  She loves deeply and is an obliging cuddler, if you will have her.  She is smart, eager to please and super cute.  She loves to go for long walks and while she pulls initially in excitement, this quickly lessens as she heads out for her 4km walk.  Yes, this gal loves to play, loves to investigate, loves to go on adventures and would love a dedicated human to continue the great work her foster mom has started.  She\u2019s looking to be someone\u2019s heart-dog and we know she has all the makings to be exactly that for her future person/couple, but she still has work ahead, so keep reading!\n\n \n\nWhen meeting new people, treats go a long way.  Sometimes she will bark if she is unsure, but she can easily be won over with kindness and FOOD!  That sweet wiggle butt of hers is the best! Food is a great tool to encourage this gal to be brave in a sometimes overwhelming world.  Forced handling or loud voices can overwhelm Sprite and so this delicate flower (she\u2019s really not that delicate) would love someone who will encourage her in life.  \n\n \n\nSprite is a playful and sometimes over-exuberant as a canine play buddy.  She never means anything malicious by her rough or excited play, but this is why it is important that any dog in the home is non-confrontational.  She does not share food or toys well with other dogs and so while we believe she would love having another playful dog in the home, the toys/bones/food will need to be properly managed (put away when both dogs are out).  She may be okay with cats based on her shelter assessment but we have not yet tested her.  Hopefully we can do so soon.\n\n \n\nWhen she is over-aroused (often when her person comes home), she does not manage that excitement boost well.  She then becomes \u201cnippy\u201d.  She is not trying to be difficult or aggressive, but she does need to be let outside and ignored until she calms down on her own.  This is why small kids in the home are not ideal even though when she is calmer, she does well to say hello and hang out.  This behaviour will need to be managed calmly and as such, she will need a dedicated human to work with her to be the best girl she can be.\n\n \n\nSprite struggled with crate training due to a neglectful past.  We worked very hard to find a solution because Sprite was such a sweet girl and we did not want her past to define her.  We discovered after working through many options, that having an empty room for her, along with an open crate with a blanket, a few bones, a few toys and some treat puzzles was the solution!  She now happily runs to her room when her foster mom has to head out and can be left for hours at a time without an accident.  Of course, she does get stressed which is why we are hoping to find someone that works from home, works shorter days at the office, or only works a couple of days a week instead of the usual 5. \n\n \n\nSprite is the most endearing, beautiful, dedicated, loving and cuddly gal a person can ask for but she also needs some help to be the best girl she can.  She has a super wiggle butt, will happily share your bed at night and keep you safe from all of the monsters underneath, and gives pretty great kisses too.  If you have the dedication to be this girl\u2019s forever person, please complete an application here: http://www.sitwithme.ca/Sprite\n\n",

She\u2019s approximately 4-5 years old, spayed & entered the Sarasota shelter on 4/4/19. Paris has a fun, spunky spirit which everyone loves.

Paris loves the sun & can often be found sunbathing in the kennel yards. \n\nCome meet this sweet girl for yourself & fall in love with Paris.

            "description": "Lily is absolutely the bees knees!! A true diamond in the RUFF! One year ago Lily was picked up as a stray in Wichita, KS, obviously a new momma (just a baby herself), taken to a kill shelter where she was euth listed due to fear - sadly her puppies were never looked for or found. Thankfully, a rescue stepped up to save her life with moments to spare. \nLily is estimated to be just over a year and a half, still a boisterous youngster, FUN, full of energy, and eager to please! Sadly, Lily had a rough start in life and quickly learned that humans aren't always kind, which has led to some trust issues and feeling she needs to be protective of her space - but once she trusts you, she's an absolute JOY! \nBecause of this, Lily needs an experienced adopter, willing to go slow and respect her boundaries to build trust, someone that can be a strong leader with a gentle hand to help her continue to shine like the diamond she is. She is smart as a whip, corrects easily with words, and can pick up on tonal cues - plus she's VERY food motivated! \nLily can be selective about her doggie friends, as she has some alpha tendencies, but truly enjoys the company of a social submissive canine companion that doesn't make her feel challenged/threatened. She would do best paired with a playful canine who can show her the ropes of being a dog and help her blossom. \n**No cats - as she has a high prey drive.**\n**No young children - as she can be mouthy when over stimulated, or reactive if startled/feels threatened.**\nLily LOVES walks, belly rubs, bones, rides in the car, and \"killing\" toys, but her most favorite pastime is digging up rocks in the yard. She's quite the amateur geologist and has a fantastic collection!!\nLike all young dogs, Lily will benefit from a healthy exercise regimen (jogging partner?) and continued obedience training. She does pull on leash and can be reactive if she sees another dog or small critter that needs to be chased - but she is getting better! Lily is house broken and knows \"kennel,\" \"treat,\" \"come,\" \"sit,\" \"down,\" \"off,\" \"paw,\" & \"sit up.\" We are currently working on \"heel,\" \"drop it,\" & \"stay.\" Come meet Lily!! We promise she will steal your heart!! ?",

If you are interested in a specific animal, please email info@evessanctuary.com with the name of the animal you are interested in written on the subject line. Please remember that ESAR requires a full complete application, an interview, and a home visit prior to final approval and placement of adopted animals. It may seem daunting at first, but to find true love its worth it, right? They aren't products on a shelf to buy, we love them like our own, and only want the best possible home for each and every one...thus the \"hoops.\" Also, please trust our recommendations, we are skilled human furry freind matchmakers with many years of experience that has given us a unique and solid perspective. For these reasons we prefer adopters to be in NYC or the immediate area accessible by public transportation so we can work with you individually and educate you face to face!\nAdditionally, please understand that we are all volunteers, no salaries are paid, we have families and pets of our own, and we have full time jobs in addition to doing rescue work - so we may be (at times) slow-ish to get back to you. We promise we are doing our best as its in everyones best interest to place these darlings quickly, so we can save more. If you would like to expedite the process, and make us extra happy, please download our application from our website at: http://www.evessanctuary.org/Adoption.html , fill it out, and return it with your initial email inquiry. Be patient, be persistent, be polite, and we promise all will be well! ;-)\nAll animals come up to date on annual combo vaccs, rabies vaccs, heartworm tested negative, microchipped, and of course...spayed or neutered!",

If you are interested in a specific animal, please email info@evessanctuary.com with the name of the animal you are interested in written on the subject line. Please remember that ESAR requires a full complete application, an interview, and a home visit prior to final approval and placement of adopted animals. It may seem daunting at first, but to find true love its worth it, right? They aren't products on a shelf to buy, we love them like our own, and only want the best possible home for each and every one...thus the \"hoops.\" Also, please trust our recommendations, we are skilled human furry freind matchmakers with many years of experience that has given us a unique and solid perspective. For these reasons we prefer adopters to be in NYC or the immediate area accessible by public transportation so we can work with you individually and educate you face to face!\nAdditionally, please understand that we are all volunteers, no salaries are paid, we have families and pets of our own, and we have full time jobs in addition to doing rescue work - so we may be (at times) slow-ish to get back to you. We promise we are doing our best as its in everyones best interest to place these darlings quickly, so we can save more. If you would like to expedite the process, and make us extra happy, please download our application from our website at: http://www.evessanctuary.org/Adoption.html , fill it out, and return it with your initial email inquiry. Be patient, be persistent, be polite, and we promise all will be well! ;-)\nAll animals come up to date on annual combo vaccs, rabies vaccs, heartworm tested negative, microchipped, and of course...spayed or neutered!",

            "description": "Jexster had a very hard life before coming to rescue and will need time to heal. He is still very afraid of people and we are working hard to try to show him that we aren't all as bad as he must have learned early on.  If you are a very experienced home who knows how to work with a behavior case dog, please apply - otherwise understand that it will be awhile longer before we answer any inquiries on his angel. He's not bad to the bone, just tramatized and currently deathly afraid. But he is learning to trust more each day...\n\nEve's Sanctuary does not have a public location to visit, although we do weekly adoption events in public locations on the UWS. If you are interested in a specific animal, please email info@evessanctuary.com with the name of the animal you are interested in written on the subject line. Please remember that ESAR requires a full complete application, an interview, and a home visit prior to final approval and placement of adopted animals. It may seem daunting at first, but to find true love its worth it, right? They aren't products on a shelf to buy, we love them like our own, and only want the best possible home for each and every one...thus the \"hoops.\" Also, please trust our recommendations, we are skilled human furry freind matchmakers with many years of experience that has given us a unique and solid perspective. For these reasons we prefer adopters to be in NYC or the immediate area accessible by public transportation so we can work with you individually and educate you face to face!\nAdditionally, please understand that we are all volunteers, no salaries are paid, we have families and pets of our own, and we have full time jobs in addition to doing rescue work - so we may be (at times) slow-ish to get back to you. We promise we are doing our best as its in everyones best interest to place these darlings quickly, so we can save more. If you would like to expedite the process, and make us extra happy, please download our application from our website at: http://www.evessanctuary.org/Adoption.html , fill it out, and return it with your initial email inquiry. Be patient, be persistent, be polite, and we promise all will be well! ;-)\nAll animals come up to date on annual combo vaccs, rabies vaccs, heartworm tested negative, microchipped, and of course...spayed or neutered!",

However, if you are patient with me I will come around and once I know I can trust you, I will be your best friend.

Here is his video collage in NC & SC:\nhttps://youtu.be/5ym6uYdr5GY\n\nRocco is 5 years old (approx. DOB 6-26-15), male, 52 lbs., vetted, is or will be neutered, and micro-chipped. This handsome poor boy was found homeless in the road trying to do a \"self surgery\" in NC and dragging a hanging pendulas cannonball tumor (since surgically removed). A good Samaritan stopped and picked him up to bring him to the shelter for help. Then June 3rd happened when our Founder happened to be making an in person visit to the shelter to help some dogs. As soon as she saw Rocco she knew he stood little chance of making it out as no one would want to take on the medical bills. The P4P Community stepped up and contributed to help us Rescue him and cover medical bills! He is doing great now as you can see! He is a sweet boy that assessed well with other dogs; he can't wait for his new furever home!\n\nStay tuned for more information as Rocco is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in fostering or adopting Rocco please fill out an Application at\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out his Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

For more information and the adoption application for Oak, please visit our website belowhttp://www.coastalgsr.org/dog_profile.php?ID=22313&name=OakOaks never met a person he didnt think loved him more than French fries and would have no problem asking strangers for attention and affection. Hes super smart, knows his basic commands, is good on a leash, and eager to work for food. Around 1-2 years old, Oak loves his walks and has been good with everyone he's met. Leash walking seemed fairly new to him when rescued, but hes mastered that task. All Oak dreams of is an active home who can provide him with the structure a young pup needs so that he'll grow up to be a respectful, happy boy who will continue spreading his joy all over Southern California. Oak wasn't previously socialized with other dogs and doesn't do well with them. Because of this, he needs to be the only dog in the household and isnt compatible with apartment living. The minimum adoption donation for adults is $375 and the adoption donation for puppies is $500. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is tax deductible. The adoption donation provides that all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis ( i.e., puppies who will need to be altered by 6 mos old). Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.",

I like to go for walks/ short runs and to just relax and soak up the sunshine. The vet thinks I am 4.5 years old according to my teeth, but I am still full of energy and love to run and play. I love to snuggle and get attention. I do have some minimal medical needs that the great people who saved me can discuss with you if you choose to make me a member of your family. I will be spayed, vaccinated, microchipped and HW negative with monthly preventatives upon adoption. If you are interested in giving me a great forever home (fenced yard required) please clink on the link below to directions to the adoption process and the application.\n\nwww.savingdogsrescue.com/how-to-adopt\n\nMy story, I was hit by a car in February of 2020 and taken to the local animal shelter where I was evaluated at the local vets and determined that I would need extensive operations and rehab to survive. The local animal rescue pulled me from the shelter and took me to the vet. At that time they operated to repair the hole in my bladder. After a week or so of rest then I was stable enough to have my pelvic bones surgically repaired. I then spent 4 months on cage rest with rehabilitation 3 times a day to get my hind legs working and to help my bowels and bladder to start working again. I have now been able to use the restroom on my own and run and play with very minimal change. So now I am ready to find a home to call my own.To access our online adoption application copy and paste the url into your browser: https://service.sheltermanager.com/asmservice?account=zw1754&method=online_form_html&formid=41",

There is no doggie more friendly, silly, fun, and playful than her. Santana loves to play in the backyard and loves water! After playtime though, she wants nothing more than to sit and lay by you. She\n\nwas a volunteer and staff favorite at the shelter and is super affectionate!\n\nSantana's only downfall is that she is not good with other dogs. She is fearful/aggressive and needs a family who is willing to work with her through this. She must\n\nbe placed in a house with a secure backyard and no other dogs. However, Santana will make up for this by covering you with kisses. And Santana knows what she wants. If she feels like she needs more attention, she will let you know my grunting at you for more. How could anyone say no to that?!\n\nSantana is a lover looking for her very own forever home. Fill out an application to meet Santana today!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this dog, please visit our website for our online application www.underdogaz.com.",

            "description": "My name is Spinner, I am Chihuahua mix, male, 4 1/2 years old and weigh 12 lbs. \n\nThe odds were stacked against me early in life, but then my previous mama found me and gave me a  happy, loving forever home.   Unfortunately, my mama passed away unexpectedly and now I need a soft place to land that will understand and be patient with my needs. A family who will love me and make my world feel safe again.  \n\nI am 95% blind, but I am able to see shadows. We believe this is caused by a neurological condition that also seems to make learning more difficult but with consistency I am able to learn new things. \n\nI spin a lot (hence the name). I tend do this when I am scared or stressed, but I also do it to figure out my location. I love my food so much that I get very upset if my food bowl is empty!  I use the words food bowl \u201clightly\u201d because I really like to just dump it out and eat it off the floor very slowly so I can savior the taste. I am not fully potty trained but my foster mom is working really hard with me!  I have lived with other dogs and my foster home has dogs and we all get along fine. I am not sure about cats, they are pretty sneaky and scary when you don\u2019t know where their at!  Having someone pick me up can be really scary and sometimes I will scratch you out of fear. Maybe we could come up with a code of some sort to let me know you want to hold me?  My foster mom says I am a very happy boy and laps are the very best place to be. \n\nWags thinks I would do best in a home with blind dog experience, a quiet home with other dogs and kids older than 12 that understand my special needs. I will need a securely fenced yard so I do not get lost. \n\nIf you think Spinner may be the one for you, please go to our website at www.wagstorichesanimalrescue.org and fill out an application to adopt.  Please be sure to include a vet reference as regular vet care is important to us for the health of all our adopted dogs. With approval and a $295 adoption donation, he will be ready to accompany you on all of life\u2019s many adventures.  Spinner is neutered, microchipped, fecal tested clean of internal parasites and up to date on all his vaccinations.\n",

DOB 10-10-16), female, 15 lbs., vetted, is or will be spayed, and micro-chipped. Pixie was found homeless in NC and brought to the shelter. Pixie is good with other dogs, likes to ride in the car, does have a prey drive toward smaller animals so cats probably not a fit nor small children running around, she is house trained, and has medium+ energy. She like to be with her humans, She loves to run, loves to sleep on soft bed and blankets, loves treats, loves to snuggle, loves to have her own space, she likes to chew her toys, Pixie knows Sit, Come, Off, and Go to your Room! Pixie's best home would be active for her energy, have another dog (she'll do her best and be her happiest), no young children (the make her nervous and stressed), and where her humans would love her furever! At her current caretaker's there are a 1 year old and 3 year old children which Pixie is too stressed and not happy there. Stay tuned for more information as Pixie is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Pixie please fill out an Application at www.Passion-4-Paws.org (please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out her Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

I'm about 3 years old. I'm an active happy young pointer. If you look at my pics, you'll see how cute I am. I love to play with toys! My foster home has other pointers that I play with too and boy do I play!!! Sometimes, I may get a little too excited and need a time out to chill. I walk nicely on leash . I'm a little reactive to some dogs, so I'd love to be an only dog. I learned belly rubs are a wonderful thing and enjoy them a lot!! I love treats too! You can teach me lots of fun tricks cause I am food motivated and eager to learn! I'd probably do best in a home without little children cause I can be a little mouthy at times. If you love to spoil your dogs, I'm the one for you!\n\nWant to learn more about one of the dogs we have up for adoption? Fill out our adoption application (http://www.pointerrescue.org/adopt.html)!!\n\nTRANSPORT AVAILABLE TO APPROVED HOMES! (currently within 600 miles)",

Well, now I do.  My first owner really liked me, but said I was \"too much dog.\"  I am really strong!  I guess I was a lot stronger than her (I think she was jealous).

He had her since birth, but had never played with her, loved on her, or showed her any attention at all, other than feeding her.  Therefore, she is very shy until she warms up to you.  Warming up doesn't take long ( a couple to a few days), but she needs that time to learn she can trust you. She is very sweet!\n\nShe is up-to-date on all her vaccinations, but because she was never vaccinated as a puppy, she will need a distemper booster in a couple of weeks.  She had worms, but has been dewormed and will simply need a fecal retest in a few weeks to be sure she is worm free. \n\nShe needs someone who will be patient with her and allow her to trust them.  She is very loving, she just simply needs a little time to warm up.",

She is very shy at first. She needs a quiet place with a male dog friend would be ideal. We will only consider the PERFECT scenario for her. We love her very much and the FPA Volunteers home she is with has a dominant female and they keep them separated. She would love to hang out on the couch with someone and have a male dog companion. She misses that.Artic is about 9 years old and fully vetted. She was rescued from a closed down Santuary where she lived in an outdoor pen, most of her life. She is doggie door trained and house trained. She is a total love, once she knows your ok and not going to hurt her.We don't know if we will ever find 'that home' for her and it's ok, she is safe and happy and will be cared for always, if not.Message or Email: forgottenpetadvocates@yahoo.com\nArtic's Photo Album:https://www.facebook.com/pg/theforgottenpetadvocates/photos/?tab=album&album_id=3838575852824661&__tn__=-UC-R\nOur Adoption Application:http://www.forgottenpetadvocates.com/dog-adoption-application/(Dog Application - No obligation and a Great Start)",

Here are some helpful tips:\n\u2022\tAll dogs listed on Petfinder are still available. \n\u2022\tPlease DO NOT use the \"Ask About Me\" tab on this page. We DO NOT receive these inquiries.\n\u2022\tWe CANNOT move forward until we receive an application. Even if you're only interested, please fill out an application at mnpitbull.com. We will respond within 24-48 hours (M-F) after receiving your inquiry. \n\u2022 Adoption fees are as follows: 2-5 months old: $400, 6-9 months old: $350, 10+ months old: $250. This covers their Spay/Neuter, Vaccinations, Microchip, 4DX, Fecal Tests, and Housing Costs. ********************************************************************************************************\nHi, I'm Poppy!\n\nI'm around 10 months old and originally from TX. I was found on the streets with a severe case of mange. MPBR rescued me and fixed me up and now I'm a beautiful white and tan lady with a grey brindle. I'm medium in size so I can fit perfectly into your life! I know how to sit, shake, and stay. I am potty trained and crate trained. I'm still working on laying down and walking on a leash, but I'll get there. I'm staying in a home with a senior cat that I am very interested in. I try to be gentle with her and I love to cuddle with her. There is also another dog that I do like to play with but I'm not sure how I feel about living with him. I really think I'd like to be the only dog in the home, then I can truly bloom! Oh, did I tell you how much I LOVE humans?! I want to play with them, and I cuddle really hard with them. I also like to go on adventures with them. I haven't met any children yet. I think I would probably be better with older kids. In my downtime, I really like to chew on hard toys so please keep them stocked! You should really meet me; I promise I will melt your heart! Please give me a chance.\n\nNote: Poppy has had fights with the resident dog which is why she is looking for a single dog home. As a result of this, a human was bit while splitting the dogs up.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in meeting Poppy, please see our adoption process and online application by going to www.mnpitbull.com\n",

I completed my heart worm treatment/injections late August.  I was just retested and am negative so can now be officially adopted!  I am learning to play with other dogs so that has been nice to have a buddy.  I can be a bit enthusiastic when playing so need someone of similar style.  Young children may not be the best in my house due to my enthusiasm!  The shelter is closed to the public in general, but I can be adopted by appointment with an approved application.",

He plays with toys, plays with humans, is highly food motivated (a good thing here). so NOT A FIRST HUSKY but if you want to train a great dog and love to run, hike and be active, Rave could fill the bill. Obviously since he is very bouncy and can be a bit rough, no small kids and of course no cats or other small animals.

I'm a pretty shy and nervous girl at first but when you get to know me I'm a real sweetheart! It took me a few days to really start to come out of my shell when I arrived but everyone here was so nice and patient with me! Once it sank in that I have lots of new friends here I was ready to let some of my personality shine! I let them see that I really like ears scratches, small hugs, and treats! I love playing fetch in the yard and would love a new ball to play with. I think I'll show more of my wonderful personality the more comfortable I get! I would do well in a home where I can be the only child and get all of the attention and love that I deserve! Think you have the right home for me? Come and meet me at Woodford Humane or call 859-873-5491 to find out more about me! \n Primary Color: Black Weight: 50.4lbs Age: 2yrs 5mths 4wks Animal has been Spayed",

He loves hanging out on the couch with his foster mom but he doesn't jump on furniture. Samson gets along great with other dogs. \n\nWe think Samson has had a rough life. He has a little trouble walking but gets around fine. Samson needs a home without steps or a swimming pool. He also takes thyroid medicine, his levels will need to be monitored and he needs daily eye drops We would love for Samson to find his forever home where he can receive the TLC he deserves. \n\nPlease apply at tzuzoorescue.com if you are interested in adopting from Tzu Zoo Rescue.  More information available by contacting tzradopt@gmail.com.\n\n[NOTE: We are a rescue NOT a shelter, meaning WE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY THAT OPENS TO THE PUBLIC. Typically, an application and home visit (both of which are required for adoption) MUST be completed, BEFORE a potential adopter will be introduced to one of our pets, in order to first determine that our basic adoption requirements are met, prior to introductions being made. We also utilize personal reference and vet checks (to ensure that any pets already in the potential adoptive home are current on vaccines, heart worm prevention and sterilized) in our adoption process, all of which is intended to ensure that the best match, between pet and people, is made. The adoption fee is based on on the dog's age.",

Mixed with what else, we don't know but hey I'm cute!\n\nMy puppy friends and I were just dumped at a cemetary.  Some big meanies did that to us.  My friends were scared, but I wasn't.  I was like \" I aint afraid of no ghost!\"  (I really was but don't tell ;) )  Have you ever spent the night in a cemetary??  Lots of scary things going on there when it's dark, let me tell ya....\n\nSo, one day this lady came by and saw us and started taking videos.  We were running around and playing, because you know it was daylight and all.  Ghosts and ghouls don't usually come out in the daylight and vampires, well you know what happens to them if they do!  HAHAHAHAHA  Anyway, back to my story. So the lady taking the video?  She posted it straight to the Lucies Project page and next thing I know, here they come to rescue us.  How cool is that?  I sure would like to give that nice lady a big ole slurp on the face.  :)\n\nNow, one of my friends and I are left here waiting for the coolest family to come visit us and considering adopting one or both of us.  Could that be you??  I sure hope so!!\n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home. Phone interviews are required for all adoptions****",

He came to us in July when his owners were moving and could not take him along. Remi does well with other dogs and knows some basic commands but would benefit from more work with leash manners. Due to his energy and playful nature, Remi will need to be in a home without children under 13. If you are ready for lots of walks, engaging playtime, and some training come meet Remi and see if he is the pup for your home!Antietam Humane Society\n8513 Lyons Road Waynesboro, PA 17268\n717-762-9091/ Fax 717-762-0996\nwww.antietamhumanesociety.org",

I suffered a spinal injury before making it to the Humane Society, which has caused me to have limited use of my hind legs. I still get around pretty well, though! I drag my rear legs when I am walking on my own, but I'm actually able to get up and RUN and use my legs to push me along! I am a sweet boy with so much love to give to someone. I am living in a foster home right now where I'm around adults and children, other dogs and even cats. My foster mom says I get along great with the whole crew! She also says she doesn't mind bringing me in to the shelter to meet you if you think you might like me. Please apply to meet me. I'm ready for my forever home.",

My human hated to give me up, but this silly thing called a \u201cpandemic\u201d meant long hours, days, and nights away from me, so I\u2019m hoping for another great chapter in life. I would love to find a human or family who is has lots of time to keep me busy. I would even love to learn some of those things Terriers \u201cdo\u201d for sport, like agility, racing, and the like.\n\nEven though I\u2019m energetic, I can also be calm and chill, too, from \u201cletting\u201d you rub my belly (how nice of me) to falling asleep in your lap.\n\nI haven\u2019t been around cats here, but I\u2019m just fine with the other dogs at the ranch and haven\u2019t had any problem fitting in.\n\nI AM high energy and I need a secure fence to keep me safe when I have the zoomies.  Not interested in chasing down balls but love to race with people or dogs (I win!)\n\nSo, whadda ya say? Are you ready to play?\n\nCome see me at \n\nhttp://www.jackrusselladoptions.org/\n\n",

Zeus came to us originally with the rest of his family (whom have all been adopted) after his previous owners couldn\u2019t care for him. Zeus\u2019 life prior to coming to the rescue was a hard one of living outside and fighting for scraps; hence the scars on his face. \n\nZeus as a result of his past, has come a long way in his socialization with humans in his time with us, but is still considered by the average public to be \u201cskittish.\u201d He loves having a safe space, his crate, to go to when the world is too much. Zeus will need a family that can see past the scars on his face to the loving, tender heart beneath, and is patient and kind with him. Zeus loves to play with other dogs when he thinks no one is watching; seeing him kick up his heels is the sort of wholesome delight we all need.\n\nZeus would benefit from multiple meet and greets with his potential family, to ensure maximum comfort for both family and Zeus. For this reason we are only accepting local applications.\n\n----\nPeach County Animal Rescue is a rescue located in Fort Valley, GA. Our adoption fees range from $250-350+. Although our rescue dogs share a common bond with one another, no rescue story is the same (even when similar). Vetting costs vary depending on their health conditions. All of our dogs are fully vetted: up-to-date on annual shots, spayed/neutered and microchipped with a lifetime registration. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nIf you would like to send in an application for this dog, please use the link below! https://peachcountyanimalrescueandrehabilitation.org/apply-now-2/",

            "description": "Beautiful Shelby has a couple of requirements for her forever family: 1. Must love pizza! It\u2019s Shelby\u2019s absolute favorite food and she refuses to be adopted by any pizza haters . 2. This may be number two but it\u2019s equally in important- Shelby must be allowed to have her space. Shelby is a gentle, low maintenance girl who enjoys her alone time in her crate. A crate is a must for this girl. It provides a retreat where she can go and feel safe when she is frightened. Shelby is frightened of many things including fireworks, thunderstorms and meeting new people. Shelby has never shown aggression towards meeting strangers, she just prefers to hide in her crate where she knows she is safe. Shelby would love a confident and gentle, male companion to play with and show her that life isn\u2019t all that scary. She currently enjoys playing with her male foster sibling and we think another male dog in her new home will help her adjust. Shelby loves when her humans make silly noises and having a consistent routine makes her very happy! Shelby takes longer to warm up to women than men, but in time she will learn to trust. We understand that a dog who likes their space and prefers not to be touched is not for everyone, but we know the pyrfect family is out there for Miss Shelby. Shelby would love her new humans to live a quiet life, with not many visitors or guests. Shelby will do things on her own time. It will be very rewarding to watch Shelby slowly come out of her shell. She may never conquer some of her fears, so her new humans need to be ok with that. If there\u2019s one thing that we do know will help, it\u2019s PIZZA! So what do you say? Does this sweet, gentle and low maintenance girl sound like she would fit in with your low key, pizza-loving lifestyle? Apply today to give Shelby a chance at a peaceful furever!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

He was a stray, so he has been fending for himself for a while. The homeowners in the area were getting upset with him for getting into their trash. He was hungry and only trying to find food to eat. He is between 2 and 3 years old and weighs 85 pounds. He's quite a good-looking fella and would love a home with some space to run and sniff around. He mostly wants to just be outside and do his houndy sniffing. He has learned to walk well on the leash since he is one of the \"regulars\" walked by our volunteers. Take a good look at this nice boy and see if he is a good fit for you. He deserves a second chance! Can you give him one?\n\nMessage from our dog walkers:\n\nI am pretty sure Santa Paws made an appearance in Jackson County. This big lap dog is such a great dog and well behaved even as we dressed him. I love this boy and you will too. He likes to walk and enjoys spending time with his peeps! He really would love to find a home and forever family before Christmas!\n\nWhen Hank arrived at the shelter he was so afraid he really didn't want to walk... He is so improved! He loves to be leashed up and go for walks now and he is not happy if you leash another dog before he gets to go! He is a great dog but like Miss Amelia, he is not a fan of posing for pictures so this picture doesn't do him justice, he is a very handsome dog!!! Hank could be dog selective\n\n1/27/2021 Hank has made such progress since his arrival. Originally, he was afraid of his own shadow. Now Hank is friendly, loving, excited to go on walks, and has decent manners on a leash. He is definitely a volunteer favorite and so ready for his forever home!\n\nJackson County Animal Shelter 86 County Farm Rd, Cottageville, WV 25239 Google map to our location: https://goo.gl/j2faZf Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/JacksonCountyAnimalShelter\nShelter Hours: Mon-Fri 11-4 or by appointment Sat/Sun Closed\n\nAdoption Application: http://form.jotform.us/form/51408614450146 Rescue Application: http://form.jotform.us/form/51744619866165\n\nFor rescue or long distance adoption inquiries, please use this form to contact us: http://form.jotform.us/form/51806042497154\nPhone (for local calls only): 304-372-6064\nRescues and long-distance adopters: We are rescue friendly and PA-licensed!

He weighs about 12 lbs. \n\nIf the animal is under the age of 3 years old or has health issues, a vet reference is required which means you must own a pet or have owned a pet in your name.\n\nAdoption fee of $295 covers all vetting including spay/neuter surgery, vaccines, microchip heartworm test and treatment if needed and any other medical that may be required while in rescue. \n\nWe only do adoptions on Saturday and not all animals are able to attend so if you would like to see a specific animal please let us know so that we can make arrangements for it to be present at the event. Event locations do vary so please check the homepage to find out where we will be this week. Please do not ask us to reduce adoption fees since all fees help us to cover medical expenses for all of our animals, some of which can be very expensive.  Saving lives is not cheap so thank you for your understanding and helping us save as many as possible.\n\nPlease email lowcountryanimalrescue@ymail.com for an application.",

            "description": "Meet adorable Addy! This silly girl seems to be part pitbull, part vizsla, maybe hound but definitely all smarts. She would love a forever family to call her own, but until they find her she's getting lots of love in a great foster home. Addy is house trained and gets along with other pups. Her foster dad says she's very smart - she knows the sit, stay and down commands. Addy is still working on her leash manners but she is a quick learner! Not only that, but she's very cuddly with the softest fur you'll ever pet! She really enjoys long walks and playtime since she has a lot of energy. And when it's time to be calm, she likes to be near her people. The ideal home for Addy is one where she can exercise her brain and her body. She loves activity and she loves to learn! This girl deserves the perfect forever home. Could that be with you? Apply to adopt Addy today! All Dallas Pets Alive adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon adoption. The standard minimum donation for dogs over six months to seven years is $200, puppies under six months is $250, dogs eight years and over are $100 unless specified otherwise. You can view all adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallaspetsalive.org/adopt/adoptable-dogs/ . For more information, you can email adopt@dallaspetsalive.org.",

            "description": "****PETronus Rescue endeavors to include all pertinent information for each of the dogs within our organization with regard to approximate age, potty training status, kennel training status, temperament, activity level, dog/cat friendliness, etc in an effort to give those considering adopting as much information as we have.  Inquiries requesting additional information will not be returned, due to limited volunteers. Thank you for your understanding **** \n\nMeet Heath.\n\nHeath was picked up off the streets by a Good Samaritan. He was wondering with a female, Arya, and was the daddy of her surprise litter of puppies.\n\nHeath is a playful guy, who does well with female dogs. No male dogs and no cats for this guy. He loves to play in the yard, has good leash manners and his foster has been working with him on some obedience training as well! He can be in a home with older children who will respect his boundaries and not poke and prod at him. \n\nAll PETronus Rescue dogs receive basic vaccinations (distemper/parvo, bordetella, & rabies), spay/ neuter, and microchip prior to adoption. We also treat any know medical issues, including heartworms.\n\nOur dogs live in foster homes while they wait patiently for their forever families to find them. This is beneficial in that they learn house manners, crate training, housebreaking, etc while they wait and we are also able to get a very realistic picture of their energy level, temperament, etc so that we can place them in a home that is the best fit.\n\nOur adoption fees are $200 for dogs over 1 year of age and $250 for dogs under 1 year of age. Puppies receive 3 rounds of puppy vaccinations.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our amazing dogs, please fill out our adoption application here http://bit.ly/PRAdoption and we will be in touch!",

She needs more work on basic commands as well as further socialization with other dogs her size. She knows sit and down ( mostly) . She is awful at the command wait and will scoot her booty across the floor to you when you try to back up and make her wait. It\u2019s hilarious though. \nShe has the most adorable blue eyes and they are set closer together giving her this sweet, endearing and unique look. She loves belly rubs and to be pet and craves attention from her hooman. She is very food motivated and will do great with additional training due to this and her desire to please her people. \nWillow does have a high prey drive and she cannot go to a home with Livestock, cats, birds etc..If you do not have experience , please do not apply. We truly want to have a positive experience for this poor girl and the best home that she can have. \nIf you think Willow is a good match for you, please apply at www.lunasiberianrescue.dog.",

A ranch style home will be great however, he can be in a smaller place as far as he gets plenty of DAILY exercise. \n\nHe is crate trained; and loves his crate in case you need to go out for several hours; that will be the safest place for him - he loves a good bone to chew on.\nHe is special needs because he needs special hepatic food - he has been tested and he is in good health now.\n\nHe will give you lots of years of unconditional love; will hug you, will give you a high five, and will cuddle with you - he is very verbal.\n\nHe loves to play ball and fetch as well - so a young kid will be a great partner for him. He loves his human family and will never be aggressive towards people - \n\nHe went through abandonment; and he is very loyal and protective as well. It takes a special person to get this special 4 leg guy:)\n\nOf course, he has been neutered and has received his yearly DHLPP vaccines, dewormed; deflead; a free health check up by our participating pet clinic.\n\nWe are scheduling meet & greet adoption appointments and keeping a distance protocol. No appointments will be made unless we have received an application; therefore, we can match you with the best fit for you.\n\nPlease text at 619-576-0747 or email veronica.aaofusa@gmail.com or visit our website at www.aaofus.org and complete our application at the following link:\nhttp://aaofus.org/adoption-application.html\n\nDue to high volume of calls; NO PHONE calls are accepted at this time - therefore, please text us or email us.\n\nLIVE!!

He was recently returned to us because he had an incident with a small dog (was aggressive toward it when the dog surprised him).  We are recommending that Dexter be an only dog (and no cats).\n\nThis is what Dexter's family had to say about him:\nReally good boy.\n3 years old.\nPotty trained.\nNeutered and chipped.\nHe loves his people so much.\nLoves rope toys and kong balls.\nCan only have grain free foods (he is allergic to grain, but needs the taurine supplement).\nMust be the only animal in the house and no dog park. \nHe's very strong, so always on firm leash.\nIs anxious around other dogs (especially off leash dogs).\nAdores his people and sleeping on the end of the bed with them.\nIs trained to sit, wait, high five, whisper, roll over, lay down, and to ring a bell to go outside to potty.\nGets very cold during winter (especially his feet).\nPlayful and also very cuddly.\n\nYou may visit Dexter at our shelter near San Luis, CO (by appointment).  Please email us to make arrangements.  woof@slvaws.org\n\nWe practice safe COVID-19 protocols at our shelter.",

She is still a bit shy of new people & needs time to warm up so would do best in a low traffic home. Peanut needs humans that will understand that she needs time to get used to new people at her own pace, especially with men. Her foster mom delights in how affectionate & playful Peanut is now & she is worth the patience to win her trust! Once she is bonded to her people, she will love them with all her heart & wants love in return. She will certainly make someone a great companion but will need a bit of patience to get her settled in to a new home. Peanut presently weighs 38 lbs, is guessed to be about 1 year old, is spayed, vaccinated, Heartworm negative, microchipped, crate & house trained.  She walks well on  leash & knows her basic commands. Peanuts gets along with other dogs with the proper introduction. She would probably do best in an adult home due to her shy nature. Cats are unknown at this time. If you would like to possibly give this pup the home where she will never worry again, please email streethearts.animal.rescue@gmail.com",

            "description": "Rubi was surrendered after being in her latest home for over 3 1/2 years...she was adopted from the shelter after being there for over a year.  Rubi is around 7 years old and wasn't getting along with another smaller dog that was brought into the home a year ago.  I'm not sure if anything was tried to help Rubi and the other dog.  Rubi is a very sweet girl who craves attention,  but she's also the nervous type.  Rubi also loves to give kisses, but she's quick about it, so you could accidentally be head-butted if you're not paying attention. She also LOVES to play fetch! She'll play until your arm gets too tired to throw!  In her previous home,, she didn't like extremely young children, but she got along with the 9 year old in the family. I hope someone will give this pretty girl a chance for a forever home. If you would like to meet this beautiful girl, please email the shelter at cchs04@sbcglobal.net and request an application today! \n\n",

We had surgery done, now she wants her own quiet adult home.  Maggie does not care for small children, they are too animated for her, but she would be fine with calm older children....she does not like cats, but is good with other small dogs.  Maggie would do best in a senior/retiree home, where she can be the center of attention, soak up the sun & let you know when the mail arrives.  She is crate, doggie door & leash trained.  She is super sweet & qualifies for our seniors adopting seniors discount.  ***If interested in Maggie, you'll first need to submit an application from www.becauseofyourescue.org***\n\nMaggie is approx 10 Yrs old and 10lbs***spayed, vaccinated, heartworm tested /on preventative & micro-chipped\n\n",

She is 10 years going on 10 months and doesn't seem to realize that she is getting into her golden years.\nShe can be very goofy and is a good companion. She is friendly towards people and loves to go on adventures. She is easy to love!\nRozay loves to play with other dogs her size or bigger and would love a home with a playmate. She is prey driven and likes to chase the little ones so she would not do well in a home with cats, small animals, or reactive small dogs. \nRozay can and will jump fences, so she needs at least 6ft fully fenced, secure yard. Luckily she comes when called pretty well and usually stays close to home.\nShe is crate trained, housetrained, spayed, microchip, vaccinated, and good being left home alone for a handful of hours at a time.\nRozay's adoption fee is $150.\nThis girl is a great dog and would make her family very happy!",

I am 2 years old and have been at the shelter since April because a new child in the home was unable to live with animals. It was so hard for me at the beginning but having people take special care of me has helped me so much. I am now a happy boy and when I see those people I get so excited I call out for them. I am smart and playful and house trained. I like to hang out and enjoy playing with toys. I like to go on walks and get so excited to do so that I sometimes forget my leash manners. It would really help me if you continued my training because I know my commands, I just need some reminders. I have lots of energy so would do best with a family with older children who has some experience. I might be able to live with another dog but would have to meet them but would need a home without cats. If you want to meet me or find out more information about adopting me, please email dogs@hitor.org",

They don't know what my real name is and I can't tell them, so I'm working hard to learn it along with how to \"sit\" and \"stay\" when they tell me to, and how to walk on a leash without pulling. I would love to live in a house with a big fenced- in yard and a family that understands my excitement. Kids seem cool too, I wouldn't mind living with them if they wouldn't mind living with me! The cats at the shelter drive me crazy and I'm not very happy around other dogs so I really would be my best self if I could be the only four legged one.in the house. My shelter humans say that I'm a very smart girl, and I'd be happy to continue training with my new family. If you want to meet me or find out more information about me, please email dogs@hitor.org",

In fact, I like almost every person I meet!\n\n3.\tI think I would like to live in a home with kids, as long as they were older than 10 and not too loud or rambunctious.  \n\n4.\tI wouldn\u2019t mind living with a medium or large female dog, as long as she was easy-going and we had some time to get to know each other.  \n\n5.\tI haven\u2019t had much experience with small dogs since I came to The Bullpen, so I don\u2019t know how I would feel about living in a home with them.\n\n6.\tI have met several of the barn cats at the sanctuary and I don\u2019t seem to care very much about them, so I think I would be fine in a home with felines after a slow and proper introduction.\n\n7.\tThe words that best describe me are loving, mellow, and happy.\n\n8.\tI like to hang out with humans, play in the yard, and go for walks!\n\n9.\tI am fully vaccinated, neutered, and microchipped.\n\n10.\t I am heartworm positive, but I\u2019ve already started treatment, and will come with all the medicine needed to complete it at my new home.\n\nReady to give Watson the forever home of his dreams?  Fill out our Adoption Application, located at www.bullpenrescue.org under the 'work with us' tab.\n\nWe highly recommend that our potential adopters fill out an online application as soon as possible, as it greatly expedites the process of finding the right dog for your situation.  \n\nOur dogs are available for adoption nationwide but preference is given to adopters willing to do an in-person meeting.  Please understand that our dogs are not adopted on a first-come, first-serve basis, but rather we strive for a \"perfect placement\" so we know that they will not be failed again.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWe highly recommend that our potential adopters fill out an online application as soon as possible, as it greatly expedites the process of finding the right dog for your situation.

This adorable guy is ready to find his forever home, and he wants his new family to know these 10 things about him:\n\n1.\tI am a bit mysterious when it comes to my breed:  some people think I look like a Cane Corso, and other people think I look more like a Boerboel. Either way, everyone agrees that I am a very handsome boy.\n\n2.\tI am 2.5 years old and I tip the scales at about 125lbs, although I could probably stand to lose a few pounds.\n \n3.\tI can be nervous when I encounter new situations and people, especially men.  A home that is willing to work with me on building confidence, and that will give me plenty of time to warm up to new people and situations, would be the best fit for me.\n\n4.\tAlthough I do like to play, I honestly prefer a calm and laid-back environment. An active adult-only home would be ideal, but I think I could live in a home with children over 12, as long as they weren\u2019t too loud or rambunctious and had some previous experience/training with big dogs.  \n\n5.\tI\u2019ve mostly only met larger dogs, but I think I could get along almost any female dog over 40lbs.  As long as my new owners were willing to give me a proper introduction to their pups, I believe I could happily live in a home with other canines.   \n\n6.\tI\u2019m not really sure how I feel about felines, but I DO sometimes like to bark at the barn cat here at the sanctuary.    It\u2019s possible that I could learn to be a friend to felines, if we are allowed to meet slowly and with supervision.\n\n7.\tThe words that best describe me are sweet, affectionate, and shy.\n\n8.\tMy favorite things are napping, playing in the yard, and hanging out with my people.\n \n9.\tI am housebroken, crate-trained, and I know how to use a dog door.  I am also perfecting my leash skills more and more each day!\n\n10.\tI am fully vaccinated, heartworm negative, neutered, and microchipped. \n\nReady to give Vito the forever home of his dreams?  Fill out our Adoption Application, located at www.bullpenrescue.org under the 'work with us' tab.\n\nWe highly recommend that our potential adopters fill out an online application as soon as possible, as it greatly expedites the process of finding the right dog for your situation.  \n\nOur dogs are available for adoption nationwide but preference is given to adopters willing to do an in-person meeting.  Please understand that our dogs are not adopted on a first-come, first-serve basis, but rather we strive for a \"perfect placement\" so we know that they will not be failed again.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWe highly recommend that our potential adopters fill out an online application as soon as possible, as it greatly expedites the process of finding the right dog for your situation.

She does fine on the leash outside, enjoys car rides and loves to be out on the many trails in our community.  Destiny is a healthy girl but does have a very sensitive stomach and is on a Mature Diet food.   There must be someone out there that can give this girl a forever inside home, where she can be safe, comfy, cool in the summer and warm in the winter.  Could it be you?\n\nFun Facts:\n\nAge (best guess) - 10 years\nBreed (best guess) - Pointer Mix\nCurrent Weight - 72 lbs\nDog Friendly - No\nCat Friendly - No\nKid Friendly - Yes\nPotty Trained - Yes\nCrate Trained - Yes\nLeash Trained - Yes\n\nAll of our adult dogs are current on vaccinations, de-wormed, heart worm tested, spayed/neutered, on monthly preventatives & micro chipped prior to adoption. \n\n*Adoption Fee is $200.00, No out of State Adoptions ,Virtual Home Visits \n Required  \n\n*We do not require fenced yards for all dogs, fenced yards are required based on a dogs needs. *No invisible fences.\n\nIf you would like to meet this dog, please fill out an adoption application at www.unchainedmelodies.org/adopt/\n\nThank you for adopting!",

For more information or to schedule an appointment, contact Rachael at rwilson@midlandshumanesociety.org or (712)396-2265**\n\nBaby Girl is a very shy girl, looking for a laid back home. Baby Girl needs a very patient owner who can let her acclimate at her own shell. \n\nBaby Girl is very skittish, especially with new situations, loud noises & fast movements. She will need more time than most other dogs to decompress. She will most likely need to spend the first few weeks on leash, inside & outside, so she learns to look to her people for guidance & helps eliminate her possibly escaping. \n\nBaby Girl will be happiest as your only pet & in an adult only home. She is not suitable for apartment living. \n\nThis is an adult dog and the adoption cost is $150, which covers microchip, age appropriate vaccines, and spaying or neutering.\n\n Come out to meet all of our adoptable animals today! ----------------------------------- \n\nThis dog is at Midlands Humane Society located at 1020 Railroad Avenue, Council Bluffs, IA 51503 Please email or call them at 712-396-2270 midlandshumanesociety@gmail.com http://midlandshumanesociety.org/ Hours of Operation:\nMonday,Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,Friday 12:00pm - 6:00pm Saturday 11:00am-5:00pm\nSunday 11:00am-3:00pm",

I'm a handsome, 7-yr old. male, pit bull mix looking for a new home. \n\nI have never been given the chance to meet other dogs so it's a question mark as to how well we'd get on. Also I've only ever lived outside so it's not known if I'm house broken. I am smart though and I'm sure I'd be a quick and eager learner.\n\nI love to play in the water, I'm good with children, and enjoy my treats. I am not good on a leash - yet. I'm sure I could learn with a little patience (and lots of treats). I am eager to please. I would need a strong walking partner until I learn not to pull. \n\nI do not like cats, but I love people.  It would probably be best if I my forever home was with someone that is familiar with my breed. \n\nIf you'd like to enquire about me, please contact Jethro Homeward Bound at mmwesttx@yahoo.com.  I am protective of my current home and will probably bark when you visit but don't let that deter you. Give me a chance to be your pal. Thanks!\n",

Duke was featured on Animal Planet's TV Show, \"Give a Dog a Home - LIVE!\" Duke showed off his skills on camera - he's super smart and loves to train! Duke knows all of his basic cues, plus some cute tricks and agility skills. He loves to play with toys and splash in kiddie pools. If you're looking for a smart, friendly, affectionate dog, you'll be thrilled to meet Duke! He's spent time in a foster home and they LOVED him! His fosters report that he is house-trained, cuddly, and goes with the flow. He listens well and matches his energy to your mood. Duke enjoys some dogs with the proper introduction and will require a meet and greet with any resident dogs before he can go home. Duke's DNA was tested by Wisdom Panel and came back as: 50% Boxer, 25% Siberian Husky, 12.5% Malamute, and 12.5% White Swiss Shepherd.If you are interested in meeting Duke, go to la.bestfriends.org/adopt and fill out our Dog Adoption Survey and our team will reach out to you!",

I hear a lot of about this \u201cforever home\u201d and \u201cforever family\u201d and it sounds amazing! I'm a little over a year old.  I hope my forever family has a comfy couch with a spot for me. My favorite past time is snuggling on the couch with my humans. Snuggles are the best! I also really hope they have lots of tennis balls. Tennis balls are my favorite and even though I\u2019m not the best at catching them, the chase is the fun anyway!\nBefore my foster mom and dad took me in, I stayed with my best bud for a few weeks. My best bud is my trainer. He taught me all of these fun human words that I understand now! I make people really happy when they see I know human words! It\u2019s super easy to learn the human words and he will even teach you them! If I got to pick my forever home I really hope it\u2019s just grown adults and possibly a dog brother or sister. I love to play so a canine sibling sounds great! \nI am really hoping to find my humans soon! Are you my mommy or daddy? Kobe will have a few training sessions with his new family and his trainer. For this reason his new family needs to live in the Charlotte area.\n\nInterested?

It takes a little bit of time for Peaches to warm up to you but when she does, she will love you forever. Because Peaches is very anxious, she is prone to nip and bite when feeling threatened or cornered. Whoever would like to adopt Peaches will need patience and be willing to come and visit her in her foster home several times until she can feel comfortable. She is fine when visitors come to her foster home but is very fearful when taken out of her environment. PEACHES MUST HAVE A FENCED YARD AND CANNOT LIVE IN AN APARTMENT. She loves to run and play with her foster siblings, get lots of love from her foster parents and give kisses. She nibbles on you a bit when she is trying to get your attention and she can never get enough attention.",

I'm ready for a forever home I just need you to submit an application for me. Can't wait to meet you!\n\nFee $125\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit petsaversshreveport.org and find our adoption application under the 'Dogs' tab. Completed applications can be emailed to our Adoption Team at petsavers@petsaversshreveport.org - all adoptions require a vet reference. Please let us know if you have any questions or if you would like to set up a meet and greet with a specific dog.",

Ella came to us and had some thinning hair but the vet believes this will grow back with some tlc and good nutrition.  She is very active and would do well with an active family.  Ella does fine with other dogs but does not do well with cats or other small animals.  Ella needs to be kept busy or she gets bored and gets into trouble.  Ella is working on her house training.  Ella is microchipped, heartworm negative and up to date on vaccines.  If you are interested in Ella, please go to www.sparkyrescue.com/adopting and fill out an application.\n\n",

I was living in a 5th-wheel trailer with a woman, 2 other dogs and NINE puppies! Talk about crowded. When the cool people at ARFhouse convinced the woman we would be better off with them, I was brought to the sanctuary where I've been ever since! \n\nI am a super sweet, energetic girl with lots of love to give! I am a Pit Bull, approximately 41 lbs. and they say I'm about 2 years old. I love to run and play, go for walks and get belly rubs! I will do best in a home with a fenced yard so I can run and play as I please. I'm good with other dogs so a home with a four-legged sibling would be super cool! \n\nThe fee to adopt Carmela is $200.00; this includes spay/neuter, deworming, vaccinations and a microchip. If you are interested in adopting Carmela, please visit our website. www.arfhouse.org and fill out an adoption application. \n\n**Please Note: Carmela is currently located at our facility in Sherman, Texas. Adoptions are by-appointment only; if you would like to meet Carmela, please fill out an application on our website. If approved, we will contact you within 48 hours to set up a time to meet Carmela.",

            "description": "Indy is a 4 year old pyr girl who is in search of a new home through no fault of her own. She came to us in August of 2020 from Edgar County Animal Shelter in Paris, IL where she was surrendered by her owner because he sold his goats and no longer needed her  When she came into rescue she was unspayed and heartworm and Lyme disease positive.  She has since been treated for heartworm and  Lyme disease, and spayed.  Both of these diseases are easily preventable with monthly flea, tick and heartworm preventatives.  Indy was adopted in the fall of 2020, but her adopters were unfamiliar with the breed, and she proved to not be a good fit for them. Indy is very sweet and gentle girl.  She gets along with other dogs, is fine with cats, and is very calm with children. She is a little skittish at first with strangers but warms up once she knows you. Indy does well getting a bath and being brushed.  She rides well in vehicles. Indy can be left on her own without being crated.  Indy does like to bark, so if barking is a concern for you, you may want to consider another breed.  She also needs work on coming inside; since she was a livestock guardian originally, crossing door thresholds, can be a challenge at first. We recommend that you attend obedience training to help you create a special bond with you and your new friend, and so you have a well behaved canine. Great Pyrenees are willing to learn, but are not as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds. They are bred to be independent thinkers. Applicants must be over 25, own their own home and all children in household must be over 6 years old. Your resident pets must be up to date on vaccines, sterilized, you must have a good history of vet care for them, and you must have used heartworm preventative year round for your dogs. \n\n\nIndy will be placed as an inside pet with outside privileges. You MUST have a securely fenced yard accessible from your home. Invisible fencing does not work with this breed and they will take the shock for the freedom.  Great Pyrenees are bred to roam and will create their own territory if not secured, which can led to them being lost, hit by vehicles or shot by people who see them as a threat. The breed is not a good off leash dog, and cannot be trusted to not run away.  A Great Pyrenees off leash is a \" DisAPyr.\" \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please complete the appropriate application on our website, www.igpr.org under the Adopt tab. \n\nAll of our dogs marked as needing foster homes are also available for adoption.  If a dog is listed on this site, it is available.  No need to contact us to see if it is,  We do require you  complete the adoption application prior to meeting a dog.\n\nWe also offer a foster to adopt program. You foster the dog, and have first right of refusal on them if an approved application is submitted for them. \n\nIn fostering a dog, the dog comes to you fully vetted. and groomed. You provide good quality food, grooming, and we provide the heartworm preventative and medical care, if needed* .(*Based on approval from IGPR.)\n\nAdoption fee is $350",

Harley is a very easy dog to care for but his requirements are very specific\u2026...  Due to his mobility issues (he takes very small steps - shuffles like an old man \u2013 and has arthritis in his front elbows, fractured pelvis and hip dysplasia in both back legs), the best home is with no stairs.  He is afraid another dog will step on him so will tend to reach out to correct one that may be coming too close, so a home with no other animals is best.  He has been badly abused by a man in the past and is unpredictably (at least to people) reactive towards them if they move a certain way, so a home without a male living there or visiting frequently is an absolute necessity.  He enjoys very short walks, but mostly enjoys sun bathing.  Even with all of these limitations, if you have this environment, we hope you will give him a chance and meet him. Harley is looking for fabulous foster family or a fantastic forever family. Please email us at lizzyshospice@gmail.com.",

Some were dumped, abandoned in an empty house, left tied to a tree, picked up by animal control as strays, or simply unwanted by their owners. We ask that only serious and committed adopters apply as these dogs have suffered enough.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet please apply to adopt at\nhttp://www.wagsandwhiskerspetrescue.com/adopt.html\nif the pet is still available for adoption and you are approved to adopt we will contact you.\n\nCalling and checking the status of your application will not increase your chances of adoption",

That is no way for a dog to live so now I'm living it up here at the sanctuary! \n\nI am a SUUUUPER sweet, super cool Boxer/Pit mix; I am approximately 3 years old and I'm a big boy, weighing in at 71 lbs. I love to play! I get along with other dogs but any existing dog in the home should be female and weigh over 50 lbs. (I like to play rough and wouldn't want to hurt anyone!). All I really want is a family that loves to have fun, play and one that will love me forever. \n\nThe fee to adopt Murray is $200.00; this includes spay/neuter, deworming, vaccinations and a microchip. If you are interested in adopting _, please visit our website. www.arfhouse.org and fill out an adoption application. \n\n**Please Note: Murray is currently located at our facility in Sherman, Texas. Adoptions are by-appointment only; if you would like to meet Murray, please fill out an application on our website. If approved, we will contact you within 48 hours to set up a time to meet Murray.",

She is housebroken, leash trained, has excellent house manners and knows basic commands. After a successful career as a livestock guardian, Eva is looking to live out her best years in a peaceful retirement home. Her animal guarding days came to an end when she tore her ACL protecting a flock from coyotes. Now it\u2019s time for Eva to relax and enjoy her golden years. Eva\u2019s pyrfect oasis consists of a quiet home, with a big yard all to herself, where she can quietly keep watch. Eva is on meds for thyroid and arthritis and she would like you to know that she would take her pills on her own if she had thumbs, but she does not, so she\u2019ll need a family who can help her with these things :) Eva would do best as an only dog, as she gets defensive of other dogs in her space. She\u2019s never been around small children, so older is better for this big gal. She is great meeting most people though slow to warm up to some. She\u2019s not a fan of manicures, humans messing with her food and thunder. She is a fan of the vet, a good brushing and her groomer at PetSmart :) Eva is a very gentle, sweet soul with so much love still to give. She\u2019s a well-mannered, easy going gal who will make the right family very happy. So what do you say? Will you help Eva get to her well-deserved retirement? Apply for this lovely girl today!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

            "description": "Odin is in search of a new home due to additional family members moving in.  He was born in December of 2017.  He is a large boy weighing about 100 lbs. Odin is a friendly boy, who would do best in an adult household. Children make him uneasy.  He is house trained, and does not need to be crated when you are gone.  He does not do well with cats.   Odin is eager to please, walks well on a leash, listens when told \u201cno\u201d and obeys basic commands like come and sit  He would do best with a female dog companion and playmate; he an be selective about male dogs. He is friendly with adults, fine with children from a distance, walks well on a leash, and does not need to be crated when you are gone. We recommend obedience training for all newly adopted pyrs, to help you create a special bond with you and your new friend, and so you have a well behaved canine. Great Pyrenees are willing to learn, but are not as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds. They are bred to be independent thinkers. Applicants must be over 25, own their own home and all children in household must be over 18 years old. Your resident pets must be up to date on vaccines, sterilized, you must have a good history of vet care for them, and you must have used heartworm preventative year round for your dogs. \n\n\nOdin will be placed as an inside pet with outside privileges. You MUST have a securely fenced yard accessible from your home. Invisible fencing does not work with this breed and they will take the shock for the freedom.  Great Pyrenees are bred to roam and will create their own territory if not secured, which can led to them being lost, hit by vehicles or shot by people who see them as a threat. The breed is not a good off leash dog, and cannot be trusted to not run away.  A Great Pyrenees off leash is a \" DisAPyr.\" \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please complete the appropriate application on our website, www.igpr.org under the Adopt tab. \n\nAll of our dogs marked as needing foster homes are also available for adoption.  If a dog is listed on this site, it is available.  No need to contact us to see if it is,  We do require you  complete the adoption application prior to meeting a dog.\n\nWe also offer a foster to adopt program. You foster the dog, and have first right of refusal on them if an approved application is submitted for them. \n\nIn fostering a dog, the dog comes to you fully vetted. and groomed. You provide good quality food, grooming, and we provide the heartworm preventative and medical care, if needed* .(*Based on approval from IGPR.)\n\nAdoption fee is $350",

Her soul has not suffered,For a blind pup I am very smart, outgoing and so sweet and gentle. I have a very goofy personality and love pretty much every one once I warm up. I am very submissive and love to play with other pups. My foster mom says I\u2019m perfect in almost every way. I can do the stairs lickity split. I learn very quick. I know how to sit and wait for my food. I am really chill and calm for an 8 mo old pup. I\u2019m great in my crate and very quiet both outside and inside.  I am in the Chicago land area and would love a forever family with and another pup and a fenced yard. Like with all puppies I will need continued training.\n\nAt 8 months old Addi is about 45 lbs she will probably be about 50-55 lbs full grown.  We are not sure of her breed. What we do know that this is a great pup and will make some lucky family a great family member.\n\n\nFor a meet & greet please fill out an app on our website.

            "description": "Sanibel is the sweetest little gnome heeler. She came from a high-kill county shelter in Tampa Bay as an owner surrender and had almost no hair when we rescued her. She is a senior and she does have some medical conditions, but being a senior also means she adores being loved on, getting belly rubs, a good roll in the grass and lying in the sun on the back porch. Sanibel has arthritis, she walks slowly and has spondylosis of her spine. She can do steps and roll in the grass and even play briefly with other dogs. She has chronic dry eye and requires eye drops that the vet prescribed for her. Her skin still gets some scabbing and she does get a medicated bath every month or so. Her hair has mostly grown back, and her bad teeth have been removed. She is on supplements for arthritis, and has a special food that she will need to have in her forever home also, it has helped her skin immensely. She is housebroken, and will let you know with a bark when she wants to go out. She loves a soft cushy bed to lie in and will bask out in the sun. She is fine with other dogs or without. Has a great appetite. Sanibel does not need long walks, and she really prefers to be with you. She would love a nice quiet place with a yard to roam in, someone that can love her as she is, be patient with her and give her all the comforts of life. She even gives little kisses to the right person!!\nIf anyone 65+ is interested, she is eligible for our Seniors for Seniors program (check out our website ewenityfarmsbch.com/adoption/ for more info on the program).",

He is a senior around 8 years old and heartworm positive, but is in treatment. He came to us from a local shelter where he was very scared and would give a little growl to keep people away. We think he may have been mistreated in his former home. But Sampson has bloomed in his foster home where he knows he is safe! He is the sweetest boy who just wants to cuddle and get scratches, pets and brushing. He gets along great with his foster brothers and sisters and has even fallen in love with a female and follows her everywhere! He loves attention so much he wakes up every family member one by one to get pets! We're not sure how he is with cats. He is house and crate trained. If you're interested in giving Sampson a fur-ever home, please fill out an application on our website: OklahomaGSR.org",

            "description": "Batman is a male shepherd mix who was born around 12/2019. He was found as a stray who had been fending for himself for a long period of time. This dog is a survivor and now that he is rescued,  needs a family who will make up for his lost social puppy years.\nBatman got his name because of his ear size-he is all ears. He is skin and bones from being a stray. The foster family is giving him good quality foods so he grows into his ear size.\nSince he has been roaming for so long out in the wilderness, he is very leary of new things, going inside a house, going into a kennel, walking in a door way, meeting new people...etc. Things a puppy shouldn't be hesitant to do. Imagine being that fearful of things?? Batman wants to be outside. But the foster family is acclimating and slowly transitioning him into a home setting. He doesn't like to be confined. We are also working on crate training.  Again, when you are out in the open for so long being confined is stressful.\n***Batmans adoptive family will need a secured completely fenced yard***\nWhen he is crated, he will have accidents. We are working on that with him.\nAt first when he meets someone. Batman will hide behind his foster mom. Once he bonds with you, you are his best buddy.\nThe new family/adopters will need to continue a routine with him so he can learn to trust and thrive into being a great family member.\nAre you willing to help Batman become part of your forever family.?\nAll medical work is completed prior to adoption including neutering shots worming flea treatment rabies shot micro chip snd vet exam \nAdoption fee is $150 + tax with an approved application.  The application is available on the website http://www.prairiepawsrescue.com and go to the adopt link.\nPrairie Paws does not adopt on a first come basis,  but who will provide the best home suited to the pets needs \n\n\n\n \n \n",

So Buddy is now looking for a forever home.  Our volunteers are smitten with this boy and his lovable self!  Buddy is very sweet, friendly, outgoing and energetic. He hasn't bee reactive to other dogs at all so would probably do well with another dog, but of course a meet and greet will be necessary for any dogs in the home.\n\nBuddy is a big boy, but he is all about being with his people.  He's not fearful or nervous like we often see with strays, so this boy won't be with us for long.  We don't know about cats or kids, but like all our dogs they often will chase things that run so cats may not be a good match.  He is a big puppy so any small children will need to meet him before he could go home.\n\nIf you can give Buddy an indoor forever home or Foster home, please fill out our online application on our website at http://www.savingpawsrescueaz.com/adoption-form/\n\nWe will only schedule meet and greets with an approved application. We are an all-volunteer organization. It may take a couple of days to process an application and complete reference checks.\n\nThank you for your interest in saving the life of a dog.\n\n",

            "description": "Like most canines, when 1-year-old Camille arrived at the bark park, she spent the first 5 minutes exploring the new surroundings and sniffing the invisible world of scents. She then turned her attention to the human and when called, quickly came to him, especially when she discovered that he was sharing the gift of hot dog treats. Camille showed off her amazing eye/mouth coordination as she effortlessly caught every treat tossed in her general direction. We are not sure of all Camille\u2019s previous life adventures, but she still experiences some fear responses to her past. She is much more comfortable interacting with men than she is with women. As a part of her continuing socialization, Camille successfully completed a lengthy car ride with the Humane Society director. She appreciated the outing and enjoyed the chance to experience the freedom of watching the world go by. Camille still pulls hard on leash and will need an adopter with dog savvy that can handle a strong canine. In the here and now of the bark park photo session, Camille continuously shared her friendly smiles with the photographer. When you look into her expressively adoring eyes, she shows a glimpse of her true self, expressing thankfulness for another chance at life. She is available for adoption at the Humane Society for Animals in Rogers, AR. We also welcome the opportunity for help by other rescues.",

            "description": "Howdy! I\u2019m Zeus and I\u2019m a Catahoula Leopard dog mix. They think I\u2019m about 2 years old! I am a playful dude and do well with other dogs. My foster thinks I would thrive in a home with kids 12+ older due to being a bit rowdy. I love to run, but I\u2019m just as awesome as I am handsome! My foster family says that I am about medium to high energy. I think I\u2019d really love a family who is active and would REALLY love if they take me with them places!! Don\u2019t let my energy fool you, I\u2019m a very sweet boy and love cuddles WAY more than you could ever imagine. I walk well on a leash and am crate trained. My foster family reports that I am indeed, a very good boy! I would love to meet my forever family soon. Think it\u2019s you? I do!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting our first step is our adoption application, located on our website.

            "description": "Jorge is a 7-8 year old sharpei/lab mix.  Jorge is a big teddy bear - he's so lovable and sweet and has the squishiest face! He loves car rides - even the car wash was fun for him! He also loves to play fetch and to go for walks. And he also loves to be lazy and be with his person.He was adopted from us as a puppy but recently came back to our rescue because he was too much for his adopter to handle.  Jorge is a big guy - around 65 pounds - and he's strong - so he can pull you on the leash and could get away if you're not paying attention. But mostly he walks well on a leash, very slow and gently, but when he sees some other dogs, he sometimes needs to be redirected/reminded to focus and continue his walk or else he can be reactive. We put Jorge in training and he did wonderfully - he is a really good boy! He needs an adopter who will help him stay focused and be the great boy that he has shown us he is!  He is very much a people pleaser.  Jorge seems to be dog selective - in his prior home,  he lived with another dog (a lab) and was fine, but they said when he would see dogs out on walks, he acted all tough and can be a lot to handle. That's when helping him redirect and focus has to happen. Jorge is living with several small dogs in his foster home and he loves to play with them! He sent him to a structured doggy daycare also and he did very well - he was a very well-behaved boy! We just think he needs an experienced dog owner who knows how to control big dogs and is willing to continue reinforcing the training we have done with him.  Based on how well he is doing at day care, at training, and in his foster home, we think he can live fine with another dog, but we'd like to help with the introductions to make sure the dogs get off on the right foot! Jorge has not been around cats to our knowledge and we haven't seen him around kids but older kids would probably be fine - he's very people friendly but given his size and strength, we just want to be sure everyone around him can handle him safely.  If you are interested in adopting from Recycled Doggies, please complete an adoption application at https://recycleddoggies.wufoo.com/forms/recycled-doggies-adoption-application/  THAT IS THE FIRST STEP IN OUR PROCESS.  Jorge is neutered, up to date on vaccines, dewormed, heartworm negative and on monthly prevention, and microchipped.  We are looking for an adopter in the Cincinnati area for Jorge so that we can help with introductions and have access to our trainers if needed.  Due to the coronavirus, we are not having regular adoption events, so we will work with approved adopters (YOU MUST SUBMIT AN APPLICATION AND BE APPROVED FIRST) to set up a time to meet Jorge and spend time with him. [Note: the process of submitting an application doesn't obligate you to adopt Jorge, it just makes sure that if it's a match, that the adoption could be finalized.] If you have additional questions, please email recycleddoggies@gmail.com.",

            "description": "1.\tWhat is your name?\n\nMy name is Rey.\n\n2.\tHow old are you?\n\t\nI was born on December 16, 2019.\n\n3.\tWhat do you look like?\n\nI am a medium sized puppy who is still growing into her fur.  I am mostly white, but I have a cute little liver patch on my butt and a few small liver spots on my body.  I personally think my ears are my best feature, \u201cflying nun\u201d style you know.  \n\n4.\tWhat do you like to eat?\n\nI\u2019ve been eating a variety of kibble and raw food and I like all proteins and edible treats of any kind.  Sometimes I get so excited over treats, I forget fingers are holding those treats, sorry not sorry. \n\n5.\tWhat kind of personality do you have?\n\nI am a fun loving, adventure seeking, energetic kind of gal during the day and a snuggly, cuddly girl at night.  I love to swim and I am getting pretty good at dock diving if I do say so myself.  I am also dabbling with the disc now.  Hoping to get better at that too with some more practice.  Even though I have a sibling that has been adopted, my foster mom tells me I have only child syndrome.  Meh, so I don\u2019t like to share my toys or be bothered when I\u2019m trying to dock dive.  I see nothing wrong with that.  \n\n6.\tDescribe your perfect day\n\nIt really doesn\u2019t take much to make me happy.  I\u2019m full of life and down for anything.  My perfect day is working for breakfast, followed by a nice walk, then maybe a nap in the sun until my food digests, with a trip to the dock to jump after my favorite toys, a good dinner, then a relaxing snuggle with you to end the day.  \n\n7.\tWhat is your favorite toy?\n\nMy favorite toy was a pool noodle, no seriously I loved it, but my foster mom convinced me other toys are way better and last longer.  I pretty much love anything I can jump into water after.  I also love a good marrow bone, those things are pretty tasty. \n\n8.\tDo you know any tricks?\n\t\nI don\u2019t know any tricks per se, but I do know how to sit, climb, stay (work in progress), lay down, walk on lead, and I\u2019m learning more each day.  \n\n9.\tWhat scares you?\n\nI am not really afraid of much.  The fireworks were loud, but pretty cool.  Storms don\u2019t bother me either, except I would prefer not to wet from rain.\n\n10.\tDo you like cats?\n\nI do like cats\u2026..I like to chase them, and chase them, and chase them, and bite at them!!!  Apparently that is wrong, so I ended up having to find a new forever home.  The cats didn\u2019t like to be chased nonstop.  I didn\u2019t really understand the problem, but they say I should not live with cats for the safety of the cats. \n\n11.\tDo you have any doggie best friends?\n\t\nI currently live with two older females but it took a week of crating and rotating before I could meet them. My foster mom says I\u2019m constant management with dogs and would probably do best as an only dog since I am still maturing.  I tend to make bad decisions with dogs if I\u2019m overly excited.  I don\u2019t really like when dogs approach my kennel, or when they approach barriers I\u2019m behind either, but it\u2019s ok, I\u2019m a work in progress, that\u2019s what my foster mom says at least.  \n\n12.\tIf you could be anywhere in the world, where would it be?\n\nOn a dock chasing that neon rainbow.\n\n13.\tHow is your health?\n\nAccording to my veterinarian, I am a healthy, growing puppy.  \n\n14.\tHow long have you lived in your foster home?\n\nI\u2019ve been with a member of Even Chance or in a foster to adopt home since I was first born.  They took my mom from the shelter right after she had my brother and me. \n\n15.\tWho do you live with in your foster home and who is your closest companion? \n\t\nI share a beautiful home with my foster parents and foster siblings. I have two high school aged people siblings that are awesome.  I seriously love playing with them and I don\u2019t seem to get in trouble when I play with them like I do shorter people.  Apparently, I can be a little too much with younger kids, but they have such cool toys, I digress.  I also have two dog siblings.  All of my foster family is great, but I\u2019m probably closest to my foster mom.  \n\n16.\tWhere do you hang out when you are home alone?\n\nI always hang out in my crate when there aren\u2019t any people home.\n\n17.\tWhere do you sleep?\n\t\nI always sleep in my crate at night, but while my family is home, I will lay on my bed in the family room, chill on my tie out in the hearth room, or snuggle on the couch.  \n\n18.\tWhat do you love about your foster family?\n\nI love that my foster family is so dedicated to meeting all my needs. I am grateful that Even Chance rescued me! \n\n19.\tWhat was life like before you were rescued by Even Chance and brought into the welcoming arms of your foster parents?\n\nI was stuck in a shelter with my mom and brother.\n\nEven Chance does not operate on a first come, first serve basis. In most cases we have already decided the type of home and owner we want for our dogs. These opinions are based on the temperament tests we perform prior to accepting the dog into our program and the behaviors the dogs display as they spend time in our homes. Our agency reserves the right to deny acceptance of any dog to an owner who we feel the lifestyle does not match that of the dog. We are in no way judging you or your lifestyle; we simply want to put our dogs in the best living situation possible. We take very seriously the decision we make when it comes to placing one of our dogs in a forever home. If I sound like the perfect pit bull for your and your family and you are interested in giving me a forever home, do not hesitate! Please fill out an application here and my foster family will contact you to schedule an in-person meet and greet. We look forward to meeting any and all interested applicants. \n\n",

His original family in Texas returned Bran back to the shelter when this all started and due to covid could not address his situation. We took this boy in not knowing what exactly his issue was. Thank you to the Stetler family who saw his story and stepped up to get his needed mri and surgery. \nYou see...Bran had a large cyst which had been there since the day he was born. It grew with Bran as he grew. Due to the damage as it was not addressed in time he will always have a funny walk.  \nBran will need a home with very little stairs as in a ranch type home and stairs that are not steep going to the backyard or front yard for a walk. He may even continue to occasionally fall and land on his knuckles. I can assure you he is very confident at walking it off as if it has never have happened.  \nBran sure is a character in personality?. He is house broken about 2 years old over 80lbs and is a shepherd mix. He is loyal and a  big hearted goofy boy. He is a big lover and loves everyone! He enjoys overlooking his doggy fosters brothers and sister to assure they all come back in from pottying and are safe?\nHe has some obiedience type of training he is working on...as in he will mouth his people and other dogs (his way of saying hello) this is not aggressive by any means. We actually do call him Crocodile Man. If you would like a meet n greet please contact us.",

I am a good boy, just not social with other dogs. Isn't there someone out there to be my best friend. Or can you foster me until we find one? Vetting and food would be supplied by the rescue.I am fine on a walk with my training collar on, that I come with. I am a 6 year old neutered, rottweiler/coon hound mix. I'm looking for someone with Rottweiler experience, that can understand me. I am laid back and low maintenance, but need to be the only dog in the home. I am dog selective. I was the king of my castle and Mr Macho moved in with us. I got knocked off my throne and had to move out. I started fighting with the other dog, that I always got along with. I guess she was a better target than him.I can't live with cats either. The hound part of me wants to chase them. My rottweiler side makes me want to be the boss ,if I don't have a leader person giving me direction. A free training session will come with my adoption, so you will know how to keep me walking the line. I will also come with a remote collar, when going for walks.That way we can start off our new life together knowing what to expect from each other. I enjoy going on walks and being outside.I walk nicely on leash but get excited and jump and bark when I see other dogs. I come with a training collar to control that. I can be left alone loose in your house, while you are at work, without being destructive. I will watch a movie. I am perfectly house trained. I am not a dog for a dog park, but I don't need a lot of entertaining anyway.I need social distanced from dogs, but I love all adult people. Teenagers are ok, but small children make me nervous.A home without them is best. I truly need to find my best friend. Could that be you? Please give me a chance.\nIf interested, you can easily fill out an adoption application by clicking here: adoption application\nFor anyone viewing this on Petfinder, if you are interested in adopting this animal you will need to go to our website www.rosesrescue.net to fill out the online adoption application. You can usually find more pictures of the animals there too. Click on our name 'Roses Rescue' in blue above to be taken directly to our website.",

            "description": "Hi everyone, Rose here and I am a real sweetie!  I\u2019m about 3 or 4 years old and am pretty small for a bully dog (about 50 pounds).  I\u2019m not what some call a \u2018pocket pittie\u2019 but I\u2019m pretty close \u2013 you can see in my photos that I\u2019m pretty short and compact.  My foster mom says one of my cutest features is the \u2018eyeliner\u2019 around my eyes; she likes that I\u2019m a short stack too.  I have all my shots, am spayed and I am on heart worm preventive \u2013 I just finished heart worm treatment so for a few more weeks I need to stay kind of quiet.  I\u2019m a very happy girl and get along well with my other bully foster mates \u2013 we don\u2019t have any small dogs around here so I don\u2019t know if I like them or not.  One day my foster dad put me in a kennel with another bully boy and after a few hours we got into a scuffle; we are back to being friends now though \u2013 dad\u2019s fault.  We run and play out in the pasture and have a great time.  After initially playing around with my buddies I will often go exploring on my own.  Since I\u2019m happy with other dogs and on my own I would be happy with a dog pal or as a spoiled princess.  I like my foster dad\u2019s teenage grandchildren but haven\u2019t been exposed to younger children. I walk well on a leash, come when I\u2019m called and will sit for treats and petting.  I\u2019m crate trained and partially house trained \u2013 we are working on that.  My foster dad doesn\u2019t think I had the easiest life before he met me.  He found me wandering around all alone in the country (I was likely dumped) and I was pretty skinny and sad.  I love my new life as a member of his family but would really love to have a family of my own that would love me, spoil me and maybe let me cuddle on the couch with them. Did I mention I LOVE treats? I would love to join your family and, hey, if you are all alone and need someone to hang with, I\u2019m your girl. Pick me, ick me, pick me!!  If you are interested in me, please contact Eric at esailors57@gmail.com.\n\nThis is a Complimentary Posting only.  Dogs listed as Complimentary Posts are NOT Second Chance Pets dogs.

She is housebroken and walks great on the leash. Snow Bunny is heartworm positive, but treatment and retesting is included in the adoption price. She came to Apollo as a mama with many babies. Her babies have been adopted out and now momma is looking for her forever home! \n\nWe suspect her to have been born in 2017.\n\nIncluded with adoption: Age-appropriate vaccinations, up to date heart-worm preventative, heart-worm test if over 6 months, insurance for 30 days, microchip with registration, and spayed or neutered- if not already, a voucher is provided. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry",

She is really good with other dogs and loves to play with all shapes and sizes of dogs. She sleeps with her foster mom and gives the sweetest kisses.\nStill a puppy at heart, she can be a bit mouthy and isn't great on a leash. She needs a home that understands the importance of positive reinforcement training and no physical punishment. She also has allergies and needs seasonal injections to keep them in-check. Don't we all in North Carolina?\nHer mom, Roxy, is one of the sweetest girls you will ever meet and was adopted by her foster who just couldn't let her go.

I know what it means to be a house dog, I like to lay around and watch TV or go for walks. I am super strong so make sure you have a good hold on me when we go for our walks. I do not like other dogs and will be best if I am in a house where no other animals are around. I like little kids and I just want to make sure they are super clean and lick them to death.

An application does need to be submitted before meeting.***\n\nMocha, is a wonderful 3 year old dog that will answer to Mocha or Mocha, Jamocha, (Sometimes she smiles like a half lip thing really cute). She is small with a soft coat and has a very big bark for her size. She would be a great watch dog for someone. She likes to jump and play and gets very excited around new people. (She does not pee though) She likes toys but doesn\u2019t have a lot because the dogs all fight over them. She loves a Kong with treats (peanut butter) in it. She can be very cuddly. She would be great for an older couple or someone with teens. Her foster would recommend she be in a home where she can be the main animal getting attention, she can be a little jealous with her current siblings. She does not chew on furniture or shoes.  She is up to date on everything including heartworm and Bravecto.\n\nSadly, She is in need of a new wonderful home because the vet feels she is allergic to her current homes grass\u2026 crazy but for the past 6 months or so she would get a rash on her stomach. When this happens, she will need two different kinds of meds to help with it and occasionally a steroid shot. This is about $200-$334 every other month. After her last visit to the vet we found that the meds can be a little cheaper not going directly through the vet and getting them online. She also has a special shampoo and condition that is also included in that price for her maintenance\n\n \n\nShe really is a great dog and would love to see her go to a home that is able to love her as much as we do and can deal with the financial responsibility.\nShe likes going out for walks and will truly be a best friend.\n\n\n\n\nUpon receipt of your application, the rescuer and foster in AL will contact you so you can ask any specific questions you may have! If there is more than one decision maker in the home, all of them should be in agreement!\n\nAdoption Donation: Unless otherwise stated in the pet's bio, our standard adoption fee is $295 which covers age appropriate vaccines (DHPP vax) and (Rabies vax if 12 weeks and older), utd on flea/tick prevention and heartworm prevention, worming, heartworm test @ age 6 months or older, microchip, fostering costs and health certificate.\n\nThank you for your understanding and consideration and for helping the dogs and puppies in need!\n\nWe do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21\nCharacteristics",

            "description": "This boy will charm your socks off!!! He is such a joy to have around, he loves his 4 legged foster sister. His healing transformation has been so nice to see. He is gaining weight and his fur is growing back in where it was missing on his head and neck. His confidence returning has been the most rewarding. He now seems proud of himself, with a jaunty upward tilt of the chin and looking you in the eyes. He is becoming a healthy, happy boy!\n\nHe loves to look out the window, go for walks and loves his cheese and peanut butter snacks. We have recently learned that popcorn is also a favorite and we get all kinds of commands and tricks from this boy for a popcorn kernel. When he walks his ears flop and it's so cute! He seems to be relaxing more and becoming more happy, I think he even smiled at me after his walk the other day. He is more comfortable with car rides too.\n\nThis poor gentleman was found roaming the streets with a huge gash on his head. Unfortunately he had multiple jaw fractures. His bloodwork is getting better but not perfect. We are still working on dental issues, as we are doing a little at a time for this sweet boy.\n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption. The standard minimum donation for puppies is $325 + 8.25% tax = $351.81, for dogs over 12 months the adoption fee is $225 + 8.25% tax = $243.66 and for our senior dogs 8 years and up is $100 + 8.25% tax = $108.25; this increase includes sales tax recently required by the State of Texas to collect. You can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallasdogrrr.org. \n\nFor more information, you can email adopt@dallasdogrrr.org. Upon receiving your application please allow us 2-3 business days to review and process.",

From poor breeding, to a lack of quality care, he was surrendered with his sibling to an overcrowded shelter with a boatload of health issues. Preston went from 84lbs on intake, to now weighing almost 130lbs & feeling better than ever after breezing through heartworm treatment! He is as true to the Dane breed as they come with his happy go lucky demeanor & never has a bad day! Preston loves everyone he meets in both human & dog form. He also LOVES kids, but would do best around kids that are more stable on their feet, given his extra large, size. Preston will require a home with lots of space to accommodate his afternoon fetch sessions & occasional zoomies! Preston truly doesn't know a stranger & loves to make new dog friends! Some of his favorite things consist of taking baths outside & drinking from the water hose, big orthopedic beds, soft fleece blankets, & being in the company of those that love him. Preston will provide an endless amount of love for whoever is lucky enough to adopt him! \n\nWe know this section often deters people from adopting Preston, which is so heartbreaking because he didn't ask to be neglected & he has so much love to give, but transparency is everything in finding the best home setting for him; We did discover that Preston has a genetic result of poor breeding & his abnormally shaped heart ultimately requires a little more stability with monthly medication to keep it pumping strong. (cost is about $120/mo through Allivet) He is also prone to dry eye due to his eye not producing enough tears so that can also be managed with eye drops/ointment once a day, which he tolerates just find with a couple treats, handy! We were advised by his vet that due to the condition of his heart, he is not an ideal candidate for heavy anesthesia, making him unable to be neutered. All pets in the adoptive home must be altered. Local adoptions in or near Austin, TX will be considered, so we can continue to support him & his adoptive family. \n\nPreston is a soldier! He is so appreciative & resilient, you would never know he was once neglected & unwanted. He is fully vaccinated, microchipped, & ready to love you! Can you make room for this big love bug & give him the chance to live life to the fullest?\n\nPlease apply at https://form.jotform.com/83106888643163 so we can contact you :)",

He was not previously socialized with other dogs or humans, given proper training, provided leadership, discipline, exercise or vetting but all that has changed and he is now on the road to a successful future. Echo is house trained, crate trained, knows sit, stay, down, and is learning to walk nicely on leash. He is being muzzle trained because he is fearful of strange dogs and people and make react aggressively initially if not properly introduced and given time to warm up and get comfortable. He is very smart and eager to please his humans once he knows and trusts you! Echo has become great friends with his foster siblings after proper introductions and is learning a lot from his doggie friends. He is a big puppy who loves to carry around fluffy toys or blankets he can hold in his mouth like a pacifier. He is an active puppy who would love an active new family who will take him walking, hiking, and play with him regularly to help tire him out. He would do best in a home without children and a more quiet environment without a ton of visitors but has a ton of potential with the right humans!\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

            "description": "Meet Shadow! As you can see from the pictures of his scarred face it looks like this guy had a rough life before he found his way to Maxx & Me. He is about 2-3 years old, 45 pounds, lab/pit mix. He was found running as a stray and trapped by a volunteer after who knows how long out on his own. We posted him all over online, let local shelters know, and posted flyers but never found an owner and with his condition we are not surprised by this. He finished his 90 day stray hold and is now ready for a forever home of his own! He is VERY sweet and gentle. He gets along with other dogs and wants to be friends and never pushy. He likes his food and treats. He will always sit in the kitchen and watch when his food is being prepared. He loves playing with the frisbee. As in some pictures he likes playing tug a war with rubber toys. He destroys stuffed toys within minutes and try's to swallow material so best with super chewer toys. Has not been cat tested. He wants a fenced in yard to play in in his forever home.\n\nTo meet Shadow please fill out an application on www.maxxandme.org. He is neutered, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped. His adoption donation is $250.\n\nMaxx & Me is an all volunteer, all foster home rescue and do not have a shelter. Please allow at least 48 hours for applications to be processed (missing information may slow the process, so please take your time and be thoughtful in your answers). All dogs posted are available (so no need to ask). We place dogs based on best home for each dog and not order of applications received. Email us at maxxandmerescue@gmail.com for updates and questions. Thank you for choosing rescue.",

Filling out an application does not obligate you to adopt, but merely begins the process. SEPR DOES adopt out of state!\n\nAdoption fees: All SEPR adoptions are $300 for adults and $400 for puppies under 1 year of age.  This includes: adoption fee (spay/neuter, utd vaccinations, micro-chipping), microchip registration, Gentle Leader, and two tie downs for use in your home. \n\nSEPR requires all adopted dogs attend a training class with their adoptive family within 90 days of their adoption. If an adoptive family completes this training class, they will be refunded $100 of their adoption fee with proof of licensed certificate. SEPR even offers an obedience class called Train-A-Bull to alumni over 1 year of age on a seasonal basis.  These classes are currently free!\n\n*All other pets in the residence must be spayed or neutered and all pets up to date on vaccinations.\n\n*SEPR requires all applicants must be 21 years of age.\n\n*SEPR dogs are adopted to be inside the home, \u201cpart of the family\u201d dogs only.\n\n*Families with children 5 years of age and under wanting to adopt puppies will be reviewed on a case by case basis. Raising a puppy properly takes a lot of time, and we understand that in families with small children, time can be a limited commodity.",

The only reason we have her listed as NO KIDS is because she is a heavy sleeper and is easily startled when you wake her up without talking to her first.   \n\nShe is a complete mush.   Wants petting and loving all day long.  \n\nShe has perfect house manners.   She listens very well.  \n\nShe is about 4 years old and has been fully vetted.   She came to us with eye entropin that has been surgically repaired and will cause no further issues. \n\nShe is heartworm positive and is being treated.    She is also on thyroid medication and will require 1 pill twice a day.  The cost is about $6 a month for her thyroid medication. \n\nCuddle Jo is into taking walks, show tunes, dancing and long undisturbed naps.     If you are looking for an easy to care for, laid back, sweet dog that loves petting and attention she is the dog for you!    This is a Rescue Dog.  She will be hard to place because of her hw status and thyroid medication needs. \n\nShe was not well cared for before coming to us.  It took over a week to teach her what a dog bed was for and to get her to enjoy treats.   She was picked up by animal control as a stray, loaded with fleas, eye entropia, hw, and stinky.    She was just sad...... now happy and playful! \n\nAdoption applications/information are at www.hollowcreekfarm.org    \n\n",

We didn't get much information about her other than her age.\nThe first night she was at our rescue, she had a seizure at the foster home. We are guessing the stress with the trip to the rescue and new surroundings may have triggered them. The vet has put her on phenobarbital to help control the seizures and hasn't had one since. She will need to stay on the medication the rest if her life.\nCleo is coming out of her shell and becoming more playful as she settles into her foster home where there are other dogs and cats.\nCleo is working on house and crate training.\nAll medical work has been completed prior to adoption including spay, shots, worming, kennel cough, rabies shot. Micro chip,  grooming and vet exam. \nAdoption fee is $150 + tax with an approved application.  The adoption application is available on the website http://www.prairiepawsrescue.com and go to the adopt link to download the application (jotform) fill it out and submit \nWe do not adopt on a first come basis. But who will provide the best home suited to the pets needs\n",

            "description": "This lovely lass is Georgina (a.k.a. Gina, Georgie, GeGe). She's around 60 pounds and we estimate her to be 6 or 7. If you love a blocky-head bully, she's your girl. Her brindle is well defined and offset by beautifully contrasting white accents. Georgie may not be a spring chicken, but she's still a looker with many good years of loyal companionship left in her.\n\nGeorgina loves car rides, kiss & hugs, and as you can tell by one of her photos; a tennis ball (or two or three) are not to be ignored. She is very people-centric, really enjoys a person's friendship and attention. If you're the kind of person who participates in life with your dog, Georgina is perfect for you. She doesn't require any special accomidations, just the usual green space to romp around a little and explore. \n\nGeorgina must be the only dog though as she can be unpreditable with other dogs. She will make a great friend to someone committed to not adding canines or felines to the household. She's probably best with older, bigger kids only due to her own size but she seems to like people of all shapes, sizes and ages. Georgina just wants to belong.\n\nIf you would like to meet Georgina, please submit an application through our website. Her adoption fee is $100.00, she's fully vetted and ready to go.\n\nwww.NinjaPawsRescue.org\n \n",

His beautiful mahogany coat and boundless energy make him a joy to be around.\n\nThis pup needs a home that is very active and can provide him with the exercise and training he needs. He is very smart, very focused and very easy to train. He would make an outstanding agility dog, running companion or potential SAR dog. He needs to be a 'working' dog because he gets bored easily.\n\nBecause of his herding instincts, Griffey needs to be in a home without children or cats. Although he gets along well with other dogs, he does have some resource guarding around his food and toys, so that would have to be managed carefully.\n\nMost of our dogs require a fully fenced yard, this does depend on the individual dogs needs and safety requirements.  \n\nOur dogs are fed a nutrient rich dog food named NutriSource.  Our experience is a high quality dog food keeps vet bills down and well-being high.\n\nIf you have any questions please email: claudiaatwag@gmail.com\n\nVisit our website to fill out an Adoption Application  http://www.wagsequimwa.com\n\nAdoption donation fee $350  (Please understand this adoption donation goes towards helping all the dogs we rescue)",

Tho he's 10 years old, he's got the energy of a much younger dog!\n\nRainbow wound up with us after his owner passed away. He was used to traveling everywhere with his owner, he's great in the car. He's housetrained and has been a house pet all his life. Rainbow is a very social dog. He greets all people like old friends! He weighs 45 lbs, a nice medium sized dog\n\nRainbow has been in our foster care since 7/9/20 and he gets along with the female dogs there! Not good with male dogs or cats. He's happy and playful and loves to romp in the yard.\n\nSadly, Rainbow is considered special needs. Rainbow had a biopsy done recently when he was neutered and unfortunately it's cancer. He has no symptoms yet, we don't truly know how this will progress. The tumor he has is said it's inoperable.\n\nAdoption fee $150.00 \nIncluded in Adoption: All dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated - Da2pp, Bordetella and Rabies, tested for HW/Lyme,  dewormed and started on HW/wormer monthly prevention (Interceptor Plus), and treated for flea/tick control (Advantix). Dogs are also micro-chipped and adoption includes lifetime registration. Also included in the adoption is 30 days of Pet First Pet Insurance, and Petco's Free Welcome to the Family Program. This program supports All New Pet Parents and offers Free resources, more than $650 in savings and 24/7 support.\n\nApply online:\nhttps://www.highlandcountyhumanesociety.org/available-animals/ \n\nTo contact us, please send an email or FB message to:\nEmail: info@highlandcountyhumanesociety.org\nWebsite: www.highlandcountyhumanesociety.org\nFaceBook: www.facebook.com/HighlandHumane\n\nHCHS is 100% foster and volunteer based (no staff, no employees). All animals for adoption are in foster homes and can be seen by appointment suitable to your schedule.  Our volunteers may be able to help with local transportation. Save a life!  ~ADOPT~ \n",

We don't know his early life except that he was found in the backyard of an abandoned house - he very likely had never been allowed inside. He's learning his house manners now and is getting the finer details of potty training hammered out. He's also finding out how great treats and toys are! Now that Dino has been shown some love, he really really doesn\u2019t want to lose it. His foster is working diligently to show Dino that love is constant and unconditional and undergoing thorough training to work on Dino\u2019s separation anxiety. He\u2019s progressing well but will need a home with structure to help reinforce and grow his current training. Dino would be perfect for a home looking for a sweet, playful, goofball full of love! He is wonderful with people but has kindly requested a home with no other dogs.",

They require a lot of attention and training with them never ends!  Boundaries must be enforced and they often need reminders as they push past boundaires you set! Dogos are loving, kind and gentle but don't mistake that for weakness because they are equally powerful and intense as well! Everyone in the home must be on board with having a dogo and play a major role in their daily routines and training. Yes it is work, but the rewards are ten-fold! Lazy homes don't work for dogos as they need stimulation, exercise, and lots of attention too during their younger years.  Our goal in rescue is to be as transparent as we can about each and every dog plus make sure new families really understand the needs of a dogo!\n",

This little monster is healthy and super friendly to people. She really belongs on a farm or big property where she can patrol the perimeter and scare off (or kill ??????) the rodents. She\u2019ll make a great pet for the right family. She is about 12 lbs or so. Please fill out an app on the website and you can text 570-903-1731 with any questions.",

            "description": "Foster Homes Needed!\n\nDo you have time and room in your life for a foster dog?\n\nhttp://www.muttloverescue.org/foster.html\n\n*****************\n\nMaddie is the sweetest girl, she's 3 1/2 years old and ~55lbs. She is shy at first but once she warms up she is very affectionate and loving. She is a goofy gal who loves attention and belly rubs. She gets along with cats and older children. She is doing great in her foster home with their two dogs. Maddie definitely needs to go to a home with another low to medium energy dog or dogs. She is crate trained and house trained. She does well on a leash and really enjoys going on walks, but can get spooked by loud noises. She needs a patient owner to work with her and give her the reassurance and love she needs. In return, you will be rewarded with an adora-'bull' snorting velvet hippo! =-)\n\nContact Dee at k9rescueva@gmail.com with questions and to schedule a meeting.\n\n**BECAUSE OF OUR REQUIREMENT FOR A HOME VISIT, WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO ADOPT TO HOMES IN THE NORTHERN VA / MARYLAND / DC METRO AREA**\n\nWe have adoption events EVERY SATURDAY from 12-3 p.m. Please note that not all dogs can attend every event, so if you are interested in meeting a particular dog, please complete a no-obligation application on our website at http://www.muttloverescue.org/application.html OR write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nUpcoming adoption events:\n\nMutt Love Rescue is doing everything we can to ensure the health and safety of our volunteers and adopters while continuing our mission to find homes for as many dogs as possible.\n\nEffective immediately, we will not be holding our weekly adoption events. Dogs available for adoption can be met by appointment only. Potential adopters should submit an online application at http://muttloverescue.org/application.html. Once we receive your application, we will contact you to let you know the next steps.\n\nWe are always desperate for foster homes, now more than ever. If you are interested in fostering during this difficult time, please complete an application... unless you are a previous adopter/foster, then you can just contact us via phone (703-988-2608) or email (adopt@muttloverescue.org) to tell us which dog you want to foster!\n\nFor information on sponsoring this dog, please write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nWE NEED FOSTER HOMES! FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE EMAIL ADOPT@MUTTLOVERESCUE.ORG.\n\nVisit us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/muttloverescue\nFollow us on Twitter: @Muttlove_Rescue",

            "description": "Bear is a 5 yr old neutered male husky / shepherd mix. He was originally picked up as a stray in Los Angeles, California (where there is a husky overpopulation problem) and was on the euth list for being at the shelter for too long, when Alljoy 4 paws stepped in to rescue him. He is a sweet natured boy and incredibly smart, like your typical husky/shep mix. He is also typical in that he needs A LOT of exercise and structure (training and rules). His current foster exercises him every day (either a hike, mountain bike ride, trail run or skiing when there is snow)...and after he has had his exercise, he mostly sleeps the rest of the day (when he's not playing with his 5 foster dog siblings). The reason we say that Bear needs a lot of structure is because he did have dog reactivity issues when he was with his previous owner and was then returned. However, he has not exhibited these behaviors with his current foster but they are VERY structured with him and set rules and boundaries (as examples: he is not allowed on furniture, he is crate trained and sleeps in the crate every night, he heels at their side when they hike/walk, he sits and waits before walking through a doorway, sits and waits before he is allowed to eat his food, etc.). He is incredibly SMART and quick to learn...he already knows how to recall off leash, place, sit, shake, down, crate, etc. Bear behaves BEST when the fosters keep him in a calm state of mind and this is something the future adopter should continue for Bear to be his best self. Bear also needs to be in a home with other dogs...he currently lives in his foster home with 5 other very well trained medium-big dogs and the pack actually helps him relax and not have any reactivity issues. He previously lived in a home with children, so we know that he is also very gentle and good with kids. He is not cat tested, but he is very prey-driven so a home with cats may not be best for him. If you are someone who exercises daily, has other dogs and wants to focus on training a highly engaged and smart dog...Bear is your boy! \n",

At the time she was so scared of her mind she was unadoptable. She was actually brought out for our rescue by mistake but I just knew there was no way in heck she would get adopted if she had to stay at the shelter. So I said \"put her in my car\" \n\nDarcey has been living in my house since July. She loves me but is still very fearful. She trusts me & would let me do anything to her for the most part. She LOVES Fiona. They actually came from the same place and once they were reunited they really blossomed out of their shells. We would really like them to go together. \n\nShe has never once had an accident. At first, I walked her out on a leash to go potty. She immediately learned the dog door and at this point lets herself out. \n\nWhoever adopts her definitely needs to have a crate for her. It is her safezone! So please- don't feel guilty about putting her in one. She likes it & it is like her den. She goes in her crate all the time with the door wide open & when she doesn't even need to be in there. If not crated when unsupervised she may get into the trash or counter surf for goodies. \n\nThis girl is HIGHLY food motivated & I promise you this is how you will win her trust :) She just needs someone willing to give her time, structure & love! If you are a patient & child free home, preferably familiar with fearful dogs- you may be the home for this diva. Let us know! \n\nShe is dewormed, vaccinated, microchipped, spayed, microchipped & 4dx tested negative (tick fever, anaplasma, lyme disease & heartworm).",

My situation is really sad and I need someone who knows how to help under-socialized dogs become better. I don't know how I got so scared. I am super scared to let anyone touch me. I tremble, growl, I am weary of people, and don't like water.\n\nI DO like my Teddy bear though. I can't even tell you if I am good with other dogs. They didn't do a dog evaluation on me at shelter. I am still young and if I can find the right loving home with no kids and a quiet atmosphere, I will get better!!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this dog, please visit our website for our online application www.underdogaz.com\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This dog is courtesy posted for another individual or Rescue.

Other than needing to be an only pet and careful around other dogs, she really has no other issues. She walks well on leash and knows a number of commands - and even follows them quite well on leash and about half the time when not on leash. (The other half of the time off leash she wants to convince us she just didn't hear the commands...oh malamutes!) On walks, she does well with the 'wait' command, though will pull to get to another dog, so needs someone strong enough to keep her from doing that. She enjoys pulling carts, which is good, as she needs exercise to lose a little extra 'fluff'. This friendly girl loves people and has spent time with older children that she did very well with. Sadie enjoys attention and getting pets and belly rubs. She likes to play with toys and will bring a toy over to encourage playtime. Interested in sponsoring? See our sponsorship information.",

The name is Aldi.  I am a 3 year old, 50 lbs, female, Pit Bull Terrier mix.  I guarantee an experience like no other when choosing to have me as your forever.  There will be no cleanups on aisle 5, because I have already mastered house training.  Crate training was also a breeze.  Im friendly to humans, but would rather have a home where I can be your one and only! If my home has kids, they need to be older, middle school and up age range. I am a very playful and active girl so I would really love if my new family shared the same passion as I do for getting out for walks and lots of playtime.  I would do best in a home with a privacy fenced in yard.  Discover the Aldi difference and submit an application!\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

We are showing dogs and cats to prospective adopters, but only on the grounds outside our shelter. We will need appointment to show the animal and we will want to have social distancing of 6' while you are there and we are wearing masks. We are doing Zoom interviews to see inside of your home since we aren't going into homes for home visit. We do come to your home before finalizing adoption to check the security of your fence if you are adopting a dog. Our dogs are given much care and attention and we treat every medical need of animal once we take them in.\nMCHS is a limited intake adoption center. We are an all volunteer, non-profit organization. All of our animals are disease free, have been spayed/neutered and are up to date on shots. We charge a Dog adoption fee of $125 which includes a microchip. Our Cat adoption fee is $75.00. Most of our dogs will require a fenced yard. To fill out application, go to our website Marshallcountyhumanesociety.org, go to Adoption Info tab and click on Application. For more info, call 662-564-2900. I was in a loving home but when my owner died, I was returned to shelter. I'm such a good, loving boy, just come and meet me and you will see. I weigh 45 lb. I really like to have a human to love. Come and see me soon by calling 662-564-2900 or E-mail DogsNCats11@gmail.com to make an appointment to meet me.\nTo fill out application go to Marshallcountyhumanesociety.org and go to Adoption Info and click on Application.\nAll our animals have been spayed or neutered and up to date on all preventives and shots and we are microchipped.",

He plays actively with other dogs and loves to play with toys. He is shy about meeting people and would love to attend a training class with his family, so he can continue to blossom. He has a soft personality and needs a bit of confidence when exploring new things and people. He is looking for a very loving family who will fill his life with positive experiences to show him what love is really about. If you are looking for a true companion and to make a difference in the life of a rescue dog, then you will fall in love with Buddy!! He is a great boy who deserves the best family.",

If interested, please complete an application on our website at www.pawswapofgreaterlafayette.com/adopting. \n\nDuke is about 4 years old and weighs 50 pounds. He has spent some time in a foster home and we have learned some things about him after he went unclaimed after a local car accident. Duke has been doing well in home with fosters and he is very loved! They have been taking him out on runs and he is a happy pup. He would enjoy being someone's jogging companion. Duke does well with a schedule, ideally a fenced yard, and owners who like to be active. He currently with fosters who leash walk him and do not have a fence, and he is doing well.  He loves to accompany his owner room to room and would love a person who can check on him mid-day or be home frequently. He is quite the cuddle bug and is ready for a nap as much as he is up for hiking and adventures. He enjoys splashing around in a baby pool and has quite a fun personality. \n\nDuke is good with older children. He can be a bit too excited for younger kiddos. Duke has been fine around certain other dogs, but can sometimes be protective of his food/treats/toys. He would be great as an only pet. He is likely too much for felines. Duke is house trained and although he doesn't love being in the crate, it's what he needs when he is not being supervised when owners are away.\n\nDuke is neutered, up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative, and microchipped. If interested, please complete an application on our website at www.pawswapofgreaterlafayette.com/adopting. His adoption fee is $100.",

When we initially met Buddy he was a very friendly and sweet boy with all people. Although he remained this way with his adoptive family and most people he meets, he has developed some issues with strangers when they make unexpected movements and startle him. Buddy also became somewhat protective of his home, barking when visitors come by, so he would do best in a home where he could have slow introductions with treats, or spend some time in a quiet room when it's known that folks will be stopping in. \n\nBuddy has aged gracefully and as a senior many of his issues have dissipated. He's slow-moving and a real sweetheart with all staff and volunteers. \n\nNow that his friend Lily Bear has moved into another pen, Buddy is hoping his next roommate will be his forever adopter!\n\nHe does prefer the company of dogs that will give him some space, rather than those who jump all over him and force him to interact. \n\nBuddy is looking for a home that will be happy to have him snuggle in with his family, rather than have to be a social butterfly. He'll need an adults-only home with experienced owners.\n\nBuddy can't wait to meet you!",

If interested, please complete an application on our website at www.pawswapofgreaterlafayette.com/adopting. \n\nThis handsome pup has had some major ups and downs in his life. Cash has proven to be an excellent and well loved foster dog, but we had to break the news to him that his beloved foster mama is heading out of state for the semester. Since he hasn't found his forever home yet, Cash will have to return to the kennel very soon. It's kind of breaking our heart.\n\nCash is a 1.5 year old pit mix that weighs in at almost 70 pounds. His first family saved him as a baby in a bad situation. They gave him a safe home for almost a year while bringing him up to date on vetting. As he grew into an adult, he was too much puppy energy for the senior pup in the home. He ended up being rehomed, but then his luck ran out for awhile. He turned up as a stray at the kennel.\n\nLife started looking up again. We recognized that he seemed like he would benefit from some inexpensive anxiety medication to get through these upcoming transitions, and it's been a game changer for Cash. He moved into a foster home several months ago and has lived like a king. He LOVES to play fetch in the fenced yard. He cuddles and snuggles on the couch, the oversized bean bag chair, and on his human's bed. He is house trained and crate trained. He's improved walking on a leash, but he is strong and can pull. Cash is good with people, we just recommend older children age 12 and up due to inexperience. Although he is on anxiety medication currently, he doesn't have any destructive tendencies...he's a well behaved house companion.\n\nCash needs to be an only pet. He is not a fan of other dogs and has too much of a prey drive to safely be around cats and small animals. Cash is neutered, up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative, and microchipped. We would love to be able to move Cash into a foster home or adoptive home very quickly to avoid having this sweet pup back at the kennel. If you are interested in fostering or adopting, please complete an application on our website at www.pawswapofgreaterlafayette.com/adopting. His adoption fee is only $100 and we will assist with medication during his transition into a forever home.",

He will need a home that can commit to keeping him active and well exercised, as well as continuing his obedience training. \n\nRJ can do well with other dogs and we are working on socializing him. He currently plays well with another young female dog his size. He would do fine as an only dog or with a laid back female under 5yo. \n\nRJ would love to find a forever home with a backyard for him to run and play. Since RJ can be rambunctious and is still learning, we recommend kids over 12. He is not tested with cats. \n\nRJ is UTD on shots, microchipped and neutered. His adoption fee is $450.",

His owner didn\u2019t realize until it was to late that she could no longer care for him.  He will need a dental and good meds for his skin which he takes without any problems so he is on the ends.  In time this little guy will make a great companion.   He does great around the other pups but would not recommend going to a household with little kids.  Consider sponsoring until he recovers from his injuries.\nUpdate:  Oreo skin allergy is all cleared up.\nAdult, Male, Small\n\nMISSYS HAVEN CANINE Rescue, in San Antonio TX- ALL of our dogs are raised in the San Antonio area. Each dog comes spayed or neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations that are appropriate for their age, microchipped, heartworm tested and on current on monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventative. \n\nALL OF THIS IS INCLUDED IN THE ADOPTION FEE OF $200.00 FOR LOCAL DOGS AND $250.00 FOR PUPPIES. ( Local is in the state of Texas)! Medical records will come with each dog at the time of adoption. Some dogs are part of our ambassador program and their adoption fee varies.\n\nIF THIS IS AN OUT OF STATE ADOPTION, TRANSPORT TO YOU is included in the adoption fee of $400.00 for adult dogs and $500.00 for puppies.

Mea was surrendered to a partnering shelter in 2018 with a request that she be euthanized. At the time, Mea was a healthy 4 year old, 45 lb pointer mix. Her 'family' wanted her euthanized for her separation anxiety. When she was left alone, she would destroy things. Instead of working with her, they gave up on her. On December 28, 2018, Mea was accepted into the Happy Hounds Prison Program, where she flourished! She and her special inmate worked side by side with a renowned trainer. Both of them gained confidence and self assuredness. Mea was considered the 'nurturer' to the other dogs who came into the program. It was as though she let them know that she, too, was once very scared and unsure, but she blossomed, and so would they.\n\nWith confidence and a whole lot of training under her belt, Mea was ready to be adopted. It lasted just 6 months. The resident dog attacked Mea. the adopters didn't set boundaries and show Mea support. They simply returned her, and Mea was a much different dog. We wept when we saw her scars, weight loss, and wide eyed expression. She was terrified of everything. A voice or noise she didn't recognize sent her spinning in her crate. Slowly and quietly, we got our sweet Mea back to where she was before she was adopted. She no longer needs a thunder shirt, and she is restful in her crate. Loud noises scare her, so we think she would do best in a rural home instead a house in the suburbs. She is slow to warm up to people she doesn't know, but if you sit quietly, she will plop herself into your lap without reservation!\n\nMea does not play with dogs in the yard, but she has doggie neighbors that only bother her when they bark too long.\n\nThis isn't our typical write up about a dog, and we know this. Our hope for Mea, who is now 6 years old, is that she will meet someone who will nurture her and support her and let her know that she is just fine. Maybe her new home is with a retired person who is home more than away and likes listening to classical music. Maybe her new home is with an older dog who won't get upset if Mea occasionally zoomies in the house when she feels silly. Maybe there is a cat who prefers sitting on top of the refrigerator to swatting at Mea's face. Maybe her new home is on a farm, where the loudest sounds are of animals calling to each other. What we do know for sure is that Mea deserves all the happiness she can get, and she deserves one final home. She deserves a family or person who will reach out to us if they have questions and reach out to her trainer if they need support. We wish this for all the dogs in our care, but we wish this for Mea the most.\n\nMea is up-to-date on her shots and her adoption fee is $280. 1/27/21 10:46 AM",

He is fun and friendly with a certain swagger that lets him position himself front and center for all the hugs, attention, and treats he can get. Rocko will want to spend a lot of time with you so if you work from home or are not gone long hours that would be a real bonus for Rocko. He is crate trained and is improving on house training in his foster home with consistent, positive reinforcement. Rocko is a 1 1/2 - 2 year old chihuahua mix, neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped. He does have allergies that may require medication. For more info call Lidia at 480-206-3883",

While she is gorgeous and can be a wonderful dog , she is 80 lbs of power !  She is looking for an owner with large, working breed experience, who will routinely exercise her daily , continue her training and respect her needs . Roxy has come leaps and bounds with her training over the last few months - but she will need structure and discipline to be a big part of her life - otherwise she could be a bit of a bull in a china shop !!!. Roxy must be the only pet in the house and it\u2019s suggested no children under 12 . Roxy is 100% housebroken and completely non destructive. She was previously a house dog and appears to have been used for breeding. Roxy likes to play and once she trusts , she is happy to receive belly rubs, big hugs and kisses. Roxy shows no aggression to people , but she does have an independence about her. She will happily nap or chew a bone but she needs her exercise. Roxy came to us with zero leash skills and she is now excellent on a leash , but you must have good control of her due to her strength. If interested please come visit her or contact the shelter .",

Johnnie Walker is one of four pups born to a stray mother. The mother found a safe place to have her puppies in an out building with a kind owner. She was fed and sheltered, but it wasn't going to be her forever home. They all (mom and pups) were surrendered to animal control when the pups were weaned. All the pups have been on the shy side, not a lot of people interaction until they were surrendered. They have played well with each other and are interested in being friends with other dogs, big and small. Johnnie has started nipping at the back legs of the other dogs when playing at his foster home. Nipped the foster a couple of times too. We are discouraging this instinctual trait, but it is truly interesting how he knew what to do without ever seeing another dog working around cattle. He also has the 'heeler yip'.

She prefers the company of dogs and will flourish in a home where she has a canine companion to show her the ropes as well as a secure, fenced yard.",

Rowan is the sweetest baby you will ever meet!  He loves to give love and will follow you wherever you go.  He gets along good with other dogs but doesn't seem to like cats and he likes to chase squirrels.  Rowan's heart is as big as the smile on his face, and he can't wait to share it with you! Come out and meet Rowan today and you will lose your heart to him!\n\nFor more information please call the HCHS at 512-793-5463.  We are open Thursday through Sunday from noon to 4pm and on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday by appointment only.  You can see all our available animals at HillCountryHumaneSociety.org.\nAll our adoptable dogs are treated for fleas, given DHPPV and Bordatella vaccines and are de-wormed.  \nWhen you adopt one of our animals it will be micro chipped and registered at the time of adoption.  Also, if not already altered, you will receive a voucher to get your animal spay/neutered for free.\nWhile we do our best to determine the breeds of our dogs, the majority are strays, and we have only general appearance, coat type, size, ear type, tail, tongue color and coat color to base breed on.  It is always possible when adopting a puppy that it will change dramatically to look like another breed.",

I had puppies over and over, and then they were taken away to be sold. I was so sad. But I don't want to focus on my past. I was rescued and now my future looks oh so bright! I am learning about this big world! Humans can be kind! I love to be with my foster mom and snuggle!\n\nI mentioned my medical stuff. My foster mom says I'm a mess. I'm diabetic and need two small shots a day, but it's super easy to do. I had cataract surgery and need daily eye drops for the rest of my life. Because I am diabetic I tend to have accidents, so my foster mom keeps me in a diaper. I also take daily pills for my skin and blood pressure. I know it sounds like a lot. But my foster Mom says I'm totally worth it!\n\nI have another vet appointment in early September, and my foster mom will have a better idea of my ongoing expenses. I am tiny, but mighty, and I'm dreaming of spending the rest of my life being loved by you!\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal. However, we have many wonderful homeless pets available.",

As he was leaving a local hardware store (Matthew\u2019s) he saw this sweet girl limping along on the side of the highway and scooped her up.\n\nYesterday, she was checked out by our friends at Grace who like her guardian angel were quickly charmed by Matty\u2019s sweet personality and soulful eyes. They estimate she\u2019s about 3 years old and currently weighs about 43 pounds. They pulled a lot of ticks off of her, which isn\u2019t surprising considering the time of year and the area. The wounds on her tail and ears are likely from a skin infection and will be treated with antibiotics and medicated baths. Her bloodwork results show that she is very heartworm positive, so she will need to begin treatment soon.\n\nMatty is very sweet girl and total love bug who loves meeting new people, riding in cars, snuggling, and giving kisses!",

I was found as a stray in KY.  I'm about 5 years young and about 15 pounds.  I was pretty shut down and scared when I first arrived but since living with mom and the other dogs I have become very settled and my sweet personality has emerged.  I LOVE to run and boy I can run like the wind so a secure fenced in yard is needed.  I do not want to live in an apartment and have to be leashed walked or rely on a dog park because I wouldn't be comfortable with a bunch of dogs I didn't know.  I like to play the game catch me if you can, which in human language means I do not come when I am called, hence the need for a secure fenced in yard.  I'm not a big fan of toys or bones, probably because I never had any before coming here, but give me a stick and I'm in my glory.  I do like to dig for coolness on hot summer days.  My favorite place in the whole wide world is on moms lap, that is if it's what I want to do.  If you want to snuggle and I'm not in the mood I will jump down.  I am an independent girl.   I do love to be petted and when mom stops doing that I put my head under her hand to tell her I still need more.  I like to know where she is, so when we sleep I either sleep in bed with her but if her little snot doesn't let me then I sleep on a dog bed right next to her bed.  I do follow the little snots lead when he is barking at the neighbor and join in with him.  For the most part I get along with all the dogs in my foster home unless mom brings home an annoying puppy to foster.  I'm done with youngsters because they are annoying, I want to be the only annoying one in the house.  I'm not a fan of dogs bigger then me especially when they want to play, to be honest I am intimidated by their size.  I really enjoy it when we foster dogs my size, I teach them how to run and if they freeze because I'm running like a nut I just jump over them.  I do a lot of play bowing to initiate play but if they continue to ignore me I'll give them a bop on the head with my paw.   I am a pretty little girl, I just hate my picture taken, I've got this phobia about having something pointed at me.  I've been with my foster mom for a little while now only because the right application hasn't come in for me.   I would be fine in a home with older children, I think little ones and all their noises would kinda freak me out.  Maybe someone could set up an agility course in the backyard and we could practice some new tricks.  Another pup my size and age would be a bonus.  Well, that's it for now, gotta go find mom.   Please visit our website for our meet/greet/adoption process, www.crazypawsdogrescue.com        Love, Tess\n\n\n",

I really don\u2019t care for men, cats, kids or dogs..... there... I said it! My foster mom (who I looove) says I may warm up slowly to a male but it will take time.

He LOVES to eat and loves any treat we give him. He is a big fan of soft beds and has not chewed or destroyed any beds or toys. He is a good shedder so daily maid services are required ? But, he is an easy bather. He is all about anything that gets him attention!",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 6/20/2020\nReason for being in rescue: Oscar was pulled from a rural shelter in North Carolina\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Oscar is a senior dog. He has a grade 4/6 heart murmor and will require daily medicine for the rest of his life. He had major surgery for bladder challenges, was neutered, and had a dental with extractions in early July. Oscar will require a special diet to help manage his bladder issues for the rest of his life.\nWeight: 9.70 lbs\nHeight: 9 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $1 - I am priceless\n\nFence needed? No\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Precious Oscar is looking for a retirement home. He needs to be the only dog in a home with someone home during the day. All that Oscar wants is a lap and snuggles. He needs a home committed to maintaining his daily heart medicine and special diet to help him live his healthiest life.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Oscar is a quiet gentleman. At an estimated 15 years young we cannot blame him. Oscar loves food. He is food motivated and will work for food, though at this point in life he is past wanting to do lots of tricks. He also loves soft beds and can be found snuggling down into any soft bed he can find. Oscar also loves to ride in cars! He will curl up in your lap for the ride and happily tag along for any road trip adventure you may be on.\n\nOscar does not like other dogs. He will snap at them if they come too close to his space, especially if they are in his place. We figure he's earned the right to be the king of someone's castle!\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Friendly\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Oscar's estimated birthday is 6/21/2005\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

I love my bath and blow dry and let my foster mom put my eyedrops in, with no problems.  I also love it when she combs my hair.  I get along with my foster mom\u2019s other dogs and want to play with them.  I wear a belly band as I am not housebroken.  I have the cutest underbite, too!  I get so excited when it\u2019s time to eat, that I dance and spin around.  I am a personable, funny boy! Click the Adopt tab, complete your application and put me, Amadeus, as a dog of interest.

            "description": "Hi there! My name is Opal and I am a smart 3 year old hound/terrier mix. My foster mom says I am an amazing mix of sweet and sassy.   I love to do things like go for walks, fetch a tennis ball, play tug of war, and don't judge me but I have a secret love of destroying fluffy squeaky toys and rope toys.  I love spending time with big  kids.  I have been around kids of all ages but I tend to get over excited with little kids. If my new family has kids they should be school aged and up. There is a cat in my foster home that I try to play with but he runs and hides. My foster mom thinks I\u2019d be ok with cats since I just want to play with them. My foster home also has a dog living there too, I can be a bit choosy with which dogs I get along. One of my requirements for a new home is that I am the only dog living in the home, no doggie visitors into my home, no doggie day care, and no dog parks. I really am a great girl, I just love all of the attention for myself.  l often like to impress people with my awesome doggie skills which include sitting, laying down, and shaking. I would love to be able to show you my awesome dog skills and for you to see what a great dog I am. Opal is around 75lbs. If you think I would fit into your family fill out an application at digsk9.org. My adoption fee is $350.\n\nThis dog is up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, and spayed/neutered. Please note that we are unable to hold dogs for any reason including moves and vacations. Once approved for adoption we require the adopter to complete the adoption and take ownership of their new companion. \n\n**We do our best to accurately represent the breeds of each pet. However, the breeds listed have not been verified via a DNA test. They are chosen based on the appearance and characteristics of the pet at the time of listing.",

My foster mom calls me a social butterfly because I \nlove meeting people.  I love playing with my foster furbrother.  I get along with dogs my size. I do get into trouble stealing water bottles at times and carrying my food dish to my bedroom. I use my sorry eyes which makes\nmy foster mom laugh. I need a secure fence due to my curiosity. Some call me nosy.   Lastly, I am fine with small children but not in the home. A little older child that has pet knowledge and understands I can\nget hurt due to my\nsize is ok.  So if you want another member of\nthe family look at\nme.  I will be waiting for you!!",

Scarface is 8 months old, house trained and crate trained even though he is not fond of the crate. He loves cats and plays very well with his foster siblings.\nScarface is young but he is gentle in his touch and taking treats. This is just a well mannered all around guy who needs a loving home and an owner who may walk him and play with him.\nHe weighs about 35 lbs right now and will probably gain about 10 more while reaching his adult weight.\nHe is up to date on vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, rabies and neutered.\nADOPTION FEE & APPLICATION REQUIRED\n\nRoxy's K-9 Rescue does not have a shelter, all of our dogs are raised in foster homes. Each dog comes spay/neutered (fixed), rabies shots appropriate for their age, and dewormed twice. The dogs are up to date on vaccinations according to their age at the time of adoption. They are microchipped, heartworm tested and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventative. ALL OF THIS IS INCLUDED IN THE ADOPTION FEE.\nMedical records will come with each dog at the time of adoption.\nOur organization is run by volunteers/foster parents, please be patient to give us time to respond to your emails and/or phone calls. We will reply to you. Thank you.",

Dexter would do best as an only pet, and he would do best in a home without children for now.  Chaos and quick movements scare him and send him into hiding.  However, he is in training, living with a foster, and gaining confidence every day! He will need a quiet home, with lots of patience and love to help him overcome his fears.

EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

Rox has this high-pitched bark that lets you know he's ready, lets get a move on right now. Rox loves being outside, and spends most of the day patrolling and protecting his back yard. Rox will need at a minimum a 6 foot privacy fence, since he is a major jumper. He sometimes jumps like a pony when excited!\n\nRoxas is more of a solo dog - no other males would be best. He gets along with his sister Lola, but she is a beta female and doesn't take any crap from the boys. He does well with males outside of his home environment on walks and at the dog park, but there is sometimes conflict with the other male dog currently in his home. Roxas is also a protector, he has protected his owner when he thought she was in danger, and also when he thought his sister was in trouble. Roxas would do well with someone who runs and loves the outside. Roxas loves running and chasing. \n\nRoxas is a sensitive and solemn dog. When his older fur sibling passed, Roxas seemed pensive and more solemn about the loss. Roxas dislikes any loud noise, beeping from the Roomba, and thunder. He will slink or run away from the sound and at times shake from his fear. His person usually sits with him on the chair and just hugs him to keep him from panic. \n\nRoxas is being rehomed due to conflicts with the other dog in the home. He has had some professional training and a recent evaluation by a trainer who states he would do well with a female dog in the home, a non-dominant male, or as an only dog.",

She knows sit and paw now (although, she has her own interpretation of \u201cpaw\u201d\u2026she lifts her paw about an inch off the ground\u2026blink and you\u2019ll miss it!\nShe loves to run over the ramp a generous donor built for the Sanctuary. Her favorite part of the day is when a volunteer visits her to take her on run! \nLula is continuing to work on her leash skills and has been doing very well with a harness or halti.\nWe will contribute to training costs if needed.\n\nEvery weekend, one of our volunteers takes Lula home for a break from the shelter. She is a fabulous house guest! She is more than happy to lay with you on the couch and chew a bone while watching TV. She also loves looking out the window and watching all of the people and critters that pass by! If Lula is left alone in the house, she continues to be our good little girl. She is given the run of the house and has had no issues.\n\nLula is an absolute sweetheart once she feels comfortable with you.\nLula\u2019s ideal family is active, dog savvy, and has no other animals. Older, dog savvy female children only.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in meeting Lula, call 610-349-5657. Meetings with Lula are by appointment only and she will not be available to meet on our open to the public Saturdays.\n\nAre you ready to give our Lula the loving home she deserves?\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please email dogadoptions@thesanctuarypa.org to fill out an application and questionnaire \n\nWe are open every Saturday to the public  from 12-2. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: At this time we are following CDC guidelines and practicing social distancing and wearing masks in our buildings \n\nHope to see you soon!!",

He is pretty mellow around other dogs and avoids confrontation with them in the home or at the dog park. He needs a confident owner that can handle his size while on leash. He is house trained and kennel trained. He loves to play in the backyard so a secure fence is a must. He is not good with cats, so a home without them is also a must. He is also good with kids.\n\nBehr would like nothing more than to find his furever home where he can play and be loved! If you are interested in Behr please send us a message.\n\nAdoptions outside of ID WA OR UT NV AND MT won\u2019t be considered.\n",

            "description": "Lucy was born on November 25, 2013. She has always lived with her sister Pinky, and the two of them are looking for a home where they both can live. They are known as pocket pitties because of their diminutive size weighing about 35 pounds each. They are both sweet and fun dogs, with a great energy about them. When they get excited they wag their whole bodies, not just their tails. They bring you joy just to watch them. Because they must be adopted together, only one adoption fee is required for both dogs. If you would like to give these \"itty bitty pitty sisters\" their forever home, please contact us today.\nContact us at straydogshelter@gmail.com for more information on this dog.",

No other animal has been at Stray Hearts longer.\n\nThe irony of it is that she's the biggest love bug we have. She is beloved by the staff and all the volunteers who walk her, bring her special treats and, yes, even gift her with new glam gear. She's great on a leash, but you can't get her very far very fast because she's always so busy happily greeting her many fan friends. \n\nIt's been difficult for Zizy to find a home for a couple reasons. First of all, she'll do best as the only pet in a household, and most Taos folks already have a handful of pets. And then there's the local dog ordinance that requires her to have a \"Dangerous Dog\" license.\n\nShe has a strong prey drive and needs to be kept safe around other dogs and small pets. That label, as you can imagine, scares most people off, but we're holding out hope that someone can see past it and give Zizy a shot at a life outside a kennel. That label, as you can imagine, scares most people off, but we're holding out hope that someone can see past it and give Zizy a shot at a life outside a kennel.\n\nAre you that person?

            "description": "We were introduced to 10yo Moose after looking into a message received about a dog in need that was seen chained to a car. He was actually chained to a tree with very little room to move, covered in flies with severe fly strike on both ears. Although he clearly needed our help, he did have an owner. After talking with them about what we could offer him in terms a new home, they gladly surrendered him. So after living 24/7/365 with chickens as his main companions, we're happy to say he is on his way to a better life!\n\nHe has now been fully vetted, including treatment for the flystrike on his ears and an overdue dental on account of his rock chomping days. While he awaits the right foster match, he will be sleeping indoors with his own cot and clean blankets, enjoying regularly scheduled outside playtime throughout the day.\n\nAs we learn more about Moose, one thing is clear- he is still learning what it means to be a functioning part of society. As a dog that has lived strictly outdoors with very little human attention and no dog socialization for ten years, we at RTR recognize that his next home will be asked to patiently guide him into this next phase of his life.\n\nHe will need to be the only dog in the household and preferably based in an area where he wouldn't regularly encounter a large number of other dogs. Currently showing ribs and underweight at around 75lbs, we do expect that with the appetite we are seeing this scrawny senior should be filling out in no time. He is VERY strong and only beginning to know what it means to walk on a leash. He will need a solid routine and a bit of time and forgiveness to help with this, and conquer potty training. Lastly, we are seeking someone who understands that for this sweet, mellow guy, human touch, companionship and exchanging of affections is all brand new and a little awkward. Are you looking to help teach an old boy some new tricks? Are you ready to show a dog what it means to be loved and respected? Let us know!",

            "description": "Jude is ready! She raised her 12 puppies and got in great shape. She\u2019s the fastest and fittest one in her foster home. She built a lot of muscle tone, tight belly and looks fabulous! Jude is 2.5 yrs old, 52 lbs and fully vetted.  \n\nShe\u2019s a quiet, smart, happy loving girl who likes to hang with the pack so it will be good for her to have another playful dog in the home. She loves to cuddle, rides in a car, great on a leash, potty trained, crate trained- she\u2019s fine if left unattended in the house. Good with dogs, cats and horses. Jude does great with teens but she is still very shy with young kids. She will jump a 5ft pasture fence and flush birds so she needs 6ft fencing. She\u2019s shy of loud noises but settles quickly in your lap. This beautiful girl is ready for her own family.\n\nThanks for considering a Cane Rosso Rescue dog! \nWe place dogs mostly in Texas but have adopted out a few out-of-state as well.\n \nIf you are interested in one of our dogs, please first complete our adoption application.\nYou can find it at https://www.canerossorescue.org/adoption-application . Her adoption fee is $300 plus tax. Our dogs are spayed or neutered, microchipped, vaccinated and heartworm tested and treated (if tested positive) before going to a new home. For more information, visit our website www.canerossorescue.org\nor email us at rescue@canerosso.com.",

            "description": "Oh sweet Georgia....we've got you on our mind!  This sweet gal ended up at our county shelter as a stray.  A volunteer saw her and immediately recognized that she had poor function of her rear limbs.  We did not know anything more about Georgia, just what her intake notes from county stated.  While at county, her first few days she was terrified, showing her teeth and exhibiting fear.  It was not until until she was lured to play area and found a tennis ball.  It was then that her playful side emerged.  We have learned so much about Georgia since we took her into our care.  Georgia is darling.  She craves attention, she LOVES people, she is playful and she is terribly cute.  Georgia is special needs girl.  All of her tests and x-rays looked good, no fractures or dislocations, old or new, however, there was prior trauma to the spinal cord.  Who knows what happened to her in her prior life, she does have scarring on her rear side, and both of her ears are cauliflower-ed.  Georgia is healthy today but will need a very special family.  She is incontinent, her stool drops out of her involuntarily and her bladder must be expressed (emptied) at least 3 to 4 times a day as she is susceptible to urinary tract infection.  In time, 2-3 years down the road, Georgia  might be a  candidate to zoom around in a wheelchair, however, her spirit will never slow her down.  Georgia is a ton of fun, she is a superhero, and as of today, she loves her walks, she loves to jump in the pool and would welcome a lift up on any couch to be next to her person!  Georgia loves to play ball and so eager to please and learn.  She already knows how to sit, fetch, stay, come and shake hands.  She is soooooo smart. She is affectionate and so inspiring. If you are interested in giving this loving girl the home she so deserves, please take a moment to fill out our application, https://www.povertyspets.org/adoption-form.  Once received, you will be contacted within 72 hours.  $200 donation, Georgia is approximately 3-4 years old.  She is dog social but will need to be properly introduced.  Some dogs may react aggressively to her disabilities,  which includes doing a spin dance to stop when she gets on all fours.  She has so much love to give.  She is magical.",

I would like to live with one or two adults in a house with a yard, or even an apartment or condo with a little patio, just something with a fence so I don't always have to go out on a leash. I have met some other dogs that I like, but if they are too pushy or if they try to start something, then we will have trouble. As long as everyone's calm and friendly, I'm good.\n\nIn the bad old days before I was rescued, people used to punish me with a spray bottle of water, and by pushing me into a crate, and by taking my stuff away from me. Now when people try to do that, it really bugs me. If I have something you want, I'd be happy to trade you for something of equal or greater value, because I'm smart. But I'm not just going to let you take my stuff and leave me with nothing. Because I'm smart. \n\nOnce I know that we respect each other, and once I feel like you care about me, I love to snuggle and I'm a really good friend.",

She is slowly starting to trust the humans around her. Kiara will need a patient, loving owner who has breed experience and has worked with under socialized dogs in the past. Her favorite thing to do is run around and play with other dogs, and she gets along great with her friends! She would feel extra safe in a home with another dog, who could show her how great humans can be and help her blossom. Kiara will need training on the leash, but can eventually make a great companion for walks. If you're willing to take a chance on this gorgeous girl, fill out an application today!",

He had emergency surgery last night to remove these bladder stones and all the sludge in his bladder. The stones were also trapped in his urethra and bladder and he couldn't relieve himself. Thanking the Good Lord that Dr. Ruth was able to do his emergency surgery after a busy day at the Olive Branch Animal Clinic. He is on IV, heavy pain meds and has a catheter.\nI knew something was wrong with him peeing all these small spots. So glad I got him to the vet and now he will eventually feel much better.\nWe committed to taking in this older guy his finder has been calling him Lazy Bonzz. He was found on Main Street in Southaven on a Saturday after hours and when the shelter was Monday they refused to pick up this stray. The elderly couple did what they could for Lazy Bonzz and got him to Desoto County Animal Clinic the following week. They aged the dog to be about 9 years old, neutered, heartworm negative and he got a 6mo pro heart shot for heartworm prevention. He also received all his other vaccines and bravecto for fleas and tick prevention. He weighs in at 25.2 pounds but could stand to shed a few pounds. He\u2019s very laid back and like to nap in his dog bed they bought for him. He is also house trained and will go to the door to let you know he wants to go outside. They have been spoiling him with canned food since he didn\u2019t really take to Ol Roy.\nLazy Bonzz\u2019s is now at the dog house as we help him find a new home. No owner ever came forward to claim him after all the flyers they put up and found reports on social media. \nHis adoption fee is $150.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, we encourage you to fill out our adoption questionnaire at http://members.petfinder.com/~MS72/adoption_app.html\n\nSave 1 Pet is a 501 (c) 3 approved charity committed to helping homeless animals.  We don't have a facility (shelter) but work out of our homes to foster the animals until they find a forever home.\n\nPlease be advised that for all adoptions, we will conduct reference checks, including veterinary references.  Our adoption fee for dogs includes spay/neuter, heart worm check, current vaccines, microchip, worming and heart worm/flea/tick prevention.\nFor dog adoptions, we do conduct fence verification.\nWhen adopting an animal, you will be asked to complete our Adoption Contract",

He is also good with kids, but due to his stature (he is built like a tank), we recommend he goes to a family with no small children ,as he will jump on you, when he gets excited.\nIf interested in Jaxson, please fill out our foster application online:  www.salvagedsoulspetrescue.org",

I love to play with my toys and love the company of adults. I am not recommended with young children, because of my energy level and I may need a bit of work on my manners. I am not good with other dogs, but I am good with cats. I am currently on a special diet, so please speak with the kennel staff about my dietary needs before meeting with me. Can't wait to meet you!\n\nSincerely,\nButters",

At just over 5 years old, Zydeco is beginning to age out of his youthful athleticism. Now, he's looking for a life partner to help him stay in shape as he approaches his golden years. He LOVES toys and can entertain himself with them if he can't talk you into a game of fetch or tug of war. This exuberant pup just has so much love for life and he can't wait to become part of yours! Zydeco really is the epitome of the ultimate loyal best friend, he has so much love to give his perfect family, and he can't wait to cover them in kisses! He would love a lower traffic, adult-only home. Zydeco would prefer an active owner who is home most of the time to spend time with him... But he doesn't want you thinking he's needy! Zydeco is an independent spirit- he just likes to know that you're around! We also believe he would be best as your one-and-only pet, but with Zydeco in your life, you couldn't possibly need much more! Zydeco is house-trained and knows LOTS of skills - all of the basics as well as place, recall, and shake. He has solid leash manners, and he'd definitely love to continue to learn new tricks with you. Zydeco responds well to structure, and he appreciates the routines and rules you establish. He has brain energy to spare and is very treat-motivated, so it's no surprise that he's thriving in APA!'s Total Obedience Program, which is modeled after the AKC's Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As part of APA's Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Zydeco after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA's CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Zydeco would love to meet you! Follow Zydeco on Instagram @adoptgoodboyZydeco to see more of this handsome pup!",

She loves going on walks, prancing next to you like a show horse with her head pointed up, looking up at you with love and admiration in her eyes. Then she'll want to smell everything, and dance in front of trees to look for squirrels. This fun, active pup will even jump in front of sprinklers and bite the water. At home, she'll play tug and fetch, picking up her little orange football and toys, and bringing them to you to announce she wants to play. She's an affectionate girl who loves all people she meets, standing on her hind legs to try to kiss their faces. Give her an invitation to the couch and she'll leap up and land next to you for a nap or to watch TV. As a smart pup, she responds to many commands. She's house-trained and goes to her crate when told to 'place,' staying quietly all night. She also behaves well when home alone. Lil Rocks is a loyal lady who will thrive as the only pet in a home with adults who can take her for those fun walks she loves. She's so entertaining! Come visit and she'll prance right up to you!",

He likes to chase you around, barking and playing. Kiwi also likes to lay on you with his face on your chest when you sit down. And don't look down, because he follows you like a shadow! He loves his own doggie bed to sleep in at night. He is 10 lbs & completely housebroken. He is a picky eater since his owner passed but loves treats! He gets along well with other dogs. He is heartworm negative, fully vetted, & neutered. Please go to sgdrsa.org for more information on sweet Kiwi.\n\nKIWI is available for adoption with Saving Grace Dog Rescue of San Antonio. The adoption fee is $75.00. An adoption application, home visit and adoption contract are all required. All dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations appropriate for their age, microchipped, and wormed for internal and external parasites. If you would like more information or an adoption application, please email us at sgdrsa@outlook.com.\n\nPlease note that visual breed identification in rescue dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only GUESSING at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

            "description": "Wilma was a baby herself when we rushed to save her and her 6 puppies from the shelter where they had been given a few hours to live; she was about 8 months old.\n\nAfter nursing her babies, Wilma went to her current foster family. They are veteran fosters, extremely knowledgeable to help harder cases like Wilma\u2019s. She was considered feral and would empty her bladder at the touch of human hands. No eye contact. Frozen in fear. Wouldn\u2019t leave her crate and they worked through each her challenges, one by one. She set the pace and they followed. They never treated her as if she was broken.\n\nEvery day she made progress. She fell smitten with her foster dad, which motivated her to leave her crate to follow him around. Her foster mom always encourages the pack to support the foster sibling through their transition. They each assured her that she was in a safe place. They showed her to play, master the doggie door, sit pretty for treats and best, to trust the rehabilitation process.\n\nIn the midst of Wilma\u2019s fear, 13-year-old Cyrus, her blind and zen sister, nurtured her and showed her to trust. Cyrus has become Wilma\u2019s greatest healing force and Best Friend!\n\nWilma recently had her 1st birthday. Since living with her foster family, they have introduced her to home life, the beautiful feeling of the wind hitting your face while riding in a car, sleeping peacefully in a clean and warm bed, being part of a pack, confidence, and the beautiful side of humanity.\n\nThough she is still working through her challenges, the amazing progress she\u2019s made, makes our hearts burst with admiration and love to see her resilience and victories.\n\nWilma is available for adoption and will need an experienced adopter that will continue to help her thrive. She\u2019s not the type that will jump in your arms or show affection; she\u2019s the type that will come when called and will love you from her safe space; this doesn\u2019t mean that she won\u2019t do it in the future, she\u2019s just not doing that now. She loves dogs and has a resilient spirit. She\u2019s an underdog with a heart of gold that will bring lots of happiness and beauty to the family that adopts her. She\u2019s our hero!\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting her, please complete an Adoption Interest Application on our website www.jointhescars.org\n\n*PLEASE READ: Traditionally, we personally respond to each submission received. However, due to the current high volume of applications/adoptions, you will receive an acknowledgment/receipt email of your submission.\n\nBecause we know each of our heroes personally and know the best setting for them to thrive in, we will ONLY contact applications that best match their requisite needs.\n\nWe thank you in advance for your interest to adopt one of our heroes and for your patience through the process.\n\nThank you for choosing to rescue!",

This cutie is a 5 year old pit mix who weighs 85 lbs (which just means there's more of him to love and cuddle with!) Clover is housebroken and crate trained! He is also fixed, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped!\n\nClover loves people and kids, although with his large size and energy he may be better suited for a home with older children. He is currently untested with other dogs, but will be prior to adoption. Clover is a kind soul with a bubbly personality that leaves a lasting impression on everyone he meets. He loves to go on walks and is learning how to walk better on the leash, he sits on command and loves kisses.",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Roo is 2 years old at the time of intake in August 2020. Roo is good with people of all ages and other dogs. Roo is only 2 ish years old, but she does suffer with hip dysplasia which is typical with sheperds and will require lifelong joint meds. She is a sweet girl, albeit a bit scared, which is understandable in light of what she has been through. We can't wait to get Roo into her forever home where she can lay her head on a soft bed each night and know that she will wake up in the same home every day for the rest of her life. If you can open your heart and home to Roo, and forever means forever, please apply online to adopt Roo (GA) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

We don't understand how someone could leave this girl because she is lovable and definitely has had training in the past. She knows commands like down, sit, stay and off. She does not need to be crated however, she likes having a crate as her safe, comfort zone to retreat to when she wants to be alone. Make sure you put all your shoes away or they will find their way into her possession :) Time, consistency and patience will go a very long way with her.\n\nWe recommend kids 10+ as she has been resource guarding items such as socks etc. Her foster dad is working on this with her but she is a little Houdini at stealing things. She loves all humans nonetheless but safety is always our main concern.\n\nThis girl deserves her furever home! Is it you?\n\n**We do not adopt out to Canada due to border restrictions and breed-specific legislation**Adoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, deworming, and flea treatment.",

She is being treated for heartworms but is otherwise healthy. She's never known what it's like to be a part of a family. A very special volunteer has spent a lot of time with her to get her to open up and learn that it's okay to be loved! The first time she met her veterinarian, she jumped up and gave her a paws-to-shoulders hug saying \"\"thanks for loving me.\"\"\n\nRight now, she needs a home where she can be the only dog until she gets socialized. Kids make her nervous, so she isn't ready for them. She needs a person she can bond with! Angel is most likely pitbull mixed with a larger, taller breed of dog, possibly dane. Those eyes just beg for affection and patience.\n\nPlease share her story in hopes that we will find her a human she can call her own. It's about time she gets to live the good life!\n\nAdoption Application: https://form.jotform.com/shannonsshaffer/adoptionapplication\n\nFoster Application: https://www.jotform.com/shannonsshaffer/fosterThe first step in our adoption process is an application. Once that is received, we will contact you to make an appointment to meet the animal. \n\nAdoption Applications can be completed at www.WFAHS.org",

            "description": "Breed:  Chihuahua\nAge:  2 yrs.\nWeight:  10 lbs.\nGood with dogs:  yes\nGood with cats:  unsure\nGood with kids:  no\nEnergy level:  unsure\nGood with men/strangers:  fearful, esp. men\nHypoallergenic:  no\n\nSpecial home requirements or medical:  adult only home with a calm environment; another dog in the home is a plus\n\nAdditional info:\n\nLook at Stewart with his fancy Pedigree pose!  Can you believe this guy was infested with fleas when he was first brought to the shelter?  He's friendly and bathed and ready for love.  We know he's a great listener...check out those ears!\n\nStewart is shy and timid with people and it may take him some time to open up to new people. He seems to love other dogs and would probably do well with another dog to help guide him and learn to trust. He can be a bit clingy with his person, so much so that he has only been able to bond with the foster and has not been too comfortable with her roommates, even when she is not home. Stewart needs someone that will help him grow confident and trust people more. He is house trained when taken out regularly, loves to play with toys and walks well on leash, Because he is so timid Stewart needs an adult only only home with a calm environment. I've asked for photos and will send when the foster sends them.\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give.

He is very selective with dogs that he plays with and his feelings for cats are unknown. Gremlin is a pretty laid back fella and he would do best in a home with older kids. He came to MCHS as an owner surrender. His previous owner could no longer care for him due to a change in their living situation.\n\nProfile:\n\u2022\tYear of birth: 2012\n\u2022\tLoves to play with toys\n\u2022\tDoes good on a leash; could use basic obedience training\n\u2022\tGets along with most dogs; proper introduction is a must \n\u2022\tCats?\n\u2022\tCame to MCHS as an owner surrender.

Some were dumped, abandoned in an empty house, left tied to a tree, picked up by animal control as strays, or simply unwanted by their owners. We ask that only serious and committed adopters apply as these dogs have suffered enough.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet please apply to adopt at\nhttp://www.wagsandwhiskerspetrescue.com/adopt.html\nif the pet is still available for adoption and you are approved to adopt we will contact you.\n\nCalling and checking the status of your application will not increase your chances of adoption",

If you are interested in Zeus, please fill out an application at www.mdgsprescue.org.\n\n\nZeus is a 5 yr old neutered and super handsome liver GSP.  Since September he has been on activity restriction as he had both of his ACL's repaired.  Both legs will be x-rayed on 1/12 and after that he is ready for prime time and available for adoption.\n\n\nThe orthopedic surgeon said that his legs will eventually be 100% but he has to build up to that.  Currently he is doing several 20 minute walks a day.\n\n\nA perfect home for Zeus would entail the following, no children, secure fencing, if there is another dog it has to be a normal energy dog.  Folks who understand dog behavior will get that.  He is perfectly fine with my 13 yr old laid back male GSP, not so much my 13 yr old female as she has nervous energy that is clear in her personality.  So another dog would need tested, but he has been good around several other dogs.\n\n\nOnce Zeus knows you, you are in \"the circle of trust\", a friend forever.  But when new people come into the home it is necessary to either go outdoors to meet your guests and stand and talk for a few minutes or put him away until he settles.  I noticed a helpful thing is to give him a tennis ball in this situation.  At that point Zeus will warm up but he does need a few minutes to re-adjust to the changes in the environment (i.e. new people).  Any wrong behavior from Zeus is caused by fear.  Once he knows you, he is the love of your life.\n\n\nZeus does not like to be cornered.  When he went to the vet for vaccines we told the vet exactly what the trainer had said - ignore Zeus, act like he isn't there and he will relax.  My vet said those instructions worked perfectly.  Zeus warmed up, came over, got a shot, walked away, eventually came back, got another shot, etc.  This went on until all his vaccines and blood draw were done.\n\n\nSo Zeus needs a non hurried home, someone who will not rush him from situation to situation, someone who gives him a moment to readjust and settle into the new situation.  \n\n\nHe is house and crate trained, but doesn't need crated when alone at home as he is not destructive at all.  He is fully vaccinated and microchipped.  He absolutely loves the game of fetch.  He also finds favor in spotting squirrels and birds up in a tree.  No live game?  That's okay, Zeus will point the possum statue in my flower bed and stay there doing that for a long time.\n\n\nZeus is a special guy and needs a special owner who understands him.  If that is you, pls fill out our Application above and we will give you a call.",

I\u2019m not always sure how to socialize with other pets, and sometimes \u2018arguments\u2019 arise about food or maybe a treat. Make no mistake, I absolutely love my humans because they give me scratches, cuddles, and treats. I would love a home with a big yard or property where I can run to my heart\u2019s content. But I can be an escape artist, so the boundaries should be secure.\n\nI am very loving and cuddly, but also very energetic, love to play with toys, love to dig, and run. I\u2019m told I\u2019m \u201cbrilliant\u201d.  Maybe it\u2019s because I so quickly learn commands like sit, down, and stay. I love to sun bathe but remember - I can jump really high. I truly need a furever home where I can thrive. Will you be my new family?\n\nIf you feel your home might be the right place for this wonderful dog, the place to start is with the adoption application found at www.dfwrescueme.org/adopt.  Once submitted, the foster will contact you to tell you more, and to arrange a meeting! The adoption fee for all of our dogs is $250.00, which includes their vaccinations and spay/neuter.\n\nMagnus is participating in the DFW Rescue Me Guest Dog Program, so custody and ongoing care are provided by the foster, not by DFWRM.",

He is crate trained and walks well on a leash. He would love a home with a canine playmate, and does need a fenced backyard to run and play in ( he is not an apartment kinda guy). \nHe is a sweet disposition, very gentle and submissive. \nSwiss is in a foster home in Memphis.",
