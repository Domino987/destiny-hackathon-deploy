            "description": "Will you be Mona's HERO??\n\nIf you'd really like to RESCUE a dog and really make a huge difference consider a Mona. She is far from perfect but who's perfect anyway? She has such a gentle, kind spirit. She LOVES walks and car rides. She has some medical issues but they are totally manageable. They have prevented her from getting adopted. Don't let that stop you from adopting her!!\n\nHere's her back story:\nWe agreed to take Mona in when she was only eight-weeks-old. She was a very sick little puppy. She had daily seizures and was completely incontinent. \n\nSince that time, many years ago, her epilepsy is managed well and the incontinence is almost completely gone. She only has occasional accidents overnight but we think that's more due to being stubborn about going outside to potty the last time at night, not because of incontinence. So making sure she goes outside to go potty around 10:00 p.m. would solve that likely.\nHer seizures are controlled with medication and the bladder surgery took care of her leaking mostly. She is on medication for the incontinence which really helps!\n\nFor a dog who had a grim future it's truly amazing how far she's come. Now all we have to worry about with Mona is finding her the best possible family that can love her as she is...not quite perfect but so incredibly darling. \n\nA tenacious, independent, confident, mischievous, joyful and sensitive husky, that's our Mona. She is a bit protective when she's in her cage so we think a family with small kids wouldn't be right for her.\n\nMona loves to play in water and would love a baby pool in her yard in the summertime. She loves walks so much and is both affectionate when she wants attention and aloof at times too, which is being what huskies can be! \n\nShe loves the snow, her crate, and her nylabones. She is very smart and sensitive too.\n\nMona co-exists with other dogs and can even play with another dog if they other dog is pushy about play but otherwise she lives without issue with other dogs. She is not good with cats or small critters.\n\nShe lives with a family with a eight-year-old child. But she would be best in a family with kids over ten only because she can get a bit protective around her cage when she steals something and brings it into the cage with her. Yes, Mona can be naughty...but not too naughty\"\":)\n\nMona is on medication for her seizures and incontinence. The total cost is roughly $100.00 a month. Because of her medications she needs quarterly blood tests. Additional medical expenses should be anticipated and money set aside just in case.\n\nA home visit will be required to adopt Mona so please only adoption applications within an hour of Libertyville, IL.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nAdoption Donation for Mona is $ 425.00\n\nWANT TO MEET Mona\n\nThe first step would be for you to go to our website at www.aear.org and then to the \"\"Adopting a Pet\"\" page to read about our Adoption Process which will answer many of your questions and then to fill out an Adoption Application.\n\nAlso, please visit our very active Facebook Page for updates on Mona and our other adoptable pets with AEAR - www.facebook.com/aear.org",

My name is Niko and I am a hunka, hunka, burning love looking for that special someone/family to call my own!\n\nI'm roundabout 6-7 yrs old and as you can see from my pics, I'm a pretty handsome fella and a bit of a ladies man. I really love to snuggle up with you and give out some kisses.\n\nI also love a good run around the yard and to play with my ropes, old footballs, and really any kind of fun with tough toys!\n\nNow I do like to be the king of my castle, so that I can be the center of your attention and not have to share my toys or love with other animals. I might be able to tolerate a laid back kind of girl, but I'd need some introductions first to be sure.\n\nI really like to please my people so learning new tricks and commands is always a fun time for me. I've learned several over the years including sit, stay, paw, and down but I might need a bit of a refresher. I'm a pretty strong guy so a nice harness is a good idea for walks (WHICH I LOVE!).\n\nNiko is up to date on shots, neutered, and microchipped. His adoption fee is $200. \n\nTo apply to adopt Niko, complete our application at www.derbycitydogrescue.org/adoption-application.html",

She was very ill for a long period of time but has almost completely recovered, with some occasional skin flareups. \n\nPersimmon is, as far as we can tell, about 3 years old, and seems to be some kind of pit/boxer mix. She's crate trained, has a solid sit, and some basic leash skills (that at this point aren't solid when there are any distractions).\n\nShe is dog and cat reactive, but will move past quiet animals with consistent reinforcement/distraction. She needs to be crated away from other animals. We do believe that with slow introductions, positive training, and patience, she may be able to interact appropriately with other dogs.\n\nShe is an incredibly happy dog who will play for long periods of time, whether she's on her own or not. She's excited about learning new things (and good at it), but has a harder time adjusting in environments where there's too much going on.\nPersimmon is, at her core, a super sweet, funny, and playful dog with a terrific personality and will light up any room she is in.\n\nIf you would be interested in adopting Persimmon, complete our application at www.derbycitydogrescue.org/adoption-application.html",

(well except those other furries, but more on that later).\n\nI'm about 8 yrs old and have been through a lot in my life. I've lived on the streets and had some lean times before a nice lady found me and helped me get where I am today.\n\nI'm a super fun chick with a love for car rides, walks in the park, and TREATS. Some say I like treats a bit too much, but is there such a thing?\n\nI really like to meet new people and make people friends really easily. I even like the small peoples. I'm not too much on the furry friends though - I like to the one getting all the love.\n\nSo, do you know anyone that is looking for a little slice of heaven like me?\n\nCheeto is house trained, is up to date on shots, spayed, and microchipped. Her adoption fee is $200.\n\nTo apply for Cheeto, complete our application at www.derbycitydogrescue.org/adoption-application.html",

He is great on walks and car rides, loves playing in water or getting a bath, and would benefit from an active lifestyle!

He is normally a pretty chill boy who enjoys hanging out in his bed and snuggling with his toys. \n\nHe is a bit hesitant with meeting new people and is in need of a potential owner who is willing to work with him on his fears and help him to gain confidence. We believe it is possible he was abused in the past, accounting for his slowness to trust new people. Once he loves you though, you are his buddy for life. Because of his suspected abuse in the past, we feel he would be best suited in a home without children at this time. \n\nChance is good with other dogs who share a similar personality. He would make a great dog for a trucker as he rides well and is happy to spend most of his time with one person. \n\nChance is up to date on shots, neutered, and microchipped.

Daisy was adopted in December of 2014, and returned in July of 2018. During that time, she was given to relatives and left outside to live. When she came back, it was very clear that she had had little to no socialization. Daisy very slowly came out of her shell and showed her sweet nature. She will need an understanding, patient adopter who is willing to work with her at her pace, with love and kindness. Because of her history, we feel she will need to be adopted by someone without children, definitely not young children.",

I've been here at CARA since 2012. I'm told black dogs are passed on by so many and I can tell you for the most part we are. We are the most common too. Overall we are just as lovable I've had interest and was almost adopted in 2017 from a family who had just moved here from another country but sadly on my adoption day they received bad news that changed their course. They did come to the shelter and told me themselves. So here I sit waiting. While I love my CARA caretaker and volunteers we all want our own family and home. We are really just as neat and loving as any other dog here. I am looking for someone to be patient with me since I've lived a shelter life for so long. \n\n**Unfortunately I'm no longer interested in sharing so I will need to be the only pup in the family.",

He is oh so sweet but oh so high energy! It's not a bad high energy, it's just a \"\"let's go for an adventure\"\" type of energy. However, we all know there are no adventures to be had at the Save A Pet shelter... which is why it is so important to get this boy out of here!\nRubble is so eager to please and very excited when meeting new people. He loves everyone he meets and he loves all of his friends at the shelter. Sometimes he gets a little too excited and some of the other pups don't appreciate his lack of knowledge on personal space. Most of the time they just run from Rubble... which, come to think of, might be his plan all along. Did we mention how much Rubble LOOOOOVES to run???! This boy was born to run! It's probably higher on his priority list than sleeping or even eating! Rubble knows how to be on his best behavior when needed... he tries super hard to be a good boy when the leash goes on.... and that lasts for a few minutes but then he wants to go on that adventure so you better hold on tight! \nIf you have a lot of love to give and a little bit of patience to spare but love the outdoors and aren't opposed to some great running, pleeeeeeease come meet our ADVENTUROUS RUBBLE! \nHe said to tell you that he is waiting and is super excited to meet you!\nIf you are interested in meeting Rubble, please message us or call the shelter at 478-994-3882.",

They say that which doesn't kill us makes us stronger. Sadie is as strong as they come.\n\nSadie was severely malnourished when she arrived at SAP. But it hasn't made her bitter. She's still attentive, loyal and eager to be by your side at all times. Sadie was born around December 12, 2016. She is still very thin, weighing only 33 pounds. She's not very fond of other dogs, so she may need to be tested with other dogs in the household.\n\nSadie has been introduced to basic commands and has done extremely well, but, of course, needs practice. She requires a home that can offer an abundance of love, attention and security. Anyone who adopts her will always have a faithful, true friend. Contact us via Petfinder.com or call 478-994-3882 to meet Sadie.",

He is currently working on leash training and learning basic commands. Thor is HIGHLY intelligent and is catching on very quickly. With a little bit of time and consistency, this guy could do amazing things! He is skillful and super assertive. When working with Thor, he looks into your eyes as if he understands every single word you say.\nThor is doing good with other dogs at the shelter and has bonded with a young energetic female bulldog. He is big and powerful, so introducing him to other dogs should be done slowly.\nIf you are looking for a bigger dog who is both smart and full of energy, Thor is your guy! He would make a great pet for an active family who can provide plenty of room for him to run and exercise. No cats or small dogs. Children over 12 preferably.",

I love playing with squeaky toys and sleeping in my bed. \n\nI do have skin issues that will require some ongoing maintenance. I've visited a dermatologist who diagnosed me with Pemphigus Foliaceous, a common auto-immune disorder. I take a pill each day to help me manage this, but it is inexpensive and shouldn't deter you from adopting me! \n\nApply to meet me at tailsandtrails.org!",

He would do best in a home with an experienced owner who will keep him mentally & physically stimulated as that's what he needs to thrive! He will also need at least a 6-foot fence or will need to be leash walked if you don't have a fence. He knows sit, down and stay, loves to play fetch, go for jogs and is also treadmill trained. He's really a big baby that will just melt into your arms! If you give him a chance, he will be a very loyal companion.

Personally I think I\u2019m just an 80lb lap dog, but my foster mom tries to tell me that\u2019s not a breed and not all people are looking for a rather large bed-warning-cuddle-machine. My favorite activities are playing with toys, going on walks, napping, playing with my 4-legged foster siblings, and MOST IMPORTANTLY butt scratches. I\u2019m crate trained, house broken, and even know some basic obedience. Unfortunately I\u2019m not all perfect because I get scared meeting new people and don\u2019t always behave appropriately, but 1 hotdog and 5 minutes later will have me backing into you begging for butt scratches. Hope to be-friend you soon!!",

            "description": "Estimated DOB is: 03/2007\n\nHi my name is Mac. My foster mom did my DNA because she was curious. One of my parents was a Boxer, the other was a quite the mix of breeds. I am the sweetest, funny goofball. When I'm taken for a walk, I still act like a puppy and think everyone we see wants to pet me. Even though I'm an older guy, I still like toys especially squeaky toys like a Wubba. My foster Mom buys me stuffed animals from Goodwill to shred. I'm really affectionate and like to give licks and when I sleep in bed with my foster Mom, I like to lay on her for a short period of time for hugs and lovin' before I go to the end of the bed. I was pretty healthy, but my health is failing me now. I take joint supplements, fish oil and an NSAID everyday for my arthritis. I have a bit of incontinence and unfortunately cannot take the drug to help that as I have a bad reaction to it. But my Mom lets me out a lot now that she is home because of the pandemic and it's not much of a problem. I was always a heavy breather, but I was having more trouble than usual and my foster Mom took me to the vet to get scoped. I had an injury that healed but the vet discovered that I had tracheal collapse. This is probably why I am such a heavy breather. It doesn't seem to be getting worse, but I have to be careful in the heat and about exercise.\n\nThe ideal adoptive of permanent foster home for me would be with retired, work from home or can bring their dog to work people. No children or other pets or maybe one other pet. I want all the attention. My foster Mom says I deserve it. I've been in homes with other pets and kids but I'm old now and deserve someone's undivided attention and to be showered with LOVE. The ideal person would let me sleep in bed with them, buy me toys, yummy food and treats and take me for a short walk every day. I am easy to walk with a Gentle Leader head collar.If you have any questions or would like to meet this pet, please email contact@stlpetrescue.com.

            "description": "Herman is one of the sweetest dogs around. His passions include snuggling on the couch, tossing his toys in the air, and running as fast as he can in the backyard. He loves to explore and go for walks, although he is wary of loud noises. Hermie enjoys playing fetch and knows commands for sit and down. He is potty trained, crate trained however he does not require one, and has never displayed the urge to chew anything but his own toys. Hermie loves other animals (cats and dogs) but is not a big fan of kids. He would be a great companion for someone who loves to see the outdoors but will also snuggle at night. \n\nHerman and is sister, Luna, came from a neglect situation. They were both born with birth defects and were not properly socialized to people, new things and situations. It is important that whomever would adopt him would be patient with him while he learns new things. \n\nThrough medical testing, Herman was found to have a cobalamine deficiency meaning he is not absorbing B vitamins from his food and needs monthly B12 shots. (this is really the only actual medication that is needed from the vet). He is on a high protein diet and does best on grain free puppy food with added canned food for calories. He has a bit of an underbite and small kibble is best as it is easier to chew. Herman had a very hard time gaining weight. It took the foster home 6 months to wean him from prescription food in order for his to gain weight on something higher in protein. It is essential that his diet is not changed to cheap food. He is now a healthy 60lbs. \n\nSince he does not have much hair, his skin and coat need special maintenance. For dryness, he will need to be rubbed with oil and because he has little hair he is at risk of sunburn and needs to be protected from the sun. He will also need to wear a coat in the winter if out for any length of time to keep him warm.If you have any questions or would like to meet this pet, please email contact@stlpetrescue.com. Information about the rescue and adoption process can also be found at stlpetrescue.com along with a full listing of our adoptable pets. \n\nOur adoption fees:\n\nCats range from $110 to $150 \n\nDogs range from $250 to $350\n\nThis fee includes: felv/fiv/heartworm testing, worming, flea and ear mite treatments, age appropriate vaccinations, spay/neuter, rabies vaccination, lab work, dental or other medical surgical treatments as deemed necessary by our team of veterinarians and a microchip with free registration.\n\nThe adoption process includes an interview, application, adoption contract, which includes a return obligation if adopter is needing to rehome pet. The adoption process may include a home visit.\n\nSt. Louis Pet Rescue adopts to the St. Louis Metropolitan area.",

            "description": "Nova was turned into the Lancaster Shelter as a stray. It seems as though she had a home at one time, but was kept as an outside only dog. She does know basic commands and is a giant sweet heart. Staff here at St. Bonnie's call her a big baby because she enjoys being coddled. She loves the company of people, but does not care for other dogs. Nova's ideal home would be a single dog home where she was able to be inside and part of the family. Nova unfortunately has recently lost the use of her back leg. She lost some nerve connections and we are currently working with her in hopes she will make those necessary connections once more. We are currently walking her with a sling and she does have her good days where she needs little assistance but most days we are supporting most of her weight during walks. She does great in her wheel chair and zooms past us when on wheels. We are looking for an adopter with previous experience in this sort of issue. She is a sweet and snuggly girl ready for her true forever home.\n\n---\nSt. Bonnie's Sanctuary (Lange Foundation) is located in Canyon Country, CA. If you would like to meet any of our animals, please call us at (661) 251-5590 or email at st.bonnies@gmail.com. \nWe adopt to families/people in the Southern California area only.

I'd been thrown out in the back yard and just left until I was skin and bones. My fur has grown back in thanks to my angels and All Heart Veterinary Clinic and Hillcrest. I'm a shepherd mix, weigh about 30 pounds and my approximate date of birth is 2/17/15. I'm timid when I meet new people. I have great house manners and play well with others although the best fit for me would probably be in a home as an only dog. I do bark for attention and am a little neurotic so I'm going to need a special person to love me and work with me. My world has been scary but I know now there are good people out there. I'm still very young, have a long life ahead of me and I especially have a lot of love to give! Will you be my next angel?\n \nPrincess is up to date on all vaccines, microchipped, spayed and on heart worm and flea/tick preventatives. The first step in our adoption process for this sweet, timid little girl is to submit your application which is available online at hillcrestanimalrescue.org. Once you are there, click on ADOPT and scroll down to our Application.",

I am good at keeping up with the big kids or being less rough for the little ones. I am a very high energy guy so I can wear out a lot of my buddies and still have energy leftover. I will chase cats if they want but most of them don't want to be bothered by me. My favorite is being with people. I have a want-to-please personality. I love it when my foster parents take me to PetsMart and I get attention there. I love people of all sizes and ages but my rescue friends say I'm too active for some people. I have good house manners and can even be in a crate if I have to be. I'm a Lab / Cattle Dog mix, weigh about 55 pounds, and my birthday is 3/8/14. Will you be my forever playmate?\n\nNebo is up to date on all vaccines, microchipped, neutered and on heart worm and flea/tick preventatives.

            "description": "Sport is mostly a Red Heeler who is very handsome and loving and outgoing with his foster parents. He is timid with new people and needs to make up with someone on his time. Sport was not socialized with other animals or people when he came to us, and it took his foster parents about a month, but then they were getting kisses and doggie hugs. He has a good heart and wants to be a great dog, but he's still insecure and will need someone willing to help him gain and keep his confidence. \n\nSport is crate and house trained, lives with lots of other dogs and has learned how to get along with most of them and made some good doggie friends. We don't feel Sport would be good with children because he is insecure and needs his space to make friends, but we have not seen him with children. \n\nSport's estimated DOB is August, 2010. He is fully vetted: microchipped, current on vaccines, neutered and on flea/tick and heart worm prevention. If you are interested in meeting or adopting Sport, please fill out our online application at Hillcrestanimalrescue.org.",

            "description": "Keller is a sweet, happy and outgoing Staffie who wins people over on sight with his adorable looks and charm. He lives with lots of other dogs but he isn't a trusted pack member as he will, for no reason we can tell and not very often jump another dog. He doesn't get vicious like most bullies when they attack and can be quickly distracted but for this reason should be an only dog or never unsupervised with other dogs. He is great with people, adores children and would be a great addition for a family. He is always happy and does a little happy tippy toe dance that shows his joy for life when he sees people he knows will give him attention. \n\nAlthough he is deaf, Keller has learned to use his voice since being in his foster home and has a cute little song he uses when he needs something or is just overjoyed for some reason. \n\nDogs who are deaf are not harder to train, just different. \n \nA dog has a sense of smell 1,000 to 10,000 times more sensitive than that of a person depending on what breed it is. When a dog smells something, it can tell a lot about it; it is almost like reading a book. When deaf dogs rely on their nose and eyes, these senses become more acute. It is important when grooming a deaf dog not to cut off its whiskers, as dogs use these to sense the distance of things around them. To him, or her, the world is what it is. \n\nThe ideal way to communicate with ANY dog is with body language and energy. Dogs need fewer words, more hand signals, along with a confident owner who can send calm yet firm vibes to the dog. A dog will feel this confidence in them and will respond accordingly. For an excellent resource on owning a deaf dog, please consult Deafdogsrock.com, dedicated specifically to the loving care and training of deaf dogs.\n\nKeller is fully vetted: up to date on all vaccines, microchipped, neutered, and on heart worm and flea/tick preventatives. For an excellent resource on adopting a bully breed, please visit http://www.pbrc.net. Please fill out our online application at www.Hillcrestanimalrescue.org if you think you might be interested in giving sweet Keller his forever home.

            "description": "Hi, my name is Chua! I am a Black and Tan Coonhound, about 45 pounds and I was born approximately 12/13/10. I am a VERY happy girl and have a great attitude. I get along well with all the other fur kids at the rescue and don't even mind the kitties. I had some very severe trauma that took multiple surgeries to correct. It didn't look like I'd ever walk again. Today, I can walk and even RUN! I do however have urinary and fecal incontinence. It has gotten much better with time and continues to heal but I may never have full control especially when I get excited. I need a special person or family that can accommodate me. I love to play and run. I'm smart and engaged with a great spirit. Are you the special person I've been waiting for?\n\nChua's is up to date on all vaccines, microchipped, spayed and on heart worm and flea/tick preventatives. The first step in our adoption process for this beautiful girl is to submit your application which is available online at hillcrestanimalrescue.org.

            "description": "Jelly Bean was pulled from a kill shelter on his last day. His rescue angel was there and he just stole her heart with his handsome self and outgoing ways. He is about 85 lbs. of pure enthusiasm and happy dog and trying to learn how to not overwhelm people with his energy. This sweet boy lost his leg after having his foot mangled by a lawn mower, but it hasn't slowed him down. He runs and plays with his foster brothers and sisters; he rough houses with the big kids and is a gentle boy with the little ones. The Chihuahua puppies literally stick their heads in his mouth rough housing with him and he never gets too rough - he seems to know how delicate they are. He doesn't like being kenneled, but is learning since his mean old foster mom says he has to stay in one when she's not home. Jelly Bean is house trained and has good house manners, but it's just a safety thing for when no one is home. Jelly Bean will need someone active enough to help him direct his energy and enthusiasm, but is happy being a rug inside with his people and friends. Jelly Bean is a smart and outgoing boy ready to learn fun stuff and devote himself to his family. He absolutely sucks up attention like a sponge and is always up for spending time with his people doing whatever they want to do. \n\nJB's DOB is 4.26.2011. Jelly Bean is fully vetted: current on vaccinations, neutered and on heart worm and flea/tick preventatives. Please fill out our online application at Hillcrestanimalrescue.org.

I love car rides, leisurely walks, love squeaky toys and a game of tug.  Smart, too!   I know sit, down, shake, and touch.  I\u2019m housebroken and good in the bath.  I\u2019m in decent shape for an older gentleman \u2013 take supplements for my kidneys, CBD for the old joints, and regular baths keep my skin/coat in shape!  I\u2019m okay w/ other dogs but not really interested in finding a doggy friend.  Cats?  No thanks!  I REALLY want a PERSON to call my own!  If you\u2019re in the market for the buddy of a lifetime then please, please consider me! \n\nBTW, I\u2019m a Labrador / Jack Russell Mix!  Neutered, microchipped, and current on all vaccines! \n\nWanna meet me?  Contact my foster Mom, Diane, at dk1enzo@cox.net or 310.507.3341. \n\n \n",

That also makes it very easy for training purposes. He is crate trained and absolutely adorable.\n\nCasper just seems to love everyone he meets. He aims to please you!\n He loves to ride in the car. He has done well with other dogs, even the small ones. Good with children too!  He is medium to high energy level and will require a fenced in yard.\n\nCasper has had and recovered from ear surgery, he takes apoquel to prevent skin allergies, now has a soft white coat.\nEar surgery was due to scar tissue build up from a old bite injury when he was admitted into the shelter.  It looks wonderful now! He no longer has any ear issues. Although he's all white, he is NOT deaf.\nHe tested HW negative  7-2019.\n",

He was rescued from our local animal\nshelter.\nHe is approx. 3  1/2 yrs old, crate trained, very clean and very laid back.\nHe's also a big cuddle bug and very intelligent.\n\n  Hammer is great around kids,  prefers the attention of women and kids. He can be afraid of some tall men but in general loves people.\nHe's just a big teddy bear searching for his forever home.\nHammer will require a fenced in back yard.\nHe has been neutered, fully vetted and 65 to 70 lb. so he will need someone who can be in control of him on outings. \n\n  Hammer has not known a very happy life, therefore he is always ready for someones attention and love. \nHe was HW positive and being treated, should test negative at this time.\nWe feel that Hammer would do best in a home with no others dogs as he can tend to be an attention hog.\n",

            "description": "Say hello to Rexford (Rex)! This spunky little man was pulled from a high-kill shelter in Georgia on the day he was to be euthanized for space. Rexford is such an affectionate and playful boy and he loves his humans! He does well with some dogs, but he would prefer to be an only child. Rexford is a people-pleaser and learns very fast, so training should be a breeze!  He already knows sit, shake, and lie down! \n\nRexford is neutered, microchipped, fully vaccinated and dewormed. If you are interested in Rexford, please contact Amanda or Robert with Happy Landings Animal Rescue. Our adoption process includes an application, a meeting/play date with your future fur baby, a brief home visit, and an adoption fee. Our adoption fees are in place to offset veterinary costs (spaying, neutering, vaccines, deworming, and microchipping) and to ensure our dogs will not be used for dog fighting or any other malicious purposes.",

I love to sniff and smell but have no desire to howl or whine.  I love to be with you people all day long!  Let me lay at your feet while you work on your computer or crawl on the couch to watch T.V.  Because I was found wandering, I\u2019m working on all my manners with my foster family\u2026and they give me an A+ for learning quickly.  I love my shorter foster brother, he is fun to play with but reminds me when I get too excited and step on his head that I need to take it down a notch.  I\u2019m great walking you on a leash, I even pick the route we should take.  I enjoy my outside time, but I love being inside a warm, cozy house.  I would love to find a home that has the perfect lap to lay on, lots of toys to choose from, different paths for our walks and a fenced yard for our game of frisbee.  \nMy foster family loves me so much and are excited to help me find my perfect home.\n\nFor more information or to schedule an appointment please contact Tri-County Animal Rescue Center by calling (814)-918-2032 or email us at contactus@tricounty-arc.org. Thank You for sharing!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoomer is a handsome Coonhound found wandering as a stray and brought to the rescue. According to the Vet he is approximately 3 years of age and healthy. Boomer is very friendly and enjoys attention from people. He is an active boy who enjoys his outdoor time & would do well with someone who provides good daily exercise, some obedience training, structure & consistency. For more information on Boomer please contact Tri-County Animal Rescue Center",

My foster mom calls me all different variations of that, like Finley Winley, Finniginly....I know she's weird but I still like her.   I haven't had a great beginning but that's typically the case with all rescue dogs.  I recently came back to my original foster home/rescue  because things were not working out with my family.  While they loved me a lot and tried their best to help me we were just not the right match.   My foster mom's theory is, I didn't think they had control of the home situation so I felt I needed to take charge of it and them.   Since being back with my foster mom, who is definitely in charge of the house and all the dogs living here I am a different dog.   I love to snuggle up next to mom on the couch or lay on the foot stool leaned up against her legs.  The best part of snuggling is having my ears stroked and belly rubs!  I love a good belly rub!!!  I do a lot of groaning when I'm relaxing, makes mom chuckle all the time.   I had a lot of anxiety in my previous home and did do some nipping to my mom and dad, never the kids.  To help with my anxiety I was on two different kinds of anxiety medication, which mom stopped immediately so she could see my true personality with her.  She hasn't seen any anxiety except on my trip to the vets office.   The doctor and her assistant said I was a very good boy and relaxed, well, as relaxed as a dog can be up on a table being checked over.  I get along with all the dogs in my foster home, especially the big girl who just wants to play, run and roll me over on my back.  Yes, I tolerate that, probably because she is bigger and goofier then me.  I still hate the crate!  I never willing went in until recently when mom bought some tasty treats.  If I was the only dog here, mom would leave me out because I wasn't destructive in my other home except to scratch the heck out of the doors trying to get out.  I do not show any signs of separation anxiety here like I did in my last home.  Is that because I know mom won't allow it, no one knows.  I haven't told you how smart I am, mom says maybe too smart for my own good.  She said when I sit and think she can see the wheels turning in my head.  Too bad she doesn't know what I'm thinking.   She goes in and out of the garage and closes the door, I just sit there and wait for her to come back in.  I'm not frantic when the delivery guys come or someone is walking by the house unless it's the neighbors cat who walks right under our window. The other dogs bark a lot and sometimes I do but not always.   Again, mom is in charge and we are told to control ourselves.  Since I have the strong tendency to protect I need a confident person who makes me feel safe and secure.  I don't want to be anxious and I don't want to be on medication because they didn't work.  Mom thinks the perfect home for me would be with a single person or couple, both must have strong personalities,  someone who is home a good amount of time because I do love people, a large fenced in yard to play in with you or a dog larger then me who likes to be silly.  No kids, because kids need to be protected and I don't want that job again.  What do you say....are you up for the challenge?  I'm not really a challenge if I'm with the right people for me.  I'm about 2 years old and 35ish pounds.  I have beautiful markings, a lot of ticking and a handsome chestnut face with big soft ears that mom loves to touch.  Since I'm a hound I love to smell to find where critters have been so a secure fenced in yard is necessary for me to be happy.   Please visit our website for our meet/greet/adoption process, www.crazypawsdogrescue.com      Love, Finley\n\n",

He did not have on a collar and tag, but thankfully RCR was contacted through his microchip. We tried to reach his adopter, but to no avail.\n\nWe immediately took Calvin to the vet. He had torn ACLs on both of his back legs, making it difficult for him to walk. Calvin has had orthopedic surgeries to repair both of his rear legs, and he is currently going through physical therapy to help him walk again without pain. Although he has been making steady progress, he is expected to always have some limitations in his mobility. Specifically, his hind legs are bowed out when he walks; he can only tolerate walks up to 1/2 mile at a time. Despite that, Calvin still has plenty of life in him. His hearing, eye sight and sense of smell are as sharp as any young dogs. Everything (except his legs) works perfectly in him!\n\nCalvin is a big loving lug of a dog. He's perfectly house trained and he does well in a kennel. He doesn't touch anything that's not his. He is quiet most of the time, but he will alert you if he hears something outside the house. A perfect alarm system! Though he is a senior dog, he still loves to play some. He loves his tennis ball and will make a pirate growl when he wants you to play fetch with him. His exercise need is low. But he loves his daily walks and is always ready to go with you. Please contact info@redcollar.org for more information on adopting this sweet and handsome gentleman!\n\nAge - 9 1/2 years\nWeight - 70 lbs.\nDogs - big dogs okay\nCats - no\nKids - older okay \nVaccinated - yes\nNeutered - yes\nMicrochipped - yes\n\nwww.redcollar.org\nwww.facebook.com/REDCollarRescue\n",

He's a quiet, sweet, friendly and gentle 4 yo that does not mind being in his crate with his favorite treat and loves his four foster siblings (the furry kind). \n\nGeorge was found on the streets and, while it was apparent he had been dumped, it\u2019s also obvious he had once been loved. This boy knows what it means to be part of a family. \n\nUnfortunately, his microchip, which was implanted in a different city, was never registered. He\u2019s about 40lbs., but working on his summer body and we think his target weight should be around 35lbs. He had gone through heartworm treatment late last year and did very well considering it does show the heartworms caused some damage. It sure doesn\u2019t stop him from wanting his daily walks though! \n\nHis ideal environment is quiet and relaxed.  He would love a new family of his own. Please meet George!",

And her personality is just as beautiful as her photos - she is sweet, funny, and smart. Triscuit is about seven years old and weighs 49-pounds. She is crate, house, and leash trained and knows cute tricks, like sit and down. She loves treats and would be happy to learn as many tricks as you would like to teach her as long as you keep handing out the snacks.\n\nTriscuit would do best in a home with an experienced pet parent who can give her structure & routine, and where she is the only pet. She bonds quickly to her favorite person and may do best in a home with just one adult to care for her. She is a very affectionate sweetheart, and you will not lack for love if you become \"her person!\"\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n2/2/21 5:36 PM",

She is a big girl trapped in a small body.\n\n She thinks she is awesome and so do we. \nShe is fully vetted and is up to date on everything. \nShe loves to be the little boss, so she can be dog selective but prefers bigger dogs.\n\n It just takes her a little time to get use to new animals. \nShe loves children and running and playing in the yard,\nso she will require a fenced in yard.\n Honey does prefer to not have the company of kitty cats!\n\n She is approx. 1 yr. old now according to the vet. Honey is spayed, approx. 30 lb. and  ready to go to the right home for her!",

            "description": "Lobo is a 7-year-old German Shepherd that weighs 75 lbs. He is very well-behaved in the house, is housebroken and knows how to use the doggie door. He is calm and loves to hang out with his people. He is also crate-trained and doesn't mind sleeping in the crate at the beginning. He is not destructive when left alone - he might bark first for a few minutes after his person leaves the house, but after that just lies down and goes to sleep. Also, he doesn\u2019t dig in the yard and doesn\u2019t try to escape. He has been great when meeting new people and has no problem with strangers coming to visit.\n Lobo knows all his basic commands and loves going for walks. If there are no dogs around, he walks really well by his owner\u2019s side. However, if he sees other dogs walking by he will bark and probably lounge at them, so his future owner needs to be strong enough to handle him and some obedience and leash training with his future owner will be helpful.\n Lobo is very fond of car rides \u2013 at first he is a little excited, but then lies down and waits to arrive at his destination. He is good with large- and small-size dogs, as he previously lived in a home with 5 other German Shepherds and now lives in a foster home with a few other dogs. \nLobo was adopted for five months and returned because his previous adopter was not experienced enough to handle him on walks. Before the adoption he was a pretty confident, happy dog, but sadly he was returned pretty skittish. Unfortunately, we have no idea what he went through in his previous home that he became skittish.\nBeing old and changing a few homes already has made him a little nervous, so his future owner needs to take their time and be patient, to give him time to adjust. During the first few weeks he will probably keep going to the door and looking for his foster mom.\nLobo is an absolutely wonderful dog that spent almost two years in a shelter before Angels Bark saved him, on his very last day, and he deserves the best possible home; we just don't want him to change any more homes. His next home needs to be committed to keep him, work with him and earn his trust.\n\nThe best type of home for Lobo is a house with a yard and another large-size dog. Lobo is not good with cats and we will not adopt him to a home with kids - an adult-only home would be the best type of home for Lobo.",

We\u2019re not sure about the cat in his foster home, but doesn't chase them so we\u2019re thinking he\u2019d probably do okay.

He is a happy, playful boy once comfortable.Troy is a wonderful boy - affectionate and very sweet, but he does have some insecurities. Troy is a broken leg dog and it has left him with some residual pain and sensitivity issues. His pain issues are well managed with daily meds. He has come a long way with the help of some wonderful folks at Crawford Canine Connection.Troy is affectionate and a big time leaner, but doesn't like to be overwhelmed or overhandled. He will need an adoptive home who is dog savvy, patient, willing to go at Troy's pace and will continue his training using positive training methods. Troy needs to use a ramp to load and unload into/out of a vehicle and we are happy to provide that to his new family. We will provide 3 training sessions so he can continue to get acclimated in his new home with positive training methods.Troy will need a quieter home with a fenced yard and no children. He would love a canine companion - preferably female, but he has done well with many male dogs as well (he is turned out with another male greyhound at the moment and does fine). He will need a home without cats. The ideal home would be a local Woodinville area home. With a little patience, this boy will reward you ten fold!!! He has made HUGE strides and is just a love.

He would need his potential new family to come meet him at Dogtown to make sure it is a good fit.

Barks a lot in the morning, when he wants to, or when he hears fireworks.  \n        -LOVES car rides, and mostly rides in my lap.\n        -Is very loyal to his owner, wary of almost everyone else\n        -gets along with dogs of all sizes, but can be a curmudgeon when they annoy him\n        -Ok with cats but not kittens and seems to have a penchant for chasing orange cats in particular\n        -Not a fan of having his belly rubbed but looooves his back and spine scratched\n        -loves being in the backyard and searching for duck eggs \n\n\nISOSCELES is a spunky, 3-legged,  8-year-old, Rat Terrier mix.\n\nFOSTER REPORT\n\n\"Isosceles has potential but he is going to need work with a behaviorist and he should definitely not be with any children.\n\nHe gets along pretty well on those 3 legs but ideally, he needs a one-story house with carpeting to stabilize him.  His main issue is that he is touch-sensitive. He will put teeth on you if you pick him up in a way he does not like. If you get behind him and get him by the chest only and not touch his legs that seems to be acceptable to him. Obviously this is a problem because he needs to be picked up to go up flights of stairs or on the couch.\n\nIn our short time with him, he became attached to my husband only and showed separation anxiety when Mike was not in sight. He is a very alert little dog and sleeps very well in his crate at night. He likes car rides. He wants love but does not know how to receive it yet. \n\nHe is a bit much for us to handle with our lifestyle but an experienced handler and a quiet household may be able to bring him up to his full potential. We hope so. My husband, in particular, is very sad to see him go. We are pulling for this little guy!\"\n\n***\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIf you would like to foster, foster-to-adopt, (in case you're not sure), or adopt ISOSCELES, just fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION, which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser. EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

She is housebroken, crate trained and knows simple commands. She would do well in a quiet home with a large fenced in backyard and a playful large male dog (she prefers to be the only 4 legged lady in the house).... but she does get along with small dogs. Willow would do best in a home without small children, cats or small farm animals. She is up to date on vaccines and spayed. She has also had a gastropexy (stomach tacked) done to prevent bloat. She does have severe allergies and needs to be on a prescription medication daily that she easily takes in a treat. Adoption fee is $300.00",

He should not be around cats or dogs. No kids as well. He is seven years old and weighs about 18 pounds. He is as cute as a button. He wants your love and attention, but he needs his space to chill too. Leon needs a lot of patience and a lot of time warming up. He has bitten in the past, so you must have experience with a JRT breed or high energy dogs with past issues. Needs a fenced yard.\n\nIf you are interested in a meet and greet with Leon please fill out an adoption application located on our website at www.pawprinthearts.com\n\nLeons adoption fee is $150 and it includes spay/neuter, rabies vaccine, DHPP, and microchip.",

A handsome and affectionate 70 pounds of dog, Dude will surely shower you with love and attention! We sometimes worry the amount of love he has to give is bigger than his body can hold! He will eagerly greet you and make sure you know he missed you. Dude loves people - all shapes, all sizes, and all ages, however, due to his size, we do not recommend a home with small children because he can accidentally knock them over. \n\n \n\nDude will need an active home who can exercise him daily - both physically and mentally. Just like any dog, without stimulation Dude can become destructive if left unattended and without exercise. Dude walks really well on leash but can sometimes get sidetracked by little critters, but he doesn't seem to mind seeing other dogs on his walks. \n\n \n\nThat said, Dude does not need a canine companion to keep him happy and is easier to manage without other pets in the home, so he is a part of our single-dog campaign. Dude just needs a loving person(s) to make his life complete!\n\n \n\nDude is house trained and crate trained. Dude rides great in the car and loves getting his belly rubbed. Dude is a big boy but is smart! He picked up the dog door within 12 hours of being in his foster home, and used it without any issues.\n\n \n\nDude is just looking for someone to take a chance on loving him and giving him a home! So get yourself a sweet Dude today! \n\n*HOME OWNERSHIP REQUIRED!*\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

I had had a rough life, I was kept outside and my owners didn't care much about me, so I got heartworms ...my rescue got me from Aiken County shelter and treated my heartworms, then I had a back problem from the treatment but that finally got well, and I was adopted, but that lady had to return me when her job changed. I came back to my rescue and had a really nice foster and then was adopted again by a lady and her son, and I was SO happy, I had a warm bed and lots of toys and no other dogs or cats to bother me. The lady's son was my best buddy , I slept with him and he played with me every day. I love to dress up and wear sweaters and fluffy collars. I had a great Christmas last year... but then my best buddy went back to live with his father, and my mom decided she didn't want me any more so I came back to my rescue. Everyone is nice to me here, but there are a lot of other dogs and I don't much like other dogs and it's nothing like being in a real home, I know cause I've had 2 of them. I am older now,about 6, and no one seems to want me. I also have to be the 'only dog', my rescue can't even take me to adoption events because I get too upset around strange dogs, so no one ever gets to see how pretty I am unless they put in what's called an application and come to see me. I love people, and children, I am nice and quiet, I'm what's called an 'inside dog' (I get allergies outside). Is there any hope for me, can I have a 3rd chance? I know some dogs don't even get a 2d chance, but, Is there ANY chance I can have a new home for THIS Christmas? If you have it in your heart to give me that 3rd chance please contact my rescue at shelteranimalsadvocates.org or call my rescue lady Mary Lou at 803-334-1219. I promise I will love you forever.\nTasha's adoption fee is $150 (which includes all vetting plus 1 month heartworm prevention and flea tick prevention and a bag of the food she is currently on)\n\n2/2/21 5:06 PM",

He's just looking for caring humans who enjoy quiet times at home and have room for a big, goofy dog who will constantly make them smile.  A stroll around the neighborhood, a game of tug, or just a nice roll in the grass is his idea of excitement.  Throw in the occasional car ride or enrichment class and he's a happy dog!  Honestly, he just wants to be a part of the family.\n\nOllie recently had a DNA test which showed him to be a Bulldog, Shepard, Husky mix, so sturdy people who have shared their home with a large dog in the past would be ideal.  He's crate trained, house trained, and has graduated from basic obedience classes.  Once he's settled into his routine, he's pretty much the older gentleman you'd expect from an 8-year-old guy.\n\nIf Ollie sounds like just the dog your life has been missing, please contact us at upstateunderdogrescue@gmail.com to learn about our foster-to-adopt process!\n\nAdoptable Underdog Ollie's Vital Statistics:\n- 8ish years old\n- Bulldog, Shepard, Husky mix\n- neutered\n- up to date on all things medical\n- pretty low energy\n- looking for a quiet home with sturdy humans and no other pets\n",

He will lay next to you and stare into your eyes while both searching and giving love. He is the proverbial couch potato. He curls up to get as close as he can to snuggle with you and he makes you feel like you are the most important thing in his life.  Leonard enjoys his time outside too. He is more comfortable when he is out with his people rather than just going alone in his fenced yard. When he is outside, he enjoys fetch when he is the mood, but is usually content to follow you around. Leonard loves his walks, and walks great on a leash when there are no distractions. He can be reactive around other dogs on walks within about two houses of his walk. Leonard would do best in a house with a fenced in yard, where he was the only dog.\n\nLeonard\u2019s eyes tell you everything you need to know about this great guy. He looks to his people for reassurance, and comfort, always wanting to just be with you.  Are you looking for a way to have a more fulfilling life? Look no further than Leonard. \n\nApplication Process\n\nMAPS\u2019s adoption process is designed to help best place dogs with homes that are in the best interest of the dog and their human companions. The adoption process starts with a prescreen review of a Guardian Application. Making decisions about dog placement in adoptive homes is an \"art\", not a \"science\", and there will be times when applications will be denied for various reason(s). This is left to the discretion of the MAPS after reviewing relevant information. MAPS reserves the right to make all decisions regarding placement or final disposition of any rescued dog in its care into a foster or adoptive home. There is absolutely no guarantee, made or implied, that any person or persons requesting to adopt a dog being fostered through MAPS, or posted on MAP's web site, will be granted an adoption. After a successful prescreen, including background checks, the applicant(s) are notified that they can visit the dogs and a time slot is made for the dog and applicant interaction. After the interaction we encourage several days of reflection before adopting a pet to help assure this will be a lifetime commitment of love and quality care for the dog. Next we conduct a home/neighborhood visit to the Guardian Applicant's home. If the home visit proves successful the new mom and/or dad of the dog will sign an Adoption Agreement and share a lifetime of love and mindful growth !\n\nGuardianship Application available for download at\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/MAPSFiles\n\nMAPS Dog Rescue Mission\n\nMidwest Area Pit Stop, Inc. (MAPS) is a foster home based rescue located in Madison, Wisconsin established in 2005 after being part of the Chicago Illinois based rescue Furry Friends for several years. MAPS focuses on providing a structured, safe calm environment for the dogs in their care that helps them flourish. This structured home environment is complimented by exercise, Positive Reinforcement Deference Training, very high quality dog food in addition to a broad spectrum of proven food supplements including vitamins and supplements. In addition to fostering, MAPS provides sponsorship funds to help with the veterinary expenses and/or Breed DNA testing to save dogs in need of a rescue at the end of their options. MAPS has been active in the community promoting dog safety, how to build a healthy relationship with your dog, and fighting breed discrimination including breed testing of hundreds of dogs since December 2007.  MAPS believes that dogs are a central component for people to have a more meaningful and purposeful life.  That is, if people are willing to embrace mindfulness in daily living. Dogs help us connect to reality and make life worth living through example and deep bonds. MAPS is not about how many dogs are adopted in the shortest amount of time but rather measures to help insure the dogs that are adopted do not come back for the wrong reasons. \n\n\n",

He is full of energy and bounce, so no small kids please. He is very active, so he will need a home with its own secured private yard. \nFor more info on this dog, please call PET ADOPTION FUND rescue and adoption center between 1:00 and 5:00 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday (closed Mondays) at (818) 340-1687 or (818) 340-1186.",

She would do best with a submissive dog or as an only dog. She will require someone that is patient as it will take her a bit to warm up and trust.\n\nThis little girl loves to play with her toys, wear pretty dresses, and to be in the arms of her human.\n\nIf you are interested in giving Leela a second chance at a happy and loving life, please visit www.pincdogrescue.com/adopt and submit an adoption application. You will also find our adoption process listed on that page.\nCharacteristics\nPlayful, House Trained, Crate Trained",

If anyone happens to see Bert, please give him my forwarding address because, life has been pretty crazy since I last saw Bert.\"\n\nSo see Bert and I were adopted as puppies by a really nice couple.  But then our lady got cancer, and life got a little crazy.  Then her husband's adult son died (also from cancer) and life really became a roller coaster because our lady died just 6 days afterwards!  I was surrendered because even though I'm tolerant of other dogs, I am a really dominant kind of guy and need to be supervised whenever I am around another dog. Suffice it to say, I should be the only dog in the home. \n\nSo, like most Mastiffs, I am good with people, but I am a little scared at first of new folks.  I would adore having my own person that I don't have to share, but I am a master in the art of compromise as long as I know who is the leader of the household (if no one there is sure who's the leader, then I can step in and run the household -- but that's not always a good thing ...so be sure you are the leader in our home).\n\nI am housebroken, neutered and up to date on shots. I am super affectionate too! So if you have a nice yard with a good fence and are looking for a protective room mate -- fill out the application and tell Lisa you are interested in ME! Name is Ernie- that's E R N I E!!! If Lisa thinks we'd be a good fit, she'll invite you to the ranch so we can meet and get acquainted and decide whether I am going to be your next life company ... I'm looking forward to meeting you.",

I was born 12-13-2016 and I came from a puppy mill auction ... where I was found in a crate in the back being poked with sticks by puppy miller children ... honestly do you think any of those kids grow up anything resembling\"normal\" ... just something to ponder when you've just had a nice dinner in your first real home with walls, a  door and nobody poking you with sticks\n\nSo I am a girl who is serious about home security.  Once I figure out I belong somewhere then I am all about being sure nobody who belongs there is ever hurt on my watch.  And it is my watch until the lead alpha bitch in my house is back home ... and as the resident BB (come on, that's me, Beta Bitch Rosie) I will take care of business until Mommy Alpha comes home, and then -- soon as Mommy tells me you are ok --  I am soooooo happy to meet you. \n\nI am spayed and up to date on shots. I am a large girl with a ton of energy. I\u2019m not going to a home with kids as they have friends who sometimes come over and walk in the door. That wouldn\u2019t end well for them. As I said, I take my guardian role seriously.\n\nIf you have had guardian dog experience, email Lisa and tell her you want RUBY!\n",

We think Lilly is a mixture of American Staffordshire terrier and French bulldog. She weighs about 30 lb.\nLilly needs an only-pet home with a fenced yard and some bigger kids to play with. She is very sweet and needs exercise. She would love to have obedience training and perhaps agility training or be a running partner.\nLilly is up-to-date on vaccines, heart worm negative and microchipped along with being spayed. She has a slight  under-performing thyroid and takes a supplement each day, but this is not an expensive medication.\nTo find out more about Lilly Bloom, call her buddy, Kelli, at 803-646-2593.

She is definitely a type.. and for the one who loves a smart, agile, fearless loving life every day.. but loves you most.. SCOUT is without a doubt your special girl!! \n\n     NOT a couch potato.. extremely loyal.. highly interactive with energy that doesn't ever really fade but can and regularly does shift into lower gears. Scout will gladly surrender her play drive for an all in massage and lots of love gazes. She has even learned to ignore the resident stray kitty that hangs around the property! Scout is one of those dogs that loves and wants to be part of everything.. car rides, activities, hikes, hanging out under my desk... she is happy when she's hanging with her peeps!\n\n   Scoutie girl is incredibly affectionate and is Level 100 cuddle master. She will hang for pets and/or brushing all day long. She will lick your face, your arm or your leg just out of pure LOVE. Scout is the kind of dog that requires attention.. she would not be a good match if you are gone the entire day at work.. she wants and needs action! She gets along beautifully with many other male dogs we have here but does have a rougher play style. \n\n***While we are very grateful for PetFinder, we have been having chronic problems receiving inquires. Please contact us directly if you are interested in adopting by emailing us at lovedogs.bedfordny@gmail.com and visit fortheloveofdogsrescue.org***",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 5/16/18\nReason for being in rescue: Sylvia was surrendered by owners who could not afford to care for her.\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? yes, Sylvia came to us lightly heartworm positive. As of June 2019 she is now testing negative for heartworms! She has been treated using the slow kill method and must be on monthly heartworm prevention for the rest of her life.\nWeight: 60 lbs\nHeight: estimated 19 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? Yes, Sylvia loves to run!\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Sylvia is seeking an active home. Sylvia also needs a home with adults that are experienced with high energy dogs. Due to her energy level, she can overwhelm small children and would do best in a home with older, dog savvy kids. Sylvia needs to home where she can be the light of someone's life. She can co-exist with another large dog, but that dog must be respectful of Sylvia's personal space.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Can you say Rambunctious! This girl wakes up in the morning and hits the ground running! Sylvia has no fear of anything and will take on any adventure she can. She has raised her babies, and now she is ready to experience life for herself. Sylvia loves treats and toys, but does not know any basic commands besides sit. If there is a treat involved, she is willing to learn.\n\nSylvia and her 3 puppies came into the rescue as an outside dog that did not receive much training or attention. She LOVES people and just wants to be with them 24/7. Sylvia does well meeting other dogs, but can be picky about who she wants to be friends with. Sylvia does need work with walking on a leash, she likes to be the leader and pull you along to the next adventure.\n\nAs Sylvia has settled into rescue life, she has calmed down a little but has also gained a lot of weight.. If you are looking for an exercise buddy, Sylvia would love to be your companion. She needs to lose about 10 pounds.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Sylvia never meets a stranger and doesn't think twice about introducing herself.\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Sylvia's estimated birthday is 06/19/2016.\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

            "description": "Ernie (65lbs.) is a 3 year old, mixed breed that was surrendered to the rescue when his owners divorced. Ernie is a highly intelligent dog with a dominant personality. Based on his presentation, it is evident that he was not taught rules, boundaries, and limits as a young pup. As such, Ernie is very pushy when meeting new people. He will test limits and boundaries until his person is able to establish themselves as the leader of their pack. Once rules, boundaries, and limits have been established, Ernie will be happy to show you all his tricks. He knows commands for sit, stay, come, down, paw, and roll over. Ernie enjoys going for long walks and lounging in the yard. Ernie would do best in an adult-only home where he can be the only pet. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or potentially adopting this rescue pet, please complete our online application at www.arrus.org.

Tanner loves people and will immediately give you his attention. If you want complete focus, all you need to do is present a toy. Tanner would love a companion who's active and will engage in play with him. Very responsive, he knows sit and stay, and is a wild walker when he first leaves his kennel, but much more calm and orderly after a bit of unwinding. Tanner's adoption fee is $150. He's altered, has been wormed, vaccinated and microchipped. How can you pass on such an athletic sweetie pie?",

Gina has found a best friend in one of our awesome volunteers who gives her weekend mini-vacations from the shelter, so we have a little more knowledge of how Gina does in a home. When provided what she needs to feel comfortable, Shocker, She's outstanding! Gina's foster/bestie would be happy to sing Gina's praises to any potential adopter that is interested in giving our sweet girl a forever home. She's quite the cute little lovebug so if you are interested, please fill out an application today!",

            "description": "Rocky is a Rottweiler Mix, his estimated date of birth is 2/7/12 and he weighs 75 lbs. He is up to date on all of his shots and he is fixed. Rocky is OK with people but is not good with kids, cats, or small dogs. Rocky has a habit of jumping and he has a tendency to try to escape so he would need a home that was very secure. Rocky has food aggression and is very possessive of toys and people. He can sometimes have an over protective drive to certain people. Rocky can be very vocal and would require a home with a lot of space as Rocky prefers to roam and would become destructive if restricted in a small space. Rocky is not good with new people or places and can be aggressive to other male dogs. He requires regular grooming and requires a special diet. Rocky is afraid of water and can become agitated by running water or large areas of water. He has a habit of dumping out his water dish. Rocky is not good on a leash despite repeated training and still has issues with house training and marking.We do not have a central location to see our dogs. Meeting any dog is by appointment ONLY currently. Appointments can be set up to meet any dog in San Diego. Currently we are unable to do any out-of-state adoptions.\n\nIf you are interested in a particular dog please FILL OUT an Adoption Application at our website @ http://bajadogrescue.org/ready-to-adopt/adopt and we can schedule you for an appointment to meet with a particular dog if it is available.

She is up to date on all of her shots and she is fixed.\n\nAlice is a very sweet girl. She is good with people and with other dogs, very happy and friendly. We first took Alice in after she was hit by a car which fractured her pelvis and caused a condition known as megacolon. Megacolon is a state of permanently increased diameter of the large bowel. This change in intestinal structure leads to abnormal function, including reduced colonic motility and chronic constipation. Fecal retention in Alice's colon causes dilation of the colon and can somewhat impair her ability to poop. We have been able to get her much better health-wise and with medication and care Alice should be able to lead a healthy long life. She currently receives a daily stool softener and Cisapride, a medication that increases the motility in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Currently Alice is not house broken and does not have normal stools. They are often watery and grey and come out a little bit at a time. We do not have a central location to see our dogs. Meeting any dog is by appointment ONLY currently. Appointments can be set up to meet any dog in San Diego.

            "description": "Kristi is a Australian Shepherd Mix. Her estimated date of birth is 8/20/2015 and she weighs 40 lbs. She is up to date on all of her shots and she is fixed. Kristi is OK with people that she knows but is not good with new people. She is better suited for a home that has no cats, no kids or other dogs or small animals. Kristi does like to vocalize and would be best in a house as she needs a lot of space to run around. Kristi is not good alone and does need someone she can trust to be her side most of the time. Kristi requires a very special diet and does not tolerate prepackaged dog food well. She has some minor skin issues that do require weekly medication. She has a very high energy level and would require exercise on a daily basis for at least 1 hour otherwise she has the tendency to be destructive to items. Kristi does have some issues on a a leash and has a small problem with marking in homes.We do not have a central location to see our dogs. Meeting any dog is by appointment ONLY currently. Appointments can be set up to meet any dog in San Diego. Currently we are unable to do any out-of-state adoptions.\n\nIf you are interested in a particular dog please FILL OUT an Adoption Application at our website @ http://bajadogrescue.org/ready-to-adopt/adopt and we can schedule you for an appointment to meet with a particular dog if it is available. We do require an application if you are interested in adoption. If you are interested in potentially adopting please fill out an application at http://bajadogrescue.org/ready-to-adopt/adopt. Your application will be reviewed and you will be placed on a waiting list for the dog(s). If your name comes up on the waiting list(s) we will contact you. You can see the dogs we have available for adoption on our website at http://bajadogrescue.org/shelter-dogs/\n\nPlease check out our FAQ's page at http://bajadogrescue.org/faqs/.\n\nQuestions?

Yes, this mama has been with us since then, but let us tell you why!\nWe now call her Cha Cha because this dancing hippo loves to do just that - cha cha all around and dance like a fool! So, you got the beat to drop with her?! Let's find out! Cha Cha lives (and loves) to snuggle, so Netflix and chill on a couch is a must! Yup. She is as laid back as the come! Cha Cha is house trained, and does well out and about, or even in her kennel. Cha Cha is a little more picky about her dog friends, but give this a girl a puppy and she is set - hey, that just means you could be an endless puppy foster! Cha Cha is the hippo - iest gal we know in her squaty body, and those ears! To die for! Cha Cha has made some pretty radical progress since entering rescue - seriously, your heart would break if we told you the mess she was day one through day 70 in foster care. These dogs are no less deserving of a forever, so let's line 'em up, line 'em, line 'em up and knock 'em back with those shares and apps! So, swipe right, swipe left, we don't care, just swipe! Let's get this fully vetted bachelorette on her way to forever! Her $300 fee covers spay, microchip, and current shots.",

He is up to date on vaccinations, neutered and heartworm negative.  He loves, loves, loves toys and enjoys playing with other dogs.  Fred is housetrained and just the perfect Saint.\n\nIn concern for families with small children, we will not adopt a dog to a home with any child under the age of 5. This is due to the large size of Saint Bernards and the safety of your children. Our Saint Bernards are not aggressive or mean in any way, they can just knock down children easily. If you would like to visit our pups please contact St. Cloud's Rescue at www.stcloudsrescue.org or call 972-679-5319. The first step in adopting from St. Cloud's Rescue is to complete an application. The application may be found OUR WEBSITE at www.stcloudsrescue.org. Please click on the application process, complete and then email it. Once the application has been sent please call us to confirm that we have received it. St.Cloud's Rescue maintains the right to deny applications to anyone for any reason we see fit. St. Cloud Rescue is a non-profit 501-c-3 organization. St. Clouds Rescue requires new owners to purchase a one year supply of heartworm preventative from us, which is at cost.

            "description": "Make no mistake, this Beauty is smart with a capital S! Plus she is gorgeous - hence her name.  She weighs about 50 pounds and is three years old..  She is leash and clicker trained  (didn't we tell you she's smart) and loves to play.  Beauty would  be a good running/jogging companion or hiking/walking companion.  Beauty is a border collie mix and wants to herd children so we are looking for a home with experienced dog owners and no children.  She gets along with dogs but would prefer to be the only dog in the home.   Fenced yard is also preferable.   If you live in the Toronto area and are interested in meeting Beauty and learning more about our foster to adopt program, please contact our rescue at c4ptoronto@gmail.com .\n",

Sadly we are confident this little guy had been abused & it caused him to be very insecure. We knew we would have to do something for him to become adoptable. \n\nChappy has come such a long way & even received professional training! He knows all of his commands including place, heeling, waiting for his food etc. He's a sensitive guy but has figured out this \"pet dog\" thing ;) \n\nHe bonds easily to people but is scared of strangers. He needs someone that will put him up when there is company over at the house & advocate for him in public-- for example, don't let random people touch him unnecessarily. \n\nHe coexists with my 6 other dogs but wouldn't be a good doggy playmate. He's more of a companion for a person. \n\nHe would love a furever home that will understand they need to keep up with the structure & obedience once he's home.\n\nLet us know if you're interested in this handsome guy longing for a place that understands his needs & where he can feel safe & secure forever! <3 \n\nHis adoption fee is waived to the perfect home!",

Please email the completed application to newleashrescue2018@gmail.com\n\nPerkins came to rescue as an unclaimed stray from a local impound.  When he first arrived to rescue, the end of his tail was badly damaged and needed surgery to be able to heal.  \n\nPerkins is thought to be almost 4 years old and weighs around 40 pounds. He is best suited for a family with lots of dog experience. Due to some special needs he's not for the casual dog owner.  Perkins has some OCD tendencies.  When left alone for longer periods of time (more than 3 hours) he will become destructive.  If he is kenneled, he spins and self harms. We have learned that the best thing for Perkins is a home where a human will be home with him the majority of the time. \nHe'd do best as an only dog because he can bully and play rough with other dogs and  plays too rough with smaller ones.  No cats or small animals.  We're still working on house training. Perkins tends to be shy in new situations so we recommend a home with no young children. We don't recommend an apartment or town home where there are shared walls because he can sing and be vocal.  \nHe loves to run around the backyard so a fenced in yard is preferred.  He is not a fan of walks unless they are along a trail where there are no cars otherwise be prepared to carry him.  He's very affectionate and will nudge and nibble you when he wants attention.  He loves to rollover on his back and get tickles on his tummy.  He's also a huge fan of tug-of-war and fetch, where you throw the ball, he catches it and you try to fetch it from him.\n\nAdoption fee is $200 + tax (no checks)\n\nFoster to contact: Cadence at 608-848-8254 or cadence.ayres@chsinc.com\n\nPerkins will not be attending an upcoming adoption event so contact the foster to learn more about him\n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home. An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home. \n\nSometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home and truly become comfortable. There are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption, discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months. We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.",

Rocco is about 3 years old, neutered, full of love, gets along with other dogs (big and small) and has an incredible soul. He is a true gentleman! His life hasn't been easy, he was abandoned and neglected for quite some time, we found him covered in mange, he had eye and ear infection as well and malnourished :(  We have seen this gentle giant blossom here at ResQme, we love this handsome boy to pieces for being so brave and determined. \n\nBAMBAM (maltese mix / $400 adoption fee) is an owner-surrendered, around 3yrs old, 20lbs, he was no longer wanted by his previous owner. BamBam is as sweet as can be and owns the most beautiful set of eyes. He is very loving, loves to cuddle and be by your side. He has a clean medical record, loves car rides and loves to go out a lot.\n\nInterested in meeting these precious boys? VISIT us online to fill out an adoption application, www.resqmedogmission.org/adoption-application. \nThank you for choosing to adopt!",

The volunteers love to tease me with the affectionate nicknames but I don\u2019t mind because I\u2019m a great sport. I can laugh at myself and love to laugh in general because I\u2019m a happy go lucky type girl. I also have a lot of energy and I like to have things to do. I may be a little (like a smidge) bossy. I would rather say I like to keep busy and if that means herding you into the kitchen for a treat is that so wrong? See I didn\u2019t think so either. You probably can\u2019t tell from my stout figure but I love my two meals a day and treats. Like a lot. I will push my nose into your pockets just to make sure you don\u2019t have any treats hiding in there. I love humans of all sizes, especially the smaller ones. But here\u2019s the deal. I like having a job and herding is my jam so the littles can be super fun for me to herd around the house. In that case I would do really well with older children or need a family that understands I like to have things to do when I'm not napping - which I'll be honest I also love to do.\n\nVolunteers say: \u201cDixie Chick is a hoot. She has such a larger than life personality and the biggest heart. It\u2019s huge. She loves everyone and everything. There isn\u2019t a mean bone in her body. She is super smart and it can be a challenge here at the rescue to keep her busy and engaged. Dixie girl would love to have a job and people to watch over. We do our best to work on more advanced training when we have a little extra time. Sometimes she has a mind of her own but she responds so well to instructions and loves (really loves) the extra attention. She would be great for a family interested in advanced training or would love to have a companion while doing chores.  Dixie is going to make some family so lucky\u201d.\n\nI am ready for a family of my own. I am so, so ready. If you have questions or are interested in meeting me please email Karin 4 Kritters at karin4kritters@gmail.com or use the button at the top of this page to inquire about me. We can hang out for a minute while I persuade you to add a little color (me) into your previously black and white life.Seriously I can do that \u2013 love Dixie \n\n\n\n",

No dogs or children in the home and no apartments for this particular dog.**\n\nFAST FACTS:\n*Calm, cuddly personality once comfortable\n*No Other Dogs or Cats\n*Adult-Only Home\n*No Apartments/Condos\n*Potty and Crate Trained\n*Training Required\n\nBIO:\nHi there! My name is Stoli, and I\u2019m a Shih-Tzu/Maltese mix, estimated to be 5 years old and 13 pounds, who ready to meet my forever family through Fetching Tails Foundation. As you can see, I have a scar on my head and body from a previous burn, but I like to consider it more as a beauty mark that makes me unique. My facial expressions will make you want to love and cuddle me, which I enjoy very much! In my ideal forever home, I would be the only furry companion (no other dogs or cats, please!) so I can have all your attention for myself. I also require an adult-only home without children, as I am a timid guy and appreciate patient humans who respect that although I love to snuggle and be held, sometimes I also need some 'me time' and personal space. My preferred residence would be single-family house (no apartments or condos, please!) with a fenced yard so I can enjoy the outdoors at my leisure.\n\nI'm learning so much about how to enjoy the world around me thanks to my foster parents and am looking forward to continuing to blossom with a forever family of my own. I am crate trained and can be left home alone to rest in mine while you are gone for a few hours. And I am fully potty trained, too: I will let you know when I need to do my business by going to the door. I can be a weary of new people and I may bark, so I prefer slow introductions to help me feel comfortable. Women are my favorite, but with a little time to know we are friends I get along with men as well (my favorite nap place is now stretched out on my foster dad\u2019s belly!) I am a smartie-pants and have learned a few commands including sit and give paw! Overall, I\u2019m a calm dude with a silly streak that will make you laugh when I feel playful, and my favorite activity is being by your side. As much as I enjoy my foster home, I\u2019m ready to spread my wings and find my devoted forever family who will give me the love and cuddles I have dreamed about my whole life. Could that be with you?\n\nHugs,\nStoli\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS, NO EXCEPTIONS: \n*ADOPTION FEE: $300\n*Be at least 21 years of age \n*Live in a 50-mile radius of Itasca, within the Illinois border\n*Have the knowledge and agreement of all adults living in the household \n*Have approval from owner of residence (written in lease) \n*Have a valid ID with current address (please provide proof of address if ID address is not up-to-date)\n*Be approved as a suitable adoptive home by Fetching Tails Foundation \n*Be prepared to make a lifetime commitment\n\nIf interested please fill out an application on our website at www.fetchingtailsfoundation.org; please make sure you fill in every required field/question or your submission will not go through. Please note that we take time to learn as much as we can about each dog in our care and our bios are our current observations; we are unable to make any guarantees on the future health or temperament of your adopted dog. Most dogs in our care come with unknown pre-rescue history and as such breed and age estimates are an educated guess. If any questions please email us!",

He became rescue only.  After being left in boarding again by a rescue ANOTHER rescue has taken him into their care.  He should have had training but did not.  NOW he will get that care. .

Penny is a 7 yr old female Chi/Rat Terrier mix who is low maintenance, easy going and gets along well with other dogs and cats. She is small in size (only 9 lbs) & she can melt your heart with those soulful brown eyes.\n\nHer favorite place is to be by your side whether it's out for a walk or sitting on the couch. She has tons of potential & will do great with some basic training. \n\nPenny has been diagnosed with luxating patella in both knees. Three veterinarians felt she was not a good candidate for surgery due to her age, requirement of extensive repair and lengthy recovery. But she\u2019s a happy little girl who has mastered living with her disability.\n\nOtherwise, she is in perfect health. Up to date on HW prevention, her vaccinations, flea & tick protection & has had her dental. Penny longs to be someone's special pet with a secure yard to run and play\u2026she's awaiting your friendship\n",

First, dogs just want to be happy and feel loved. Living inside and being a part of the family is really important to us. A lot of the things you need as humans to stay happy and healthy, us dogs need too. We depend on you for things like vet visits, nutritious food, clean water, social and play time with people and other pets, training classes, toys, and of course, lots of love and attention! Regular baths, nail trims and grooming help us to look and feel our best, while monthly flea and heartworm prevention help us to stay healthy. Did you know that depending on our size and breed, dogs can live up to 20 years? Just think of the wonderful life we could have together!",

He pounces on toys like a champ and is generally a goofy and happy pup. He wants to bring all of his joy to his adopter! He promises to be a good boy if you'll give him lots of treats to help him put on some weight. Copeland has already learned \"let's go\", \"sit\", \"go to mat\", \"trade\", \"go get it\", and he is working on \"come\". He would make a terrific companion for anyone with a house and yard in which he can feel secure and fully express his playful nature. This goofy young boy loves socializing and playing, and he learns new games and commands very quickly. Copeland loves to go running, but he is also great inside. When company is over he will make friends instantly and be the life of the party. He loves the outdoors but feels anxious and is reactive to crowded or busy city streets, so a quiet suburban environment would be the best fit for him. Apply today to meet handsome Copeland!\n\n__________________________________\n\nIf you are interested in meeting a dog or cat, we require an adoption application. If the animal has \"HAS APPLICATION\" listed, they are still available to receive additional applications but also may be in the process of being adopted soon. Apply for a DOG: http://www.citydogsrescuedc.org/adoptable-dogs.html\n\nInterested in saving more lives? Foster a dog today! Learn more, see our list of dogs needing foster, and apply, https://www.citydogsrescuedc.org/foster-a-city-dog.html\n\nCity Dogs Rescue & City Kitties is a foster-based rescue in Washington, DC. We do not have a shelter. We focus on local adoptions in DC and the metro area of Maryland and Virginia. CDR&CK has a thorough adoption process in order to find the best possible fit for each of our dogs and cats (we do not operate under a first-come, first served model).\n\nUpon accepting a new cat or dog into the organization, we provide a basic vet visit that includes necessary vaccinations, disease screenings, deworming, microchips, and spay/neuter (unless specified). We do not provide a comprehensive medical exam prior to adoption. As a result, sickness, injury, and disability may exist unbeknownst to CDR&CK. City Dogs Rescue & City Kitties is not responsible for payment of any vet care, including known and unknown medical conditions once a cat or dog is adopted from us. \nDog specific: Rabies, DHPP, Bordatella vaccines. They are tested for HW, Lyme, Ehrlichia, Anaplasmosis.\n\nMost cats and dogs will have a house training accident in the initial days in their new home and we cannot guarantee any pet is housebroken or crate trained.\n\nWe also update our Facebook page daily with new cats and dogs.",

She had a blast with her play time and checks in pretty regularly to get some loving in between her victory laps after getting her toy.:) Maryanne is a wiggly package of goofball love. She is eager to learn, and we are working on teaching her basic training commands. She does very well in her crate and in the house; she just needs someone to be patient with her while she learns her basics, as she has never had any real attention or love before ending up at the shelter and then being rescued, so she is starting from puppy square one at her age, but she is coming along nicely! :) Maryanne is available to foster or adopt. If interested in adopting or fostering, please contact us at destiny@dogsofdestiny.com for more info or fill out an application at dogsofdestiny.com.\n",

Marley is a super sweet little lady who knows her basic training and is house and crate trained. She is good with kids but unknown with cats. Marley tends to be dog selective and would really enjoy having you all to herself. She would give you plenty of unconditional love and fun.

Madison needs a patient person. She was not treated very well by her previous owners and can scare easily. Because of this, she does nervous pee during those times. She is good in her crate but would need some work with house training her. She is good in the house as far as not chewing on things but does have the occasional accident when left out on her own in the house. She is perfectly content snuggled up to you while on the couch and will insist on being close enough to be touching. For all her energy, she does rather well on leash and listens very well. Madison can be nervous around dogs she doesn\u2019t know and tends to be selective about the ones she likes but she has come a long way since we first rescued her. Even though she can tolerate others on leash and in passing, Madison needs to be the only pet in the home. She loves kids of all ages! :) To adopt or foster Madison please contact us at destiny@dogsofdestiny.com for more info or fill out an application at dogsofdestiny.com.\n",

Isabella is an active gal that would make a great fitness partner for those that like to walk and/or run. She also likes to burn up her energy by playing in the yard, and she is okay with doing most of the running around! Can you say zoomies? Isabella has been very good with kids but can be a little too energetic for some of the younger ones, she gets along with cats with slow and proper introductions, and is selective with other dogs, definitely needing an adjustment period with them longer than most, so she would need someone very patient with her if she went to a home with another dog. She is EXCELLENT in the house when left alone while you are at work and is also crate trained.

He is a very good boy with a lot of playful \"puppy\" energy but is super smart and listens very well to redirection/calming directions. He has done well with other dogs here at the rescue.

He was originally seized by animal control after his family, who had neglected and abused him, treating him so much like a lawn ornament, left him chained in the yard when they moved away. Huey has been doing just wonderfully here at rescue! He is one of our RADAR dogs and has been through his heartworm treatment thanks to them! Huey is also deaf. We've been working with him on not being so mouthy when he interacts with people, as well as trusting us that he won't be hurt when he comes to us. He has made such wonderful progress and actually now approaches you to be loved on and to get treats!! He has been doing very well with his dog interactions but in unknown with cats. We are so happy Huey is learning to \"dog!\u201d While we work with Huey on his mouthing, he is currently only available to foster (we will consider adoption to a family experienced and understanding of the work they will need to continue with him and/or a foster to adopt situation under the same pretense). If interested in adopting or fostering, please contact us at destiny@dogsofdestiny.com for more info or fill out an application at dogsofdestiny.com. Please also keep in mind that Huey is deaf, so working with him is a little different! A contractual agreement of working with our behavior consultant for a minimum of 5 visits will be required.\n",

She does it out of fear but will warm up if you give her a chance (and if you have some treats). After that, she is all about the pets and love. We do realize it could be intimidating for some, and we want to make sure she is in a home that is savvy, patient, and most of all, loving because Emma is a great dog! Treats are the easiest way to ensure a lifetime spot in her heart! :) She is good with other dogs but can be selective and unknown with cats. She is house and crate trained.

His play energy is low but peppy, and he loves his snuggle time and his peanut butter kongs. Duncan has been through numerous tests to find out what the issue causing his excessive urination and drinking is, but we have not been able to determine a cause. He is healthy all-around though! And all other issues we have had during his testing cycle have been eliminated and seemingly self-corrected. Duncan will need someone understanding of him having accidents because of this condition, but he does very well in his crate and will use pee pads. He receives weekly B12 injections and is also on a cranberry with d-mannose supplement that would need to continue in his foster or forever home. Duncan walks very well on leash and has done very well with people of all ages and other dogs! He is unknown with cats. If interested in giving Duncan a loving home, email at destiny@dogsofdestiny.com for more info or fill out an application at dogsofdestiny.com.\n",

Dexter does well in his crate but does take some time to get used to the house training, as he was kept outside all the time in his previous home. However, with routine and consistency, he catches on quickly. He loves to snuggle as much as he loves to play and has the cutest smile!

She is a gorgeous girl, but even better, she is as loyal as the day is long. She is an attentive and affectionate girl, and her sloppy kisses are to die for. Dalia Pixie looks to her person for direction and guidance and wants to make you happy. She has done well with other dogs here with proper and gradual introductions and also has been good around kids of all ages. She is a big girl at around 85 pounds, but she takes treats very gently. She loves activities that have her interacting with her person like agility! She also makes a great cuddler. Dalia is crate trained and does well when left to have free reign of the house. To foster or adopt Dalia Pixie, please email Dogs of Destiny at destiny@dogsofdestiny.com for more info or fill out an application at dogsofdestiny.com.\n",

From what we were told, he was in foster and the same decision had been made. A volunteer group stepped up and found him an adopter. The adopter decided she didn't want him anymore (apparently you can't teach a mostly deaf dog sign language, and she was disappointed that he wasn't totally deaf). Once again he was at risk of being put down since his rescue didn't want him back. They were once again scheduling him for euthanization. The volunteer group that thought they had saved him once before sent us an urgent plea for his life...and we answered. Nigel is super sweet and is a very young 7 years old! Nigel is hard of hearing but not deaf, and he is learning sign language regardless and is very well behaved! He also has food allergies so must be kept away from chicken or beef. His skin is very sensitive, and in the summer, he may break out in a hot spot and needs to get baths with a shampoo that is good for his skin (something with neem or tea tree oil in it...or even with ketoconazole). He can be a bit mouthy when he plays or tries to get your attention, so older children are recommended. He does well in his crate and has done very well in the house especially considering he had lived a good portion of his life outside only. This guy loves his peanut butter and loves his kisses! Nigel is available to foster or adopt. He has done well with other dogs he has Interacted with here. If interested in adopting or fostering this super sweet, handsome guy please email us at destiny@dogsofdestiny.com or fill out an application via our website at dogsofdestiny.com.\n",

            "description": "Meet CHLOE!!! There just aren't enough nice things to be able to describe this sweetheart of a gal! Chloe is very gentle when taking food and giving kisses. While she likes to romp around in the yard, she doesn't necessarily have any particular type of a game she likes to play, and she does check in with you for pets and praise while romping about. She can be very nervous/on guard when meeting or seeing people wearing hats, so it is best to ensure people she meets are not wearing them. She can also be reactive at the vet's office/strange places toward other dogs she doesn't know. This could be in part because Chloe was in and out of vet's offices and back and forth to specialists when we determined she had cancer. She had surgery to remove the cancer and has been cancer free for over a year now! Along with her regular check ups, she needs to be checked to ensure she is staying cancer free. She is a very sweet girl and she has a sassy \"talking\" side too, and she will bark at you to let you know you aren't moving fast enough to give her meals or her treats, so you've got to be on top of that stuff! :) CHLOE wasn't very socially appropriate with other dogs while she was at the shelter. While at the shelter, she would do okay with other dogs until she became overly excited or overly stimulated and then would mount them. Once she did, she wouldn't really respond to any correction another dog would give her to let them know they didn't like being mounted. Since she has been here, she has been doing very well with her baby gate interactions and her on leash interactions. We have also seen a significant decline in her trying to mount the dogs she interacts with! She is doing very well! Chloe is very well behaved in the house when left alone and also does very well in a crate. She takes a little while to fully open up to you and show you her goofball side and her snuggly side, but once she does, the full spectrum of her sweetness really shines through!

Albert is such a well-behaved boy. He is dog friendly, always showing proper etiquette and response, and is always loose and wiggly. Albert is a people pleaser and has shown nothing but love and happiness. He is such a happy, loving boy! He is gentle with everything he does, even in his play and loves to lie next to you for snuggles or simply just to be close! He does wonderfully on leash and is crate and house trained too!

This happy wiggle butt is almost impossible to get a good picture of l unless I can catch her either not paying attention to me or doing so while she sits nicely knowing a treat awaits her. :) We are still working with Adelaide's basic training, but she is progressing nicely! For not having a whole lot of structure, she is still very well behaved! Adelaide is also super loving. She can be a bit mouthy when she gets super excited, but she is still very much a puppy and has come quite a way with us working with her to be nowhere near as mouthy as she was a couple months ago. :) Adelaide is available to foster with someone who understands they would be working with her to help her advance in her training. We would like to see her a little more solid in her foundation before we make her available for adoption. She listens very well and is eager to learn, love, and see that she makes you happy. If interested in fostering, please contact us at destiny@dogsofdestiny.com for more info or fill out an application at dogsofdestiny.com\n",

Winston loves playing with the water from the hose and will give a cat a good chase, so NO CATS for him! He does very well with other dogs and is currently being fostered with two! One about the same size as him and another small dog. He has been the perfect houseguest and has had no accidents while in his foster home and even lets his foster mom know when he needs to go out. He has been neutered and is ready for his forever home! He takes medications well when hidden in food (he was on an antibiotic following his neuter--that\u2019s how we know)! He also LOVES to be around kids! If interested in adopting or fostering this distinguished gentleman, please email us at destiny@dogsofdestiny.com for more info or fill out an application at dogsofdestiny.com.\n",

            "description": "Hi my name is Clint and I am a 3 year old Shepherd/Cattle dog mix. I am great with female humans but I seem not to like men. I am also very selective with other dogs. I would do best in a dominant breed experienced home and ideally, as an only dog. Ideally I would have female owners in a low activity home as I don\u2019t care much for strangers. I would be an amazing and protective campaign for a single retired mom who could benefit from my temperament. \n\nI must be in a home. Apartment living will not be considered for my adoption. \n\nI love my spa dates at P.A.W.S in Newhall, Love walks. Love being a roadie with my owners. Love getting pets and affection too! I have been dreaming about my own happy ever after. Hope that could be with you! \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nInterested in adopting? If so, please complete an adoption application first at www.delaneysdog.com/adoption-application.html\n\nAll Delaney's Dog adoption fees include :\n-Up-to-date vaccinations\n-Spay/neuter\n-Microchip & microchip registration\n\nThe adoption process requires an initial approved Adoption Application, a home visit to ensure safety and well-being of adoptee & a separate Adoption Agreement.\n\n**Adoption fees vary and are NOT NEGOTIABLE. \n\nNOTE: An Adoption Application does not guarantee an adoption. Adoptions are based on the best possible situation for each dog and their prospective owners. Not all breeds are right for all people and not all people are right for all breeds. Our commitment is to place these animals in the right homes so that they never again have to face re-homing. They deserve a forever family too.\n\nAdditionally, each adoption includes a one week, partial fee refundable, trial period to ensure pet is a right fit.\n\nNO OUT OF STATE ADOPTIONS",

We were fully vetted and adopted out. Unfortunately I came back. You see I am afraid of men. I don't remember why, but it probably has something to do with being dumped.

Litters, pregnant mommies , young dogs , old dogs , injured dogs . You can see it all. Animal control can not keep up and even when we are with 4 German shepherd rescues on that one shelter , we can not keep up.\n\nAisa was one of the lucky ones. When she went on our truck other ones were getting killed . The thin line between life and death .\n\nAisa is a wonderful sweet and calm 3 year old German Shepherd . We had no problems walking her on the leash . For now we would like to have her as pet only .\n\nAisa is looking for a nice family who will treat her like the rare gem she is .\nA family who will love her and spoil her . Where she can forget her past .\n\nAisa is located in Middle ISland NY\n\nTo become her new family please apply today by filling in the  adoption application to find on our website www.a-teameliterescuedogs.com or email is and we send you one .",

Because of the unsuccessful adoption, we have learned more about what Nikko needs to thrive and live a happy life.\n\nIs Nikko a great dog? Yes he is! Will he make an awesome companion? Absolutely! He deserves the chance to shine and to be the wonderful dog he is. \n\nNikko needs to be in a home with no children and no other pets. He is best suited to live with one adult because he is extremely loyal to and protective of his person. But with proper training and patience, he could very well adapt to living in a home with more than one adult. Although he functions well at HSBR when multiple staff members and/or volunteers tend to him, it appears he functions best with one person in a home environment.\n\nNikko prefers staying indoors, but when he goes outside, he needs to be in a fenced yard. He enjoys playing fetch, loves toys and is a big fan of car rides! \n\nIf you are looking for a loyal canine who has so much love to give and will see you as the best thing since sliced bread, then Nikko is definitely for you. He is 3 years old, current on his vaccinations, neutered and microchipped. For more information about Nikko, contact HSBR at (706) 632-4357.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nOnline Adoption Application \nGideon is a 7 year old cuddly boy in search of a good home. He is neutered and up to date on all vaccines, flea and heartworm preventative medication. He is great with children - lives with a 2 year old and a 3 year old and is incredibly patient with their attention. He loves attention and cuddles and regularly sits on people's laps if they are on the floor. He is housebroken. He is not currently crate trained but we are working on it.\n\nGideon is a protector with high anxiety. He goes on high alert when out with his people on walks or car rides. He has been on anxiety medication for 3 years and has some destructive habits when separated from his people. A good home for Gideon would require someone with the patience and knowledge to help him through his anxiety.\n\nHe needs a home with a yard, preferably fenced (high fence - he can jump!) so he can run and roam. He is prey driven and has caught rabbits, snakes and turtles (and tried to catch squirrels and birds). He does well with other dogs when properly introduced and attends doggy daycare occasionally. He was raised with another lab for the first few years of his life and LOVED her - I think he misses having a doggy friend but needs one that is not going to challenge his alpha spot or they may not get along. He has never been around a cat but I would worry about the prey drive in that situation. 2/2/21 4:05 PM",

One of his favorite pastimes is laying on his back with his legs sticking straight into the air. While at the sanctuary, he currently lives with another large breed female and would do best in a similar environment. He loves to be near you while your around in the house but is calm and relaxed while you are out.",

He will need a household with few people that understand he needs patience with strangers . He can NOT be with young children or placed in a home with other animals. We would prefer Oliver go somewhere with a fenced in yard as he will not be good in social settings with strangers. \n\nOliver needs someone that understands him. Someone that will give him time and patience. He does not want to snuggle all the time, and he will growl when he wants to be left alone. He has been here a while now and we would love for him to find his forever home.",

After two major initial surgeries, she went to the same foster home as Mookie. Even though he was only 5 months at the time, his gentleness and care for Victory melted our hearts. Victory had to undergo two additional surgeries. Mookie has been right by her side through all of her recoveries. They have a sweetness for each other that we just can\u2019t separate, and we are adoptiong these two precious puppies as a bonded pair, together. Mookie is a total cuddler and loves to sleep next to his people in bed. He will curl up by you on the couch after a busy day of playing ball and chewing on his bones. He\u2019s a confident, active, energetic pup with the most soulful puppy eyes you ever did see. Victory is also a love bug, with plenty of kisses to give. She\u2019s a sweet, happy girl who wants to please her people. She's a complete darling, and everyone seems to just fall in love with her. Victory has been diagnosed with fibrotic myopathy which is a rare, idiopathic disorder. We officially consider Mookie her emotional support animal! If you\u2019re interested in opening your heart and home to this pair of wonderful pups, we\u2019ll be happy to talk to you further about Victory\u2019s special needs.\n\nWebsite:      http://www.goodshepherdrescuetexas.com/\nFacebook:   https://www.facebook.com/GoodShepherdRescue\nApplication:  https://www.goodshepherdrescuetexas.com/adoption-application\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  We do not respond to Petfinder inquiries with any information about the dogs.

Mable is very loving (I mean, look at that face!) and great with kids. She is house trained and loves to get cuddles and give kisses. Unfortunately Mable is not so great with other dogs and her family feel she would be best suited as the only dog. She just doesn\u2019t want to share her people! Her family would like to find a situation for her that includes a house with a fenced yard and where she will have lots of love and attention. Mable is spayed, vaccinated, chipped and is heartworm negative. Please text Kali at 817-320-3466",

This sweet girl is about 15-24 months old She is partially deaf and has some vision impaired, but that doesn't slow her down. Delilah gets along with other dogs once she has been introduced to them properly. Delilah also does well with kiddos, but the kiddos have to be dog savvy and GDRST recommends children 10 or older.  Delilah also chases cats and a home with no cats is a must. Delilah loves to dress up and loves being in the water. Delilah does want to please her humans and has been out on several social occasions and did very well. Delilah needs a home that can allow her to run off her energy so she can wear herself out.  An active family would be perfect for Delilah. \n\nDelilah will need a home that knows, or is willing to learn, how to communicate with Delilah and the disability that she has. \n\nADOPTION CONTRIBUTION FEE: $217.00 \n\nIn many cases, the cost of vetting services is greater than the adoption contribution. The adoption contributions help defray the costs of vetting services, but rarely, if ever, cover all expenses.   Additional donations are welcomed and appreciated. Please consider making a donation to help offset medical expenses.\nTo  do so, please  visit our website at www.saveadane.org\n\nGDRST will have the following services completed as part of the adoption process. Each animal will be spayed or neutered, fully vaccinated, heartworm tested, heartworm treated if applicable, fecal tested, de-wormed, microchipped, and administered Heartgard.\n\nPlease note GDRST  is an all-volunteer, run by individuals with full-time careers. In order to meet with a Dane that you are interested in, you will need to complete an application. After receiving your application, a volunteer will verify with your vet the care on your current or previous animals. Then, we will contact you to set up a home visit and to discuss which Dane may be a match for you.\n\nGreat Dane Rescue of Southeast Texas \n16516 El Camino Real #402             \nHouston, TX 77062-5723                        \n\nInformation E-mail: info@saveadane.org \n\nAdoption E-mail: adoption@saveadane.org  \n\nWebsite  www.saveadane.org\n\nConnecting Great Danes to Great People \n  \nGreat Dane Rescue of Southeast Texas",

There are four dogs and one cat.\n\nOVERDOG ~ This is the highest level, top dog.  This position is occupied by the dog who has been in the network the longest.\n\nUNDERDOG ~ This is the second-highest position, this dog is second in command and right-hand to the OVERDOG, this position is occupied by the dog who has been in the network second-longest.\n\nCONSIGLIERE ~ This is the advisor or counselor to the OVERDOG. This position is occupied by the dog who has been in the network third-longest. \n\nRING BOSS ~  This is the overseer of the RING LEADERS.  This position is occupied by the dog who has been in the network forth-longest.\n\nEMISSARY ~ This is the only top-level position held by a cat.  The Emissary acts as a diplomat and liaison between the Canine Syndicate, and it's antimatter equivalent, the Feline Syndicate.  This position is held by the cat who has been in the network the longest, outside of the core operatives of the Feline Syndicate.\n\nThe remaining dogs in the network who have been waiting for adoption two or more years are RING LEADERS.  They lead small crews with varying numbers of AGENTS, dogs who have been in the network for less than two years.\n\nRING LEADERS are in line for top-level positions as they become vacant when senior members retire via adoption.\n\n***\n\nPROJECTS\n\nOperation \"Royal Flush\" ~ Initiated August 10th, 2019\n\nThe objective of Operation Royal Flush was to retire all 5 founding core Syndicate operatives no later than 1/1/2020 via adoption. \n\nThe project concluded on 1/1/2020, three out of five core operatives had been adopted, only Smiling Timmie and Slick Rick remained.\n\nHISTORY of ADOPTIONS\n\n1/20/2019 ~Baby Faced FITZ was adopted and has stepped down from his position as Underdog, the vacancy created was filled by the promotion of is mother, Four Stix FARRAH.\n\n12/4/2019 ~ Four on the Floor LUCKY was adopted and has stepped down from his position as Underdog, the vacancy created was filled by the promotion of Baby Faced FITZ.\n\n11/10/2019 ~ Little MARTHA was adopted and has stepped down from her position as Overdog, the vacancy created was filled by the promotion of Smiling TIMMIE.\n\n9/19/2019 ~ Fast LEO was adopted and has stepped down from his position as Underdog, the vacancy created was filled by the promotion of Smiling TIMMIE.\n\n8/21/2019 ~ Big Daddy MAKO was adopted and stepped down from his position as Underdog, the vacancy created was filled by the promotion of Fast LEO.\n\nCURRENT PERSONNEL\n\n1/20/2020 - Present\n\n* Smiling TIMMIE ~ Overdog ~ 7/16/2014 (6 years)\n* 4 Stix FARRAH ~ Underdog ~ 7/31/2016 (4 years)\n* PEARL  ~ Consigliere ~ 9/15/2015 (5 years)\n* BAXTER & BONNIE  ~ Ring Boss & Assistant RB ~ 08/22/2016 (4 years)\n* SLICK RICK ~ Emissary ~ 12/16/2017 (3 years)\n\nFOUNDING MEMBERS - (2013 - 8/21/2019)\n\n* Little MARTHA ~ Overdog ~  7/9/2013 (6 years)\n* Big Daddy MAKO ~ Underdog ~ 7/16/2014 (5 years)\n* Fast LEO ~ Consigliere ~ 9/27/2016 (5 years)\n* Smiling TIMMIE ~ Ring Boss ~ 7/31/2016 (6 years)\n* SLICK RICK ~ Emissary ~ 12/16/2017 (3 years)\n\n***\n\nLINKS: Current Operative Dossiers\n\nSmiling TIMMIE:  https://www.petfinder.com/petdetail/30491049\n\n4 Stix FARRAH:  https://www.petfinder.com/petdetail/31802128\n\nPEARL:  https://www.petfinder.com/petdetail/33292650\n\nBAXTER:  https://www.petfinder.com/petdetail/36019868\n\nBONNIE:  https://www.petfinder.com/petdetail/36019876\n\nSLICK RICK:  https://www.petfinder.com/petdetail/40232941\n\n***\n\nINTERVIEW WITH SLICK RICK - 9/13/2019\n\nThe DAILY BISCUIT\nAA Tabloid News\n\nSPECIAL EDITION - An exclusive interview with Syndicate Emissary, Slick Rick.\n\nRecently, BISCUIT Investigators were approached by Canine Syndicate Consigliere, Smiling Timmie and offered the rare opportunity to interview one of its operatives. \"If we intend to achieve the objectives outlined in Operation Royal Flush by the established deadline of 1/1/2020, some bold moves are in order. We're prepared to grant an interview.\" ~ Smiling Timmie\n\nThe following transcript details that interview.\n\n*** 9/12/2019 - Biscuit Investigator (BI) & Slick Rick (SR) ***\n\nBI: Good morning Mr. Rick, thank you for taking the time to speak with us today.\n\nSR: My pleasure.\n\nBI: Mr. Rick, I'd like to talk to you about Operation Royal Flush. Let's start with your prospects, do you think you will be adopted, and thus able to step down from your position as Emissary by 1/1/2020?\n\nSR: Please, call me Slick.\n\nBI: Sure. So do you feel your prospects for adoption are good Slick?\n\nSR: Absolutely.\n\nBI: Why so?\n\nSR: I'm an asset.\n\nBI: Please explain.\n\nSR: I bring a lot to the table.\n\nBI: Could you expand on that Slick?\n\nSR: Sure. To start, I'm a diplomat, very easy to get along with, a goodwill ambassador if you will. I'm skilled at negotiating and keeping the peace, that's why I'm the Emissary. It's not easy you know, acting as Liaison between the Canine and Feline Syndicates. We're talking about an age-old struggle, the conflict between cats and dogs. Before my Syndicate days though, I was a street hustler, tough, gritty, very resourceful... totally independent, I didn't need help from anyone. Not until the incident anyway.\n\nBI: The incident?\n\nSR: Yeah, that's what actually brought me here to the Animal Alliance Shelter in Lambertville, known as \"HQ\" within the organization. Anyway, I'd been banged up pretty good in a fight, first time I ever had my ass handed to me like that, that was one tough tomcat! I had a nasty head injury and an even nastier infection. Then I started slipping into delirium, didn't know which way was up. When I finally came to my senses, I realized I was in the mysterious and mythical \"Rescue Network\" that I'd always heard about. Until then, I didn't believe the thing even existed. Thought it was just the pipe dream of delusional street cats, coughing and shivering in dumpsters.\n\nBI: Can you tell me more about the Rescue Network?\n\nSR: Okay sure. First, I'll need to acquaint you with the \"Animal People\", we also call them the Guardians. The Guardians are members of the Human Race who protect animal life. The Rescue Network is only one of their many projects.\n\nBI: Are rescue volunteers Guardians?\n\nSR: Yes, as are the adopters.\n\nBI: You inferred that the Animal People were involved in other projects.\n\nSR: Yes, the Animal People have many other projects, but that's for another interview.\n\nBI: What is the Canine Syndicate's connection with the Rescue Network?\n\nSR: Now we're getting into the deep end of the pool. Our organization exists within the Rescue Network, specifically that of Animal Alliance. It began when Little Martha and Big Daddy Mako founded the organization in 2014 when it was beginning to look like they might never be adopted. Then Smiling Timmie and Fast Leo were made in 2016. I arrived at HQ in 2017, it was early 2019 when I was approached by the Syndicate and made Emissary. We all began to realize that there was a growing number of us accumulating within the Network. Clearly, this was not what had been intended by the Animal People. So we came up with a plan, Operation Royal Flush.\n\nBI: Please, continue.\n\nSR: Right. So, we had given ourselves, and those in the same boat, an identity; the Lifers. We were individuals who had remained in the Network for two or more years after rescue, waiting for adoption. The objective of Operation Royal Flush was very specific, to grease the revolving door, get the Lifers adopted and bring in new rescues. Our tactical strategy was to start at the top of the seniority hierarchy and work our way down. We wanted to retire the highest-level operatives of the Syndicate via adoption first, promote the Ring Leaders next in line, and continue turning over the top tier until there were no more Lifers in the Network.\n\nBI: I'm beginning to understand now. The Canine Syndicate was formed by Lifers, and the objective of Operation Royal Flush is to eliminate the Lifers via adoption.\n\nSR: Exactamundo!\n\nBI: Slick, is there anything, in particular, you would like to leave our readers with before we wrap it up?\n\nSR: Yes, the next time you look at the AA adoptable pets list on Petfinder, start on the last page. The individuals you'll see on the last few pages are the Lifers. Every last one of us brings something special to the table and we'd really like the opportunity to show that to you. Believe me when I tell you, there are some once-in-a-lifetime friends to be found on those pages!\n\nBI: Slick, this has been a very informative and enjoyable conversation. Thank you for granting us this interview.\n\nSR: You're very welcome.",

Today, his skin is in great shape, his hair has grown back, and he's a happy guy. Amos is friendly and active. He likes other dogs and would do well in a home where he has a buddy or two. He does require medication to control seizures.\n\nAll dogs are seen by appointment only. Our adoptions include an application, meeting the dog, a home check, and an adoption contract.

Her and her buddy Athena are looking for a home that will work with her to become and amazing dog.  She stays in a crate at night and does great.  She jumps a little so may knock down little kids, but love attention and is sweet as can be. If interested in one of our amazing dogs, please go to www.route66petrescue.org and fill out an application.  All dogs are required to be inside dogs and must have a privacy fence unless otherwise stated.  We do home visits, vet reference, and meet and greets with other animals. We are at Petsmart at 41st and Yale every Saturday from 11-3pm.",

If the owner does not reclaim the dog, then it will be altered and go home after the stray hold period is over. Winnebago County Animal Services only takes one pre-select hold per dog. Dogs at WCAS passed their stray hold time or owner surrendered and currently available for adoption are available on a first-come, first-served basis with an approved application.",

They are featured to showcase some of the wonderful Keeshond foster dogs that have been adopted from Southern California Keeshond Rescue, Inc. (SCKR).\n\nThank your for your interest in adopting a rescue Keeshond. Where are you located? You should contact the Keeshond rescue group that is closest to you and get on their waiting list. If you have not done it yet, be sure to ask for an adoption application, so you can start the adoption process. That way, they can put you on their waiting list and let you know when they get a dog that they think might be a good match for you.\n\nWe limit adoptions to the Southern California area. \n\nAt this time, we do not have adoptable Keeshond rescue dogs who are ready for permanent placement. As we evaluate new fosters for placement, we will consider adoption applications on file to match with each dog's individual needs. \n\nCOVID-19 update: We are closely monitoring the COVID-19 situation and taking it very seriously. At this time, we will be keeping our rescue dogs in their foster homes and suspending home visits and meet and greets until the COVID-19 situation has changed. Please continue to submit adoption applications and we will resume home visits and meet and greets when the Shelter-in-Place directive has passed.\n\nAre you ready to make a lifetime commitment to a Keeshond rescue dog? If you are interested in adopting one of our foster dogs, the first step is to complete an adoption application. Southern California Keeshond Rescue works with potential adopters to find each dog the right forever home. We foster the dogs in the homes of volunteers, who include them as a part of the family. We have all rescue dogs examined by a veterinarian, spayed/neutered, immunized and tested for heart worms. We provide treatment for known illnesses or medical problems on a case by case basis. Visit our website at http://www.foreverkees.org to learn more about our adoption process and to submit your application.\n\nOn behalf of the Keeshonden we serve - thank you for your interest in adopting a Keeshond. We look forward to hearing from you! Please visit our Facebook page too!\n\nSouthern California Keeshond Rescue, Inc. (SCKR).\nwww.foreverkees.org",

Her photos do not do her justice, she\u2019s a \u201cmust see\u201d in person.\n\nGinger was turned in by her person following a scuffle with their other dog and she has displayed food protection so she needs to be an only dog and would appreciate the time and space to finish her meals.\n\nDid someone say \u201cplay\u201d?! Ginger really enjoys her toys and would love someone to play ball with or even go jogging (check out her video where\u2019s she enjoying a good game of Kong keep away). Ginger can be \"a lot of dog\" for a petite/slight person and she responds very well to males (we think she prefers a deeper voice and larger stature but it's a bit of a mystery).\n\nGinger would be the absolute best companion to a single person or a couple that appreciated her as a member of the family. She's been unpredictable around small children so teenage or older would be better suited to her energy. She\u2019s not demanding but does love attention and is quick to learn. Ginger just wants to be loved by someone that is kind and will treat her like the special girl she is.\n\nGinger is fully house trained, spayed, micro chipped, heartworm negative and current on vaccines.\n\nIf a \"forever\" situation is not your thing, perhaps Ginger could hang out with you until her forever person comes along. Fostering would get her out of boarding and into a home routine. \n\nTo apply to foster or meet Ginger for possible adoption please go to our website and fill out an application.\n\nwww.ninjapawsrescue.org\n",

            "description": "Boyd was surrendered to a shelter for killing chickens.  He was born in January of 2018. He came into rescue weighing 67lbs, and is now at a healthy weight, and is reportedly a Great Pyrenees Anatolian Shepherd mix.  \"Anipyrs\" are a nice mix of the two breeds - you get the gentle demeanor of the pyr and the short coat of the Anatolian Shepherd.  Since they are both guarding breeds, socialization and training is important.  Boyd is very gentle, and a little timid with new people at first, but warm up quickly. He is doing great walking on a leash.  Boyd would do best in a home with another dog to play with.  He is unproven around cats.  He also does not like being crated, so someone who works from home, and has time to teach him to be comfortable in a crate at home would be the best fit for him.   His tongue was somehow injured and has a split in it,  but all his teeth are fine.  It does not hinder him from eating.  He would do best in an adult only home; he can be growly with children. We recommend obedience training for all newly adopted dogs, to help you create a special bond with you and your new friend, and so you have a well behaved canine. Great Pyrenees and Pyr mixes are willing to learn, but are not as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds. They are bred to be independent thinkers. Applicants must be over 25, own their own home and all children in household must be over 6 years old. Your resident pets must be up to date on vaccines, sterilized, you must have a good history of vet care for them, and you must have used heartworm preventative year round for your dogs. \n\n\nBoyd will be placed as an inside pet with outside privileges. You MUST have a 6' securely fenced yard accessible from your home. Invisible fencing does not work with this breed and they will take the shock for the freedom.  Boyd can get out of a 4' fenced yard.  He would also be eligible as a walk only dog, meaning he is walked for exercise and potty time.  Great Pyrenees are bred to roam and will create their own territory if not secured, which can led to them being lost, hit by vehicles or shot by people who see them as a threat. The breed is not a good off leash dog, and cannot be trusted to not run away.  A Great Pyrenees off leash is a \" DisAPyr.\" \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please complete the appropriate application on our website, www.igpr.org under the Adopt tab. \n\nAll of our dogs marked as needing foster homes are also available for adoption.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nOnline Adoption Application \n\n**Please read the full bio for Cooper ** Meet Cooper. Isn't he handsome? The pictures are great but honestly don't do him justice of just how handsome he is. He is 60 pounds of smushy gray fur with a white-tipped tail, paws, & belly. He has the cutest little underbite. Cooper is looking for his forever home - one who is dedicated to just Cooper as he needs to be the only pet in the home. Cooper is housetrained & crate trained - he enjoys a treat-filled kong or bone while chilling on his bed. Recently he hasn't needed to be crated (his foster mom does remove things that would be tempting to chew in his space). He is a smart boy - in his first home, he completed quite a bit of training. He can sit, leave it, lay down, recall, & stay! He is a strong boy & needs an experienced handler that will work on his manners & leash skills. In his original home, Cooper lived with 10 & 12 year-old boys from the time he was 8 weeks old until he was 11 months old & he loved them very much. He is both active AND chill - he likes to lie down beside you as well as run & do the zoomies in the yard. Chasing a ball or stick is his favorite pastime. When he is done, he's ready to lounge. A DNA test was done which says he is a mixture of Labrador Retriever, American Staffordshire Terrier, hound, & Chinese Shar Pei.If Cooper is so amazing, why was he returned to the rescue? Cooper was loved & cared for from the time he is adopted at 8 weeks of age until he had to return to the rescue at 11 months of age. He was adopted into a home with a 2 year-old dog who was also a Pawfect Match dog. She loved him as a puppy, but gradually indicated that she no longer wanted another dog to live with her, as she would prefer to be the queen of the castle. They both had high energy play styles & a few play sessions became too escalated & difficult to break up, with neither dog relenting. Cooper didn't take kindly to being told no by her, & continued to assert himself. She then didn't take kindly to being ignored. It caused a stressful situation for both dogs. Because of this, we have decided Cooper needs to be the only pet in a furever home.\nCooper needs to know he has a place to be calm & that no other dogs might get in his business. He is not going to be a candidate for a dog park or doggie daycare. It would put him an unpredictable situation, undoing the confidence, training, & self control that are important to his success.\n***Cooper is the 'pawfect' match for a household with no other pets looking for a wonderful, housetrained dog with so much to offer. Cooper needs a home with a true FENCED yard (with a wooden privacy fence) so that he can burn off the young dog energy & play in an environment without the ability to get into trouble. Although Cooper has received a great deal of training, he will need an adopter who will commit to ongoing training. Could You be that 'pawfect' match? Could you be the furever home for Cooper?",

He is leggy guy who is around 65 pounds. He is a sweet boy who loves to give his foster human a hug. He is house-trained, neutered & up to date on all vet care. Tarzan is a bit anxious so he needs time to warm up to strangers, especially men. Patience and love will be the key for Tarzan - & a bit of medication (Fluoxetine aka Prozac - he takes this daily & does better on it than off). He doesn't love being in a crate so needs patience with that as well & would prefer to not be in one. He does not use one in his foster home. He does well with other dogs although they aren't a necessity - he has loved playing with the dogs in his foster home & previously enjoyed going to a dog park in his first home. He also did pretty well at doggie daycare. The staff at the daycare described him as cautious at first, but loving, & eventually opened up. Tarzan needs a furever family who is patient & dedicated to him, even with his eccentricities, for all of his life - dedicated to his shy nature, dedicated to seeking training & to whatever his care entails. An ideal home for Tarzan would be on the quieter side...one with a human who is home quite a bit...a fenced yard would be great - he isn't ultra-energetic but likes the safety of a yard. He has completed some training & his general manners are pretty good. Tarzan is a loving boy who enjoys snuggles & belly rubs. Could YOU be his pawfect match?",

He doesn't show well with strangers, but transitioned well and quickly into the shelter with all his new people friends.  He is a large dog with lots of energy.   He has lived with young children and we are told he lived successfully with cats and did o.k. with other respectful dogs, but was nervous at first.  We have not tested him ourselves with cats or children, and have only experienced him between a fence line with other dogs, which he enjoys to run the fence line with.  \n\nTucker is neutered, microchipped, and completed vaccinated.  He tested negative for all tick-borne illnesses, as well as negative for heartworm disease.  \n\nTucker loves to see all his human friends come in on shift to let him out and love him up.  He really loves people, but does get scared around new people at first due to lack of socialization during the first year of his life.  Some regular socialization will help him get past this behavior.  He is a big strong fella who requires an active home.",

            "description": "\nPLEASE NOTE: We will only be adopting Shey Shey to a local family as she needs to stay close so that we can offer assistance with her acclimating to her new home/enviornment.\n\n \"Shey Shey\" is one of our \"Three Little Bears\".  She is now almost a year old and is a Shepherd mix.  At only 2-weeks old, she and her litter mates were found near a river trapped in a fishing net and were dying.  Thanks to the dedication and love of our local Veterinarian \"Shey Shey\" survived and is with us today in all her glory.\n\nShey Shey has a very introverted personality.  She is shy and slow to meet new people.  Once you sit with her and she has a chance to meet you on her terms, she is an absolute love pie.  She loves to cuddle and she loves to stay close.  She will do best in a calm household with human companions that have a more introverted personality. She gets along well with most dogs and really needs to have a dog companion in her new home. She is a great size at around 40 pounds.\n\nShey Shey needs a home without younger children, and definitely no cats.\n\nMost of our dogs require a fully fenced yard, this does depend on the individual dogs needs and safety requirements.  \n\nOur dogs are fed a nutrient rich dog food named NutriSource.  Our experience is a high quality dog food keeps vet bills down and well-being high.\n\nIf you have any questions please email: claudiaatwag@gmail.com\n\nVisit our website to fill out an Adoption Application  http://www.wagsequimwa.com\n\nAdoption donation fee $350  (Please understand this adoption donation goes towards helping all the dogs we rescue)",

To learn about fostering dogs like Love Bug, please contact us at http://www.dogsxlrescue.org/volunteer/foster\n\nName: Love Bug\n\nBreed: Boerbel/Bulldog/Bullmastiff Mix \n\nApproximate Age: 2 years\n\nApproximate Weight: 95 pounds\n\nCurrently Living at: Local Foster\n\n \nMeet Love Bug! Love Bug is a very sweet and affectionate mastiff mix. To be precise, LB's DNA test revealed that she's 75% Boerboel, 12.5% standard Bulldog and 12.5% Bullmastiff!\n\nBug has a super cute tail nubbin and her whole body wiggles when she's happy, which is nearly all of the time! She\u2019s looking for a family who would love to take her on a hike or out for a swim (there\u2019s nothing cuter than a Love Bug splashing about, rolling in the sand and surf!) Love Bug adores other dogs, but isn't always great at taking their cues when they're done playing, so she would do best with another playful dog and a dog-savvy adopter who can help her learn how to play appropriately. \n\nThis darling girl is strong, and definitely needs some basic manners and leash training. She is also a typical mastiff and would do best with a very experienced adopter who's familiar with guardian breeds as she can be fear reactive to strangers (especially men) and exhibits some guarding behaviors. Bug is muzzle trained for everyone's safety and would love an adopter who will continue to work with her to teach her that strangers aren't as scary as she thinks, and who will manage introductions very safely. Bug is an eager student and excited to learn! If you give her your heart, she promises to be a loyal companion for years to come.\n\nBug needs a home with no young children, and she is not a good fit for a family with cats. Ask us about Love Bug today!\n\nLove Bug needs a foster or a loving forever home to lavish love and attention on her. Please open your heart and home to Love Bug!\n\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $300, which includes the cost of heartworm treatment and routine vetting, including vaccinations and spay/neuter.\n\n \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the application online at http://www.dogsxlrescue.org/adopt/adoption-questionnaire\n\n \n\nThank you for considering adoption and helping to save a life!\n \n\nPlease visit us online at www.DogsXLRescue.org",

He loves to chase the squirrels and pretend he is a hunting dog when outside. Scooby will run right into an outdoor kennel if you have one as he thinks it is his personal outdoor safe place. He really enjoys standing on top of his dog house and pretending he is a junk yard dog.

            "description": "We are looking for a very special adopter or foster for Sage. Sage is a 2 year old, 60lb American bulldog mix of sorts. When she originally came to us from the shelter she had a terrible case of pneumonia and as she began to heal we quickly discovered there was more than what met the eye with her. Sage was diagnosed with diabetes shortly after and has finally reached a point where her glucose is regulated with proper care. Caring for Sage\u2019s diabetes is easy, she receives two insulin injections a day and eats a prescription diet. Her insulin is roughly $35 every other month and her prescription food is around $130 monthly from Chewy. \n\nSage absolutely loves all humans and wants nothing more than to go for a short walk before cuddling up on the couch for the long night of binging Netflix. Sage is good with children and is very gentle. Sage had been thought not to like other dogs but has been working on forming a friendship with the calm dog in her foster home. Given the right amount of time, she may be able to live with another calm, older dog, but cannot be with cats. \n\nSage is looking for the perfect forever home or even a foster home without other animals. Could that be with you! Diabetes is easy to manage and we would be able to answer any questions you might have!",

She has been in our foster system for a year, due to aggression issues.  She is near-sighted, and cannot see things at a distance.  Once she learns to trust you, she is a real sweetheart who loves belly rubs.  But this takes time.  She is not good with strangers and if approached by someone she doesn\u2019t know, she will bite.  She needs someone who has the love, patience and experience to bring her around.  She would not do well with young children, and would best fit into a quiet home.  If you feel you could work with this little girl and give her a permanent, loving home, please apply at oarwny.org\n",

She really would love a home where she got to spend her time being with her person.  She is very sweet and loving.  Pepper is also very playful and loves to run around the yard playing with her toys and the other dogs!  She is a lot of fun.  \n\nPepper would like a home where she has active owners who will play with her, rub her belly, and spend time with her.  She would do best with another male dog her size as she doesn't do well when left alone but does better when left with a dog friend.  Pepper lives with older kids and does great with them (age 7-12).   She lives with a female and a male dog but does much better with the male dog.  \n\nPepper is crate, leash, and house trained.\n\nPepper is spayed, microchipped, and current on her vaccines.  Her adoption fee is $175.  \n\nIf you would like to adopt Pepper and make her a part of your family, please contact ForeverYoursOKC@gmail.com.",

I\u2019m loyal, love my people, friendly with strangers. I love to go places and do things. I\u2019m also a good jogging buddy. \nI\u2019m working toward my canine good citizen certification. \n\nI prefer to be in a home without small children. I don\u2019t like to be messed with when laying down. However if you ask me to get up I will and will be fine. \n\nI have some trouble with my eyes. My eyes can\u2019t make their own tears. I need eye drops 3 times a day when given I also need a moisturizer within 10 mins. I\u2019m perfectly tolerant of handling and fussing with my eyes.\n\nI will require strong leadership and dedication to my eyes.",

Bandit is a very handsome 8 year old male who came to us last year sadly after his elderly owner passed away.\n\nBandit is currently in boarding hoping that he will again find someone to love him. Bandit will benefit from structure and routine in a patient home while he can learn to trust again. An active adult only home where he can get the exercise and stimulation he needs is required. Due to his love of chasing squirrels, a cat free home is needed, and it would be best if he were the only child.\n\nBandit has been waiting patiently for his new home. If you would like to give this beautiful boy his second chance, please contact us!\n\nBandit is current on all shots, neutered and has tested negative for heartworm. He will be professionally groomed before adoption and will go home with a new leash and collar.\n\nTo apply: 1. You must reside within our adoptable states: NY, NJ, CT, RI, MA, VT, NH, PA, DE, MD, VA 2. AND you MUST submit our online application, please\n\nCLICK HERE\n\nor copy & paste this link:\n\nhttp://www.nyabandonedangels.com/adopt-or-foster-application",

Meet Romeo!!!!\n\nRomeo is a ten year, 55 lbs. lab hound mix that adores everyone. Romeo lived his whole life in paradise (Kauai, Hawaii). Sadly his Mom got sick and had to leave the Island for her medical care and couldn't take Romeo with her. As a senior dog on a small Island, Romeo was quickly euth listed by the shelter. When we were alerted to Romeo's situation, Romeo's travel arrangements were quickly made. Romeo had his senior work up done and his lumps removed (just big fatty masses, not cancerous per the biopsy) and is now ready to find a forever home. Romeo is house trained, leash trained, crate trained, rides well in the car, knows some basic commands, gets along well with people and dogs (with proper introductions) and wants nothing more than to please everyone he meets. He's the perfect blend of long walks and cuddling on the couch and is the market for a loving family that will cherish him through his golden years. Could that family be yours? Email dogs@labradorsandfriends.org or fill out our online application at www.labradorsandfriends.org. Romeo is located in Southern California.",

In his first couple of years this bashful boy was not often exposed to every day life situations, if at all and perhaps he was even a stray at some point. \n\nSince arriving at TVR, he has become more confident and secure in his surroundings. He genuinely loves to play with the other dogs and feels much safer in their presence and with a pack. He is becoming more comfortable when interacting with people but it still takes a long time for him warm up to new people. In spite of his fears, he does know how to walk on leash and seems to be reasonably house-trained although accidents can occur during any new and/or stressful situation.\n\nLinus belongs in a home with at least one other dog who is super friendly and confident to take the lead and show him the way. He will benefit from an outgoing counterpart that will help him find his courage. His human can help soothe Linus by brushing him (he loves it) and filling his dog bed with cozy blankets before tucking him into bed. \n\nWe are not 100% sure what incident occurred to make the world an intimidating place for Linus, but we know in our hearts that with the right person by his side and the security of a home he will learn to feel safe and at ease. He will finally be able to take a breath and live a happy peaceful life which he deserves. \n\nAre you ready to give this sweet, gentle and shy boy the home he has been waiting so patiently for?\n\n\n*HEARTWORM UPDATE: Linus has completed his heart worm treatment and is ready to go to his new home! It is very important for Linus to be kept on a monthly Heartworm preventative (such as Heartgard Plus) and not miss a dose. Linus will need to be taken to the adopters primary vet in 9 months (approximately June 10th, 2021) to be retested for Heartworm Disease.",

Alexander was rescued as a puppy from the shelter.  \n\nAlexander is a very sweet boy who does great meeting new people.  Alexander would like a home where he has a yard to run and play in.  He will need a family willing to give him lots of love and affection and playtime.  He will need a 6ft fence as he's very athletic and can jump a shorter fence especially because he'd be motivated to do so by other passing dogs.  \n\nAlexander does live with another dog currently in his foster home but does struggle meeting new dogs.   If introduced properly, Alexander is good with other dogs however he gets a little overwhelmed in a large play group of dogs so wouldn't do well at the dog park or a multi-dog household.   Alexander is very reactive on the leash to other dogs but has no problem with people. For this reason, he would do best with an experienced owner. \n\nAlexander is house trained. He does not love his crate but he is working on that in his foster home and will need continued work in his forever home.  He currently sleeps in his crate and is crated when left. \n\nAlexander is neutered, microchipped, and current on his vaccines.  His adoption fee is $175.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Alexander and make him a part of your family, please contact ForeverYoursOKC@gmail.com.",

You'll catch her zooming around the yard, romping with her doggie friends, and playing fetch. Coco also appreciates cuddles with her humans.\nThough Coco has a clean bill of health, you may notice the bump on her cheek. Coco has visited multiple veterinarians and they all concur that the bump is from a previous trauma. They also indicated that because it doesn't bother her, they dont recommend unnecessary cosmetic surgery. She has had a biopsy and confirmation that it is NOT cancer. Though we will never know what Coco experienced, we know her future forever family will love her just the way she is.\nCoco is too interested in cats, so no meow meows. She would do great in a home with or without another dog. Children 10+.\nTo meet her, call (530) 824-1985. You can also submit an application at http://www.secondchancepetrescue.org/adopt/",

He is a young guy with tons of energy and strong. Smart as a whip, he loves to keep busy and learn new things. He will thrive in a home that provides him with structure and commits to his training.\n\nLogan is learning to live with structure and limits. He has developed certain ideas of what behavior is appropriate. Our volunteers are spending time teaching him that he does not get to be in charge. Check out one of his training videos!\n\nPlease go to our website and complete an adoption application at:\n\n/https://www.gsroc.org/application/\n\nAn adoption counselor will contact you to go over your application and assist you in determining which dog may be best for your particular situation.",

She was in a local shelter after wandering the streets on a very hot summer day. Mitzi is blind and deaf and will protest loudly if she doesn\u2019t know where you are. She startles easy, so gentle touch is a must to show her you are near.  She is very silly and active for an older gal. Mitzi loves belly rubs and will roll around on the sofa to get some. Mitzi will do well in a quiet environment with` no toddlers or kids under 7.  I think she also needs a furry companion to help be her eyes and give her comfort when her family is not home.  Please consider giving this girl a loving home to spend the rest of her years in. Seniors are the best! \n\nPictures soon\n",

He wound up in a small town shelter and lucky for him, we were notified.   Scooter came to us with back end issues and when we got him to our vet it was discovered he had a broken pelvis. This is not a new injury and he must  have been in great pain when the break happened.  Because of this Scooter has mobility issues and has to have his bladder expressed several times a day and doesn\u2019t know when he has to poop. He is such a sweetheart and it breaks our heart to think that no one will want to adopt him. Thanks to some pug angels, Scooter will be getting a cart and we can\u2019t wait to see him wheel around the yard. Please consider giving this sweet boy a real forever home. He deserves the best life has to offer!!",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Stormy. I am almost 9 years old and spent 8 of those years in a commercial breeding facility where it was my job to have lots and lots of puppies. One day last year, some nice people came and took me on a really long ride to a place called a foster home. I had never been anywhere before and everything was so different and new - wow, was I scared! When I got there, I saw a doctor who said that I had something called heart worm disease and would need treatment. So I had to stay very quiet and calm for a few months. But I was a very good girl and now all the heart worms are gone and I'm healthy! Foster mom says that I'm a very calm and gentle girl. Foster mom says that she can't wait to see my true personality and inner Shibatude emerge now that I'm healthy and can hang out with the other dogs. For now, I am pretty shy and still learning that I can trust humans. Loud noises and sudden movements are particularly frightening to me, so I would do best in a quiet home without small children. My foster family has been trying to teach me to walk on this thing called a leash, but I really just don't understand it. So it would be best if my forever home has a securely fenced yard. When I first got to my foster home, I was pretty shy about going potty, especially outside with all of the strange scary noises. So my foster parents taught me to use potty pads inside so I didn\u2019t have accidents! Now that I am brave enough to be off the leash In the yard more, I\u2019m learning that I don't have to be quite as shy about doing my business out there! I really like my foster siblings a lot, especially the little puppy that lives here too. It would be great if my forever home had another dog to help show me the ropes! If you live in the midwest and are interested in adopting me, please visit www.savingshibas.com/adopt for more information and to dowload an application to become approved as an adopter.",

She  loves,  people, car rides and adventures. Playful  and  plays  well  with dogs  her  size. She loves water.     Her favorite thing is to swim with her human. \n   It is obvious her previous home did not give  her  training  and  she  will  need the  basics in all areas. \n    The  good  thing about Harper, \n \u2022she is  intelligent  and  catches on quickly.     \n \u2022Loves  to please  and  will  work for rewards.  \n \u2022 Very athletic  and  would  make  a great  running companion.  Plenty of energy to keep up. \n \n   Harper is treadmill trained for those days it is just to hot outside. \nFor the little  bit  of  training  effort  you will need  to invest  you will have  years  of loyal companionship.  \n\nHarper  is  ready  for  her new  home.  \n\nThe adoption fee is $250. and  includes being vaccinated, spayed  and microchipped. \n \n\n We  prefer  she is not placed  in a household with smaller  dogs  and cats.  She is  good  with  children  but does  not  like  sudden quickness  in her  direction  so  we  think  she  needs  to be in a  home  with children who are good with dogs,  10 and older.  \n\nfor any questions or  a meet  and greet.\n      \u2022\u2022\u2022Please inquire by text \u2022\u2022\u2022\n           at 661-809-5555",

At only 2 years old, it is apparent that she had never learned to properly interact with humans or other animals. Peach is incredibly dog social, but she sometimes has difficulty reading other dog's play cues. She also has possession aggression with other dogs and due to guarding tendencies, we feel she would do best in a quiet home as an only dog. She has passed a preliminary cat test. She walks well on a leash but does not like to meet other dogs while leashed due to barrier issues. She is kennel trained, however, she has weather phobia and will try to escape her crate to be near her people. Peach is in need of a 6 foot privacy fence as she is capable of climbing a 6ft chain link fence. Given her trust issues and collar sensitivities, we feel she would be best in a home with older or no children. Peach is wanting to find that perfect family who is willing to take a chance on a young broken soul and give her the time and space she needs to build up trust. Once she trusts you, she will reward you with loyal companionship, a strong bond, the absolute best snuggles in the world.",

I'm kid friendly, I enjoy both snuggling and being lazy and going for walks and jogs, and I love running playing with my non-dominant doggie pals! I'm also a great jumper and climber so a 6 foot privacy fence would be best for me! Also did I mention I'm super smart? I'm kennel- and house-trained and I know sit, down, come, and wait. Speaking of waiting... I'm still waiting for my furever family!

Treatment is controversial in asymptomatic dogs. The symptoms are weakness and collapsing. \n\nPerferred Home : Only dog or a home that will keep her separate from their other pets \n\nJackie had a rough few months. She had serious complictions during labor and ended up having to have a c-section. Unfortunately not all of her babies survived. Thankfully though she came through without any lasting complications and her puppies are thriving. She has been selective with other dogs but it could be because she has been protective due to the puppies. She would love to find a foster or forever home.",

She loves to cuddle, will be your shadow, she's happiest when everyone is in their chill spot so she can choose who she will cuddle with. Her ideal home would have few humans and no other dogs.

He is a big, strong boy and is not the \"perfect dog because he does have some quirks, but due to his past we can completely understand. He really is such a lovable GOOD BOY.\n\nGunner was found abandoned left chained in a back yard starving day after miserable day. While at the shelter he was incredibly fearful and reactive through the kennel bars but once out just wanted to be loved, we couldn't walk away and leave him to die alone and afraid. He does have some barrier reactivity (when there is a leash, kennel, fence) with dogs, but is dog friendly in his day-to-day life. He loves kids and in his previous adoptive home, before he was returned, was BFFs with a blind kitten. \n\nGunner needs 6 foot privacy fence. He knows several commands, walks ok on a leash, and is a super snuggly boy. And also has really funny zoomies. And as you can see...he has a GREAT smile.",

Sometimes she can get a little spooked with men and need a little bit to warm up to them .She would do best in a home with older children so they scare her or pull on her. We dont know what her life was like prior to coming into our care but she needs to be an only dog and isnt a fan of other dogs or cats. This girl is just looking for the special family who will give her time and patience to let her get comfortable and settle in. She deserves a couch to lay on and get snuggles everyday! Could you be that perfect home for her!",

He will remind you, you're never too old or big to be a lap dog. Will take all the love and scritches/kisses you can provide, and will return them if you let him. Due to his dislike of squirrels, Skipper does require 6 ft fencing or higher; he doesn't mind the human or dog neighbors, but will definitely protect your home from squirrels. \n\nFor your viewing pleasure: Skipper, aka Skipperdoo, aka Mr. Skip, aka Hey Handsome. \nPS, this kid and his smile will melt your heart.\nPSS, this dude is house/kennel/leash trained and trained in healing & stealing hearts",

If you are outside of this area please do a search for your local GSP/GWP/Pointer rescue group.\n\n--------\n\nI'm Viva's second born, so I'm Lara, formerly known as Baby Girl 2!  My birthday is 5/28/2019 (4:32 am).  I'm growing up nicely and am ready for my new home, just like my siblings.  I'm very special and very busy.  There's so much for me to see and learn and do.  I love playing with my buddies inside and outside.  I have a blast in the pool and climbing mountains in the yard.  I'm a girl so I'm a bossy little thing.  I'm the smallest of the pack but I'm definitely feisty.  I'm going to be a spectacular, loving and adventurous companion.\n\nYou can see more about my story on the Utah's Perfect Pointers facebook page:  https://www.facebook.com/pg/UtahsPerfectPointers/photos/?tab=album&album_id=2441619882523003\n\n---------\n\nGENERAL APPLICATION NOTES:\n\nWe strongly urge adopters to consider a male canine companion if they already have a female GSP/GWP. We get asked several times a year to take in one member of a 2-female GSP family because there are control issues between their girls that result in pretty ferocious fights. Interestingly that never happens among males. Go figure.\n\nDogs under 2 years of age need to go to a home with another well-socialized canine companion of a similar size (when grown) and within a few years of the pup\u2019s age. This is how they maintain and continue their learning/socialization process. Socialization outside the home is important but doesn\u2019t replace the in-home learning that is so important as the pup ages. https://www.facebook.com/ UtahsPerfectPointers/posts/ 1460968517254816\n\nMost older dogs aren\u2019t interested in having a puppy incessantly chewing on it and demanding attention. If you live outside of the Salt Lake area and are sure that your older dog just loves puppies, please arrange a visit at your home with a 2-4 month old pup for a couple of hours and make sure that your older dog feels the same way about this that you do. Please video the interactions and send it to us.\n\nJust a word of caution........ most pointer types need jobs. Otherwise they're not good pets. They need to be able to utilize their brains and no amount of exercise without a \"work\" or \"thinking\" component is adequate. The job doesn't need to be hunting. But it does need to be something that satisfies their genetic predispositions - nose work, agility, tracking, dock diving, etc. The job cannot just be obedience. If they can't use their innate senses they're just never going to be the dog you want for the next 15 years.\n\nAs far as other breeds go, the pointers are generally good with most other breeds with the exception of the Arctic breeds and bulldogs. I'm not sure why, but if there's ever an altercation in daycare between a UPP dog and another dog, it's generally one of those two breeds. It may be the difference in energy levels. It may be some ancient behavior we know nothing about...... Not sure.\n\nUtah's Perfect Pointers is a very small rescue group and doesn't have the resources to adopt to states except for the ones noted above. If you are interested in adopting a GSP please contact the closest groups below.

            "description": "NO KIDS FENCE REQUIRED\n\nBagel may look like a super sweet dog, but he has some major behavior issues and resource guards people and other dogs on occasion. He MUST have an experienced dog owner who knows how to handle dogs with behavior issues. A dog trainer or behaviorist would be best. You cannot have him in a corner where he feels that he has no way out or he will growl, bark and show his teeth and it will scare you. He has been living with a dog trainer for over a year now and has gotten adopted several times and he was always returned because the adopters could not handle his personality. At his current foster home he does really well and has minimal issues but that took a good amount of time. If you are willing to put in the work you'll get back a hilariously animated, very goofy, super handsome, and personable dog. Bagel is crate trained, house broken, a mild puller on walks, has no major medical issues or medication, and can be surprisingly good with guest visitors. Right now, he lives with a dog trainer, another adult and 3 dogs. Bagel's favorite activities include walks, playing with his dog friends, and hanging out in the yard. Bagel's ideal home has one or two adults, has confident active dogs to play and interact with, a yard, plus patient and experienced dog owners.\n\nPlease do not fill out an application for Bagel unless you have thoroughly read and understand this bio and his issues. We know he is cute but that doesn't mean he would be an easy dog to handle in your home. We do want what is best for Bagel and the right fit for your home. and that is why we are being completely honest with what he needs. Absolutely no kids and no cats.\n\nBagel is part of our monthly special! His adoption fee is only $100!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Bagel, complete the Adoption Application on our website at www.NeedyPaws.org and we will contact you. Adopters must live within an hour's drive of St. Louis, MO.\n\nBagel 's adoption fee is $100.00, which includes up-to-date vaccinations, heartworm testing and preventative, spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are a 100% foster-based rescue and all of our dogs live in approved foster homes. We are dedicated to finding the best Forever Homes, and will perform home visits and conduct veterinarian and reference checks for each potential adopter. 2/2/21 5:36 PM",

            "description": "PLEASE READ THIS GUY'S DESCRIPTION!! \nAs of 12/31/2020, Shorty is still looking for his forever home.\nShorty is not a first-time hybrid owner kinda guy, he has to have a highly knowledgeable owner with a wolf proof enclosed to be able to qualify to adopt him. We don't want to see anyone or their pets get hurt or to see Shorty run off and get hurt himself. As of 05/03/2020, our dear Shorty turned 1-year old and is still with us. We have tried a few placements, fosters, and adopters but none have worked and he has been returned every time. He is trying out to be the alpha male so would work well with other large female dogs but will fight with other males and could do serious harm to smaller dogs. Very independent, headstrong, intelligent, and well mattered once he gets to know and trust a person. He will listen and mind you once he trusts you but he does have that wolf personality and attitude so trust is going to take a lot of time and patients. We're definitely wanting an owner that has a lot of knowledge working with and owning wolfdogs. He is a Siberian Husky Wolf Hybrid mix so he can be hardheaded and stubborn at times. He's large and strong so he may not do well with kids he will mow them over if they get in his way. Also would not advise leaving him unsupervised around any small animal including smaller dogs these are prey and snacks to him. He will need to be on a mix of kibble and loads of raw meats and is very high energy so lots of exercises are advised to keep him out of trouble. You're welcome to email the shelter for any other info.",

We save lives thanks to people all over the metro Saint Louis area opening their homes to dogs in need. \n\nWe are ALWAYS seeking foster homes for dogs so we can continue to save lives. The rescue provides what you need to take care of the dog. Crate, food, vetting, necessary medications, etc. The foster period can last a few weeks to a few months depending on the dog. Our goal is to match you with a dog that fits your household to make it the best possible experience for you. \n\nHave questions about the process?

She is very alert to everything around her and will follow you around the house to keep track of where her people are going. She loves her toys and bones but does not like to share - we don't blame her for that! She does allow her humans to take them away from her nicely.\n\nEdie lives with two other dogs and she does fine. They are not best friends but they like to co-exist with one another. The other dogs have learned to give Edie her space. She is crate and house trained (but prefers to not be in her crate). She knows her basic commands and loves puzzle toys!\n\nEdie does have DCM and gets medication twice a day. She also gets fish oil and CBD oil supplements for her joints to keep her young and moving! Edie would love a forever home to spend her golden years with!\n\nThis fabulous foster is a Doberman Rescue Minnesota foster dog.\n\nPlease read all adoption steps and policies carefully on our website. http://dobermanrescueminnesota.com/adoption-steps/\n\nQualified adopters are within the approved adoption area, and Adopter will be requested to visit this foster dog at the foster family home. Our foster families are generally located within a 250 mile radius of Minneapolis, MN.\n\nAll DRM dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, health checked, microchipped, 4DX tested, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention. 2/2/21 5:36 PM",

When you meet her, miss June Bug will nuzzle her head up to you and give you all the kisses. Because she loves to be center of attention, June Bug would be best as an only dog.\n\nApprox DOB: 7/2011\n\n\n--\nThe first step in meeting any of our animals is to fill out an application at halliehill.com.",

Also bonus- take a look at her DNA results! Her results suggest she should be much bigger, but this petite girl is a mere 58 lbs.\n**Reminder** We are facilitating adoptions by appointment ONLY. If you arrive at the shelter without an appointment we will not be able to accommodate you. Thank you for your understanding.\nPlease call the shelter 516-869-6311 during working hours (Mon. to Fri. 9AM-4PM; Sat. 10-4PM) for more information about Sally, the adoption process at the shelter and to confirm availability.

And by the time a wonderful woman and her husband found them Emma and Ruby's paws were swollen, red and blistered. We don't even know where they gathered the energy. Their bones could easily be counted. They acted like they'd never eaten a meal in their lives. They were terribly neglected physically. Medical complications arose because of their neglect but the Good Samaritan who found these babies hung in with them. And we mean hung in! It isn't always convenient to be a Good Samaritan. A person who sees a pet in need and decides they can't turn their back. But the payoff for the heart ... well, you can't put it into words but you can sure put it into pictures. Look at Emma and Ruby now! <3\n\nThe only thing better than this amazing picture of these darling sisters is that last picture we can't wait to post. The day they find their forever home! Ruby and Emma are approximately 4 years old around 58 pounds. They've done amazingly well with the other dogs and they are just wonderful with humans. Love kept these two sisters together and maybe that hope and prayer of a forever family is what kept them going. <3 <3 \n\nTo adopt write to: adoptions@shamrockpets.com (Louisville, Ky Local)\n\ncc 08/0`/2019\n\n",

I have fostered her for over a year. \n\nWanda is a petite lil shepherd/husky.  she may look more shepherd but she acts more husky LOL. She is super sweet. She is very smart and extremely trainable.  It's clear that nobody took the time to teach her anything. But she's learning and will only get better with consistency. Fully vetted.\n\nThere is no \u201cfixing\u201d Wanda.  We need an angel who will love her as she is and care for her for the rest of her life.\n\nWanda is lots of fun! She loves being outside and chasing a ball. She will bring it right to your feet and patiently wait. She needs a yard to run and play and people who will love hanging out with her. When play is done, she loves to snuggle!\n\nShe is being fostered in the Jefferson City area\n",

We asked for a consult at the University of Missouri, but it was cancelled when the pandemic hit. \n\nBecause Wanda was exhibiting all symptoms of EPI, I ordered an EPI test kit. It was not an absolute definitive positive result, but felt we needed to try something.  So, Wanda got started on enzymes, and after just two weeks, there was marked improvement!  There were some hiccups along the way, and we just felt there was still an issue.  When the University called to reschedule the appt from spring, we jumped on the chance to have Wanda looked at by a GI specialist.  Wanda had lab work and urinalysis,  her EPI test wasn\u2019t redone - everything came back normal.  Now we were really scratching our heads.  If not EPI, then what?\n\nWe were encouraged to follow up with the University\u2019s internal medicine dept. on 10/29.  They did an MRI and x-ray.  Wanda definitely has a congenital defect (on the outside and inside).  Wanda\u2019s colon is larger than it should be.  Also, where her pelvis and spinal cord meet is compressed.  Her x-rays definitely do not look like regular x-rays.  The vet could see that Wanda\u2019s intestines were full of feces.  She had issues that she was not able to empty her bowels which explains why she was always trying to go.  The vet started her on lactulose and a compound medication (both liquid) to be given twice daily.  The vet prescribed her hydrolyzed food which will help her with digestion.  The vet also said there\u2019s minimal nerve function.\n\n\n",

            "description": "Moose was found as a stray in a ditch in rural Indiana.  We estimate him to be about 3 years old.  While at the shelter, he bonded quickly with some of the staff, but not others, making him unadoptable based on their requirements.  We had an experienced Great Pyrenees \"Pyrent\" meet with Moose to assess him, who noted the shelter environment was extremely stressful for him, and that being in a foster home would be a better test of his personality. He felt he was a good dog, who needed some structure, and that he was a typical young male Great Pyrenees.  Moose has made himself right at home in his foster home.  He is very loving with his foster family, loves to play with the resident dogs and is well behaved with them.  He is crate trained too, but does not need to be crated when you are gone.   Moose gets along well with their cat also.  He rides well in cars.  If you are looking for a snuggle buddy, Moose is the boy for you!  He would probably do best in a household with adults only, and supervision with children is always recommended when a dog is present.  We recommend obedience training for all newly adopted pyrs, to help you create a special bond with you and your new friend, and so you have a well behaved canine. Great Pyrenees are willing to learn, but are not as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds. They are bred to be independent thinkers. Applicants must be over 25, own their own home and all children in household must be over 18 years old. Your resident pets must be up to date on vaccines, sterilized, you must have a good history of vet care for them, and you must have used heartworm preventative year round for your dogs. \n\n\nMoose will be placed as an inside pet with outside privileges. You MUST have a securely fenced yard accessible from your home. Invisible fencing does not work with this breed and they will take the shock for the freedom.  Great Pyrenees are bred to roam and will create their own territory if not secured, which can led to them being lost, hit by vehicles or shot by people who see them as a threat. The breed is not a good off leash dog, and cannot be trusted to not run away.  A Great Pyrenees off leash is a \" DisAPyr.\" \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please complete the appropriate application on our website, www.igpr.org under the Adopt tab. \n\nAll of our dogs marked as needing foster homes are also available for adoption.  If a dog is listed on this site, it is available.  No need to contact us to see if it is,  We do require you  complete the adoption application prior to meeting a dog.\n\nWe also offer a foster to adopt program. You foster the dog, and have first right of refusal on them if an approved application is submitted for them. \n\nIn fostering a dog, the dog comes to you fully vetted. and groomed. You provide good quality food, grooming, and we provide the heartworm preventative and medical care, if needed* .(*Based on approval from IGPR.)\n\nAdoption fee is $350",

Mom was an American Staffordshire Terrier and dad was unknown. The puppies were scheduled to go to an out of state rescue however that rescue backed out at the last minute. The puppies risked being sent back to the shelter for euthanasia so we agreed to bring them here. \n\nTemperament- Initially- Very standoffish, shy, and weary. Czr would not do good in a busy home with a lot of visitors. Once he bonds he is a big ol' lap dog-- he loves laps, cuddling on the couch, and hugs. Once he has bonded he is very sweet, playful, and happy who loves his toys. He does look intimidating because he is so serious but he is a shy guy who just wants love..   \n\nEnergy Level- Mid to lower level energy- loves to play chase and wrestle with the other dogs (he is with Jacques, Taffy, and Piquin). They wrestle, play tug, play chase, and just have fun but he would really love to have his own person to love and cuddle with on the couch.\n\nDogs/Cats- Good with the other dogs and cats\n\nHousetrained- House trained perfectly using a dog door. There have been no mistakes at all.\n\nThis guy is so handsome, loving, and gentle with his family. However, gaining his trust will take some time and treats. He is one of those dogs that will require several visits before transitioning to a new home and then should be kept on leash for at least a week or two. Once he bonds he is the most amazingly beautiful, happy, goofy boy ever. He is stocky but not large. He would love a family to love and call his very own who he can sprawl out on the couch with. He will make someone an amazing pet as he bonds strongly and becomes an amazing protector.\n\nAdoption fee is a donation to the rescue - he is neutered, has been given all age appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, 3 yr rabies vacc, HW tested, collar and tags, training information, and all the support you need.\n\nSend us an e-mail to adopt@almosthomenm.org  requesting an application to adopt this sweetie!!

He loves car rides and gets really excited about the world.  His facial expression is priceless.  He knows sit, down, give me your paw and stop.  The person he needs is a person with a heart full of love and patience, strength and stamina and time to train this smart baby.

            "description": "ACE IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION. ACE IS A SPECIAL NEEDS PUP WHO NEEDS SPONSORSHIP\n\nHi folks, Darling Ace here, I'm about 11 years old and weigh ten pounds. I tend to enjoy a low key predictable lifestyle. It's best to take baby steps when making changes in my life. I'm a very loyal fellow. I also might like another small \"low key\" friend to pal around with. I just live for one or two little squeaky toys. My favorite is a long neck brontosaurus. I'm not much of a jumper, but I have learned how to use puppy stairs. I love my walks and do great on a leash, my back end sometimes chooses its own direction, but that doesn't stop me. My foster family thinks it's kinda cute. I take several naps a day to keep my peppy alert personality going. I like to be within eye or earshot of a family member. My eyes, ears, and smeller work well. I've had no problem adapting to my family's schedule. Potty skills are good in my current foster home, I am an indoor dog. In a new home, it might take a day or two for me to know where and when to do my business, but I'm a quick learner. Here I have access to the outdoors and a short/low ramp to walk out to the yard.\n\nAt Bichon Rescue of Orange County, our commitment to our pups does not waiver when they have special needs. These special needs pups are less likely to be adopted for reasons of age, health or behavior. We have amazing volunteers committed to fostering these pups until the end but we need sponsors to help with funding all of their needs. Won't you consider supporting Lily by setting up a monthly sponsorship? Even the smallest amount will help. As a Senior Sponsor we will send you photos and updates on Lily. If you can find it in your heart to help Lily or one of our other seniors, please copy and paste this link in your browser: https://bichonrescueoc.org/sponsorship.",

We take animals that have been tortured, abused, and neglected and supply the emergency medical care required to get them well. We then provide rehab physically and mentally to prepare them for their new home and new life. We are located in Ridgeland, SC., and are by appointment only. All of our dogs are at our Rehabilitation Center either in hospice care or being loved on by staff until we find them forever homes. Please call 843.540.6755 or email NoahsArksRescues@mac.com with any questions. If you are interested, please fill out our Adoption Application at https://www.noahs-arks.net/nar-application.

            "description": "No Phone Calls or Emails -Due to this dogs past behavior, he cannot go to a home with children or anyone over 50 years old. \n\nLAST CHANCE FOR ADOPTION:  When Bradley came from the shelter in Aug 2019 he had some serious health issues. His ears were chronically neglected to the point he had to have ear ablation in one ear. On top of all of that he had heart worm disease which had affected his liver. However, the rescue got him treated for heartworms and his liver returned to normal. He is now heart worm negative. We also got his ear ablation done and still battle his other ear. As long as he remains on hypoallergenic food and stay on top of his ear infection he is doing okay.\n\nWhen Bradley came to rescue the shelter said he seemed to be a nice dog.  But, he was not so nice and for a few months later acted out wanting to bite and jump up on you when he didn't like what was happening. He did bite the rescue lady back in March of this year after his ear surgery. Since that time we finally have gotten him to accept an alpha structured environment.\n\nBradley cannot live in a home with any children and is best suited for middle age adults in case he does bite. He isn't biting us now, he has been here long enough that he trusts us. The foster mom can correct him, massage him, medicate his one ear and ruffle his feathers. He is finally doing better with dogs so perhaps being an only dog or with one submissive dog would be best.   Bradley is still working on house manners. He needs someone willing to give him a chance and not quit on him when he acts out. He can be a loving sweet dog in the right hands.\n\nAdoption fee:  $350.\n\n\n\n",

He is very strong and energetic and would benefit from some training, so an experienced dog owner that will work with him would be ideal.  Spot is a 4 year old boxer-terrier mix.\n\nThe NAWS Dog Adoption Program operates as a rescue versus a shelter. We believe in matching the right dog with the appropriate family based on each specific dog or family\u2019s needs. To achieve this we believe in spending the appropriate amount of time with each family to allow for enough interaction time with potential adoptees. This cannot be achieved if people stop by unexpectedly to meet our dogs. Please e-mail Stacy@NAWSUS.org to set up a day and time to meet with Tim, Victoria or Heather, (our dog adoption counselors), and our potential adoptees. Thank you!!",

My foster mom says I'm the sweetest girl in town !I'm a little shy at first but give me 24 hrs to warmup and you'll feel like we've been together for years. I love my humans, my hobbies include following you around, chewing toys, snuggling and sleeping on the couch, I'm learning the whole walking on the leash thing, I sleep in my kennel at night and do pretty well. Really I'm just a happy lucky girl waiting for my furever home, my perfect family!!\n\nPlease contact\napp@aarfhouston.org\nfor more information about this dog.\n\nYou can apply online by clicking on\n\nApplication\n\n.\n\nPuppies that are under 4 months old cannot be adopted outside of our Veterinary Service area. Please call for specific locations.\n\nOnce your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events.\n\nThank you for considering a rescue!\n\nThe adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you.",

She loves running around in a fenced in yard despite being 7  years old and loves to carry her stuffed toy on walks.\n\nDespite her former owner stating that she is loving, active, adventurous, playful and a gentle giant, after a year of homelessness,  Sally has recently displayed  kennel stress with stress related lunging and grabbing at people she is meeting for the first time. \nSadly, she is currently off the adoption floor until we can help her.  Some dogs handle a kennel environment without stress or anxiety, others do not fair well. \n",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Angel. I am two years old and a purebred Carolina Dog. I am a very loyal girl and pretty smart too. My ideal home would be with humans (NO CHILDREN) that have calm energy and strong leadership. Because I don't like a lot of excitement, an adult only home would be best for me. I love my humans and prefer to not be left alone for long periods of time. I do get along with other dogs but I can be dog selective at times so proper introductions are needed. My most favorite activity is searching in the yard for lizards, so my ideal home will have a fun back yard for me to play in. But because I love to chase things, it's a good idea that I do not live with a cat. I am good walking on a leash and really like my daily exercise so I am looking for active people like me! I have a very sweet and loving personality to share with the right person - hope that is you!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit the I.C.A.R.E. Dog Rescue website and complete an adoption application: www.icaredogrescue.org/ready-to-adopt\n\nAdoption fee includes: spay/neuter shots up to date micro-chip fecal and vet check",

I'm a ton of fun to be around - just ask all my two-legged and four-legged friends! I love a good romp in the playfields with my dog pals, and afterwards some quality one-on-one time with my human friends - with lots of love and attention, of course. Kisses anyone?! But I'm not just all about having fun, I LOVE to learn. I know all my basic commands already, but I'm always ready for more! I'm super motivated and a really hard workerfeeling up to a the challenge to teach me some new tricks? I can't wait! I've been hard at work in the American Kennel Club Canine Good Citizen Shelter Dog training program. I've learned all sorts of cool things to help me become an upstanding member of society! If you adopt me, the shelter will provide us with FREE training classes so that we can take the official test together and I can become CGC certified! I'm a sponsored Dolly's Dream dog and a Fospice pet. Adopt me and all my routine medical care, food, medication and other supplies will be provided by Peggy Adams Animal Rescue League, free of charge. We'll also go home together with an ID tag, leash, collar, harness, training crate, dog bed, toys, training treat bag, food and water bowls and 7 months of pet insurance. Wow, huh?! Lots of goodies for you and me, and even a waived adoption fee! Meet with an Adoption Coordinator to learn more.",

Ziggy likes to be in the same room as people, but he is not clingy. He just likes to be near you. Ziggy loves to be sprawled completely out when it's bully stick time. He stretches his entire body out and then lies on his side and gnaws away. It is so nice to see him so relaxed and comfortable. He would also be a road trip star! Ziggy LOVES riding in the car, and is such a polite passenger and he loves looking out the window and seeing everything go past. To contact his foster, email randallgs@sbcglobal.net.",

I get along great with all people, espeically ones that want to play or cuddle with me. I love to go on secluded walks and am great on a leash. I am house trained and crate trained. I know basic commands and will wait to eat my food until you tell me it's ok. I am responsive to treats which will help you teach me lots of new things! Above all, I am looking for a family that wants to love me and let me love them back. Do I sound like the kind of pet you're looking for? Click here to view my behavior notes.",

Penelope is ready to leave her past behind her and is looking forward to a future filled with lots of love and belly rubs! She is described by the people who know her best as affectionate, silly, and loyal. As an ahem, distinguished lady, Penelope has experience in a home, and knows a thing or two about couch snuggling, potty breaks, and zoomies in a yard. Penelope would be more than glad to snuggle up and watch a movie with you, or take a leisurely stroll in the neighborhood in the cool mornings or evenings. When she feels happy and safe, Penelope makes the cutest little grunt. Oink oink! She can sometimes be particular about new people but it all comes from a past that she had no control over. As an outside dog, Penelope felt the need to protect her home and family from strangers. Her ideal home would be low traffic, and slow proper intros when there are visitors. She does have the potential to live with another calm, respectful, low-medium energy dog. We would love to introduce you to Penelope if you think she sounds like the dog for you!

They love to cuddle each other or other family members, both doggie and human! MaryLynn lifts her paw when she wants to be picked up for a hug or a quick snuggle and throws her head on your shoulder to hug back. TJ is fond of giving kisses. He loves to play with stuffed animals and enjoys a good game of tug-o-war! Both enjoy outdoor adventures in the back yard or on a stroll with you. If you would like to meet this pair, please reach out to their foster mom via email at amy1263@gmail.com.",

            "description": "Hi, my name is QUEEN and I would love to meet you. I am a Spayed Female Pit Bull Terrier mix. The shelter staff think I am about 10 years old. I have been at the shelter since Sep 09, 2020. Well hello there! I am the lovely Queen. I am loving and affectionate and love to go for walks. I had to come back to the shelter because I did not get along with the other dog on the property. According to my previous owner I know how to sit, stay, and lie down AND I`m crate trained. I`ve never lived around kitties or other dogs, and would prefer to be the ONLY PET in your life. I need a home with teenagers or adults as I can be sensitive about handling. Queen pupdate: Hello there hoomans! Well, I`ve been hanging out in a really cool foster home for a few months now and I`m pretty settled in. A few more things you need to know about me - I am a GREAT watchdog, I will watch out the window all day long and let you know if anything suspicious is happening, like that pesky neighborhood squirrel is getting on the porch again! I love to go for rides in the car, in fact sometimes my foster mom and dad have a hard time convincing me to get out of the car when we get home. I have some aches in my joints so I get special food and treats (I suspect it might be MEDICINE!) to help keep me feeling good, and going for regular walks keeps me from getting too stiff and sore. While I love my foster family, I am ready to find that special home to call my OWN. **** Interested in adopting?? Email dogfoster@thehumanesociety.org !! ****",

After a puppyhood of neglect, Jewel is happy to be around people who love her and can't wait to find her forever family. Shortly after Jewel arrived at SASF, we realized that she is deaf, but that does not stop her from being friendly and playful and well trained. Jewel has been trained with hand signals, much like sign language, so she knows her basic commands already. She would love a fenced-in yard or a promise of many adventurous walks and hikes. Jewel loves to play with other dogs and gets along with dogs of all ages and sizes. Her favorite thing in the world is to go to playgroup and run around with her canine friends. Fill out an application on Jewel today to see if she'd be the right match for you. Jewel is currently in a training program!",

Rolly would love a large yard to patrol. She will gladly protect her yard from intruders like squirrels, cats and other little furry critters. She would enjoy sharing her home with a female doggie friend or a small submissive male dog. She really comes out of her shell with another dog, so we'd love to find her a home with a canine companion. If you're a patient person with a relaxing home, Rolly might be your perfect match!

More information will be provided once she settles into her foster home.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Mallory is $350, which is TAX DEDUCTIBLE, and goes toward providing supportive services to animals in the home, as well as the high cost of vetting our dogs in rescue. If you would like to welcome Mallory into your home, please begin by submitting our adoption application. The adoptions for all of our dogs will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver the dogs. If you would like to learn more about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue, or donate to our dogs, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com. We invite you to visit our Facebook Page, and when you visit, please don't forget to Like our Facebook page so that you wont miss any information about our dogs and events!",

            "description": "Rivver is a 45-lb. bundle of charm. Gentle, sweet, and playful, around 6 years old, with a delicate appearance. Prefers to be indoors most of the time unless you want to throw her kong to her, then she will stay out as long as you can catching and retrieving the kong. Rivver would probably enjoy being an only dog. Walks are a favorite and she walks easily on leash. Rivver would be a perfect companion. Her favorite things include lying on her pet bed, with lots of toys surrounding her, while chewing on her Nylabone. This sweet girl can hardly wait to be a member of a family or the center of your universe! Rivver is spayed, microchipped, with her rabies vaccinations, bordatella, DhPP and Lepto vaccinations. She is some type of lab mix. She is a copper color on her body with dark blue feet and tail tip-looking like she stepped in a blue ink spot. House trained and crate trained. Rivver is fostered in a private home with other dogs.\nTejas Rescued Pet Adoptions . PO Box 790372 . San Antonio, TX 78216 . adoption@tejasrescues.org (210 496-3947\n\n2/1/21 10:26 AM",

Before you go falling head over heels for Austin\u2019s drop-dead handsome looks, he wants you to know he\u2019s got some non-negotiable requirements for his new family. Milk bones are a must :) But Austin\u2019s new humans must also understand that he\u2019s been hurt in the past and he is going to need some time and space to earn your trust. Once he feels safe, Austin will reward your patience with loyalty and affection. Nothing makes this boy happier than pleasing his humans. He can be left alone, but the crate makes him very nervous. You will be super impressed with all the commands Austin has mastered such as: heal, stop, let's go, come, sit, wait, paw, down, leave it, drop it, and focus. Austin prefers female dogs, after slow proper introductions but will choose to be with his humans over dogs. He is looking for a home without many visitors and will need to be put in another room if guests do stop by. He is working hard to overcome his fears but his new family should understand that he may never conquer them and that\u2019s ok! A family with breed experience, particularly with fearful dogs, will understand how to set this boy up for success, so he can live the life he deserves with humans he trusts. Due to his past trauma, young kids are a no but cats are a go. If given the right environment, Austin will thrive and reward you with kindness. Once he feels safe, he will quickly become your shadow. Austin will make the Pyrfect family very happy, if they can give him the patience and understanding he needs to thrive. If you sound like what Austin is looking for, apply today!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nNGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY. View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.\n\n",

            "description": "This beautiful fur baby's name is Willow and is she approximately 2 years old. She is a very sweet and friendly girl who loves attention. She is currently vaccinated, micro-chipped and heart worm negative. The clinic that originally vaccinated her couldn't tell if she was spayed and because we didn't want to put her through unnecessary spay surgery we decided to wait to see if she went into heat. She hasn't exhibited any signs of going into heat in the year we have had her so we believe she is spayed. If after she is adopted, she should go into heat, we will pay for her spay surgery at a vet of our choosing. Willow would be a great family dog. We believe she is house trained as she waits to go potty until she gets out of her outdoor kennel for exercise.  Willow has a lot of energy and because she is still the \"perfect dog\" in training, needs some work in some basic training. She knows the sit command but in her excitement to get attention from humans she might jump up and put her paws on them which could be overpowering for small children, therefore, we believe she would be a better fit for families with larger children. She is friendly towards other dogs and we believe she will do great with any dog that is playful in nature with an even tempered personality but would be fine in an only dog family as long as she received a lot of attention from her family and daily exercise. She currently is fostered on property that has a lot of room for exploring. Willow does lose her winter coat starting in the spring so her fur does need to be raked to remove the loosened fur. She seems to enjoy it (and the attention she gets during the process). If you feel this wonderful girl would fit into your lifestyle please email us at arnt_dfw@yahoo.com for a pre-adoption questionnaire which is part of the adoption process. Once reviewed, if it appears your home would be the right fit for her we can schedule a meet and greet. Her adoption fee is $200.  We also conduct home visits as part of the adoption process, therefore she is only available for adoption in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area.",

She has enjoyed living in a loving foster home that has helped her grow and thrive since she joined the 2BABR family. \n\nHammy still retains some concerns for small humans, other dogs, and vacuum cleaners (weird, but true!) and thus needs a calm, well structured home without children under the age of 15 or other animals. Hammy has been working hard on basic obedience and responds well to the use of a training collar to assist her with impulse control. Hammy is potty trained, crate trained, and walks very well on a leash. Hammy loves to play catch but resists returning the ball to it's thrower in favor of playing with it and tossing it in the air to herself. Hammmy does require a yard with a privacy fence (6 foot minimum). She is treat motivated but her favorite \"reward\" is a belly scratch and hearing the words \"good girl!\" \n\nHammy needs a strong leader in her life and one who will continue to work with her on training, manners, and structure. Please apply today if you think Hammy could live her Happily Ever After in your home and heart! \n\n*BSL Restrictions apply!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

If you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please fill out an adoption application on our website www.helpingshepherdsofeverycolor.com You may also find us on facebook: Helping Shepherds of Every Color Rescue.\n\nFred is a little shy at first but he warms up to you pretty quick. He is a little rough around the edges needs a patient adopter who will work with him and not expect perfection on day 1. He is good with other dogs but he may stand up for himself if another dog tries to start an argument through the fence. Fred might also help you redecorate by rearranging your stuff. He doesn't chew it, just moves it somewhere else. He needs to be in a home with older kids or no kids, he doesn't quite know what to do about younger kids.",

I am a very handsome, very black 3-year-old Chihuahua/dachshund mix with a load of character.\n\nI love big dogs and I love to play. I need to go to a home that has one or two big dogs as companions. Small dogs make me a bit nervous (smile). I am a rough and tumble kind of guy and love to play and I love people.  You can take me for a walk, I am good on leash and I melt in your hands. \n\nRecently, I had some really cool professional training and I am ready for my forever home.  I am going to be an awesome companion and a really great dog.\n\nPlease no children, they can be overwhelming.\n\nMost of our dogs require a fully fenced yard, this does depend on the individual dogs needs and safety requirements.  \n\nOur dogs are fed a nutrient rich dog food named NutriSource.  Our experience is a high quality dog food keeps vet bills down and well-being high.\n\nIf you have any questions please email: claudiaatwag@gmail.com\n\nVisit our website to fill out an Adoption Application  http://www.wagsequimwa.com\n\nAdoption donation fee $400. Please understand this adoption donation goes towards helping all the dogs we rescue.\n\n\n\n",

He's very mouthy when he plays and sometimes he doesn't realize just how hard he's playing. He would do best with younger energetic dogs and a little older kids. This beautiful a lump of clay waiting for you to mold him. If you would like to adopt Petey, please fill out the application at this link. http://dfwfgf.org/applications/",

When he could no longer stand he was dumped at a high kill animal control facility, his back legs so stiff, the hunters said he was useless...they said he was old...that was their excuse for his stiff body and emaciated condition....he also had a flesh wound  from a bullet.  He is in great health now.\n\nHe is a great companion and attaches mostly to one person. He is very affectionate to his person, once he knows they are his friend.\n\nHe likes girl dogs and wants to play w other male dogs but is too dominant so he would be best in a home where he is the only dog.\n\nBecause of the cruelty he endured and because he was used ( abused) as a hunting dog he would be best in a quiet home.\n\nall adopters must have a securely fenced yard, be a stable home owner and have a past pet who a veterinarian can verify you took good care of.\n\nAlgebra would be the perfect pet for the right person,  he loves to play fetch...call audrey 484-844-0374   thank you.\n",

The puppies have been adopted but Meagan remains at the rescue for almost a year.  She will need to be an only dog child in the family as she just wants all the attention and no other dogs! Meagan loves those that love her.  She needs an understanding and loving owner that will continue her desensitizing training with her.  She's been through a lot and although we do the best we at the rescue there is no substitution for a real home.  She was heart worm positive but we raised the money and she has received treatment as of 12/13/19!  Yay for Meagan!.   She is up to date on vaccinations, dewormed, given flea/tick and heart worm prevention and spayed. She would really like a loving home and is waiting for her forever family. Come see her at Kind Keeper today.\n\nCall: 843-427-4388\nVisit at: 1500 LD Drive North Myrtle Beach, SC 29582\n\nFill out an online application at: https://kindkeeper.wixsite.com/kindkeeper/adoption-application",

            "description": "Felix and his brother Oscar came to us from a rural shelter in central VA.  They were surrendered along with 3 siblings and from what we were told, all 5 of them had been kept in cages outdoors.  We were also told that Felix is 11 years old, although that is hard to believe when we see him playing with the young puppy in his foster home.  Both Oscar and Felix were adopted, but while Oscar is happily in his forever home, Felix was returned to the rescue because he was having trouble with his house-training in his new home,  even though he appears to be housetrained in his foster home.    Anyone who adopts him will have to be willing to work through this issue with him.\n\nFelix loves attention and would probably be happiest as the only dog in the home.  He is fine with some dogs in his foster home, but not with others.  He likes to be outside, but he also loves to cuddle on the couch with his humans.  He is now  about  12 years old weighs about 13 lbs.   He would really love a quiet home of his own where he can live out the rest of his life.  \n\nOh, and I almost forgot to write that Felix is missing the foot on his back right leg!  You can see it if you look closely at the pictures, but it is really hard to tell.  The vet noticed that he actually has part of a paw pad on the stump that he has, which means that he was born without the foot rather than having had it amputated at some point.  This must be the reason that he has no trouble with missing a foot and it's also the reason that I almost forgot to add it to his description.  It's easy to forget about it because it doesn't bother him.  Sometimes he will hold up the leg that is missing the foot and sometimes he will walk on it.  Either way, it doesn't seem to slow him up much.  \n\nIf you like to meet Felix or apply to adopt him, please email cosmozcause@gmail.com",

She is a sweet but shy little girl who has not had the best beginning to her short life. Moxie was taken to West Tennessee shelter. Even though the shelter was open she was left outside in a plastic crate with a big bag of dog food on top of it. Thank goodness someone noticed the food and the crate and went to bring it inside never thinking there was a dog inside. Imagine how hot Moxie must have been and how scared. She has been in foster care now for a few weeks and has left that life behind. Moxie has learned that people are nice and she is warming up to everyone quickly. Moxie loves to be petted and comes up and puts her front feet on your leg so that you can love on her. She has also learned to sleep on a dog bed beside her foster dad's bed. She is welcome on the bed but seems to prefer her own. She can also be found sitting in her crate relaxing during the day. Moxie is housebroken and can stay loose in the house during the day. She does not bother anything at all. Moxie does love to play and tries to entice her foster brother and sister to play with her. She prefers playing with them over toys. Moxie likes to be outside and it making great strides at walking on a leash. She loves to run around in the fenced in back yard and likes to sun when it is not too hot. A fenced in yard is a must for Moxie as she will not walk on a leash to do her business. She would be good as an only dog as long as she does not have to spend lots of time alone and she would be fine with a similar sized dog her age. If you would like to be considered for her forever home please contact Vivienne at viviennejames@comcast.net or 615-943-7311. APPROVED APPLICATION AND ADOPTION FEE REQUIRED.",

They LOVE LOVE LOVE to run and play, snuggle with the big dogs. Crate trained and house trained. Both are skittish of new people and take time to warm up but, they're worth the time!We require that you have a fenced in yard, not a \"kennel\" in the yard AND we do not approve underground fencing. Depending upon the dog some exceptions are made for those who live in apartments. We also require that the adoptee will be a part of the family \"living\" within the home. Our adoption process may be found on our website at www.bitofheaven.org\n\nVisits are scheduled by appointment only via emailing request to ownedbycaninesandlovit@yahoo.com",

Sue is blind and while she navigates her world just fine once accustomed to her surroundings, Greta makes everything so much easier for her since Sue has a mate to follow around and give her the confidence she needs in the world.  Additionally, Greta is a super gentle but submissive soul who comes right out of her shell in the presence of Sue.  With Sue and Greta together they are totally different dogs and it is amazing to see!\n\nThese girls are both great with other dogs, housebroken and just the sweetest dogs around!   While Sue is good with cats, Greta is not so a home without kitties is ideal.  Both are good with kids but we would prefer a home without children simply because Sue might spook easy with the quick movements and loud sounds of kids.\n\nSue is thought to be a Catahoula mix and Greta is a Boxer mix.  While we would place each dog separately, we would LOVE to place them together since they really compliment each other and to be honest, they just simply love each other.\n\nThe home that would suit them best would be an adult home with a fenced yard so they can run and play (yes, Sue loves to run and play).  What a great pair and it would truly be a wonderful thing to give both of these girls a great home!",

            "description": "Angus (formerly \u2018Troubles\u2019) originally found himself at Stanislaus County Animal Shelter in January, 2019. He was healthy and in good shape, and luckily he was also microchipped, so he was reunited with his owners. Six months later, Angus once again found himself at the shelter, only this time his owners didn\u2019t come to claim him, and he was in bad shape: his right leg is non-functioning, his spine is out of whack, and he has scars all over his body. Though we\u2019ll never know exactly what happened to Angus in the six months between leaving the shelter and coming back, it definitely wasn\u2019t good.\n\nIn spite of everything, Angus is a sweetheart! His body may be broken, but his spirit isn\u2019t; he still trusts people, and isn\u2019t reactive to other dogs in non-stressful settings. He is working through some separation anxiety, which isn\u2019t surprising given what little we know of his history, and will have his medical needs assessed and addressed before going to a forever home. In general, he just wants to be touched, hugged, scratched, and loved. His resilience is astounding!\n\nIf you're interested in applying to adopt, please complete an application at www.sacrdr.org/adopt.\nTo keep up with Angus, check out #SacRDRAngus on Facebook and Instagram @resilientdogrescue",

Shooter takes awhile to trust new people and is very kennel reactive when people pass by. He walks well on a leash and knows some basic commands. Shooter loves to play fetch and run around the yard. A patient home who will help him adjust as his own pace and be the only pet in a home without children would be required for Shooter. He warms up to women quicker than he does men and would enjoy an active lifestyle to keep him stimulated.

            "description": "Winston is a two year old Chocolate Lab/German Shorthaired Pointer mix. This special boy does well with other dogs, loves to play fetch, relax in the pool and go on walks.  Winston is a very loving and smart dog, but does need help staying focused and remembering his manners and boundaries. He would do best in a home with an experienced adopter that is comfortable fulfilling the role of a \"strong leader\" that Winston can trust to steer him in the right direction.   We will not place Winston in a home with kiddos or other dogs.  He can not handle the responsibility of being permitted on a bed or a couch.  Winston is so intelligent that he would love an activity such as dock diving!  \n\nWe are looking for adaptors that own a house with a fenced in yard. No town houses. Also a home with no bunnies or cats. \n\nMr. Winston is currently being trained while with us.  So we are in search of a local forever family.  Once Winston is adopted, his current trainer will continue to work with him and his new family at no further expense!    \n\nHe is housetrained, up-to-date on vaccines and neutered. If you are interested in learning more about Winston, or perhaps would like to schedule a meet-and-greet please contact The Canine Rescue of Central PA at 717-232-1644 or e-mail adopt@crcpa.org.",

He also loves to hang out on the couch and snuggle.\n\nDobby has been doing more snuggling, less playing, as he was tested heartworm positive when he came in and is currently undergoing treatment. His activities are limited to short walks right now, but he is responding well and will slowly start to add in more activity as we get the clear from his vets! \n\nDobby is very food-motivated and LOOVES to work for food. Do you have some treats for him? He could be your new best friend!\n\n11/25/19 Update: Dobby completed his heartworm treatment. The treatment and period of restricted activity was a little hard on him and he had to undergo some behavior modification for resource guarding with Halo K9 behavior. He is currently being slowly re-introduced to his dog friends and caretakers again and is doing well. We will continue to monitor him. \nDobby is really in need of a forever home where someone can provide the structure, care, and training he needs. Please ask about him and what he needs!",

            "description": "Urgent Courtesy Post!\n\nThis cute senior needs your help!\n\nDash is a 10-year-old Spaniel mix whose senior owner is losing her home this Saturday, July 27th. She found a small apartment over a garage and a  charity will be paying the rent for 6 months in the hopes that she'll get back on her feet during that time. She was only allowed to bring 1 of her cats. Thankfully, a feline rescue group was found that took in her other cats. Saturday Dash will have to be surrendered to a local shelter in the Hollywood area if a permanent home or foster cannot be found. Dash has been well cared for and is in good health. He\u2019s a happy - loving chap who gets along well with other dogs and cats.   \n  \nIf interested in fostering or adopting Dash please contact:\nRobin #213-819-9966 text or Robinlfaber@gmail.com\n\n\nUnited Hope for Animals (UHA) is a volunteer group and does not have a facility for animals.  This pet is part of our Shelter Support Program at the Downey Shelter: \nhttp://www.unitedhope4animals.org/about-us/shelter-support-program.

His social skills have come a long way. He is very attentive to people and makes a quiet and faithful companion. He is a versatile dog who enjoys being indoors and outdoors alike. He rides well in the car without the need for a crate. He is well-mannered on a leash and loves to sit at outdoor caf\u00e9s while his human sips on coffee, chats, or reads a book. He is non-reactive to other dogs. He is food motivated. Bear needs an experienced and assertive handler who is going to give him time and space to adjust to new home while establishing new routines and boundaries.

She has a few skills she\u2019s constantly honing out in the world while out on walks, but in addition to those daily bits of training, we also think she\u2019d quite enjoy living with someone who likes to teach her new things. Tricks, fun enrichment, general Cool Stuff Dogs Like--she\u2019s down to try it. Don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s not code for \u201csecret border collie,\u201d but she\u2019s got the brains, so she\u2019d love to go home with someone who wants to use \u2018em!\n\nAll of Lilly\u2019s fosters have reported back that she does very well in the house--easy in her crate, potty trained, and is the perfect mix of sometimes independent but always ready for a good time. She's the ideal Stay at Home buddy--she'll entertain herself through your Zoom calls but be ready for a play break when you are! \n\nLilly V would prefer to be the only dog at home, but could potentially live with a confident cat with a slow introduction.\n\nCheck out more from Lilly V on her Instagram at @illy__lilly (https://www.instagram.com/illy__lilly/)\n\nAbout 3 years old and 55 pounds, Lilly V is crate-trained, house-trained, micro-chipped, up to date on routine vaccinations and knows her basic commands.",

            "description": "When Elvis sang \"You 'Aint Nothing But A Hound Dog\", he very well may have been singing abou our sweet Stella!    Stella is a 60 pound, approx. 4 year old Coonhound/Treeing Walker/Beagle Mix.   In typical coonhound style, she usually has her nose to the ground.  She is super sweet, calm, and relaxed. She loves her humans and enjoys snuggling.  She loves to run & play with her foster siblings and her humans. She loves attention and has the sweetest disposition. She wants more than anything else to have her very own family to love and adore her.\n\nLike many rescue pups, this furbaby is HW+, but is currently undergoing the *slow-kill method of treatment (see more information below).  \n\nAll our adoption fees include spay/neuter, micro-chip, up-to-date vaccinations, including rabies thru date of adoption. This pup is heartworm positive and is currently being treated with the *slow kill method, approved by her veterinarian, on prevention & on flea/tick prevention. \n\n*The slow kill method of treatment, simply stated, is a 30 day regiment of  doxycycline followed by a monthly dose of Advantage Multi for 12 months, then retesting.   Most dogs test negative after one year of following this treatment; however, we always recommend that potential adopters consult & follow the advice of their family veterinarian upon adopting any of our hw+ pups.   Although the fast-kill method is still considered the \"gold-standard\" by the AVA, and may be preferred by some vets; the slow-kill method has proven to be effective in our rescue. The main reason we utilize this method is due to our limited financial constraints and the high number of our rescue pups that are infected.   In the cases of severe infection and if the pup is highly symptomatic, we sometimes use the fast-kill approach instead.   Again, we recommend for you to consult with your veterinarian after the adoption is complete and follow their recommendations.   \n\nIn order to be considered for one of our beautiful pups, please go to our website and complete and application: https://www.mustluvdogs.org/adoptable-pets.\nPlease note that we are a DUE DILIGENCE adoption organization. Part of our approval process requires, among other things:\n* Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered.\n*The majority, but not all, of our pets require a fenced yard or secure enclosure.  In the case of apartments, we require Landlord approval and designated dog area in complex.\n*Verifiable good veterinary history INCLUDING regular vaccination/visits and good Heartworm Prevention history is a MUST!\n*Adopter must be able to have time to spend with the pup and be able to provide the pup a safe environment to live.\n*ALL our dogs are expected to be primarily INSIDE dogs.  They MUST sleep inside the home.  We truly understand that some folks have working dogs (i.e. farmers, ranchers,etc); however, the majority of our dogs have had a rough life prior to coming to us & we want to make sure that they are showered with LUV & maybe even a bit spoiled for the rest of their lives. \n\nOther facts are also considered, including whether children or other pets are a good fit with the dog. \n\nMust Luv Dogs reserves the right to deny any applications that we don't think are a good fit with the pup. Our first & foremost concern is the dog's best interest. It is our MISSION to place them in a home that is a great fit for their needs for a lifetime of luv & being part of a family.\n*We will consider adoptions in any area; however, will do not ship or transport puppies under the age of 12 mos. We will ONLY transport an adult dog on a transport approved by MLD, at adopter's expense.\n* In order to be affordable and afford every family an opportunity to have a pup of their own, we keep our Adoption Fees low; however, please keep in mind that the fees we charge do not cover all costs for the pup.  Any additional donations are greatly appreciated!\n\nPlease note that all of our pets are in private foster homes. In order to reduce any stress or confusion for our pups, we require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meet & greet for any of our pups.  Alternatively, you are always welcome to come meet any of our pups at one of our regular Adoption Events.   Our events are always posted on PetFinder OR on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/mustLUVdogs.org.\n\nFinally, THANK YOU for considering Must Luv Dogs for your next pet. \n\n*Most dogs require a fenced area in yard. \n*Apartments okay IF nearby dog park or walking trails (with landlord appoval).\n*ALL dogs must be INSIDE dogs and treated a part of family. \n*We are a DUE DILIGENCE Adoption Rescue.  \n*Must have good Vet history & Heartworm prevention is a MUST!\n*ALL dogs are fully vetted, spay/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption.\n\n\n\n",

I\u2019m a 1 year old male lab mix!  love to explore the world around me, play with toys and hang out with people. I am a good cuddler too and I give out lots of kisses!! I am good with other dogs and I need another dog to play with at my forever home. I do not know how I feel about cats. Children 12 years old or older. My forever home is required to have a chain link or privacy fenced yard where I can safely run, play and hang out with my humans. I am neutered, up to date on my vaccinations, on monthly Heatworm preventative as well as house and crate trained. I am dreaming about a forever family who would take me on adventures, play with me and love me for the rest of my life!!\n\nAll dogs we rescue stay with us until they find their forever homes. We do not do same day adoptions. A home visit is required to ensure our dog is going to a safe environment and our dog gets along with your dog(s) and/or cat(s). We require all our dogs over 1 years old  attend 1 obedience class (class is a 6 week session) outside the home. You must live within 1 hour of Birmingham, MI to adopt one of our dogs. No out of state or outside the U.S. adoptions or fosters. Leon's adoption fee is $275.",

Dragon is still quite shy but he appreciates his routine and loves him roommate. When Dragon visits the sunporch to share lunchtime with the humans, he looks around in wonder at all the happy faces smiling down upon him. He likes to explore the hallway and hang out with the office dogs. Because this sweetheart still has some confidence issues, another dog to show him the ropes in his home would mean the world to him.\n\nVisit Dragon at www.hua.org!",

But Russo wasn't loving a kennel environ so he came here.  He is shy and fearful but not aggressive and loves the company of other animals.  He seems to thrive in a pack.   He will come for treats and will approach to say hello and ever day seems to warm up more and more.  He is now allowing petting. We think he has great potential for a patient adopter who will let him see how great being a people dog can be.  He is a youngster at about two years old.  And CUTE as a button!  Great size too,  He will take patience but will be so worth the time.  He should not be an only dog.  Russo needs a playmate or two.  he plays great with dogs and that is his comfort zone.  Right now we deem him feral and not ready for a home.  It might be a huge set back, catching him will take a lot currently..",

She loves people, but should only be living with adults. She is very dog aggressive(including all animals), so definitely should be the only pet in the house. Her new owner(s) would ideally be experienced with the bully breed dogs.\n\nShe is very active and will need an owner(s) who can give her enough exercise to wear her out ! She needs a solid, securely fenced yard with a 6-7 ft privacy fence, as she can leap at least 5 ft. She is about 3 yrs old and 35 lbs, a great snuggle size; she's also good on a leash. She's been fully vetted, including spay, vaccines and deworming. She's very playful and loves her toys including old buckets, balls, kongs, antlers, beef bones and anything that can be thrown. Please contact Dee at K9rescueva@gmail.com with any questions, and to meet this sweet girl.\n\n**BECAUSE OF OUR REQUIREMENT FOR A HOME VISIT, WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO ADOPT TO HOMES IN THE NORTHERN VA / MARYLAND / DC METRO AREA**\n\nWe have adoption events EVERY SATURDAY from 12-3 p.m. Please note that not all dogs can attend every event, so if you are interested in meeting a particular dog, please complete a no-obligation application on our website at http://www.muttloverescue.org/application.html OR write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nUpcoming adoption events:\n\nMutt Love Rescue is doing everything we can to ensure the health and safety of our volunteers and adopters while continuing our mission to find homes for as many dogs as possible.\n\nEffective immediately, we will not be holding our weekly adoption events. Dogs available for adoption can be met by appointment only. Potential adopters should submit an online application at http://muttloverescue.org/application.html. Once we receive your application, we will contact you to let you know the next steps.\n\nWe are always desperate for foster homes, now more than ever. If you are interested in fostering during this difficult time, please complete an application... unless you are a previous adopter/foster, then you can just contact us via phone (703-988-2608) or email (adopt@muttloverescue.org) to tell us which dog you want to foster!\n\nFor information on sponsoring this dog, please write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nWE NEED FOSTER HOMES! FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE EMAIL ADOPT@MUTTLOVERESCUE.ORG.\n\nVisit us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/muttloverescue\nFollow us on Twitter: @Muttlove_Rescue",

With the classic smarts and high trainability of this great herding breed, he needs focused accomplishments to occupy his mind. Augie is on a great path in his dog savvy foster home where he is learning agility skills, getting consistent mental and physical stimulation and lots of time with his people. He is seeking a forever home who will continue that journey.\n\nOnce Augie has connected with his person, he is deeply affectionate, and enjoys major snuggles at the end of a busy day. Augie loves to explore, and is happy to hop in the car and go on adventures; he makes a great sidekick! \n\nOur trainer feels this clever boy is a great agility or rally dog prospect. He enjoys walks and hikes, but most of all he likes to use his brain to learn new things. Because of his herding dog heritage, he would do best in a home without children. Augie can be selective with his dog friends so needs to be a solo dog in his forever home, and he finds dog parks too stressful so needs other forms of exercise. \n\nAugie is house trained, crate trained, excellent on leash, and ready to find an experienced forever home who will enjoy going on Augie doggie adventures with him!\n\n\nThank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (https://anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible organization. ANCAR is a foster-based rescue, and we adopt within a 90 mile radius of Bedford Hills, NY.  You will find the adoption application here:(https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/).\nPlease read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) so you'll know what to expect when you submit.  All fields on the application must be completed in order for our volunteers to process it (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/) \n\nOur dogs are in foster care and we do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. This is a firm policy. Our busy volunteers are not able to respond to questions about the dog or dog meeting requests in the absence of an application.  We know these dogs very well because they are in foster care, so please read the profiles of the dog(s) you are interested prior to submitting.  If there are specific requirements stated (ie: Fenced Yard or Canine Friend Required) these are included because they are vital to the happiness, health and safety of that dog. \n\nWe are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering,  and microchipping before transporting our dogs. Then, we provide all supplies, preventatives and any follow up vet care necessary while they are in foster care. These costs are high and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you. We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources, so if you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through the kindness of supporters like you that we are 'changing lives...one tail at a time' by providing our dogs with 'A New Chance.' (https://anewchancear.org) \n\nThanks so much.",

            "description": "Duke is a handsome adult male Catahoula mix with stock dog instincts typical of his breed, also known to be very affectionate with their family! Looking at his athletic body profile we wonder if he might have some Greyhound or Whippet in him, with those long legs and delicate head.  Sadly his family decided to surrender him for adoption due to personal difficulties.  They advise that Duke might not be the best choice for a home with very small children, as he does his best to herd them together and keep 'em corraled!  Though he gets along fine with other dogs Duke does love to chase cats, so your feline friends would definitely not welcome him into the family.   Duke will do best with regular exercise and would make a wonderful walking or jogging companion.  His adoption fee of $95 includes completed neuter surgery and up to date vaccinations, worming, flea control and heartworm prevention. There's also a separate one-time charge of $10.99 for his lifetime, transferable microchip registration with HomeAgain.  If your \"grand duchy\" could use a new Duke, please GO TO WWW.SPCAOFMC.COM and click on the green arrow icon near the top of the page to fill out an online adoption application.  Thanks for thinking rescue!",

He\u2019s been deployed overseas and has to leave behind his beautiful dog Sargent. With no one to take Sargent in, Sargent was surrendered on July 12, 2019. We thank his owner for his service. We know heading off to war and leaving your best buddy behind is absolutely heartbreaking. We promised we\u2019d to do whatever we could to find Sargent his forever loving home, but after 18 months this gorgeous boy is still waiting.\nSargent is an awesome dog. He was 18 months old when he arrived but now he's almost 3.  He certainly doesn't deserve to spend his life in a shelter. He\u2019s thought to be a Boxer/Australian Shepherd mix. Sargent is a handsome boy with a tan and white coat and one brown and one partial blue eye. His ears are expressive and he looks at you as if he knows what you\u2019re saying. Sargent is on the bigger side weighing 72 pounds. Sargent is mostly house-broken but could use some consistent training to make him just about perfect. He\u2019s smart and knows some commands like sit and shake. Sargent has a lot of energy and will enjoy being part of an active family that\u2019s able to keep his body and mind going. He\u2019s game for most anything. Sargent has a high prey drive. Hedoes not seem to like other dogs and especially doesn\u2019t like cats and will need to be in a home without them.  Sargent fears stressful situations and that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s in. We hope his stay with us will be short, but that depends on us sharing his story far and wide and finding his home. Please help us pass along his story!\nSargent wasn\u2019t expecting the turn that his life took and we hope he remains as strong as his owner. So far he\u2019s hanging in there, but we know it\u2019s not easy on him. If you\u2019re looking for a wonderful companion dog to welcome into your family, come meet Sargent. You\u2019ll not only be helping Sargent, but also a solder serving our country.\nSargent is microchipped, neutered, and current on vaccinations.\nCall 706-865-4135 for information on additional health services provided as part of the adoption fee. If interested in one of our puppies or dogs, please submit an application online or at the shelter. Applications can be submitted online at: https://www.charlessmithgallhumanesociety.org/page/dog- adoption-application\nOnce an application is submitted online, you will receive an email saying your application has been successfully submitted. If you don\u2019t receive this email within 24 hours, please check to make sure all application fields were completed or please call our shelter at 706-865-4135. All adopters must complete an approval process which involves a reference check with current/recent vet and a brief home visit if located in the immediate area. We do permit out of state adoptions. Adopters MUST come to the shelter to transport their new family member home. We do not ship nor do we transport them to their new homes. Adoption policies and application procedures are detailed at the shelter website: http://smithgallhumanesociety.org/ under tab All Adoptable Animals.\nCharles Smithgall Humane Society (CSHS) is a No kill shelter. Animals in our care remain safe with us until adopted. Resident animals are primarily owner relinquished and also accepted from local Animal Control. The facility usually is operating at capacity with a list of animals waiting for space to open.\nAdoptions and meet and greets are being scheduled by appointment only. Please call our office, email us or complete an application and someone will be in touch just as soon as they can.an.",

Bonny is good with other dogs, though she needs a slow introduction.  She does have leash aggression, so she needs someone strong enough to handle this big girl, and also needs someone willing to work with her on this. She is a very fast learner - keeps impressing us with how quickly she learns commands.  She is unbelievably smart and learned \"sit\" in about 15 minutes!  She is house trained and crate trained. Bonny has medium energy - she mainly likes to follow you around and hang out with you, but also can be found playing in the yard!",
