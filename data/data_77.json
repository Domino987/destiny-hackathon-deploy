He has the cutest face, and a wonderful smile, but Chuck does need a proper introduction to new people in order to illicit those lovely looks. It is an absolute requirement that Chuck go to an ADULT ONLY HOME. Please do not call us regarding Chuck if you have children in the home. While Chuck is very dog social in the yard with the other dogs, he has some guarding tendencies that show up in the home, therefore he will be placed as an only pet.

            "description": "This dog is being fostered in Dallas TX and must be adopted within the Dallas, North Central Texas or the southern Oklahoma area.\n\nNAME:               Betsy\nGENDER:          Female (Spayed)\nAGE:                   About 3 years\nWEIGHT:          About 6.5 pounds\nDOGS/CATS:  Needs to be an only dog, Unknown with cats\nCHILDREN:     Should be fine with older, mature children (10 and older)\n\nIntroducing adorable Betsy. This girl has a fun and sweet personality. We adore her, and think that you will too.\n\nBetsy was found running lost in the Arlington TX area. She had no collar, no tags and no microchip. She had obviously been lost for awhile as she was thin, covered in dirt and had very long nails. The Arlington Animal Shelter kept her safe and patiently waited for her owner to come to find her. When no owners stepped up, they reached out to CRT to see if we could provide a safe landing space as she searched for a forever home. We were thrilled to say yes.\n\nThe longer Betsy is in our program, the more we think she would do best as an only dog.  While Betsy gets along with the other Chihuahua in her foster home, she wants it on her terms.  Betsy does like to be the \u201cboss\u201d and will occasionally let the other dog know that she wants to be in charge \u2013 LOL.  It is starting to cause friction.  So we are updating her bio to say maybe an only dog situation where she can bask in all the love would be best!  Betsy also loves toys of all kinds. She has a favorite stuffed animal that she will carry around the house. And oh how she loves balls. She LOVES to play catch and hopes that her humans will play fetch with her every day. Our photographer captured some great pictures of Betsy with her ball (see her complete bio and photo shoot on our CRT website for adorable pictures of this.)\n\nBetsy is a loving girl who wants someone she can snuggle with and show her affection. Betsy is a bit shy when she first meets new people, but she warms up quickly. Betsy loves to snuggle with her humans. She is adorable in all aspects and wants to be your best friend! She loves to be in the same room you are in. Betsy especially enjoys being on your lap in the evenings as you relax together. When not on your lap, she has a favorite pillow in front of the fireplace that she is enjoying during these cooler days.\n\nBetsy is super smart. She has learned to \u201csit\u201d. She picked up on the routines in her foster home very quickly. She is an energetic dog that loves to play. We believe the ideal home for Betsy would be an energetic, active home that would play with her every day. She would be best as an only do (her amily will need to spend lots of time with her). There are no children in her foster home, but we believe she would be fine with older, mature children (10 and older). She will bark at sounds, but settles down quickly.\n\nBetsy is about 3 years old. She weighs a perfect 6.5 pounds and is fully grown. Betsy is tan with white highlights. She has perky ears. She also has a shorter tail (we are not sure if she was born that way, or something happened along the way, but her tail is constantly wagging). Betsy adores people so much. She would be great for a work at home family as she could actively share love with you all day long!\n\nBetsy is doing well on her potty training. She will go to the door to let you know she has to go out to potty. At night, she loves sleeping with her humans, and snuggling under the covers with them. Betsy does well on a leash and we believe she would enjoy short walks with her family.\n\nBetsy is being fostered in the DFW (Texas) area. If this sweet girl sounds like the right fit for your home, our CRT adoption form can be found at: http://www.chihuahua-rescue.com/adoption-application/\n\nBetsy is spayed, micro chipped, up-to-date on shots, HW negative and on heartworm prevention. She is ready to join a loving family \u2013 could that family be yours?\n\nThis dog is a CRT rescue. Reference checks, adoption contract and $270.63 adoption donation required ($250 adoption donation and $20.63 Texas Sales Tax). Note: as of 1-1-20, the Texas State Comptroller office is requiring all rescue groups to collect sales tax on adoptions, even though we are all 501c3. We are all fighting this, but for now, have been told it is non-negotiable.\n\nAs part of our mission to reduce the number of unwanted and sick dogs, we require that all current pets are spayed or neutered, current on vaccinations and taking heart worm prevention. Applications will not be considered if one or more of these requirements are not met.\n\nAfter filling out an adoption application (found at http://www.chihuahua-rescue.com/adoption-application/), please email DFWCoordinator@chihuahua-rescue.com if you are interested in this dog. Please be sure to read about our adoption process and then fill out an adoption application before emailing the contact person.",

Her black-and-silver markings and intelligent face are hints to the special dog she can be, once comfortable with you.  She\u2019s still a tad bewildered in her new environment and seems to lack socialization with other dogs.  Mid-energy Reina walks well on leash but will react to dogs who get in her face.  She exhibits similar behavior in playgroups, where she will snap if a dog approaches her.  Our trainer is working with this shepherd beauty but, for now, she needs to be the only dog in your home.\n\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website and Facebook page!

He is a bit timid at first but opens up quickly with lots of love and treats.\n\n**Words from Maverick: woof!\n\n\"The names, Maverick!\nPeople don't know it yet but I'm pretty pawsome. I've been at the shelter for a minute now and I see a lot of other dogs come and go, the ones that leave go somewhere called their forever homes that include lots of room to run, sleep on fluffy beds, treats, more time with the humans that give them lots of pets and hugs! I love hugs and pets a lot!\nThe humans at the shelter spend time with me, and I don't like it when they try and leave. I get kind of sad so I try following them...\nThey use to give me medicated baths because I use to have no hair on my rear! I was good for those and don't really need them now but my skin may flare up sometimes.\nI know I'm not a bad dog...Just have some things I need to work on and figure out, like this word \"sit\" that these humans keep nagging me about when they hold those yummy treats... I keep barking for them to just give it to me but they just hold it there...what the hecks that about?!\nI love the humans, but I haven't decided if I want any siblings when I go to a forever home, I see other dogs here all the time and some I have disagreements with while others its like whatever.... I see these things called cats up in a window looking down on me and I just have staring contest with them....they always win...I get distracted when I see a human or toys!\nAnyway...I'm going to stay pawsitive that someday I'll find a forever home too because they sound so cool!\n\nLove,\nMaverick! ?",

            "description": "Chelsea is another one of the five dogs that was seized from the same property that Cowboy came from. She is a very sweet dog, but she is also not good with cats. She walks very well on a leash and will sit for treats.  HW-; 44lbs; 4 yrs old; 11/24; female; lab mix\n\nPretty in Pink!  Petite Chelsea is just as cute as cute gets!  This smaller framed bully mix is meek and quiet in her approach and gave me the once over as I hooked her up for a walk.   The good news for both of us is that in no time,  she was slowly sauntering out to our front play yard where we were greeted with a nice warm sun on what was a chilly winter day.  Chelsea is slow and steady and is never in any real rush.   Super polite and calm in meeting other dogs,  she did a wonderful job slowly sniffing and checking out both a male and female dog.  Once the sniffs were complete,  her interest in the pet was sated and she went on her way.  Chelsea is not a clingy/needy girl and does not ask for much.  Her big gifts for us today were small cracked little smiles of gratitude, an occasional sniff of our faces and hands and the always very steady wagging tail.  We really enjoyed Chelsea and so will you!! \n\nhttps://youtu.be/6YuZSqrvHVg\nBlue and Chelsea\n\nchelsea and dani\nhttps://youtu.be/nLRjjbjKWMA",

            "description": "Stark is a very special boy who will need a patient, special family. He has a laundry list of medical problems, the least of which is a need to put some meat on his bones. This is due to the fact he has \"\"mega esophagus\"\", meaning the tube that carries food and liquid between the mouth and stomach gets larger and loses its ability to move food into the stomach. Thankfully, Stark is not showing any clinical signs of this issue, meaning he does not regurgitate his food at this point. We do however used raised bowls to feed him and have him on a low fat, prescription diet that is good for dogs with this condition. \n\nWhile Stark is only 2 and a half years old... and he also has what is called \"\"myasthenia gravis\"\", his legs are showing a lot of improvement! He has slowly been able to start walking and even running without too many problems from his back legs. Stark is a wonderful boy who has a lot to give to a family who is willing to help him learn how to best enjoy life, despite the medical issues he has. \nThe vet would like to set the goal of being able to eventually taper off his meds, however at this point in time, we cannot say for certain whether this will happen. The vet is extremely pleased with how well he responded to the medicine and does have high hopes that he will eventually be able to be weaned off it. Stark is going to be a lot of work for his family, but promises he will do his best to make it all worth it! \n\nOnce Stark is comfortable with his people he is extremely loving, yet still independent enough to not need constant attention, while preferring to be near his people. He is pretty much house trained, despite the fact that none of his legs are working wonderfully. While with his foster, he has not needed crated and has not shown destructive tendencies. Frankly, Stark sleeps on the couch at night like a lump! He's a smart boy who has become a sit and shake pro! Stark loves other dogs and has been able to begin playing with his foster brother while his legs are learning to keep up with him! Stark gets a little too excited when getting treats sometimes (don't we all?), but once he is told \"\"easy\"\" remembers that he should still have some manners. Stark doesn't get too excited over toys, but he is starting to occasionally enjoy a good tennis ball. Stark is learning to walk on a leash, and while not animal or person reactive, is still learning basic leash manners. He is definitely a very special boy with some special needs that are totally worth the trouble.\n\nStark is microchipped, up to date on vaccines, and heartworm negative. Because of his condition, we are going to wait until he is more stable to neuter him. Stark's adoption fee is $150 and it will be in the contract that you must take him to be neutered at our vet in approximately 6 months to a year when he is ready. This will be schedule by us and paid for at our expense. If you think you could be the special family that Stark needs, you can submit an application for him at www.pawpatroldayton.com/adopt. \n\n**Please research both myasthenia gravis and mega esophagus prior to applying for this sweet boy to ensure you understand the care he will require.** All of our animals are vaccinated, micro-chipped and spayed/neutered before being adopted.",

I have lived in a home before and learned all my house manners, just might need a brush up! I love my exercise, so I hope my family loves to go on walks, but I'm no marathon runner. Maybe a leisurely stroll through the park to stop and smell the roses! Sometimes I get nervous around other dogs, so I'd love to meet your pups here at the shelter first before getting adopted.

She is a small-medium sized dog around 35 pounds and due to her shy personality she did not like all the energy from the young children in her previous home. Mara can be skittish with new people but once she trusts you she becomes very lovable and playful. She loves taking long walks and playing with her stuffed toys. Mara will do best as the only dog in her forever home and can possibly live with a dog-savvy cat after a slow introduction.Please visit the following link on our website to learn about Second Chance's adoption process. http://www.2ndchanceanimalcenter.org/adoption.html",

            "description": "In June 2020, our Gorgeous Greta was found as a city stray in New York, and was transferred to the Brooklyn outpost of NYCACC. As time passed, Shelter staff ascertained that Greta was pregnant, and then her options for adoption fizzled. She sat in the shelter for almost 6 weeks during the summer of COVID, until we could transport her safely to our Connecticut Rescue.\n\nThe Rescue process is extremely upsetting to most dogs, and not the ideal scenario for whelping pups. Despite all the traumatic changes, Greta sailed through her intake process, making friends at every turn. Once she was released to us, she continued to show a delightful personality and balanced nature. She gave birth to 6 healthy puppies on July 27, 2020.\n\n\nGreta was a first rate Mama, and now that she has fulfilled her responsibilities, she is ready to live her best life. Greta doesn't have the over-the-top energy that we see so often in other members of the Bully breeds. She has a relatively calm demeanor and is easy to handle on lead. She would be an excellent choice for a novice Bully owner.\n\nOf course, Bullies are higher energy than most dog breeds, so even though Greta is calm for a Bully, she still needs sufficient exercise to be happy. She has a strong, yet nimble physique, but is slightly chunky at 65 pounds, and is working on a 10 pound weight loss. Her coat is short, manageable and easy to groom. Greta is mostly tan with a striking white tuxedo markings.\n\nGreta loves the outdoors, and enjoys her walks even in the harsh weather. She would be an ideal walking companion, and would do well with one to two brisk leash walks each day, plus focussed playtime and obedience work. She has had a good deal of obedience training, and knows all her basic commands. She has begun her Canine Good Citizen program and impresses us every day. Adopters should continue her program, and develop her full potential. Bullies as loving as a Greta should be the Breed Ambassadors.\n\nGreta could join just about any kind of active home. She is generally well behaved, and friendly to all. Although she is fairly easy to handle, she may overwhelm toddlers, but she'd be fine with older children and other well behaved dogs. We have not tested her with cats.\n\nGreta has excellent house manners, and at the age of three, is well past the puppy mayhem stage. She is house trained and crate trained, although adopters should expect to troubleshoot the occasional accident that may occur as she adjusts to a new routine. Greta is a calm car passenger, and behaves well in public.\n\nGreta has been spayed and vaccinated for routine shots. She has had a negative 4snap test, and has been microchipped and dewormed. If you are interested in Greta, please write to Denise at Angelsfrgod@aol.com or call Denise at 860-908-9738 for more info.\n",

            "description": "Name: Barry\nSuspected Breed(s): Collie mix\nGender: Male\nAge: 9 months old\nWeight: 73.5 lbs\nPersonality: adaptable, loyal, playful, eager to please, quick learner, snuggler, smart, protective, trainable, friendly\nObservations with Dogs: Barry needs training to properly greet other dogs when on walks. That said, he has fun and plays well with the resident dogs in his previous and current foster home.\nObservations with Cats: Barry does well with cats.\nObservations with Kids: Barry enjoys playing with the tweens in his foster home. He may be a bit much for a home with young children, as he may inadvertently knock a young child over while trying to show his love.\nHouse Training Progress: No recent accidents. \nCrate Training Progress: Dislikes the crate, but is well-behaved in the home and is trusted to be left uncrated.\nLocation: DC area foster\nRescued From: Roane County, WV\nAdditional Information: Barry is a big, adorable lovebug at home. He is a pro at doing tricks for treats, and he already knows sit, shake, down, wait, and come. Barry also enjoys playing with his toys (he loves to chew!) and chasing the ball around. He has a lot of energy and would love an adopter with a big yard or who likes to go on runs or hikes! Barry is an extra-large puppy! He's affectionate and is still learning leash manners, so he needs an adopter who is willing to work on training to help him mature into the polite dog we know he can be. He gets along well with the resident dog at his foster home, but Barry is a big boy who gets over-excited when he encounters other dogs on walks. Speaking of excitement, Barry loves greeting new humans, and he is learning that jumping up is not the best way to show that joy.\n\nIn addition to being movie star handsome, Barry is well behaved in the house and very friendly and playful. He will talk to you like Chewbacca when he is excited about something like a walk or a meal, or just to tell you he loves you. (For this reason he may not be the best fit for an apartment building.) Barry is also a good watchdog; he'll let you know a package is delivered before the porch pirates have a chance. He loves kids and is playful with other dogs and seems fine with cats. Barry is BIG. If you love big dogs (and who doesn't?) he might be just the one for you.\n\nBarry is sponsored by Kevin R. Thank you for saving a life!\n\n__________________________________\n\nIf you are interested in meeting a dog or cat, we require an adoption application. If the animal has \"HAS APPLICATION\" listed, they are still available to receive additional applications but also may be in the process of being adopted soon. Apply for a DOG: http://www.citydogsrescuedc.org/adoptable-dogs.html\n\nInterested in saving more lives? Foster a dog today! Learn more, see our list of dogs needing foster, and apply, https://www.citydogsrescuedc.org/foster-a-city-dog.html\n\nCity Dogs Rescue & City Kitties is a foster-based rescue in Washington, DC. We do not have a shelter. We focus on local adoptions in DC and the metro area of Maryland and Virginia. CDR&CK has a thorough adoption process in order to find the best possible fit for each of our dogs and cats (we do not operate under a first-come, first served model).\n\nUpon accepting a new cat or dog into the organization, we provide a basic vet visit that includes necessary vaccinations, disease screenings, deworming, microchips, and spay/neuter (unless specified). We do not provide a comprehensive medical exam prior to adoption. As a result, sickness, injury, and disability may exist unbeknownst to CDR&CK. City Dogs Rescue & City Kitties is not responsible for payment of any vet care, including known and unknown medical conditions once a cat or dog is adopted from us. \nDog specific: Rabies, DHPP, Bordatella vaccines. They are tested for HW, Lyme, Ehrlichia, Anaplasmosis.\n\nMost cats and dogs will have a house training accident in the initial days in their new home and we cannot guarantee any pet is housebroken or crate trained.\n\nWe also update our Facebook page daily with new cats and dogs.",

I will need someone that is able to give me lots of time to adjust and move slowly as I learn to be the best dog ever. I am used to being an independent, outside dog so I am still adjusting to the cushy, home life and will need some guidance. I really love being inside, but I haven't quite figured out how to be comfortable with constant companionship yet. I really prefer the company of adults to kids. I think of myself as a very mature guy and want to keep mature company. Because I have been so independent my whole life, I would be best as the only pet in the home. My biggest quirk is that I am a very social eater! I would love to have a spot at the dinner table next to you! If you are ready to have a dog that you can bond with over training, I'm exactly the guy for you! Come adopt me today.",

Odie is a 1 year old dog that is very smart. He knows how to sit, shake, walk on a leash and he also does well with being on a leash while someone is riding their bike. He does have one testicle so his neutering is going to possibly be more expensive. He needs to be in a home without young kids as well as a home without other animals as he has dog aggression. \nHe would do best with a single person or a couple looking for someone who would be looking for an active dog!\n\nIf you are interested, you may need to visit a few times to gain his trust. You will need to set up an appointment to meet him, please no walk ins to meet Odie. Please call 715-284-0251 for more info",

He is good with cats, dogs and he's been around kids 10+.\n\nHe is still playful and loves his toys! The only indication that he is a senior man is he has trouble hopping up onto the furniture. So he will require joint supplements to help with that.

This two-year old, 45# mixed-breed beauty, is a world-class snuggler and will crawl onto your lap at every opportunity. She likes to nap in the sunbeam and loves neighborhood walks. But she\u2019s still full of puppy energy and will make you laugh if you give her a fenced yard or tether so she can zoom and jump. She knows basic commands, is quickly learning leash skills, and sleeps in her crate at night. She does need some training, because because she gets riled up around excitable dogs, but she really just wants to play. She could be happy living with a dog that\u2019s calmer/older (or a dog-compatible cat). Apply to learn more\u2014you won\u2019t regret it, because this dog is made of love and fun!\n\nInterested in meeting Mira? \n\nAll Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue dogs are in homes with foster families; we do not have a shelter where dogs are available for daily viewing.\n\nOur process is as follows:\n1.  Review our policies and adoption radius  on our website: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n2.  Submit an application for review and approval;\n3.  MPM Rescue reviews application and checks vet records and references;\n4.  MPM foster contacts approved applicant(s) to arrange a home check and meeting with available dog(s);\n5.   If there is a good fit, adoption is completed with a contract and fees (payable via check or cash).\n\nThe adoption fee is listed here: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n\nDogs from Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Age appropriate vaccinations\n- Heartworm test (for dogs over 6mo) and treatment if positive\n- Microchip\n- Deworming\n- Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\n- Any other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\n*Please note that the identified breed(s) are best guesses. We very rarely have information on our dogs' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays.*",

Marvin is mostly house trained, is selectively deaf (only hears when and what he wants to), and gets along reasonably well with other small, non-aggressive doggies. Marvin did some stray time before he came to us super-skinny, but he's gotten stronger and grown some thicker fur, as well as feeling much more energetic these days. He was neutered as part of his vet care, and he is modeling his 'collar of shame' in one of his photos, but he's over that now. He's also had major dental work, so his mouth is healthy too! Marvin is your basic companion pet who acts like he has a lot of life left in him. He appreciates human attention (gentle, and preferably adult), likes his meals and his visits to the yard for restroom duty and squirrel/bird prevention, and naps when he so desires... Basically, Marvin is a great pet for the person who appreciates a loving senior with a lot of personality!",

            "description": "Outdoor enthusiasts, meet Edith the adventure pup! Edie, as she\u2019s affectionately called by her foster family, is a 33-lb Border Collie/Lab/Terrier mix born in February 2020. This little smarty loves taking her people on hikes and learning new tricks.\n\nFound on the side of the road with a leg injury as a puppy, Edie came to us needing medical help. She also needed to know love and safety, and she got that in spades in her foster home. She\u2019s a happy girl that will make her new family smile every day.\n\nEdie wants a family that loves exploring the world: hiking at state parks and forests, camping, traveling and generally spending lots of time outside. A lover of new places and new things, Edie needs to keep her mind and body active through regular exercise and mental engagement, including puzzle toys and slow feeders, as examples.\n\nVery people oriented, Edie wants to know what\u2019s going on in her home and will follow her family from room to room. She can entertain herself while you work, playing with toys and napping on her bed. Edie can live with older kids, but she might accidentally scratch or knock over littles. Edie can be an only dog or have a canine sibling - as long as her people are around and engaged with her, she\u2019s happy. Kitties are a little too tempting, so only cat-free homes will be considered.\n\nSilly, sweet and just the right amount of sassy, this girl loves to learn! Edie has mastered many basic behaviors, tricks and walks well on a leash. She wants a patient family to help her through a dislike of having her nails done without manhandling; she needs a kind and positive environment in which to thrive.\n\nAs wonderful as she is, Edie is not a first-timer\u2019s dog. While out and about, if she\u2019s surprised by something, she reacts by barking and raising her hackles. She can also be slightly selfish with resources, whether toys, food or people. A family with herding breed experience and a background of helping dogs gain confidence and turn to their owners for guidance would be an excellent fit.\n\nEdith is located in Minneapolis/St. Paul. If you think you're a good fit for Edith, please fill out an application at hoabcr.org/how-to-adopt  \n\nAs a foster-based rescue, we do not have a central facility to visit. Meet and greets with specific dogs are arranged once your adoption application (not an inquiry email through Petfinder) has been received, processed, and approved. We are located in Minnesota and adopt to an area 400 miles from Minneapolis/St. Paul.\n\nEdith's adoption fee is $350 + MN sales tax. She is spayed, microchipped and up to date on vaccinations.",

At the time of her rescue she had patches of missing hair but did not get diagnosed as having demodex mange until several months into foster care. Her hair has grown back in now and she looks great. Apricot is spayed, microchipped, has all vaccinations, is heartworm negative and weighs 38 pounds. We call her a 'pocket Chow.'\nApricot/Peaches is a fun loving, playful spirit enjoying giving doggie kisses and going on walks. She enjoys sunning outside and chasing squirrels. She sleeps any where but typically is near the bed on a rug. She is a perfect house mate and will make an excellent companion. Traveling she takes in stride and car rides are the best! Children are fine and cats in the house are fine but outside cats would be chased. She does great with smaller dogs and male dogs, we are not sure about other female dogs. Bathing and grooming is ok with her also. Vet visits are OK too.\nAn approved application is required for adoption. Her adoption donation is 300.00.\nTejas Rescued Pet Adoptions . PO Box 790372 .

Owners are required to ask for an adoption fee from adopters.\n\nThis is the information that we received from Truly's current foster:\n\nHello, I found this dog a few months ago. I have 4 other dogs and it isn't working out. I feel like she would be great for a one dog family with room to run. \n\nHer name is Truly. According to the vet, she's about a year and 3 months old.  I'm not sure what mixed breed she is - some kind of working or Heeler or something. She would be a great dog if she's the only one. Truly doesn't get along that great with other dogs. She seems ok with cats. I'm not sure how she would do with kids.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this beautiful girl, please contact Rhonda at: rhondaaubin@gmail.com",

This sweet boy does well with other dogs but prefers females. So if you have other dogs at home it's best to bring them in for a keep and greet prior to adoption. Corbin is definitely a ladies man. He loves going on walks and exploring but he also likes his down time. Corbin enjoys comfy beds and absolutely loves his toys. When he takes naps during the day he loves to snuggle with his stuffed toys. He is also house broken/crate trained and walks great on a leash. Corbin is a very sweet and social boy who would be a great fit into just about any home! His adoption fee is $125 and includes his neuter, microchip, rabies vaccine and heartworm test. Corbin is heartworm negative.All animals unless otherwise noted in their descriptions are at 1825 Airport Road, Rockwall, TX. Hours of operation are Monday through Friday 9 AM - 6 PM and Saturday 9 AM - 5 PM.

            "description": "Hi, my name is Bo. I am a 5 year old male pointer/pit mix that weighs about 60 lbs. I am neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccinations, and heartworm negative. I have been in this rescue a long time but have only now gained enough confidence to be adopted. You see, I am a very timid guy thanks to an unfortunate past. But since coming into the rescue, I have been with wonderful fosters that showed me love and understanding. I have been trained by Serenity K9 whose awesome trainers totally boosted my confidence. I walk very well on a leash, I know \"\"place\"\" and \"\"sit\"\", and I am learning other tricks too. My adopter will also receive lifetime support on my training through Serenity K9! Overall, I'm very well behaved, although I am still learning what is and isn't appropriate to chew now that I'm getting to know what being an \"\"inside\"\" dog is all about (I am getting a LOT better about this though!). I am house trained and crate trained. I am extremely sweet and do well with all dogs, although I haven't been cat tested (just ask and the rescue will test me!). I would probably do well around children who are polite and sweet with me, but I have not been tested around children. Even though I have gained lots of confidence since coming into the rescue, I am still relatively unsure and insecure, especially with new people and new situations. I will need an owner that can understand my insecurities and show me that this world is a nice and safe one. My adoptive home will need to have at least one female in the household, and men in the family will need to be patient with me as I tend to be less trusting of males. I would probably also do best in a home with at least one other confident dog to be a good role model and friend/playmate for me. My fur is also really soft so you will love petting me, and I love being pet too once I trust you. I'm looking for my furever family...maybe that will be you?\n\nIf you are interested in giving Bo a forever home, please visit the link below to fill out an application! http://fureverafterrescue.org/adoption-application.html It is best to submit an application through a computer. We have experienced some problems when applications have been submitted using a mobile device. *When you submit the application, you are not obligated to adopt however it does reserve for you the opportunity to adopt that particular animal.

He came to us with a bad skin condition and is now healing well. He is still growing his coat back in. He is a great medium sized dog. If he could be for you, please fill out an application today.\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project (www.animalrescueproject.org) is committed to the best possible veterinary care for the pets it rescues and it is looking for adopters who will be similarly committed.\n\nAll dogs and puppies are given a general check-up when they enter our program. They receive medication to remove any intestinal parasites (worms), fleas, and ticks they may have. Dogs greater than six months of age are checked for heartworm. If heartworm positive, the Animal Rescue Project treats the disease. Dogs and pups receive all age-appropriate vaccinations for distemper, and dogs greater than four months of age are also vaccinated for rabies, in compliance with State of Michigan laws. All dogs will be microchips as well. \n\nMost dogs and older puppies are spayed or neutered before adoption. In the case of puppies not old enough to be safely sterilized, a $50 deposit is required at the time of adoption and is refunded to the adopter with proof of sterilization.\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project requires every adopter to establish an active relationship with a veterinarian no later than 10 days after adoption. Adopters will receive a plan for routine veterinary care at the time of adoption and are expected to work with their vet to complete the plan.",

Despite being a puppy, he only chews his own toys and is completely house-trained! He's also very smart and eager to please, so it's easy to train him. Kelev is easily scared, so he would do best in a relatively calm environment without other dogs, and with older kids. When he's comfortable, he enjoys cuddling with you. He's otherwise quite independent and is ok being left alone too. Because of his fear the behaviorist has Kelev on anti-anxiety medicine, and this helps him a great deal. Kelev has been in the same home since he was 8 weeks old, and hasn't had any traumas. He's only being put up for adoption because his current home has young children and another dog. Kelev would thrive in an environment where he's more comfortable.",

            "description": "Meet Rafa, a 1 year old Anatolian Shepherd mix! Rafa is an energetic guy who loves to race around a large yard. Rafa enjoys other high energy dogs to play with, lots of fun toys, and working for treats. A perfect day for Rafa would include lots of play time in the yard, stopping by a training class, and snuggling up in your lap. Rafa does not love walking on leash yet and therefore would not be an ideal dog for apartment living or a home with shared walls - we are working on his leash skills tho and have confidence it\u2019s going to click one day soon! If your family loves the outdoors and is looking for an active pup that can keep up with lots of adventures,  you might be a good match for Rafa! \n\nALL children should be at least AGE 5 to be approved for adoption!\n\nFill out an application at our website below to be considered for adoption.  This dog is available in the NJ Area.  We will contact you if we need further information.  We cannot directly reply to all applications.  \n\nPlease apply directly at WWW.BIGDOGRESCUEPROJECT.ORG/Adopt.\n\nOur adoption fee of $425 includes  age appropriate vaccinations, microchipping and transport expenses. Spay/Neuter at 6 months of age is provided at select vets to NJ residents for $20. Details provided upon adoption. \n\nApplication will be accepted and an adopter chosen based on the needs of the dog.  We will contact you if you are chosen to adopt.  \n\nApplications can be made at bigdogrescueproject.org/adopt.  Please use the NJ Application. Thank you for considering Big Dog Rescue Project.",

She also loves to follow you around from room to room.\n\nPretty Miss Ivory is DEAF and has a few other congenital issues that the adopter needs to know and consider when thinking about adding her to their family. \n\nIvory is 5 month old, 25# (1/26) looking for a special home willing to teach her all the things dogs should know- and in her case, with Sign Language. Her foster home is working on the basics- sit, down, go outside, yes, come. She is treat motivated- making training a lot more fun. It is good to have done your research on Deaf Dogs before considering adoption of one as there are a lot of good basics to know going into it. \n Her foster home thinks that she would do best in a home where she would have another friendly/playful dog who could help teach her the ways. She loves her doggie siblings in foster care. \n They also think she would be better in a house not apartment and a home without young kids. She startles easily from her sleep/being snuck up on (normal for deaf dogs) and for this reason young, playful, unknowing kids might not be great for her. \n She is working on crate training at night and when her fosters are away at work. She does make a lot of noise to start- but does settle down after time. Her fosters recommend continuing crate training in her future as she loves to drag shoes and clothes all over the house. \n\nIvory has early kidney failure based on blood tests. When she arrived at Underdog it was found that she had ectopic ureter (malformation of kidney and a ureter that didn\u2019t connect to bladder correctly). With this, Ivory had the one bad kidney removed. Most dogs do fine with one kidney. However Ivory\u2019s one kidney isn\u2019t fully functioning. She will almost certainly not have a long life (unknown months or years). She will need a special food for her kidney and frequent kidney lab values drawn. This is something an adopter needs to consider. It may also mean added medications and fluid therapy in her future. \n\nBeing both deaf and having kidney issues at birth, it is likely there could be other congenital issues/abnormalities that haven\u2019t surfaced yet. \n With her light pink skin- it is also good to keep in mind she may have higher risk for certain allergies and skin issues. \nPrior to adoption we encourage reaching out to your personal vet or Underdogs Vet Service to discuss any concerns and to keep in mind the financial responsibility that will come with extra vetting. \n\nInterested in this sweet dog? Apply today at http://www.underdogpetrescue.org/dog-application\n\n**Please note: Our animals live in foster homes throughout the Madison area. We do not have a shelter where animals are available for daily viewing. Applying is the first step in our process.**\n\nDogs from Underdog Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\nSpay/Neuter\nRabies, Distemper, and Bordetella Vaccinations (as age appropriate-puppy adopters may need to cover some vaccine boosters)\nHeartworm Test (for dogs over 6mo)\nMicrochip\nDeworming\nHeartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\nAny other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\nOur adult dog adoption fee is $300. Our puppy (under 5 mo) is $375. Our senior dog (over 8 yrs) is $250.\n\n*Please note that all breeds noted are estimates or best guesses. We very rarely have information on our animals' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays*",

To arrange a meet and greet with a dog, you MUST fill out the adoption application so that it can be sent to the foster parent for review to determine if your home is a match for the dog. If a dog receives multiple applications, we operate on a best-fit basis, not first come first served.***\n\nHi, my name is Callen! I am a 4-6 year old hound mix with such a big heart. I love attention and give affection as freely as it will be accepted. A couple of months ago I found myself in a county shelter. My sweet personality and unique ear patterns caught my foster's mom eye, and when I was at risk of being euthanized due to a foot injury, she took me home! \n\nI am crate trained, though I will bark when crated, mostly house trained (I have only had a few accidents when anxious), and harness trained. I currently have four-legged foster siblings and foster mom thinks that I would do best in a forever home with a four-legged companion because I love to play! I also don't love to be alone, so having a fur-friend to keep me company helps when the humans leave. I am currently on an anti-anxiety medication (fluoxetine aka Prozac) to help stop the barking when I am crated and to help me feel more comfortable when I am alone. Luckily it is a cheap medication. It isn't clear whether I will need it long-term, or if I'll be able to be weaned off of it if I no longer have to be crated in my forever home! \n\nThere is a doggy door in my foster home and me and one of my foster siblings are left loose to go in and out as we please. I am not destructive when I am left loose which foster mom really appreciates! She says I am such a good boy, she just wishes I wouldn't bark so much in the crate. I have loved every person I've met. Like I said before, I am super affectionate and I have the most soulful eyes! \n\nI am very excited to find my perfect forever home! Just to give a quick recap, my perfect forever home would include the following:\n\n1. Another playful doggy\n2. A fenced in backyard\n3. A family that is around a lot \n4. Affectionate humans\n5. A free-standing home so if I am crated my barking won't disturb the neighbors\n6. Lots and lots of ear and belly scratchies! \n\nI am neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, microchipped, have been dewormed, and am current on my monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventatives. My adoption fee is $300. If you think I could be the one, please fill out an adoption application on our website: www.secondchancenc.org. Thank you!",

PLEASE READ THIS UPDATED INFORMATION FROM HER CURRENT FOSTER MOM:\nEmber is a super sweet, Lab mix (probably mixed with some sort of Bully Breed) who was recently rescued from a high kill shelter after being abandoned in someone's yard and brought into the shelter by animal control. She is a beautiful girl and is estimated to be around three years of age and weighs 57 lbs. She shared her last home with a small dog with no issues and is currently in a foster home with a male dog who is her size and they get along fine. She also got along very well with other dogs at the sending shelter and we have videos to prove it. You can tell by watching her video that she feels kind of lost and really can use some love. We are sure that she will give it back tenfold. She is great with people and thrives on attention. Ember loves to be with her people and will follow them wherever they go.  She sits on command and will sit for her food. She is house trained.  She is crate trained and sleeps in her crate but would love to share a bed with her new family. Ember enjoys playing with toys and running around the yard. She enjoys being outside despite the cold temperatures here in PA and would love having a fenced-in yard to play in. Ember was cat tested at the sending shelter and did an okay job at meeting the kitties. Ember is spayed, micro-chipped and is current with her vaccinations. She has also recently been treated for heart-worm disease and is past her \"restricted activity\" phase of her recovery. If you would like adopt this beautiful dog, please submit the adoption application through our website OneLifeToLiveRescue.com today! A rescue volunteer will then be in touch with you to answer any questions that you might have and to discuss our ever popular \"Foster-to-Adopt\" program with you. The recommended adoption donation for Ember is $325 to help with the cost of vet bills. Thank you for your consideration of giving a wonderful home to a beautiful, rescued Lab Mix. We are trying to strictly follow all suggested safety precautions during the COVID-19 pandemic. All recommendations will be respected with as limited person-to-person contact as allowed. Masks are required at this time during any and all interaction with others.. We promise to do our best to keep everyone safe while helping our dogs find loving homes during these trying times.\n",

Please read our Frequently Asked Questions and Adoption Processed Explained documentation.\n_________ B I O ______________\n\nName:Aleks\nSize: ~Large range: 61-100 lbs\nAdoption Donation:$250 (applicable sales tax included).Adoption fees may be paid by cash or check.\nOther:Neutered Male, Vaccinations current, Microchip, No Cats, Older considerate children only, Not apartment-friendly, Fence Required\n\n*\nAleks needs to go to a home with another dog - he needs a dog buddy to help him feel comfortable and confident!\n\nAlekswould love to be your boy!\n\nFoster Home Feedback\n\n*\nNo Cats, older considerate children, Not apartment-friendly, Needs a dog buddy and fenced-in yard\n\n12/11/2020: Aleks is sensitive to stress and will need time to decompress in his new home. His favorite place to relax and relieve some stress and anxiety is outside, so a fenced-in yard is a must for him. He is also on medication to help with his anxiety and he does well with taking his pills.\n\nAleks will do best with a home that has someone who can dedicate time to help him adjust easier and work on any behaviors that may arise. We think a dog buddy would be best for Aleks so he has someone to take cues from. We think this will help make his transition a little easier as well. Aleks loves attention and wants to have it often. He enjoys laying on laps and getting as close as he can. He prefers to have bones to chew on and toys to play with available at all times\n\nAleks has not been in his kennel for the last couple of weeks and he has done great! He sleeps on a dog bed on the floor of our bedroom and doesn't make a peep all night. Aleks is free to roam the house while we are gone and we have not had any problems.\n\n10/22/2020: Aleks' toe has finally healed and he is ready to go to his furever home! Aleks is such a happy guy and has lots of energy. He loves playing with our dogs, spending time outside, and playing with his tennis ball.\n\nHe has done really well with 2 puppies we fostered and is getting along even better with our own dogs. Aleks continues to improve on entertaining himself when we are busy and the other dogs don't want to play. He loves to have plenty of toys and bones to chew on and he also enjoys playing fetch in the house with his tennis balls.\n\nAleks loves to get lots of attention. He prefers to lay on top of his people and get up close and personal while he gets his pets. Aleks has a tendency to use his paws a lot when he wants attention and it is something we are working on with him\n\n8/19/2020: Aleks still loves to spend time outside. His favorite things to do are sit and watch the birds and squirrels, chase bugs while they fly around, wrestle and play chase with our other dogs, and lay around. He does not like the lawnmower and prefers to be inside while that is going. Aleks was pretty excited to go on walks again after a week-long break due to his surgery. The poor guy broke one of his toes, so he is restricted to his kennel for the time being, but we are going to use this time to get lots of cuddles and pets in.\n\nAlong with physical exercise, he also enjoys mental exercise. He's found a love for any toy where he has to figure out how to get treats out. Aleks loves to bat around any ball that he can find. When he's inside and not playing, Aleks enjoys cuddling on the couch and giving his people kisses. He's currently working on sitting before he goes outside, before his leash is put on, and before he gets to go out the gate to begin his walk. Alex loves to be brushed, especially on his head and behind his ears, although he may try to walk away after a while.\n\nAt night, Aleks goes into his kennel after being told to \"get in your kennel\". Sometimes, Aleks will go lay in his kennel before you say anything if he is tired. On the way to the kennel, he occasionally likes to stop and pick up his favorite toy and bring it in his kennel to sleep with him. Aleks sleeps in his kennel and does not make a peep all night, but, I think he would love to sleep on the bed with his people if he could.\n\n8/11/2020: Aleks continues to improve while he's staying with us! He recently found out it's okay to play with toys. When he's in the mood to play, he enjoys throwing his favorite toy in the air and going to get it. Aleks likes to cuddle and be pressed up against his people, which is made a little difficult because of his cone, but we make due. He loves to be scratched on his head! Aleks is also learning to sit, lay down, and shake. I think his favorite part about the training is the hot dogs. Aleks has not chewed on anything he shouldn't or had any accidents. Aleks is also learning to relax inside of the house. He will lay down and also sleep even when he's not in his kennel.\n\n8/7/2020: Aleks is a very energetic boy. He will gladly go on a walk anytime he can. He is a young dog that unfortunately hasn't had a lot of experience or training on the correct ways to meet and interact with new dogs and people. Aleks jumps and barks when meeting new people which can be intimidating due to his size. He also will mouth people when he gets over-excited. We are working on these manors with him and his adopter would need to be willing to continue to work with him. He has already improved a lot in the few days with us. Aleks is very friendly with both but gets excited and is unintentionally rude. He would probably benefit from being with a dog that has experience dealing with younger dogs that don't have perfect etiquette to help him learn how to best interact with new dogs. He does not get along very well with our cat. He barks and whines whenever he sees her. Aleks would probably do best in a cat-free home.\n\nAleks loves his time outside and would love a family that likes to chill in the backyard as much as he does. We have a fenced-in yard and he seems to relax and calm down when outside. Aleks is a little unsure of the indoors at this point and spends a lot of time pacing and checking closets and corners. He is beginning to get more comfortable.To view additional dogs available for adoption, please see our website: www.4luvofdog.org",

He prefers lots of snacks and ear scratches. Bucky is very playful and social with other dogs. \n\nBucky would benefit from a family that is well versed in basic obedience training, as he is currently learning basic commands such as sit, wait, and impulse control as he is a high energy pup. His foster family reports that he is HIGHLY food motivated and eager to please, and is responding well to training. Buckaroo now waits for his meals and will rest in his crate during the daytime on his own.  He is learning about city life and startles to bikes/mopeds (he came from a rural area). \n\nWe are looking for the following in Bucky's forever home:\n- 6 ft Fenced yard \n- If you have children, over the age of 15+ as Bucky is a very high energy dog\n- If you have another dog, medium and large breeds that are dog friendly are preferred as Bucky is very active\n- Prior dog experience and basic obedience training\n\nIf you are interested in making Bucky a part of your family, please apply to adopt him at www.strongpawsrescue.org and fill out an application!\n",

            "description": "Brooklyn von Berching is a beautiful 3 year old German Shepherd. Brooklyn is absolutely stunning, smart and sweet, especially with her humans! She enjoys pack walks with other dogs but she\u2019ll always prefer to be your one and only (and she's a no for cats). She is excited when exiting her kennel and has an air of confidence. We think she may be housebroken. Her leash manners/training are ready to be continued with her forever human, as she aims to please! Brooklyn is always happy to give and receive affection from her handler. She has German Shepherd loyalty, intelligence and confidence but does need someone experienced to make sure those qualities are fine-tuned to make her a great companion.  If you\u2019re looking for a vibrant gal and want to have your own personal buddy, Brooklyn\u2019s the one for you!\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website and Facebook page!

Lady is a 3 year old Shepherd mix with glossy fur in a black and brown mix.  She is house-broken, loves car rides, and knows commands. Lady is a little \"fluffy\" and like most of us, could lose a few pounds.  She gets along with male dogs, but not female.

            "description": "Caleb is a 2 year old Terrier/ Poodle found as a stray in the streets of Mexico and brought to a local high kill shelter. Caleb has spent time with fosters and has been working with our volunteers to help build his trust and gain confidence. He is hesitant to move when he is on a leash but walks well when with another dog. He does not show any aggression and he reacts well with other dogs and is starting to learn to interact and play. We have also learned that Caleb has a heart murmur which may require life long medication and will require regular vet visits. This is a manageable condition but he will require someone willing to love him and care for his medical needs. He has the sweetest face and you can tell he wants to show love. This boy deserves a great second chance! Please email muellenbergerin@gmail.com for more questions or message our Instagram account: @ahome4ever_rescue Thanks!\n\n---\n\nCome meet our dogs Saturdays and Sundays at Petsmart in Costa Mesa from 11:30-2:30. All A Home 4 Ever Rescue dogs receive a wellness exam by our veterinarian and are up to date with vaccinations. They are spayed or neutered and microchipped before they go to their adoptive families.

            "description": "HEADS UP: Due to the large number of covid 19 cases in the community, the high hospitalization rates etc, the DFW Dachshund Rescue program will be closed to new adoptions (those that weren't already agreed to before January 1rst) until March 1rst. Most of our volunteers are over 50, and we are using caution until things improve. If you are interested in adopting, contact us after March 1rst.\n\nHIS STORY: Carisi, R.G. (he goes by \"R.G.\") is a red smooth male dachshund/chihuahua mix who is the size of a small standard dachshund. He is a very intelligent, affectionate but extremely energetic dog. He learns quickly, but needs a home that is very active and has another small to medium sized dog for him to play with. An individual or family considering this dog needs to have the commitment and time to take him regularly to dog sport type classes such as agility or obedience. He is not a dog for an inexperienced owner nor for someone whose own level of physical activity is limited. R.G. will make an active individual or family a delightful and fun companion. d.\n\nCan you give Carisi, R.G. a loving, permanent  home with lots of attention? If so, read the rest of the information below and then contact us for an adoption application. Please be aware that our adoption applications are sent out by postal mail only, and are not sent by e-mail nor are they available on-line.  \n \nBefore you contact us for an application, please be sure you take some time to read and learn about this breed. Dachshunds are personable and intelligent; however  they  take extra time and patience to housetrain and it is important to know this before you apply to adopt. There are many good books about Dachshunds currently available. Time spent reading one or two of them is well worth it. \n \nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS: In order to be considered for adoption through DFW Dachshund Rescue Foundation, you must: Be over 21 years of age and have verifiable identification to that effect. Be able to verify that you may have a pet where you live. Live within the immediate Dallas/Fort Worth area. We appreciate your understanding and hope that, if you live outside this area, you will consider adopting a pet from a rescue group that services your particular geographic area. Be prepared to make a donation to our rescue efforts of $250. Be willing to fill out an adoption application, the entire contents of which will be verified upon receipt. Be aware that vet references will be verified to confirm current pets are altered, up to date on vaccinations as well as being annually tested for heartworms and regularly taking heartworm preventative. Have a complete, secure, and safely fenced yard. Be prepared to have a home visit from one of the rescue foundation members as part of the screening process to adopt this dog. During the home visit, our representative will do a brief temperament evaluation of all current dogs in the household. We are unable to adopt to homes where any current dogs exhibit people-aggressive or dog-aggressive behaviors during the home visit. In addition, while we do not preclude adopters who currently own large breed dogs, due to size differential and a dachshund's predisposition to spinal injuries, we are also not able to adopt to homes when the board determines there may be potential for injury to the dachshund. This is to ensure a safe match for our rescued dachshunds. Understand that DFW Dachshund Rescue Foundation has the right to deny any application. \n\nPHOTOGRAPHY COPYRIGHT: We are fortunate to have Teresa Berg, professional photographer, work with our foundation in regard to photographing rescue dogs in the program. Please note that the Federal Copyright Act protects photographers by giving the author of the photograph the exclusive right to reproduce them. This includes the right to control the making of copies. It is illegal to copy, reproduce or display these photographs elsewhere without the photographer's permission, and violaters of this Federal Law will be subject to its civil and criminal penalties.\n\nLOCATION OF DOGS: Be aware that we do not have a public kennel facility for our dogs; our rescue dogs are fostered with individual families throughout the DFW Metroplex area. \n\nVET CARE FOR RESCUE DOGS: All rescue dogs are spayed/neutered, fully immunized, tested for parasites (and treated if needed) and tested for heartworms (and treated if needed). In addition, each dog receives a basic blood profile, has a dental cleaning (very young dogs may not need this) and is microchipped. Any infections or other health related issues identified by our veterinary clinic will also be treated. It is our goal to have the dog in excellent health by the time he or she goes to an adoptive home. \n\nMEETING DOGS: We do not permit visits to any of the rescue dogs until an interested household has filled out an application, and had a reference, vet and home check. Only screened and approved applicants may visit dogs available for adoption through our program. We will not hold dogs for homes that have not yet been approved by our rescue committee. If there is a dog you are interested in applying for, do indicate that in your application, but realize other applicants may be considering that particular dog as well. This is especially true in the case of female dachshunds and puppies. Unlike city animal shelters, we do not use a first come, first served philosophy when it comes to placing dogs from our program. Our goal is to thoughtfully and carefully select the correct home for the dog, and the correct dog for a particular home. The rescue foundation board has final approval on any adoptions for dogs from this program. After the home visit has been completed, the board will consult with the foster parent and/or home visit coordinator and make a determination on the proposed adoption. Decisions by the rescue board are final. \n\nAPARTMENTS/TOWNHOUSES: While we do not preclude adopters who live in apartments or townhouses, be aware that most dachshunds bark a lot and often do not make good apartment/townhouse dogs. We rarely have apartment/townhouse suitable dachshunds available for adoption. If you live in an apartment or townhouse and wish to apply, be aware that you may wait a year or more for a suitable dachshund from our program. In addition, for safety reasons, your apartment/townhouse must have ground floor access. \n\nCHILDREN: While we do not preclude families with children as potential adopters, it is important to be aware that dachshunds and other small and toy breeds, as a rule, do not respond well to the sudden moves, higher activity level and more impulsive behaviors typically shown by children under 10 years of age. Please be aware that we do not often get dachshunds that are a good match for homes with young children; so anyone applying may experience a longer wait. Instead, you may want to expand your search to breeds that are known to be better with children; such as Labradors, golden retrievers and boxers. Larger dogs may be better able to tolerate the activity, noise and rough play that occur in a home with children. Another choice is to postpone the adoption of a dog until your children are older and more mature and better suited to living with a small dog. \n\nPUPPIES: We rarely, if ever, have puppies available in our rescue program. If you are interested in a puppy, please contact us for the puppy referral packet to reputable breeders in our area. Please be aware that when we do have puppies or dogs under 1 year of age, they will not be placed in homes where they will be the only dog. \n\nCAT OWNERS: If you are planning to apply to adopt a dachshund, and own a cat(s), please take into consideration the fact that dachshunds are a hound breed. They tend to view a cat as prey and in many cases, a cat may not be safe living in a home with a dachshund. Occasionally, we have a dachshund who has previously lived successfully with a cat and a dog like this can be adopted to a home with a cat. However, please understand that if we tell you a dachshund(s) will not be good with a cat, we know this to be true, and we will not bring a dog like this for a trial visit with you, for the safety and well-being of your cat. \n\nOur adoption application has been designed to evaluate potential adopters to ensure that each person who adopts a dachshund is not only aware of the responsibility that comes with adopting a dog, but also to address the suitability and permanence of each dachshund placed in a new home. When considering a new home, our goal is to make the best possible match for each of our rescued Dachshunds. These special dogs deserve the stability of a permanent home where they will be loved, secure and safe for their rest of their lives.",

That\u2019s her, always wants to be by your side or on your lap. \nShe\u2019s no grumpy gal - she gets along with other dogs and with cats!\nShe is puppy pad trained, so no worries there.\nTeeth? Who needs them? Peanut Berry says she only needs one. She has a great appetite and has mastered the puppy dog eyes. It\u2019s hard to resister her looking up at you while you eat dinner. She\u2019s just hoping for a dropped morsel or two. \nPeanut Berry was rescued from a high kill shelter and is now residing in a foster home with a pack of chihuahuas.\nShe is a gentle and quiet soul who just wants someone to love her in her golden years. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

Heaven one of our dogs in boarding. Heaven is looking for a foster or even better, a forever home. Heaven cannot be with other dogs or pets, but she loves her humans. Heaven is great with children of all ages and loves meeting new people. Heaven has been temperament tested with humans and passed with flying colors. Yes, Heaven is a stunningly beautiful silver-blue lady, but she is so much more. Heaven would make such a great emotional support dog and even though Heaven is not a specially trained 'service dog', not all dogs need special training to be emotional support dogs. Heaven can provide emotional support by giving unending love, friendship, and companionship. Because Heaven wants to be by your side she would be a tremendous help to anyone who may feel isolated or anyone who may be having difficulty showing emotions because when you look into those big doe-eyes, your heart will melt. If you are looking for a companion who wants to bond closely with you, who wants to be by your side, and who has an unending supply of love and affection to give, that's our Heaven! She is very polite and waits before eating her food and will wait politely at doors. Heaven knows all her basic commands and loves it when you ask her to shake with her paw. Heaven is crate trained and fully house broken. Heaven must be the only dog in the home, and she cannot be with cats or other pets due to her extremely high prey drive. 2/2/21 5:06 PM",

He would do much better in a rural setting; urban environments give him too much stimuli to react off of. This rural farm boy loves riding on ATVs, tractors and riding mowers. He would be a great farm dog because he is good with livestock and farm animals. He does get along with other dogs and cats, but behavior needs to monitored closely for potential triggers. He does not hear vocal warning signs from other dogs and his style of play is not always well received. We suspect iHop suffers from some sort of PTSD. We feel he would make a wonderful companion to someone who has also suffered traumatic experiences. He loves to be around people and is a very good companion. iHop requires daily medication to control seizures.",

            "description": "Meet Bradley! Bradley is a 2 year old lab mix. This handsome guy loves to play, but also likes to curl up with you for attention. Bradley needs a home with no small children (under 10 due to energy/playfulness) and without cats. Bradley has done well with other dogs his size. Bradley needs an active family to help him burn that puppy energy. A fenced in yard is preferred for adopting Bradley. If you would like to make Bradley a part of your family, please fill out an adoption application at www.barktownrescue.org\nAdoption Fee: $170\n\n*Due to Covid 19 restrictions some of our new intakes vet scheduling has been delayed. We will still go ahead and schedule your meet and greet even if all the vetting needed has not been completed. Once vetting is complete the approved adopter will be able to take their dog/cat home to their forever home.The shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at the dog's predominant breed or breed mix. We strongly encourage you to select your new pet by looking at each dog's individual personality and pet qualities rather than relying on a breed label that is only our best guess.\n\nOur adoption fees vary from $150 and up. All of our dogs are up to date on vaccines, heart worm preventives, and flea/tick medication, and will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Portions of your adoption fee also help care for the sick and injured animals that we take in. Thank you for supporting us and considering a rescue dog!",

He is a great dog. \n\nVERY IMPORTANT!! COMES WITH BOARD AND TRAIN CONTRACT. HAS BEEN PROFESSIONALLY TRAINED WITH TOP TRAINER AND CONTRACT INCLUDED FOR LIFE WITH NO COST TO ADOPTER-\n\nWhiskey is almost four years old, born in March of 2017, and is a very sweet and loyal dog. He loves to play in the grass and go on walks and has been proven to be very well behaved when given the proper care and attention. Very affectionate and eager to please. \n\nUnfortunately, he has had two incidents in which he nipped a person coming into the home unexpectedly who had been drinking, but there was no injury to either person. \n\nHe needs a very structured home with a dedicated owner. It is also highly recommended, if not necessary, to keep in contact with the trainer to help build the kind of structure he needs. The trainer knows him very well and will ensure the easiest transition possible, and will come at no cost to the new owner.",

Unfortunately it seems Timmy has developed some food aggression and their were two different incidents one involving food where Timmy bit a toddler in the family. We would hate for this to be the end of Timmys story so we are posting him again in hopes to find him a home with no children. Timmy is sweet and playful and loves car rides. He loves playing fetch and would be a great dog for long hikes or runs. Timmy will need a dedicated owner who would not be opposed to setting boundaries for him and providing him with training. \nIf Timmy seems like he would be a good fit for your family please email us at Pinkheartrescue@gmail.com",

            "description": "Lulu is the perfect combination of silly and sweet. She is eager to please, loves her human and dog companions, and believes she's a professional MMA wrestler in her spare time. \n\nLulu came to us from a rural shelter in South Carolina with her ten puppies. When they arrived, Lulu had no hair due to severe flea infestation combined with mange, she was extremely underweight, and she had BB pellets embedded in several places under her skin. It took weeks for shelter workers to earn her trust, and as soon as they did, Lulu and her puppies tested positive for parvo despite strict quarantine procedures at the shelter. Luckily, Lulu and her puppies received early treatment and they all survived! Lulu's ten puppies were quickly adopted, but Lulu had a much harder time with trusting both new humans and new environments. \n\nLulu's foster mom worked hard for months to build up her confidence, get her used to leash-walking, and to teach her what toys are! Now Lulu absolutely loves to play, especially with other dogs of all sizes. Lulu derives confidence from having another dog and can only go to a home with at least one other medium-high energy pup. She is extremely silly and her zoomies are incredibly fun to watch! \n\nLulu is wonderful with women and kids 10+ and does warm up to men given time and treats. She is a pup who loves to use her paws to \"\"boop\"\" both human and dog family members, so families should be able and willing to use appropriate positive redirection. \n\nLulu is wonderful in the car, walks well on a leash, and is learning that outings and adventures are fun opportunities rather than scary experiences. \n\nLulu is crate trained and house trained, as well as medically cleared to go home! She takes prozac once a day to help her with her fears -- she loves to scarf up her meds with peanut butter.\n\nHi and thank you for your interest in adopting from The Foster Farm!\n\nCOVID-19 UPDATE: Due to the overwhelming amount of applications, calls, and emails regarding our currently available pets, we cannot respond to everyone at this time. We appreciate your enthusiasm to rescue a new family member, but please be aware that we simply do not have enough pets in foster care to meet demands at this time. \n\nWE ARE NOT DOING OUT-OF-STATE ADOPTIONS AT THIS TIME.\n\nIn order to help us process your application, please include as much detail and information as possible. Our adoption process is not first come first serve - we work extremely hard to meet the needs of every pet individually, and we do not base our matches on appearances (color, coat length, etc.). \n\nIf you're inquiring about our adoption process, please visit thefosterfarm.org/adopt for information, policies, and procedures. \n\nIf you have submitted an application at thefosterfarm.org/adopt and received the confirmation email from Cognito Forms (your receipt will appear as a copy of the application you submitted), we are reviewing your application. If you are approved to adopt, you will receive an email approval within 72 business hours (Monday through Friday only)! Because our organization is run entirely by four volunteers each with full-time jobs, families, personal pets, and foster animals, we are only able to reach out to approved applicants. \n\nThank you so much for your patience and understanding as we all navigate these exceptional circumstances together!\n\nStay healthy and safe!\nThe Foster Farm Team",

            "description": "Mama G here! I am a gorgeous Pit Bull mix found as a stray. I appeared to be well taken care of, so I am not sure why my family let me go. Oh well, time to move on to better things I suppose! Initially I can be nervous of new people, but I don\u2019t take terribly long to warm up. Yummy snacks sure do help that process speed up! I would do best with kids over 12 years old due to that and that I get easily over stimulated when excited, grabby for my toys, etc. What can I say? I am very enthusiastic! I love to play with toys and prefer to keep myself occupied. I will trade for something else, so that is best to do if you want something I have. I know sit, paw and down, a smart cookie really. I would love an active family as I do like to run around and be silly! I will need a feline free home. I wasn\u2019t fond of the cat I met, at all. As for dogs, I was a little taken back by the energetic dog I met here. I might prefer a calmer friend or I don\u2019t mind to be your only love!",

He can be very sweet and engaging with people, but he does need an adult home and a confident handler. He is working on proper leash-walking skills, including when he's around other dogs. He\u2019s excited when he exits the rescue \u2013 ready to go.  Although he doesn\u2019t like being corrected on leash (like an adolescent), he can meet and walk well with other dogs and enjoys their company -- well, except for some pushy types he meets in playgroups.  Nero is young, smart and capable of continuing to learn how to be a good German Shepherd. Now he just needs the opportunity. \n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website!

He ventures out of his kennel excited and ready to go on a walk but, with some coaching, will focus his attention back to you.  He needs to keep up with his leash-training, and Westside is happy to provide one free training session for Bruno upon adoption. We think he may be housebroken. When he meets other dogs, he can seem a little pushy at first and will be more comfortable around calm, easy-going types.

I'm young and need lots of training (I'm working on learning sit and walk better on a leash right now). I love treats and am very treat motivated, so they can be a great learning tool for me. I won't even notice how hard I'm working for one! I'm looking for a family who can take the time necessary to train me and turn me into a well behaved boy.

            "description": "Hi there friends! My name is Winchester! I am a very happy and very active boy! I just love to play it is the best thing in the whole world to me! I would do best in a home that has 5 years or older kids. I can be a little mouthy and I wouldn't want to hurt the little kids. Did I mention I like to play? I get excited about the toys and when they are thrown I'll chase but I'm not too sure what to do with them after that...I can tell you a secret though, I pounce on them like a kitty. I also love to wiggle my nub ALL THE TIME!! I get very excited to meet other dogs and I want them to be my friends just sometimes they think I'm a bit too much so they get a bit irritated, that's ok though I can settle down believe it or not. Sometimes I just get so happy and excited I can't help myself. If you are looking for a guy like me come on in and lets get to know each other.",

He tries really hard but he's just now getting used to manners being requested of him.  It's really hard for him to remember to not jump on you.  He also has an odd habit of dropping to the ground and leaving his rear waving in the air when you attempt to put a collar on him.  He is approximately two years old and is a bicolor German Shepherd.\n\nCayden has been neutered and tested for heartworms and intestinal parasites.  He is current on his vaccinations, deworming, heartworm prevention and Flea and Tick Prevention.  Cayden's adoption fee is $350 and includes a microchip.  Come meet his handsome boy today!\n\nTo request an Adoption Application, email rescue@southwesthospital.com. \n\nRecycled Rovers Rescue reserves the right to deny any application that is deemed unsuitable for the animal. \n\nPlease be aware that our animal adoptions are NOT on a first come-first serve basis. Our sole purpose is to find the best possible home for the animals that fall under our care. \n\nPriority will be given to local applicants and previous adopters.",

He is a perfect example of a \"couch potato\" and would do best in a home that is willing to give him a space of his own when new people come around.\n\nSampson is a special guy with lots of love to give. He needs an experienced owner with no kids, cats or dogs. He'll need you to provide the love, patience, and treats. while he provides the snuggles and lasting memories.\n\nSampson is also part of our \"Forever Foster Program.\" This means you provide the loving home and care, while the QCAWC provides his training and medical expenses.\n\nDo you think you could be the one to give Sampson a home to live out his golden years?

He was malnourished and had a massive skin infection.  He had little to no hair on his ears, feet, or abdomen.  He is a bit of a doofus and loves to smile at his friends! He loves to rough house with his doggy friends.  \n\nDue to Apollo's early life of neglect and undersocialization, it does take him a bit to warm up to you but once he counts you as a friend you're in forever!  \n\nApollo has been neutered, is heartworm negative and current on his preventatives.  He is ready to be adopted at this time!",

Well, as you can see by my photos, I\u2019m a handsome brindle Boxer with a black mask \u2013 the ladies think I\u2019m very dapper! They say I\u2019m about 4 years young and very sweet. I love all dogs and even cats! I\u2019d like to work on my physique some as I came in to Rockin P from the shelter and was very thin. Not a bad thing to have to eat more \u2013 so I\u2019m not missing any meals! Once I put more weight on, I will start treatment for these nasty things called heart worms. BUT once that\u2019s done in about 5-6 weeks, I\u2019ll be more than ready for my forever home! Bring it on 2021! If I can be your New Year\u2019s baby and you can open your home to a sweet boy like me, please put BEAU on the application.\n\nThis dog is being fostered near Jacksonville, AL. You must be willing to drive part if not all of the way to pick up this dog for adoption unless transportation to another state has been arranged.  Please contact us with any questions. \n\nPlease visit Rockin' P Rescue, Inc. to submit an online adoption application.  www.rockinprescue.org\n\n\nAdoption contributions are as follows: \n* $300.00 for a dog 6 months and under\n* $250.00 for a dog aged 7 months to 1 year \n* $225.00 for a dog over one year",

            "description": "Miles -\nAvailable for Adoption /or Foster\nFriends of Stanly County Animals Rescue\n\nMy name is Miles, or as my foster parents call me Mr. Miles.  I'm 4.5 yrs old and weigh 85 lbs. I have been with my foster parents for 4 months basically on a trial run towards adoption. Currently, I walk at least 1 to 4 miles almost everyday at a pace of between 17:30 and19 minutes per mile. I am friends with my foster parent's older female dog and their 4 cats. I don't react at all. \n\nMy best fit would be a home where I am the only dog. I really don't care to be around other dogs. I love my foster family so I automatically protect our home. \n\nPeople dropping by the house with their dogs isn't ideal. I like some of the neighbor'dogs, but still feel this need to protect my home.\n\nI enjoy long walks and I'm learning not to pull on the leash.\n\nI\u2019m learning to pull less and pay more attention to my foster's  directions. The gentle lead leash seems to work well for me.\n\nI need someone who can continue to teach me. I really enjoy being outside so I can walk, smell, see the scenery. This may sound funny, but I love watching the buzzards fly.  When an emergency vehicle comes by I have a beautiful howl that sounds like the siren.  I do have separation anxiety when my foster parents are out of the room or leave the house. I pant and whine, but eventually I do go back to my spot on the couch or floor.  I try to offer my paw wanting love and affection. I love to play with toys and some minor fetching, but only when I\u2019m on the mood.  I love a lot of affection, love, and treats; except for peanut butter, which surprised my foster mother.  I do love car rides.  My ideal home would be where I am the only dog, and I'm able to go out and walk. My other personality loves being a couch potato.  I do not like dog crates. I'm not sure why..  When my foster parents were trying to crate train me, I got one of my front paw pads stuck in the crate door trying to get it open and eventually broke the latch on the door.  Since then I have been sleeping in my foster parents bedroom on the floor at night. Ideally, I would like a home where I don't have to crated. I can still use some training, especially while out walking or letting someone know it's time for a bathroom break.  Currently, I go out 3-4 times a day.  I will not poop in my own yard, although I will while out walking.  My foster parents have tried to train me to poop in the yard, but I won\u2019t always.  I do know how to sit, come, paw, and up, but I sometimes don\u2019t want to listen.  While walking I know cross means I speed up my walk and cross street.  Turn means turn left.  Right means turn right and stay on right,  I'm still working with this sometimes.  Heal I am still working on.  I am good with kids, but I would not want a child under age 5 as I may jump up on them or they could hurt me and not mean to.\n\nAdoption Application Link:  \nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJcO2I9-K8FMjB9CNflX9xbOpIRjc0gyxzYtdkRn6zPluovw/viewform",

I\u2019m told I have a gorgeous brindle coat and warm brown eyes \u2013 plus I\u2019m young at about 3 years old. I would fit in well with most families and make a great companion. Thank goodness the nice people at the rescue pulled me from a rural shelter where I\u2019d have no hopes to be adopted. I do have these nasty things called heart worms but they are treating me so I will be healthy and ready for my forever home in 3-4 weeks \u2013 just in time for Christmas!! If you are ready for my sweet self- please put EMMA on your application.\n\nThis dog is being fostered near Jacksonville, AL. You must be willing to drive part if not all of the way to pick up this dog for adoption unless transportation to another state has been arranged.  Please contact us with any questions. \n\nPlease visit Rockin' P Rescue, Inc. to submit an online adoption application.  www.rockinprescue.org\n\n\nAdoption contributions are as follows: \n* $300.00 for a dog 6 months and under\n* $250.00 for a dog aged 7 months to 1 year \n* $225.00 for a dog over one year",

She is gentle and loving. Nina  likes to play with squeaky toys but doesn\u2019t seem to indulge in rough housing with other dogs. She gets along well with other dogs but has not been tested with cats. Nina would do well with respectful children over the age of 10 years. \n\nNina loves to go for a walk on her leash and does well on car rides. Nina would like a home where her people are home most of the time and she would LOVE a home where she could sleep in the big bed and snuggle under the covers. \n\nNina does have some separation anxiety and will cry and bark when left in her crate.  Nina is crate and house trained but like all dachshunds she will need to be reminded and encouraged to go outside on a regular schedule. Like  all dogs she will need to be confident in her environment to have good potty habits. All rescue dogs go thru a period of adjustment so understanding and patience is important. \n\nNina loves to eat and is not a fussy girl . Nina takes medication daily to aid in seizure prevention. Nina has not had a seizure since coming into rescue and her vet feels as though she may be tapered off of this medication. \n\nNina is ready for a forever home.  Are you ready to welcome Nina home? Apply to adopt her today! \n",

Especially with other female dogs but would do well with a male with a slow introduction. I\u2019m smart and know I could learn a lot of things \u2013 I just need some more help with training to get there! I\u2019d love to have my own forever family so please put AJ on your application to make me the happiest pup alive!\n\nThis dog is being fostered near Jacksonville, AL.

He has a handsome tan coat and black markings, and mascara markings around his eyes. He can be wary of strangers right now, but once he gets to know you he'll give you plenty of affection and roll right over for a tummy rub. He's protective and needs someone who can handle a large, strong dog and give him attention and love. We think this big guy will reward you with big Cash dividends, so please come see him soon!",

Everyone always wants to grab my cheeks which I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m an English Bulldog with maybe a little mix of American Bulldog \u2013 but either way I\u2019m a \u201cbully breed\u201d through and through with my Bulldog attitude people love! I\u2019m ~ 4 years young and weigh a healthy 45 lbs. I\u2019ve got this thing on my eye common for Bulldogs called cherry eye but the nice donations at the rescue will enable me to have it fixed before adoption dapper as can be. Did I mention I LOVE balls and entertain myself for long periods of time if I have lots of them? I love being a Bulldog and am stubborn and want my way so my new home needs to be firm yet loving so I respect and obey. I\u2019m a vocal guy too and love to snort and grunt \u2013 wouldn\u2019t you love to fill your home with all my Bulldog characteristics? If so, I\u2019m ready and so deserving so please put HANK on your application.\n\nThis dog is being fostered near Jacksonville, AL.   You must be willing to drive part if not all of the way to pick up this dog for adoption unless transportation to another state has been arranged.  Please contact us with any questions. \n\nPlease visit Rockin' P Rescue, Inc. to submit an online adoption application.  www.rockinprescue.org\n\n\nAdoption contributions are as follows: \n* $300.00 for a dog 6 months and under\n* $250.00 for a dog aged 7 months to 1 year \n* $225.00 for a dog over one year",

            "description": "This is Lucho, a three-year-old, ten pound deer-head Chihuahua who is very excited to meet his new family!  He loves being with people and is always looking to see what is going on.  He wants to be right in the middle of his foster family's activity and he loves to take long walks or play in the yard no matter the weather.  He also loves playing with his plush toys and likes to carry them out in the yard with him.  Lucho loves affection and pets!\n\nLucho is a happy go lucky guy who adores his people but he does have some Chihuahua quirks which would make his ideal home a single owner with no other pets.  Lucho does show some resource guarding when he is on the couch or bed and may bite.  For example, if he is cuddling on the couch with his person and someone else comes over to give affection to the person he is sitting with, Lucho may bite them.  His previous owner was a single, older person who did not take him out much or introduce him to many people so he is learning to adjust to different experiences .  Lucho loves everyone he has met since moving in with his foster mom but please take things slowly.\n\nLucho finds other dogs scary at first but can adjust to being around them if they are easy-going and not confrontational.  He had a foster sister who was a three-pound Chihuahua, and still found her a bit scary but he did like lying next to her on the couch since she seemed to like me.  Right now he is living with two other small male dogs and while he tolerates them he would prefer to have his owner all to himself.  Lucho does have a bit of barrier aggression with the other dogs and becomes very reactive when they go near his crate or if he sees them through the sliding glass door.\n\nWe will be prioritizing applications that are a single owner with no other pets but we may consider two people if they have experience dealing with resource guarding.  We would also consider a single person with one dog who would may be a good fit for Lucho.  Please detail your experience with resource guarding on your application.\n\nIf you are interested in finding out more about Lucho, please fill out an application on our website by copying and pasting the following link into your browser:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2JnZqK5\n\nLucho is being fostered in Millbury, MA and the adoption fee is $300.\n\n\"Like\" Broken Tail Rescue on Facebook! https://www.facebook.com/brokentailrescue/\n\nNOTE:  Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n\nWe expect that all adopted dogs will enroll in a formal dog training class with their new owners.  Obedience and training classes are an excellent way to learn more about your newly adopted dog, gain handling and training experience, and improve your relationship with your pet.",

They came into the shelter on Nov. 20 as lost dogs and no one has come to claim them. They are both about 2 years old; Xity weighs 66 pounds and Drago weigh 62. They are very sweet and a little shy.  Both are up-to-date on vaccinations, now altered and will be heartworm tested and microchipped upon adoption. Come meet Drago in Run 807 with ID#626087; his sister Xity is in Run 802 with ID#626088.\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information.

            "description": "Negan is a handsome liver colored German Shepherd estimated around three and a half to four years of age. Negan came to us through a rural Kentucky shelter after being involved in a court case due to neglect. Although Negan has had a rough few years he is ready to put that behind him and find his fur-ever home.\n\nNegan is the sort of boy who doesn't believe anyone should be a stranger for long and that he should always be the life of the party. Negan has a very outgoing personality and is quick to make friends most of the time. Although there are times he can be a bit shy they are definitely few and far in between. Negan is a tripod but that does not slow him down in the slightest and he loves to get out and run and play. He can be very bouncy and jumpy with those he knows but has mostly learned not to jump on new people. Negan loves to go for walks and hikes and exploring creeks when he gets the chance. He also greatly loves to play fetch as well as tug games. Negan does very well in the house and is an overall well-mannered boy. Negan has been around children as young as 2 years of age and done okay.\n\nNegan loves to romp and roughhouse with other dogs. He is quick to make friends and even quicker to push them around. Negan does live with other shepherds and has lived with dogs as small as 15 lb but he can be a bit of a bully in the play yard at times. If he is allowed to get his way he would definitely be a trouble starter. Thankfully the other dogs he is around tolerate him well and just keep playing. They are particularly fond of chase games and Negan is happy to entertain. Negan does come from a background where food and water were scarce so he does have some resource guarding with the other dogs but continues to get better every day. Negan has been around a cat briefly and done okay but we would like another cat test before he could be placed in a home with a cat.\n\nNegan is a playful, adventurous guy who is looking for a home that will give him the patience, exercise, and love he deserves. If you're the home for Negan please email tierhavenrescue@gmail.com for an adoption application or visit Tierhaven.rescuegroups.org for FAQs",

            "description": "Sweet Happy needs a permanent foster or loving home for the time she has left. We are unsure of how long that would be but she does have a medical issue. She cannot open her mouth normally and therefore can only eat canned food. We are unsure of what has happened to her to cause this, probably some sort of trauma. She gets an antiobiotic for her mouth monthly to keep down the infection and she has rimadyl and gabapentin daily. All of these meds would be paid for by the rescue for sure in foster and if an adoptive home could be found and cannot afford, the rescue will take care of it. She seems to be pain free when on this combination of meds and loves to play with toys and go for walks. She is also hearing impaired, may hear a little but not much. Probably due to ongoing ear infections left untreated. Because of her hearing impairment we do prefer a fenced in yard but it is not mandatory. She does love to play with her toys in the yard. Happy currently is in a foster home with two other male dogs. One she is totally fine with but wants to be rather bossy with the second one. She does have some food aggression with other dogs only so bowls need to be picked up after eating and she should be kept separate at feeding time. Happy has many needs but is a wonderful, loving girl so deserving of a loving place to call home. Happy is a lab mix and currently weighs about 37 lbs. She could gain another 5. We think she is about 10 years old. She is housetrained and crate trained and does not get into any trouble when left with the run of the house. She has not been around children since we had her but we think older respectful children would be fine. We are also unsure about cats but her temperament is so sweet we don't think they would be a problem. She is fully vetted. Please consider opening up your home to this sweet girl. If interested in Happy, please email hartmanshounds@gmail.com or call Peggy @ 440-452-1619. Her adoption fee would be very minimal to the right home.",

They came into the shelter on Nov. 20 as lost dogs and no one has come to claim them. They are both about 2 years old; Xity weighs 66 pounds and Drago weigh 62. They are very sweet and a little shy.  Xity has not been spayed, nor has Drago been neutered, so they have to occupy different runs at the shelter until they get an appointment with the vet. Both are up-to-date on vaccinations and will be heartworm tested and microchipped upon adoption. Come meet Xity in Run 802 using ID#626088; her brother Drago is in Run 807 with ID#626087.\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information.

Katrina is fearless and limitless when it comes to jumping, climbing, walking a balance beam, or anything really that is between \"Katrina\" and \"where Katrina wants to be.\" This does mean you must have a really, really great fence or commitment to leash walks. In return, you get a constantly-wiggling, super-loving girl with a fantastic smile and a world-class head tilt. She also enjoys water sports and car rides. Katrina loves all people but precisely zero non-people (she is a devoted only pet with no dog park potential at all). Please contact the shelter if Katrina sounds like your next BFF.  \n\n  \n\n~  Est DOB: Nov 2014  \n~  Intake weight:  50#  \n~  Adoption details/application:  calhouncountyhs.blogspot.com/p/adopt.html",

She is also friendly with other dogs but isn't too fond of cats. She can jump short fences so definitely needs a home with a 6ft or taller fence. Pretty Penny would love an active family that she can go on hikes and adventures with! We estimate her to be born in May 2019.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry\n\n----------------------PLEASE READ-------------------------------\nOur dogs are dogs are fostered in Texas but available for adoption in the Pacific Northwest...With stops in - Lacey, WA  and Portland, OR.\nThese dogs are transported to a predetermined location agreed upon by the rescue.\n\nOur out of state adoption fee is $500. This fee includes spay/neuter, current vaccinations, a registered microchip, a negative heartworm test, health certificate, and transport costs. \nAs an Apollo direct adoption, the adoption interview/meet and greet occurs on video call (Skype, FB Messenger call, Facetime, etc).

He is neutered, up to date on all vaccines, has been dewormed, and is current on flea/tick and heartworm medication.\n\nBodine would do best in a quiet environment so he prefers no young children. He also doesn't care for cats, but gets along with other dogs. \n\nBodine needs a patient home as he is a little leery/timid at first. He is a super sweet boy once he gets to know you and you earn his trust! He loves playing with his toys and getting a lot of love!\n\nAdoption fee is $150.00 with an approved application. \n\nApplications will need to be pre-approved before we schedule a meet and greet and/or adopt. \n\nWe do not go by a first come first serve basis. We go through all apps and choose the best fit for our pups!\n\nTo request an adoption application, please email us at amybennettwashburn@hotmail.com\n\nWe hope someone will give this boy the home that he deserves!",

He said it was way too much fun tossing it in the air and rolling with it. Since baseball didnt work out, he took a gig as a cowboy, but he just wanted to play tug of war with the lasso. Loving car rides as he does, his next career move was race car driving. Unfortunately he was more interested in looking at scenery thought the laps were too boring. He finally found his niche at the circus where he could clown around all day. If you are looking for home entertainment, look no further and come visit Benjamin. He will cure the COVID blues.",

Do to her age she does have arthritis and a rare form of diabetes that will require meds for the rest of her life. She is also partially deaf.\n\nDaisy is trained not to get on furniture. She loves walks or a fenced yard. No tie-outs for this girl. She is good with other dogs and cats, but would feed separately, she does guard food.\n\nShe loves her crate or any den like space, but once comfortable she does love a dog bed and laying around her humans.\n\nDaisy is not a fan of car rides, or going to the vet . She will not act out at the vet, it is just hard to get her in the door. She is very much a homebody and loves napping. We absolutely adore this girl.\n\nIf you would like to meet Daisy 1 fill out an app at www.adoptastray.com\nAll SAAP animals are vet checked, UTD on vaccines, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, and given flea and heartworm preventative as age appropriate.\n\nOur website is: http://www.adoptastray.com/\n\nTo check if this animal is still available visit our master pet list on our website at:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/adoptable-animals/\n\nHave questions:\nPlease email us at saap@adoptastray.com for more information about this animal or to answer any questions you may have.

To begin the process please fill out an application here:  http://goo.gl/forms/XPuk6w9615GXqo0x2\n\nThis is my foster dog...if you or anyone you know is interested in adopting this dog please contact: www.DogGoneInn.com\n\nName: \t\tHarriet \nGender: \tSpayed \nColor:\t\tBlack Brindle\nDOB:\t\t11/18/2019\nBreed:\t\tCane Corso\nWeight:\t70 lbs\nNotes:  I am timid and would do best in a quiet home without children.  I do great with dogs and cats though! My third eyelid protrudes, but it doesn't bother me.  My foster mom says it makes me unique and pretty.  I have been experiencing separation anxiety and will need help to trust that you\u2019re my forever home. \n\nThere is an adoption process along with a donation.\n\nPlease bring your dog (if you have one), and a martingale collar with a leash, should we move forward.  We recycle theirs for the next dog :)  I have attached a picture of a martingale collar.  If you cannot find one, we do sell them at the daycare for 10-15.  Purchasing one from us allows us to fit it properly and it helps to benefit the rescue.  We carry leashes too, the collar and leash set are 30.  Adoption donations vary depending on the dog's age and medical expenses.  Typically they start at 650 and go up from there.  We realize this is a larger donation, however we have no state funding like shelters do.  That being said, dogs do come to you fully vetted.  They have been fixed, given distemper, bordetella, rabies, heartworm tested, de-wormed, on prevention for heartworm, fleas, ticks, intestinal parasites and microchipped.  Additionally we have paid for the microchip registration for life. \n\n*Please note we make every effort to have our dogs altered prior to adoption, if we cannot spay/neuter clauses will be in the contract.\n\n*Please come down to the Dog Gone Inn in Manlius to meet us!\n\nThank you for choosing rescue! \n\nDon't forget to like us and follow us on Facebook, we get new animals in regularly.\n\n*Please submit an application here: http://goo.gl/forms/XPuk6w9615GXqo0x2 and come down to the Dog Gone Inn in Manlius to see me or (315) 728-9344 or www.DogGoneInn.com or DogGoneInn@Yahoo.com or www.facebook.com/DogGoneInn",

The amount of fur we took off of Bread was almost equal to half of his body weight! But all that neglect didn\u2019t prevent Bread from being a very sweet and loving dog. From what we observed at the shelter, he\u2019s friendly with people and indifferent to dogs when outside. He is very dominant when he is being walked and pulls a lot on his leash. He is a bit apprehensive at first with people which is probably due to the severe neglect he was subjected to. He has also previously shown fearful aggression and is for experienced adopters only. Despite all the hardship we know Bread will make an incredible pet companion for whoever ends up being lucky enough to adopt him at https://amaanimalrescue.org/pet/bread/",

I do have some manners but it never hurts to have more, I am very smart and eager to learn new things. I have learned some new things in the time I have been here at the shelter, like sit and wait.

The right family for Sheeba will have no cats or other small animals around. She is friendly to people and has been around young children.  She is leash reactive to dogs while on walks and will need a home who is committed to engaging her with a trainer to help her in this area. Sheeba\u2019s current foster does not have other animals but she came from a home with other dogs and was reported to be friendly. Sheeba\u2019s favorite activities include some serious squirrel stalking, surveying the back yard, laying in the sun, and checking on her person. She is happy to clean off your kitchen counters if you leave things within easy reach. Sheeba is a sweet dog who loves to be near her humans and will be a wonderful companion for just the right family.\n\n<p>Please visit <a href=\"\"http://www.austingermanshepherdrescue.org\"\">Austin German Shepherd Rescue</a> for more information on this pet!</p>",

This boy likes to follow you around the house, go for a short walk or have a cuddle and kiss on the couch. \n\nLexi is a real character. He is goofy, very curious and animated. He adores other dogs and is desperate to get close to them to kiss them and play. Lexi is a 7 year old, 60 pound, red nose Pit Bull. In behavior he is like a puppy, he has little explosions of excitement, likes to put things in his mouth and can be mouthy when he is excited. A home with a single person, couple, or family with older children would be suitable for him. They would need to be tolerant of his sometimes puppy like behavior. \n\nLexi is neutered, and house trained. He comes with a collar, leash and 3 free training sessions for you to learn proper handling, leash walking and how to give corrections. Our rescue provides ongoing lifetime support for our adopters and are always available by phone, and in person to help you assimilate your new baby into your home. Let us know if you would like to meet Lexington and get some kisses.",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Asa! Sitting in the shelter is no fun, and MVPC knew I was a nice guy, so I came to rescue! \n\nI am an easy going dog. Walk? Let\u2019s go, I am good on a leash! Snuggle on the couch for a movie? I am game for that too. I am perfectly content to play in the backyard, then come in to chew on a bone. I like kids and adults alike and am pretty independent, so not always in your face. I absolutely want to be with you, but I know when it\u2019s time to lie and watch. I am selective on my dog friends, and cats can be too fun to chase. Did you know they are fun to chase? Overall, I am a good boy hoping to finally land in a family that will love me forever. \n\nADOPTION FEE: $200 (All MVPC dogs are heartworm-tested, completely vetted, spayed/neutered, microchipped, crate-trained and house-trained)\nADOPTER: Must have breed experience\nBIRTHDAY: Estimated 2 years\nFENCE: Required (an electric fence is not an acceptable form of containment)\nDOGS: Would prefer to be the only dog\nCATS: No, I like to focus on them every once in awhile\nCHILDREN: Yes, over 8 please\n\nINQUIRIES: ALL inquiries begin with a submitted adoption application, which is found on our website, www.miamivalleypitcrew.com. We do not adopt to individuals under the age of 25. We prefer male/female dog pairings unless both already reside in the home. \n\nDO NOT: USE THE PETFINDER CONTACT/ADOPT BUTTONS--we are unable to monitor those and you will not receive a response. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: We are volunteer based and a home visit is required; we have a two-hour adoption radius from Kettering, OH for our adult dogs and 75 miles for our puppies. Exceptions for our ADULT dogs only, though rare, may be made on a case-by-case basis but we must be able to do a home visit. Thank you for your understanding!\n\nProfessional holiday and Valentine\u2019s Day pictures courtesy of the talented Gwen Estep Photography, LLC https://www.facebook.com/GwenEstepPhotography/\n",

We don't know her story because she was a stray picked up by animal control. However there's much more that we do know about this 8-lb Rat Terrier with the low-ridin' look of a Teddy, or Type B, Rat Terrier. We know that her teeth used to be in wretched condition and caused her great pain. Now that all but the two lower canines have been removed, Beatrice feels ever so much better. We know that she's in remarkably good health and has no conditions that require meds. While she's past her playful stage, she gets along nicely with other dogs and cats. She earned the name Beatrice because of her love of skittering about like a busy bee. She doesn't like to be held, but we know she loves to snuggle. She also likes to be fed her by hand. She eats better that way, and we know you'll enjoy the bonding experience as much as she does. Beatrice isn't house-trained, but we know she'll do her best if you're vigilant and offer her frequent opportunities to go outside to potty. There's one more thing we know about this sweetheart--Beatrice believes there's somebody who can't wait to make her golden years the very best! So be that somebody! We know that you won't regret it.\nOur adoption fee is $175 for adult dogs or $225 for puppies under 6 months old.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog,\nPLEASE READ THE DETAILED ADOPTION PROCESS information on our website\nat www.\nNewRattitude.org/adopt/\n\nFrom there, you can access our adoption application or contact our Adoption Team for more info.",

Jack is good with Children.  Jack was adopted for a short period of time and we were told he did not get along with cats.  He is back at his foster home who has two cats running around him all day and he is not aggressive toward them.  Jack would do best in a home with another dog to play with as he loves to play.  He would also benefit from some basic obedience training. \n Jack is crate trained.  He is a very good boy and he will make a wonderful companion.  \n\nJack's adoption fee includes his/her 1st grooming/bath, spay/neuter, rabies and distemper vaccinations, fecal, heartworm tests, flea/tick treatment if required, microchip, collar, and any other vet care that's required during his/her stay with us.  \n\nPlease fill out an application at cryforhelprescue.com if you are interested in meeting Jack.\n\nSee all our adoptable dogs and fill out an online application now at http://www.cryforhelprescue.com.

            "description": "Hi! I am HANK THE TANK! I am an 8-year-old, 72-pound, bundle of love! I love food, I love sleeping and I love toys, I love my foster mom and dad, I love kids, I love walks, I love treats, I love car rides, and oh yeah, I love other dogs. I just LOVE life!\n\nAre you looking for a pup to enjoy life with? If so, that would be me!!\n\nThe first 8 years of my life were bad. My tongue has a cut on it, many of my teeth have fallen out, and I have scars on my ears. I was skin and bones when a nice lady saved me. Now, I am looking for a furever home where I will be loved and spoiled.\n\nEven though I've had a rough life, I still have a loving heart. My foster family tells me I'm pretty amazing, since I was betrayed by humans, but can still show tremendous love for them. I need someone that will kiss my lovey, smooshy face each day and remind me that I am loved.\n\nI am house trained and crate trained. I like my crate for those times when you leave the house.\n\nI am good on a leash and I don't even pull. I get really excited when it's time for my walk!\n\nHere's a list of what I am looking for in my furever family:\n1. Someone home most of the day.\n\n2. A\n\nhome that understands a typical lab's goofy personality!\n\n3. A fenced yard where I can lounge and chase squirrels.\n\n4. Someone that likes to take daily walks.\n5. Maybe even another doggie sibling to play with.\n\nSo who's ready to be my furever family and love life with me?!\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online. http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.",

Miller is 2+year-old, Scooby-Doo lookalike weighing in at about 66-pounds\n\nWe have Miller Kyle listed as a Pit Bull/Labrador mix (\n\nmaybe some SharPei?) but he sure looks a lot like Scooby-Doo.\n\nThis sweet guy is a perfect house-guest who wants to move into your home and be your one and only full-time companion.\n\nMiller Kyle loves playing frisbee, going on walks, running, car rides and snuggle time. He is also house and crate trained but really enjoys sleeping with his humans. Miller Kyle likes to chill in the crate on his own when he's home alone, but you don't have to worry about leaving him out of his crate when you're gone - he's very respectful of house items and even human food. But Miller Kyle isn't a fan of other dog.\n\nThis super-smart guy knows commands like, \"sit,\" \"down,\" \"touch,\" \"go say hi,\" and he is mastering \"place\" meaning he goes to lay on his dog bed. He very much enjoys training, and he will work for treats!\n\nMiller Kyle also enjoys solving the mysteries of the back yard, like where did the squirrel hide his nuts, what is the large-4-legged, furry thing with horns. Who knows, maybe Miller Kyle can help you solve crimes?\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal.

            "description": "ROSA\n\nRosa is a 7-8-year-old bloodhound who came to us from a shelter in Texas. She is a classic bloodhound, sweet and stubborn, loving to her people, good with other dogs, although she seems to prefer the males over the female in her foster home. Considering where she is from, there was no surprise that she was heartworm positive. She has been treated, and has no residual effects, but she will require some follow up on the part of her adopter. She is crate trained and house trained with a dog door. Good with small dogs, but cats are unknown. She has not met kids that we know of, but we suspect she would be fine with kids 8 and up. She tends to put her paws up on her person as if to hug them and this might be a bit much for a young child.  Leash skills are so-so as she does pull somewhat. \n\nRosa\u2019s adoption fee is $225. If you are interested in adopting her, please fill out an application on our web site: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SnhudHYFJaPfZyCeKy36-9pbowOVOI-xrX4TIiSIxl4/edit and a volunteer will contact you about a home visit\n\n\nThis dog's adoption fee is a minimum $225.00 donation to help us save more dogs. Southern Arizona Beagle Rescue, SoAZBR is an all-volunteer group. One hundred percent of your donation is used for the care and treatment needy beagles. Your donation is 100% tax deductible, too.\n\nWe URGENTLY need fosters so we can help save more dogs.  If you can help, please contact us.\n\nSouthern Arizona Beagle Rescue Contact Info:\nE-Mail Southern Arizona Beagle Rescue adoption@soazbeaglerescue.com\nSee more of our adoptable at Southern Arizona Beagle Rescue web site http://www.soazbeaglerescue.com \nPhone us at (520) 247-7720",

            "description": "Meet Johnny, a handsome dazzler looking for a specific home and sidekick, that will be able to provide the structure and management he needs to be set up for success. Johnny has some training under his belt like being potty trained, basic commands, and muzzle trained but will need more work in his adoptive home. Best Friends is offering FREE training sessions to help him get on the right routine and training plan to ensure he makes good life choices! Johnny requires an in-person Lifesaving Center Visit and counseling. \n\n Johnny is a staff favorite for so many reasons, but his smile, sweet nose freckles, and tail wiggles help brighten anyone's day. While Johnny has a loving and loyal personality with the people he has bonded with, he is a work in progress and requires an adult only home (18 years and older) where he will be the only animal. Due to his stressors caused by previous negative experiences, his next home must be aware that he needs to be cautiously managed when around high populations of people OR other animals and is not a candidate for any off-leashing activities. He thrives with structure and routine and will need to continue these habits in his new home. If you are interested in learning more about Johnny and setting up an interview for an in person meet and greet, email utahadoptions@bestfriends.org",

At the shelter she lived in a kennel and wasn\u2019t allowed outside. She is thriving in her foster home. She loves to be outside, walking, on adventures! She is the kind of dog you could take camping she would love being outdoors! She doesn\u2019t do well with other dogs or cats so an only pet for her at this time is a must. She is learning how to trust, since she was abused it takes her a bit to warm up- but once she does you have a best friend for life!",

He's 2 years old and a big boy of 80 pounds. He's potty trained and walks nicely on a leash without pulling. He's submissive with other dogs and people and hesitant with men. Remi is gentle and very sensitive. He wants to please more than anything in this world. Remi does not play with toys right now but he LOVES any game of chase and he will snatch something of value, a sock, a shirt . . . to get you to chase him. Adorable!\n\nRemi was found as a stray in Oakland and then adopted straight from the shelter. His inexperienced new owner returned him after just 4 days for separation anxiety.\n\nDespite having 4 other dogs to be around at his NorSled foster home, Remi still has very pronounced separation anxiety. We are working on this issue but we like to be transparent to potential adopters. (If you have leather furniture, Remi may not be the dog for you.)\n\nIf you have other Northern dogs and have the patience and desire to help Remi resolve his separation anxiety, please submit an application\nwww.norsled.org.\nThank you. Remi is being fostered in Oakland.",

He's a real cuddle bug and he'll happily hang out with his head in your lap while you work at your computer. He's also fond of sleeping next to you. He's got a great disposition and his friendly to everyone he meets. He loves going on walks and he would make a great hiking companion (and he's good in the car). \n\nDevin is a smart cookie who knows his basic commands and really wants to please. He's also quite content to hang out on the couch and nibble at his chew toys. Devin is a super sweet dog and would make a great family dog. He's a big guy (65 lbs) and he is active so he would probably do best in an active home with older kids. We are sure he would love a yard! Inquire about this lovable lug today\n\n",

Kona Kay is energetic, loves treats, humans, and runs like the wind with her beloved toys. \nWe're working with her on her leash skills - she gets so excited to go play outdoors that she can barely contain herself. She is a good girl in the car and enjoys going for rides around campus. Kona Kay currently lives with a big, playful male pup and they get along well. She is an enthusiastic player so if there is another pup in her new home, he should be of a good size and temperament.\n\nVisit Kona Kay at www.hua.org!",

Since we don't have a long health history of your\nadopted dog, we can only treat the pet for whatever symptoms present during the initial exam\nand follow up exams.~\n\nHealth:\n\nShiloh may have injuries to the muscles, tendons, etc. that are still healing. There is visible atrophy of the left rear thigh/leg muscles at the time of the exam. He may or may not have a permanent limp. Veterinarian's advice: keep an eye on these areas as he gets older. He may require pain management later in life.\n\nShiloh tested \"moderate positive\" and is receiving treatment for Heart Worms.\n\n***** No other obvious issues found during vet exam *****\n\nTemperament: Shiloh is a well behaved, affectionate, and obedient indoor dog. He is very smart and agile and, therefore, should always be considered a flight risk pet. He knows how to open doors with level style handles, push sliding doors open (including \"doggy doors\"), and use yard objects as stepping stones to leap over 6' fences.\n\nSuper sweet dog and would make a great companion or walking partner. --\n\nWhere did he come from: Shiloh had been a stray that was seen on \"Ring\" coming and going for several weeks. He may have been hit by a car.\n\nAdoption: ***** $216.50 Includes required tax *****\nWeight: 50.5 lbs.\nApproximate age: 24 months\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: http://www.recycledpoms.org/application --\n\nEmail info@recycledpomeranians.com to request a printable application. --\n\n------Please remember our group is made of only volunteers all of whom have full time jobs, foster fur-kids, and families of their own, so please be patient.--------",

If you are looking for a long, lanky boy to play with, then Pablo is your guy.  He was born in August 2015 and weighs 66 pounds but he could probably stand to gain a few extra pounds. Our best guess is that he\u2019s a Rottweiler/Catahoula/Doberman on stilts. He\u2019s the true definition of a \u201cHeinz 57\u201d dog; he\u2019s just a little bit of everything. This year has been hard on everyone, including Pablo, whose owner could no longer afford him and had to surrender him to McKamey. We decided to help him out and give him a change of scenery here at PPC. He\u2019s extremely smart, potty trained, and friendly with everyone. He already knows a few commands including \u201csit\u201d and \u201cdown,\" and he\u2019s learning \u201clay down.\u201d He\u2019s an active boy who loves to play and gets along with every dog he meets, however, he\u2019s a little too rough with cats, so ideally he needs to be in a home with only canine companions. His favorite activities include playing fetch (poorly), cuddling, and napping with his favorite people. You\u2019d be surprised at how much he just wants to be a lap dog. If you want a dog who\u2019s ready to go on adventures and play at the dog park, then give us a call!\n\nPablo recently went out on another hiking adventure and his handler said this about him: \"This fella\u2019s got the most amazing pouty face (when he wants a treat), and is a super nice dog. He will run splendidly right beside you, is only mildy curious when we passed other people/dogs (this is HUGE if you\u2019ve ever owned a reactive pupper) and does not pull on a leash. He\u2019s so treat motivated. I swear to dog he reminds me of an AT-AT Walker (I had to google \u2018Star Wars long legged machine thingy\u2019). Pablo is a funny dude!\"\n\nWe're open Wednesday - Sunday 12 - 5 p.m but are doing meet & greets and adoptions by appointment only.  \n\nThe adoption fee is $90 which includes a free veterinary exam within 2 weeks of adoption at local participating vets, up to date vaccinations, heartworm test,  heartworm preventative, dewormer, flea preventative, microchip, & spay or neuter.\n\nIf you are interested in this pet, please fill out our ADOPTION APPLICATION at https://goo.gl/forms/9FdDBiPU5aa5ySTv1\n\nVisit our website at www.PetPlacementCenter.com",

Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nStormy is a bright-eyed and alert 3 year-old Terrier mix spayed female with a beautiful dark brown coat who found herself shelter bound after her owner died and no one in her extended family could take her on. She was understandably stressed and confused at having lost the only home she'd ever known so made the trip to Canine Lifeline so she could take her time finding a new forever home. We don't know anything about Stormy's previous life although it was likely that she was the only dog in her home. While she has done well with the other dogs in her foster home, we think she would probably enjoy having her new humans all to herself and not have to share them with another dog. Stormy has had excellent crate manners in her foster home and may be housetrained too although we can't guarantee that. She is quite strong on a leash for a smaller-sized dog and would do well with an Easy Walk Harness as she works on her leash manners. With some daily practice, she will soon be walking like a pro and make a great walking or hiking buddy for someone looking for a smaller yet very spunky companion who can definitely keep up with the big dogs. Stormy weighs about 26 pounds and her adoption fee is $325. She's spayed, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Stormy. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Stormy and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nMaya is a shy but sweet 3 year-old Lab mix female who looks like she might have had a rough life in the past. She was found as a stray and when she wasn't claimed at the local county dog shelter, made the trip to Canine Lifeline so she could relax in a foster home while searching for a permanent new home. Maya was initially very shy and nervous when she came to us and will likely be timid when meeting new people. It does take her some time to trust someone new so her new family must be patient with her as she gets used to her new environment. Maya is very comfortable around other dogs and loves playing chase and wrestling with her canine buddies in her foster home. She would do best in a home where she'll have a canine pal to show her the ropes and help boost her confidence. Given her shyness, she will need a home with a yard that has a secure aboveground fence. She would not be comfortable in a busy urban or suburban environment so is looking for a home in a very quiet neighborhood or rural area. Maya has had excellent crate manners in her foster home so may be housetrained too although we can't guarantee it. She will need some work on a leash and will do best walking with a harness as she works on her leash skills. Maya weighs about 44 pounds and her adoption fee is $325.

It takes her time to warm up to men as she is afraid of them. She is three years old and spends a lot of time relaxing now after what must have been a crazy life for this little lady. She does enjoy walks and is responding well to leash training and any training we try. Cherokee Rose has a fear of kennels, but has made herself a safe space on our couch, where she likes to hang out as well as sleep. She's come out of her shell since being here with us especially since we have a resident dog who she follows everywhere. We think it's essential she be in a home with other dogs because she's really done well here with a buddy and I think she'd be pretty lost alone. Cherokee doesn't really \"play\" as she is way too serious for that, but does enjoy the company of the resident pup. She's not been around cats so not sure how that will go. She's recently finished heartworm treatment and is ready for her forever home. She's really a sweet girl who just wants to be petted and loved. She'll make a great addition to a family with patience and love to give her. \n\nAdoption fee includes: Full veterinary exam, alter, prepaid microchip, dewormed, Rabies vaccine, DAPP vaccine, Bordetella vaccine, 4DX\n\n, flea/tick and heartworm preventative while in rescue.

            "description": "**PLEASE READ THIS BIO IN IT'S ENTIRETY BEFORE REACHING OUT!!**\n\nMeet Zelda! \n\nWe scooped her up juuuuuuuust before Hurricane Zeta hit. She was emaciated, running around Central City, New Orleans. She was surely once someone's good girl. She's impeccably trained - knows sit, paw, other paw, down and even runs into her kennel when her meals are being prepped. She's good with men, women and other dogs. I'm going to assume cats are a no go. She LOVES destroying stuffed animals - the squeaker is her prize. She loves cozy dog beds and loafing around on a good couch. She'll lay her big fat head on you and melt you with those big brown eyes. If we had room for one more, we'd keep her without hesitation. If I was still a single woman living in the city, THIS gal would be my best friend and best home defense system. \n\nShe is about 4 years old, spayed UTD on all vaccinations and currently undergoing heartworm treatment, which we will fully fund. She's put a good deal of meat back on her bones and is well on her way to being healthy again. We anticipate her to max out at about 70#.  Her activity will need to be limited while she undergoes HW treatment. She does exceptionally well in a kennel, so this should be easy peasy. \n\nHer ideal home are seasoned bully-breed owners without small children. Although she is well-trained, she is a VERY STRONG animal. She usually takes treats from your hand with care, but there are definitely times she does not. She usually grabs just the toy from your hand when playing, but there's definitely times she inadvertently snags your finger. For those reasons, we'd like to keep children out of the equation. \n\nIf you think you are a good fit for Zelda, Please fill out an application for consideration.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*We are NOT a shelter. We are a foster-based rescue with NO facility. PLEASE take a moment to read more about who we are and what we do at Trampled Rose Rescue & Rehab HERE: \n\nhttps://www.petfinder.com/member/us/la/ponchatoula/trampled-rose-rescue-rehab-la410/   \n\nIt outlines, in great detail, our adoption process, adoption fees, how we select forever homes and much more.\n\n*If you think you may be a good fit for one of our rescue dogs, PLEASE SUBMIT AN APPLICATION for consideration. Feel free to drop a line with any questions we haven't answered, however, ONLY SUBMITTED APPLICATIONS WILL BE CONSIDERED AND PROCESSED. \n\n*If the dog is visible to you here on Petfinder, IT IS STILL AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION, so NO NEED TO ASK. The moment a home visit agreement is signed, the dog will be marked 'Adoption Pending' and, if all goes well, 'Adopted'. If the home visit was not a success, the dog will be relisted as 'Adoptable'. \n\n*We get DOZENS (and sometimes HUNDREDS) of messages via Petfinder, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, phone, text and email about EACH of our rescues DAILY. We do the best we can to respond to them all, but ultimately there's just not enough hours in the day. If you're seriously interested in a dog, the best course of action is to submit an application and BE PATIENT. We DO go through EVERY application that we receive, on a first come first served basis, and will select the home BEST SUITED for that particular rescue. We almost exclusively deal with special needs dogs and there is an ideal lifestyle we have in mind for each of our rescues. If you DO NOT receive a call it DOES NOT mean you were forgotten or declined. We likely had a barrage of applicants before you and one of those was a clear winner. Please keep in mind, we all have full time jobs, families and fosters and permanent pets of our own, so PLEASE be patient and allow us ample time to do this volunteer work in what little free time we have. Thank you.\n\n*Applications are available on our main page here on Petfinder OR on our website, www.trampledroserescue.com/adopt. Thnx!\n",

            "description": "I'm Dodger (HWTH#20275A)!  I am a German Shepherd, born on 11/14/14 and I weigh 60 lbs.  I arrived at Halfway to Home after I was found by a Good Samaritan as a stray dragging a leash near the aqueduct in Lake Los Angeles.   My owner never claimed me so now I am looking for a forever family!  I am truly \"man's best friend\" as I seem to be drawn to men in particular, however I am friendly with all the adults I have met.  I am not sure if I get along with kids or other dogs. I love balls and other squeaky toys.  I am a strong and high-energy boy, therefore obedience training is essential to ensure I learn how to walk on a leash without pulling and what is acceptable behavior.  Apartments, condos, or mobile homes would not be suitable for me because I need a large fenced yard to exercise and play.   I need at least 2 long walks a day, and I would love to be a jogging or hiking partner.  When we aren't participating in outdoor activities,  I want to be an indoor dog and treated as a member of your family.   If you like what you have read and you would like more information or an appointment to meet me, please call Sandy at tele#661-824-4495 (this is a landline).  Thank you!",

Please go to www.wowdogrescue.org for any updates.\n\nChance is a mix of Pomeranian and Maltese we think..\nHe is a tiny little guy weighing approx. 8 lbs.\nHe can get through the tiniest places, and is terribly missing his deceased owner of 10 yrs.\nHe would be happy to live with another male, and him being the one and only...like he is used too. He is not aggressive with other dogs, but enjoys getting all the attention. \n\nRight now he is with a male foster, and has done well with his 2 small dogs. He doesn't interact with them, and doesn't try to play with them at all.\nChance is a nervous little guy at first, but he will settle in nicely after he knows he is safe and loved.\nHe will sit next to the foster on his legs while on his chair now, so is feeling pretty comfortable there.\nIf you are looking for a sweet boy who LOVES going for walks and having a back yard to run around in...he's your boy! APPLY!\n\nChance is WAS scheduled to be neutered and get his microchip, and Rabies\nshot BUT he is no longer a candidate to have this done as he gets very anxious and the vet felt is is in his best interest not to have the surgery.\n\nHe is current on his Rabies, DHPP and Bordetella. He also has his microchip inserted.\nHe is ready for his forever home now. \n\nChances adoption fee is $175.00 UNLESS you are a senior..  then his adoption fee is $100.00 plus anything the rescue has in to him but not to exceed $175.00\n\nWe are NOT Petfinder, \nWe are not Adoptapet,\nOR\nRescue me.\n\nOur application is on OUR website:  www.wowdogrescue.org \n\n**PLEASE do not call to see if he is \"still\" available.\nHis Gallery photo on our website will be updated daily and will state his status.\nIF we have chosen someone, he will be marked \"Pending\".\nIF he has been adopted, he will be marked \"Adopted\".\n\n***Tired of not finding, or not being chosen for the dog of your dream??\nConsider Fostering with us...Our Fosters have 1st chance at adopting the dog they foster, while we pay for everything.\nIts a win win for both! YOU get to see if this is a good match for your family, while the dog is being loved in your home...",

I was so sad and distraught that I began to lose weight. A local rescue group saw how well I behaved and felt sorry for me. They placed me with their dog trainer who agreed that I was a good girl. One of the volunteers offered to foster me in her home and I felt so much more at ease. I am eating well now and enjoy going for walks. My foster home has cats and I do not mind them at all. The vet thinks I am a senior but I feel young and enjoy playing in the yard. I would LOVE to find a permanent home to call my own. Maybe you are the one I've been waiting for? Please call (631) 219-8529 and ask about me. I'll be waiting!",

Please read the bio before sending questions - we answer all we know about the dog here.\n\nHello everyone- my name is Milo! I'm about 3 years old with the most precious heart. My previous owner was in the military and because of their offshore duties, I had to be surrendered. I loooove to play with any kinds of toys, I love long walks, and when I'm excited I hop around, and that's how I landed the nickname bugs bunny! When we're done playing, I hope you're ready for cuddles! I am so sweet and talkative, and I'm ready for a human to call my own. I would do well as the only dog in a home, but if I meet my possible sibling and we get along, that works just as well. I am house trained, but may need some time to adjust to your schedule so I don't have an accident. (I usually bark if I have to go)\n\nMilo's adoption fee is $300 - Obedience training is required after adoption Obedience training is also required for all our pups.\n\nObedience training is also required for all our pups.

He was relinquished to Hawaii Dog Foundation due to a worsening skin infection. \n\nWe took him directly to the vet to get a better understanding of his health status.  Smokey was diagnosed with demodectic mange and hookworm.  He was immediately given medicine for the hookworm and a flea & tick preventative to address the mange.  Frequent baths, good food and continued care should get his skin feeling better in no time. \n\nSmokey is a vert gentle boy. He really does just want human care and attention. Smokey does very well with other dogs, but we've not seen him with cats just yet. \n\nHe is not quite ready for adoption right now (Nov 2020), but we suspect by Christmas or the new year, he'll be feeling much better.\n\nIf you'd like to meet Smokey, please complete an adoption application on our website, www.hawaiidogfoundation.org and ask for him by name. We'll give yo a call t set something up!",

So good that she even got to ride shotgun on the way back to the shelter! \n\nTwo times in a row Aristotle rode shotgun while the other crates in the van were empty. She was the only dog not adopted at BOTH events ? \n\nIn fact, this amazingly sweet and gentle girl has been with us since October and we're not sure why she keeps getting overlooked.\n\nAristotle is a 3 1/2 year old Pitbull mix with the sweetest disposition. She is a petite girl weighing only 40 pounds. If you're looking for a calm and laid back dog- she is the one for you! She doesn't require a lot of exercise, but does require a lot of love! Aristotle does well around other calm and well mannered dogs but she does not like playful or high energy dogs. Because of this she needs a meet and greet before going home. (no kitties). She is kid friendly and loves car rides too!\n\nAdoption fee is 125.00 which includes spay, vaccines, and microchip.\n\nIf you want to give Aristotle the chance she's been patiently waiting for, come on in Tues-Sun 11am-3pm to meet her!\nwww.JARMission.org/adopt\n843-726-7799\n",

He was rescued from a homeless camp on the west side of the island of Oahu. \n\nSome of his royal demands thus far...\n4 meals a day ? \nSoft spot to rest his head\nTreats on commands ? \nScratches whenever \nRocked to sleep ?\n\nAs you can see, Sir Philip needs some work on his noble demands.\n\nPhil came to us malnourished at 23lbs. As of Thanksgiving, 2020, he's up to 30 lbs. We think he'd be at ideal weight at 35lbs. So, he needs to gain a wee bit more weight before he is neutered and microchipped.  We've learned that he is a lover and not a fighter. He wants nothing more than to be with the human that has the food and will give him belly rubs. We think he'd do best in a home without small children, but definitely another dog to help him continue to come out of his shell. \n\nIf you'd like to meet this shy, but loving guy, please complete an adoption application on our website, wwwmhawaiidogfoundation.org and ask for him by name.",

We're calling him a terrier mix, but who knows (lab, hound, sharpie, etc) He is a young guy, between 1-3 yrs old, he weighs about 40lbs, is neutered, current on vaccinations and microchipped. He also enjoys the company of other dogs. He is house trained, kennel-trained and loves toys that squeak.\nJulio's ideal home is one that is moderately active (hiking, walking, stand-up paddling, etc). He likes people and older kids, just as long as they give him a little time to check them out before they move in for some cuddles (so small children aren't ideal).\nIf you'd match that description and would like to meet Julio, please complete an adoption application on our website, www.hawaiidogfoundation.org and ask for him by name.",

Chachi's owner could no longer afford to keep her and, as a result, Chachi's life changed dramatically. Now she's a dog in need of consistency to feel secure. She's an emotionally fragile dog who is playful and energetic but also worried when she meets strangers. She's quite intelligent, but also petrified of the vet. She has lived with another dog, and yet she doesn't like other dogs living in the same home, and she will not live with cats or small children. She will walk with another dog, but she must know the dog first. She loves toys and must have a fenced in yard to help her with her high energy. Are you a person with experience with dogs, who understands dogs, and who is willing to spend time reassuring this dog that she is loved and will never be given up again? We mean this. She's wonderful girl who has been dealt a life of uncertainty. She needs you. In-depth conversation with her foster will help both you and the foster decide if the adoption would be good for you and for Chachi.

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

The vet contacted Make A Difference Rescue to see if we could take her in. Of course, we said YES!! Snookie is an amazing girl!!  She loves to be around people, loves warm & cozy dog beds and most of all she loves to be loved on. Snookie is good with other  dogs after a proper introduction is done. Unfortunately, we do not know how she is with cats. Snookie needs a fenced in yard where she can safely run and play. Children 12 years or older. Snookie is up to date on her vaccinations, on heartworm preventative as well as house and crate trained. Snookie is scheduled to be spayed. Snookie cannot wait to be part of a loving family who will cherish and spoil her for the rest of her life.\n\nAll dogs we rescue stay with us until they find their forever homes. We do not do same day adoptions. A home visit is required to ensure our dog is going to a safe environment and our dog gets along with your dog(s) and/or cat(s). We require all our dogs over the age of 1 year attend 1 obedience class (6 week session) outside the home. You must live within 1 hour of Birmingham, MI to adopt one of our dogs. No out of state or outside the U.S. adoptions or fosters. Snookie's adoption fee is $275.",

In addition, Xavier should be in a home without cats. Xavier is very smart and has a very demonstrative personality.\n\nWith the Covid-19 situation, FURS has temporarily stopped our weekly adoption stands. We can make alternate arrangements for meeting the FURS dogs but would require an approved application for adoption. There is no fee or obligation with submitting an adoption application and applications can be completed on line at www.fursdogs.com\n\nA required step of our adoption process is to conduct a home visit. Since FURS is a very small, all-volunteer rescue, we can only support our adoption process to homes in the Richmond, VA and surrounding localities area",

Dennis is an escape artist and is known to have climbed a chain link fence. Dennis is very sweet with people but does not like to be left alone and can be destructive when left alone for long periods of time.  We believe that with proper training, he\u2019ll settle down and make a wonderful addition to a family.\n\nWith the Covid-19 situation, FURS has temporarily stopped our weekly adoption stands. We can make alternate arrangements for meeting the FURS dogs but would require an approved application for adoption. There is no fee or obligation with submitting an adoption application and applications can be completed on line at www.fursdogs.com\n\nA required step of our adoption process is to conduct a home visit. Since FURS is a very small, all-volunteer rescue, we can only support our adoption process to homes in the Richmond, VA and surrounding localities area",

            "description": "Hi! I'm Shanti, I'm a DEAF heeler, 38 lbs, socially awkward, and a ball of loving, furry energy! I'm looking for my very own special person/people because as I've matured into a young lady, I can no longer live with canine sisters. I'm a very good girl, I know my basic dog commands and other commands via hand signal, I love nose work and long-line work. I even volunteer for my city's geese management program using a muzzle and long-line (due to breed tendencies and being deaf) and with mom of course. I know all about using a dog door, crate, halter, gentle leader, and muzzle. I'm house trained and even know to ring a bell if the dog door is closed and I need to go out to do my business. I know to feel for floor vibrations or look at a flashlight as a \"look at me\" signal when inside. I love car rides and new adventures! I need daily exercise and mental stimulation to release some of my natural heeler energy otherwise I can get myself into trouble when I create my own kind of fun. I really, really need someone who knows and loves everything about hard-wired working heelers 'cause we're pretty special and not everybody's cup of tea. So if you know all about heelers then you just have learn my deaf hand signals and I can learn about you-perfect match! I also need someone who is home a lot because I'm what's known as a \"Velcro\" dog due to my breed type and deafness-I need, need my people and would be very stressed if you're gone a lot of time so it would be a very sad life for me. I currently eat a raw diet (mom says it's to keep my protein high and carbs low). I love back rubs and neck massages-this helps me relax! Unlike most heelers I do have a tendency to be relatively verbal (my way of connecting to the world since I'm deaf) -I like to grumble at things I see out the window, or make self-soothing sounds. All in all, I'm a pretty resilient lil gal looking for my very own person/people! Here's more info from mom:\n\nShanti Needs:\n\n Best to be the only dog but could possibly live with an older, larger, gentle, very calm male dog (would need gentle and gradual introductions)\n\n Yard with a secure 6 ft fence, no apartments\n\n Daily physical activity: walking or running at least 30-45 minutes daily, ideally two times per day or other activities and access to yard\n\n A loving person who can be her leader\n\n A person experienced as a dog guardian and ideally experience with heelers\n\n No children, no cats, no small animals (due to strong breed tendencies)\n\n Willing to learn hand signals and continue training to help her be a full member of the family\n\n Person/people who can be with her the majority of time\n\n Person to keep her on leash, watch for door dashing and be aware of dangers for a deaf dog\n\nHer adoption fee is $250.

            "description": "Hi! I'm Shanti, I'm a DEAF heeler, 38 lbs, socially awkward, and a ball of loving, furry energy! I'm looking for my very own special person/people because as I've matured into a young lady, I can no longer live with canine sisters. I'm a very good girl, I know my basic dog commands and other commands via hand signal, I love nose work and long-line work. I even volunteer for my city's geese management program using a muzzle and long-line (due to breed tendencies and being deaf) and with mom of course. I know all about using a dog door, crate, halter, gentle leader, and muzzle. I'm house trained and even know to ring a bell if the dog door is closed and I need to go out to do my business. I know to feel for floor vibrations or look at a flashlight as a \"look at me\" signal when inside. I love car rides and new adventures! I need daily exercise and mental stimulation to release some of my natural heeler energy otherwise I can get myself into trouble when I create my own kind of fun. I really, really need someone who knows and loves everything about hard-wired working heelers 'cause we're pretty special and not everybody's cup of tea. So if you know all about heelers then you just have learn my deaf hand signals and I can learn about you-perfect match! I also need someone who is home a lot because I'm what's known as a \"Velcro\" dog due to my breed type and deafness-I need, need my people and would be very stressed if you're gone a lot of time so it would be a very sad life for me. I currently eat a raw diet (mom says it's to keep my protein high and carbs low). I love back rubs and neck massages-this helps me relax! Unlike most heelers I do have a tendency to be relatively verbal (my way of connecting to the world since I'm deaf) -I like to grumble at things I see out the window, or make self-soothing sounds. All in all, I'm a pretty resilient lil gal looking for my very own person/people! Here's more info from mom:\n\nShanti Needs:\n\n Best to be the only dog but could possibly live with an older, larger, gentle, very calm male dog (would need gentle and gradual introductions)\n\n Yard with a secure 6 ft fence, no apartments\n\n Daily physical activity: walking or running at least 30-45 minutes daily, ideally two times per day or other activities and access to yard\n\n A loving person who can be her leader\n\n A person experienced as a dog guardian and ideally experience with heelers\n\n No children, no cats, no small animals (due to strong breed tendencies)\n\n Willing to learn hand signals and continue training to help her be a full member of the family\n\n Person/people who can be with her the majority of time\n\n Person to keep her on leash, watch for door dashing and be aware of dangers for a deaf dog\n\nHer adoption fee is $250. Submit an app at www.eapl.com\n\n2/2/21 3:04 PM",

And while this does not define her or slow her down she will need someone who is willing to make the extra effort and learn to communicate with her using hand signals. She is eager to please and loves nothing more than playing fetch with her favorite ball before cuddling with her humans. \n\nZoe will do best with someone who is home a lot and has time to spend with her as she really likes human companionship. This beautiful girl was found running around the streets all alone. She had been thrown away like trash after giving birth. How scared she must have been. Immediately after rescue we found out she needed emergency surgery as she had an infection in her uterus. We are happy to say she is doing great today and all healed. Zoe is an extra special girl who has plenty of love to give. \n\nWe are looking for a foster hero in the NYC/NJ who can open their heart and home to this beautiful soul.

The rescue has tried to find them individual homes but it has never worked out.  They need a canine companion, preferably each other, and someone that is home 99% of the time.\n\nThey were adopted as pups into a home with a stay at home mom and had a fenced yard so they were not leash trained.  They had each other and never had to be crated.  Well time passed, and family dynamics changed and resulted in a move.  The new residence could not accommodate the boys so they came into the rescue.  They have so much love to give to a family looking for companionship.  He has been described as the perfect dog by a family that did a trial adoption but was unable to be home enough to meet his needs.  He is completely vetted and his adoption fee is $200",

She loves belly rubs and to play tug.  The one photo shows how far she has come as she was pulled from a shelter after being found as an emaciated stray.

He is about 55 pounds he is super shy and will not come up to you until he gets to know you.  I personally love shy dogs as once they bond with you it is the most incredible bond!  He would do best with another dog in the home to help him come out of his shell.  No young kids due to how shy he is lound noises will scare him.If interested in this sweet boy, please submit an application on our site, www.mountainrottierescue.net!",

Megaesophagus is a condition in which the muscles of the esophagus lose their tone and are no longer able to propel food into the stomach. In normal function wave like contractions move the food from the mouth to the stomach. When megaesophagus occurs the esophagus dilates, or enlarges, due to lack of muscle tone. This causes the food to just sit in the esophagus, unable to continue into the stomach to get digested. \nBlue is a relatively easy keeper. She eats a blend of dry kibble, a can of wet dog food mixed with water to create a soup type of consistency. She eats elevated. We you a coffee table to put her food bowl on and she stands up to reach the bowl. She does not require any special chair.",

            "description": "The only thing \"senior\" about this guy is the little bit of white on his face!! He's an active, exuberant happy dog that would love an equally active family. About 60 lbs of wiggle butt! He lived his whole 9 years with a family but they moved to a home where they can't have another dog so Nestor finds himself looking for a forever home. He will need a fenced yard so he can run and play safely. He would also love to go hiking, walking or running with his new family.  He currently goes for 2 hour hikes 4 days a week with our volunteers.. Older children would be best for him because his energy level might be too much for small kids- he would knock them over. Nester seems to be way too interested in cats so none of them in the household either. A playful dog his size might be OK but would have to do a meet and greet. Nester is a great snuggle buddy and will hang out with you on the couch after a day hiking. He is totally house trained and good on his own in the house.\n\nNester is up to date on all his shots, neutered and microchipped. \n\nWe are looking for a home for within an hour's drive of Phillipsburg,  NJ. For more information about Nester, please contact us at grrnewjersey@gmail.com. If you're interested in adopting him, please email us for an adoption application. You can also find us on Facebook (facebook.com/GRRNJ).",

Now that rescue is closing which is why she is now with us. We believe she is about 5 years old and German Pinscher  mix, she knows a few basic commands, loves hikes and especially her toys. We think she would thrive with an active person or family and as an only dog and in an adult only home. She does need an experienced adopter to help her live her best life. She is unbelievably sweet and loving once she gets to know you but you will need to earn it. \n\nPlease note: Because we require home checks adoptions are limited to the Los Angeles, Ca area.",

            "description": "Aubrey has been at ACSKC since January 2020Aubrey is like a morning spent puttering around the house in pajamas pants as you take your time with that first cup of coffee. During those long, lazy days, Aubrey is the perfect companion. It is easy to picture him padding up alongside you, offering his head for a scratch behind the ears, before laying at your feet.A gentle and laidback Terrier mix, Aubrey has eyes like warm, deeply steeped tea and a terracotta coat with a dusting of white that gives him a distinguished look. Affectionately called The Old Man, Aub is in good health at 9 years old and does not require a lot of exercise. A short stroll a few times a day is all he needs. In fact, hes a bit of a couch potato!

Don't worry, I just have a few skin tags, they're no big deal -- I'm an old man! I came here all the way from a high-kill shelter in North Carolina. I'm excited to be here! The sights and smells of a new place were a little overwhelming at first, but I'm starting to get used to life here at Stray Haven. I kind of like to keep to myself. Sometimes new people approaching me can be scary. It took me a second to open up to the caretakers here, but I'm learning that they aren't so bad. I love it when they take me outside! There's a huge yard here that I loooove running around in! I just want to soak it all up! Once I'm inside, I'm a peach. All I need is a nice warm bed and I'm set. I was an owner surrender, so I'm cautious about getting too attached to people, as I am worried they will just leave me. All I need is someone to show me unconditional love, and I'll fill a hole in your heart you never knew you had. It's a very special thing to adopt an old dog like me -- these are my golden years! I keep my kennel very clean. I'm not sure how I would feel about living with cats or other dogs; maybe ask the staff so you can have a conversation. I could probably live with older kids as long as they respect me. I think I need a home where the people love me for who I am and spoil me as I grow old and gray. If you're interested in being my new family, please come meet me at Stray Haven!\nStray Haven Humane Society & SPCA\n194 Shepard Rd., Waverly, NY 14892\n(607) 565-2859, www.strayhavenspca.org \nOpen hours (winter): Tues, Wed & Thurs Noon - 6pm; Sat 10am-4pm",

I originally came from North Carolina. I was brought up to New York a while ago to try my luck at finding! Life at Stray Haven is a dream! I get plenty of yard time, and caretakers do such a good job making sure I'm stimulated and having a relaxing stay here at the shelter. They're also teaching me the basics of being a dog. I'm working on my leash manners, and I'll admit, I'm having a hard time. I'm a really smart dog so I definitely have the potential to learn. I can sit like nobody's business, and I love snacks!! I'll literally do anything for a treat! I think I would do best in a home with older kids because I jump and nibble on people occasionally. I shouldn't live with other dogs because I can be a relentless player. Living with cats probably won't work out; they sound like they would be a lot of fun to chase! I definitely need lots of rules along with mental and physical stimulation to keep me happy in my future home. Once I learn some leash manners, long walks would be nice. Until then, I think a fenced in yard is a must for me. If you're interested in seeing my big smiling face, come down to Stray Haven and ask for me, Ace!!\nStray Haven Humane Society & SPCA\n194 Shepard Rd., Waverly, NY 14892\n(607) 565-2859, www.strayhavenspca.org \nOpen hours (winter): Tues, Wed & Thurs Noon - 6pm; Sat 10am-4pm",

            "description": "Dudley is  a very affectionate and beautiful dog looking for an active and loving home. He was not given much attention or direction in his first year on this earth but is now in a intense training program where he has learned to not only walk well on a leash, but he is doing pack walks with 8 other dogs. He has integrated into a very large pack and is learning that the world is a fun and safe place. Dudley loves to play and just need a patient and experienced family that will show him how to be a part of a household. He is potty trained as well. I think Dudley would do best with older children because he is playful and may knock over small kids, even though he wouldn't mean to. Dudley comes with a trainer that will show you how to maintain everything he has learned. Dudley is eager to please and treat motivated. \n\nDudley is dog friendly and will pair best with a dog who can match his energy and run around and play in the backyard with. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Dudley or want to see videos of Dudley in action, please reach out.\n\nTo apply for adoption: \nhttps://forgottencoastanimalrescue.org/adoption-application",

Seriously????\n\nAs soon as we saw the plea, we knew we could not let this precious boy die alone at Barc, because yet another human had let him down.\n\nToto\n\nis a pretty simple guy who just wants some love. He loves to sit right next to you with your arm draped around him.\n\nHe is estimated to be about 11 years old. He is a cattle dog mix and unfortunately, is heartworm positive, but of course we will take care of that.\n\nToto\n\nis a great boy who would love a super comfy bed and a reliable human to spend the rest of his life with.

She was vet checked as are all our in takes and found to be pregnant. Hum we thought it was all the good food she was eating! She had her puppies and all of them will be available for adoption in 2021. Her puppies are now 4 weeks old and will be ready for adoption in a few weeks. There are 6 of them :Art, Cousin Eddie, Ellen, Aunt Bethany, Clark, and Russell. Once the kids are weaned it's  Mika's turn to find a good home where she can be spoiled.\n\nPlease contact Andrea @ andrea@oglalapetproject.org for an adoption application. Adoption fee is $200. Adoption applications are processed by OPP volunteers, since we do not have a shelter facility we check references and meet with you in your home to discuss the pet you are interested in adopting. The adoption fee for all OPP dogs/puppies is $200 which includes vaccinations, dewormer, flea/tick treatment and spay/neuter surgery - and in many cases we've treated the pet for much more if it arrives to OPP ill or injured. Our adoption fee helps cover to cover some of these costs - adopters are welcome to make an additional donation to the program at the time of adoption so we can continue to help other unwanted pets on Pine Ridge.\n\nVisit us on Facebook to learn more about our work facebook.com/OglalaPetProject Thank you for choosing to adopt a rescued animal!",

She is one of our younger Frosted Faces at only 7 years old, and she weighs 7 lbs.\n\nShortly after Chi Chi became a Frosted Face, she spent some time in a Foster home.\n\nChi Chi\n\nshared\n\nher Foster home with\nt\nhree other dogs and got along with all of them\n\n.\n\nHer Foster Mom says Chi Chi loves to snuggle, soak up the sun, and follow her all around the house! She started playing with toys while she was there, too!\n\nBack at Frosted Faces, Chi Chi is loved by our volunteers for her sweet nature and for being a cuddle bug! She can often be found hanging out with one or two of her Frosted Friends on a bed.\n\nChi Chi would love a home of her own! Could it be with you? Apply to meet this precious girl: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family.

            "description": "The photo session in the bark park shared with 10-month-old Ludwig revealed an amazingly talented canine with a seemingly endless inventory of surprising skills. He has a quiet, attentive nature and despite his athletic stature, is a very gentle creature. He proudly performs an instantaneous sit, both on request and at his own discretion. You will find it hard to follow his motion as he shifts from a stand into a sit so quickly that it seems to materialize via teleportation. Ludwig has great eye/mouth coordination as he catches virtually all treats tossed in his general direction. A few of them were blown by the gusting wind beyond his reach and he would \u201chunt\u201d them down with great delight. His joyful, energetic play was galvanizingly entertaining and awe inspiring. He was respectfully awarded his name as his elation stirred the memory of Beethoven\u2019s interpretation of the \u201cOde to Joy\u201d. (Ludwig is also celebrating the 250th anniversary of the birth of his favorite musician). As the photographer turned away to reposition for the next shot, Ludwig would silently appear behind him and give the human\u2019s hand a tender touch with his nose just to let him know that he was going to be there, and you were the total focus of his attention. With a name like Ludwig, you know he has to be good.",

Like most Humane Society canines who are given the opportunity to experience the freedom and seemingly unlimited confines of the bark park, he responded with unfettered enthusiasm. After a few minutes of spirited exploration, 2-year-old Sebastian approached his human for a reassuring touch of appreciation, which was immediately shared. Sebastian enjoyed prancing about while performing as the singular parade participant posing proudly with his tail held high in a show dog presentation in spite of the prevailingly gusting wind which tried its best to push it to the side.

At 9 years old Roxi is still young at heart. She loves going for daily strolls and playing with stuffed toys. She is completely house trained and great in the car. Although she is picky about her dog friends, she hasn\u2019t met a person she doesn\u2019t like. Her dream is to have a a loving family, warm bed, and plenty of treats! She has the typical goofy boxer attitude.\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------\nhttps://puppymillrescueteam.org/dog-adoption-application/\n\n\nThis dog is located in Rochester NY.  Applications for this dog will be considered within a 60 mile radius\n\nWhen the application has been reviewed their foster will be in touch!  Make sure to check your spam email, it will be coming from a fosters personal email address.\n\n\nPuppy Mill Rescue Team New York State registration No. is RR400 as we are a registered 501c3 nonprofit organization. We rescue discarded dogs and puppies from puppy mills and place them with ethical rescues that will care for their veterinary needs, house them in volunteer foster homes, and eventually adopt them into loving families. The PMRT also works to educate the public about puppy mills and supports efforts to eradicate the existence of the inhumane mass dog breeding facilities commonly known as puppy mills. The PMRT promotes choosing pet adoption, over purchasing online or from a pet store, as the vast majority of those are sourced by puppy mills.",

He can be a bit goofy and is generally happy even if he's barking when he meets new people. He is working on his leash skills so an experienced dog owner would be best with a fenced yard. He likes to be around his people and is super sweet, loves attention and will cuddle up with you to watch tv. A single family home would be recommended as he can have a loud bark. \n\nAs part of Jackson's $250 adoption fee, he will be microchipped, up to date on vaccines, neutered and up to date on flea, tick and heartworm meds. If you have more questions, please contact us at dogteam@pawsforlifenc.org. If you wish to adopt, please fill out an application at pawsforlifenc.org.",

This one is perfect!\nCupcake is a female approximately 5 to 6 years old 44 pound English bulldog. She was previously from a breeder, and did have several litters by C-section.\nCupcake loves people, and she does OK walking on a leash, and knows to go potty outside most of the time.She is a sweet and loving girl and is ready for a home of her own.\n\nCupcake also has had bloodwork and dental done recently! Yay!\n\nInterested in becoming a forever home for Cupcake? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Cupcake.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Cupcake the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \nFor immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.\n\nOur adoption fee is $475. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

She is a Staffordshire terrier/American bully/pitbull mix with some super mutt for extra spice.\n\nChanel, our sweet mama  was surrendered to a vet clinic because she needed an emergency c section and the owner couldn't afford it. She not only raised her 2 surviving pups (out of 13), but 4 weeks later took on 5 newborns whose mother had died! This supermom deserves her own happy ever after now. She would do best as an only dog and she can jump a 4 foot fence. \nChanel was fostered in a home with children and she was just as sweet with human kids as she was with furbabies! She is well-behaved and eager to please her humans.  She would make a great addition to any home.\n\nChanel also has had complete bloodwork done recently \nInterested in becoming a forever home for Chanel? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Chanel.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Chanel the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \nFor immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.\n\nOur adoption fee is $475. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

She is crate trained and leash trained. She is spayed, up to date with all vaccinations, microchipped heartworm negative and on monthly prevention. \n\nLucie is still learning her manners, she is still all puppy at heart! She loves to cuddle in bed and watch movies or go for a long walk and explore. She is very smart and could easily be trained to do tricks and special commands.\n\nShe has not been tested with other dogs besides her littermate Pattie, but we know she does not like cats or other small animals.\n\nWe would love for Pattie and Lucie to be adopted together since they are  bonded. But exceptions can be made if the right family comes along. We want forever homes for both girls, even if apart.\n\nAdoption fee is $250.00 each or $400.00 if adopted together\n\n",

            "description": "This is Roxie!\n\nRoxie was brought into the Orange County Shelter as a stray. She had a microchip, but no owner was found, so we made Roxie a Frosted Face on November 24th. She is 10 years old, weighs 11 lbs., and is blind. Roxie is incredibly sweet, loves to be held, and gives little kisses. She is good with other dogs and cats, too!\n\nRoxie's sweetness may be why a two-week Frosted Fling turned into a Foster home! Roxie's Foster Mom has taken care of her as she has recovered from several surgeries: dental surgery to remove 15 teet and repair an oronasal fistula, spay, mammary masses removed, and hernia repairs. According to her Foster Mom, Roxie is a new woman! She eats comfortably now and walks 2-3 miles easily with pep in her step! More good news: the biopsy results from the mammary masses came back benign! Little Roxie is ready to find her forever family!\n\nHer Foster Mom shares, \"Roxie is the absolute sweetest little baby girl! She needs time to figure out her new space and feel relaxed, but she absolutely will relax and will be the best little companion. She is blind after all, so it's only reasonable to give a girl some time to map out the place. Here's a few other things I've learned about her:\n\n-She sleeps through the night like sleeping beauty. She sleeps on a dog bed in my room and once she's all tucked in she'll sleep for at least 8 hours easy. No accidents through the night either!\n\n-I've left her home alone in a crate and given free roam. Had no issues leaving her in an area free to roam, she just sleeps.\n\n-LOVES food, and it's kind of hilarious to watch because she's so tiny!\n\n-Loves her person and will wiggle uncontrollably anytime you go pet her! She also very much enjoys being held like a baby. She is going to be someone's perfect little baby girl.\"\n\nMight Roxie be your little girl? Apply to meet her: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees, and we help with medical costs!\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 1/27/21 KG",

She is crate trained but its not her favorite place to be. She is spayed, up to date with all vaccinations, microchipped and on flea prevention. \n\nUnfortunately Pattie came to us with heartworms. She has started the long process of being rid of those pesky heartworms forever! \n\n\nPattie is still learning her manners, she is still all puppy at heart! She loves to cuddle in bed and watch movies or go for a long walk and explore. She is very smart and could easily be trained to do tricks and special commands.\n\nWe would love for Pattie and Lucie her littermate to be adopted together since they are bonded. But exceptions can be made if the right family comes along. We want great forever homes for both girls, even if apart.\n\nAdoption fee is $250.00 each or $400.00 for both girls.\n\nShe has not been tested with other dogs besides her littermate Lucie.",

She is a good girl that has had all of her vetting done and is now looking for a loving family. \nShe has not been around cats and we would say best to not send to a cat home. Also as she is a larger dog--we would not adopt to a home with toddlers or small dogs as she could accidently bump them over.  She is very smart and eager to please--she would love a family that would spend time with her---talking walks, maybe some training, and snuggling on the couch.

            "description": "Bella is in a foster home, and is currently not at the shelter. Please find info below on how to adopt her, thanks.\n\n\n\nHomebody seeks homebody: Bella is the most loving, gentle dog with all humans. One of her favorite activities is snuggling on the couch. When you pet her, she makes happy little grunts. Talk sweetly to her, and she wiggles from her nose to her tail.\n\n\n\nBella has great manners inside the home: She won't chew your stuff or steal food, and she rarely barks.\n\n\n\nBella is not a fan of other dogs. She is working on staying calmer when she sees other dogs outside, but she will never have doggie friends.\n\n\n\nFor this reason, Bella needs to live in a single-family home with a securely fenced yard, ideally in a quiet neighborhood.\n\n\n\nBella also needs an experienced, patient guardian who is committed to continuing her training. While she is good with children, she requires an adult handler due to her dog reactivity. No cats or critters, please-they are too much fun to chase!\n\n\n\nBella would be a wonderful, easy companion for someone who works from home and is content to exercise her mostly in the yard. Even though she's still young (2-4 years old), Bella needs only moderate exercise.\n\n\n\nHOW TO ADOPT - Please fill out a Dog Adoption Application, available at http://www.seattle.gov/animalshelter/forms.htm and email it to the Seattle Animal Shelter Foster Dog Program at adoptionreview@gmail.com.\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Many of our dogs will receive numerous applications, and the Seattle Animal Shelter asks for your patience during the process of finding the very best match. If you have questions about this dog that have not been answered above, please contact us at sasfosterdogs@gmail.com. If you would like to arrange to meet this dog, you must submit an adoption application. Thank you!",

Inquiries will not be answered at this time.\n\nRain will remain with her family until she can be placed in an appropriate home that fits her needs! She is not for a first time dog owner.  Here is what her current owner has to say about her!\n1. DEAF/doesn\u2019t respond to most correction.  Rain really needs someone with time and patience to work with her. Very high prey drive, once locked onto a target she\u2019s difficult to distract. 2. Likes to choose to ignore commands but has the drive to learn  3. Very hand shy (has never been hit in our home, we are unsure about her previous home.  She doesn\u2019t like brooms or fast hand movements. Hates the vacuum) 4. Slight food guarding with other dog in the house. Never showed any reactivity towards person taking food away though 5. Absolutely NO CATS as her prey drive is very high. No young kids. (13+ fine) 7. No small dogs or small livestock such as rabbits, chickens etc.  8. Possibly ok with large dog (lived with large male GSD and did fine, but has very alpha personality so would depend on other dog) 9. Loves to play with big dogs she likes but can get a bit intense and seem aggressive in her play style. 10. Will fence fight relentlessly (always checks to see if other dog is there when let outside) 11. Digs a lot when she\u2019s bored (needs secure yard/plenty of activities. I think she would highly benefit as a companion animal as she thrives off of being with her people) 12. Chews/shreds things heavily when bored (ex. Chewed food bowl, backyard hose, chair legs, shredded blanket in kennel... etc) 13. Weird about going through doors.  14. Knows how to sit with hand signal or for food/treats 15. Needs to learn leash manners, (she has close to none) Wants to be head of the \u201cpack\u201d and pulls horribly. 16. Leash reactive with other dogs (sometimes once let off leash she\u2019s fine. It depends) 17. Very calm and well-mannered when indoors as long as she has people around. 18. Frantic when crated initially, but will calm down and curl up to sleep eventually. (A toy to chew helps her calm down) 19. Loves car rides but does better restrained because she wants to \u201chelp\u201d you drive 20. LOVES water/snow 21. Has occasionally peed indoors to mark her territory, otherwise completely house trained. 22. Is used to being crated at night, but will also happily sleep inside on a bed. 23. Really likes carrots/ enjoys whole large carrot to chew 24. Enjoys hard chew toys/hooves/antlers. (Good way to keep her happy and entertained when she can\u2019t be supervised so she doesn\u2019t chew other things)\n Please research POSITIVE training techniques before applying to adopt. We care very much about your application answers and they are reviewed for completeness and the best match.   Please fill out an application on the included link: https://threerivershs.org/adoption-app-2/\n\nThe adoption fee of $125 includes spay/neuter, current vaccines, microchip, free vet visit, 30 days of pet health insurance, puppy book, and engraved ID tag.\n",

He comes as a bonded pair with his favorite blue Kong ball, which he carries around wherever he goes. He is truly the best big dog - very good manners when it comes to jumping, sharing his toys and food, and being respectful of other dog's space. He has been introduced to multiple female dogs, and is friendly and happy to share his space with them. He is crate trained (though he'd rather not be in it), house-trained, and is very well behaved within the house. \n\nBruno was rescued from the animal shelter, overlooked for 3 months because he was heartworm positive. He has had his first shot and will be wrapping up treatment mid January. All of his treatment is covered by HFGM.",

Come on down and meet her today! (:\n\n\"I said Muf-... I said, uh, que pasa?\" Meet Banzai, our favorite little hyena! She's a rowdy gal who absolutely LOVES LOVES LOVES water!

I am slow to come around to strangers so a house where it's just me and my family most of the time would be the best fit for me. I am curious about other dogs but I haven't had any buddies here at the shelter yet. I chased chickens and didn't like the cows in my previous home so I may be too much for cats! I would get along with older children who go slow with me. I love to have toys around to play with! My favorite ones are spikey balls that squeak! I enjoy a good butt scratch as all labs do! I am very smart too! I know how to sit, shake, take nice & get down! I keep my kennel clean and walk nice on the leash! I like to go for rides in the car too and it would be fun to run errands with you! I would like to meet you to see if I could be the boy for you! I can't wait to get to know you and check out my new furrever home today!",

            "description": "I'm Jack but they call me Jack Jack sometimes. I absolutely love people and other dogs are exciting, too! Cats are kind of scary so I think I'd rather leave them be. I love playing with other dogs and then getting pets from people. If I see a tennis ball being thrown, I'm ready to go get it! Tug of war is turning out to be a fun game, too. I have yet to meet a human, dog, or toy I don't like. I'm all about fun and playing and enjoying life. \n          The shelter is not my forever home so I'm camping out here until my perfect family comes along. I love kongs and bones to chew on. I'm doing pretty well on the leash, too. I'm such a friendly guy when it comes to other dogs because I want to be friends with everyone. \n          I'm a spry 2 years old and 55 lbs. I think I am catching on to the house and kennel training part but the shelter is not the best place for me to practice because nothing beats a home with friends and love. Although the shelter is not my forever home, I'm keeping my spirits up because I know my family is out there and it's just about being patient waiting for them to find me. If you're looking for a fun and friendly guy to experience life with or maybe your dog wants a playmate, too, come visit me at the shelter and bring your dog if you have one and I'll show you my sparkling personality!\n\nAll dogs come with a microchip, annual vaccinations including EBR rabies license and tag, dewormer, vet exam and spay/neuter. Adoption fee is $95-$175.\n\nCompanion Animal Alliance\n2550 Gourrier Ave.\nBaton Rouge, LA 70820\n\nphone: 225-408-5360\n\nOpen 7 days a week - 10 am to 5 pm\n\nPlease contact the shelter for more information. Email is best adopt@caabr.org\n",

I love to play catch with balls and snowballs! My foster mommy will throw a handful of snow in the air and I love to run through it! Every time I catch that snow I get the zoomies and run around the yard as fast as I can!!! She always claps for me, which makes me go faster!!! \nI love to stand or sit on the chair in the living room and make sure my backyard is safe from intruders. I'm pretty good at the neighborhood watch gig!\nI also love when my foster kids play tug with me. It's one of my favorite things to do!!!!! I also love to find those silly squeaker in stuffies. They don't last long, but it seems every time my humans run an errand, they pick up 1 or 2 more for me to destroy. \nI don't love my kennel, but I go in like a good girl when my humans have to go to work. I mean, they need to make some money to buy me all those stuffies. When they come home I am waiting patiently for them to let me out. I never bark.\nI'm a really good girl looking for a \"\"fur\"\"ever home with a family who loves to play and cuddle.\nSincerely, \nDaisy (AKA: Daisy-roo, Daisy-doo, Daisy Dukes, Pretty Girl)\n.\n.\nAll animals are current on vaccinations and microchipped prior to adoption. All cats and kittens are Feline Leukemia and FIV tested. All dogs and puppies 6 months and older are heartworm tested. All animals 6 months and older are spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Any kittens/puppies will have refundable spay/neuter deposits included in their adoption fee; spaying/neutering will be the responsibility of the adopter and a refund will be issued upon proof of the surgery being completed by the adopter's veterinarian of choice.\n.\n.\nKitten adoption fees are $150 (includes a $40 refundable spay/neuter deposit). Cat adoption fees are $120, unless otherwise noted. Dog adoption fees may vary between $200-250. Puppies adoption fees may vary between $300-350 (includes a $100 refundable spay/neuter deposit). All adoption fees are taxable (tax is not included in the prices listed above).\n.\n.\n\"\"Sponsored\"\" means that a donor has covered a portion of the adoption fee for that animal. \"\"Fully sponsored\"\" means that a donor has paid the full adoption fee for the animal.",

            "description": "Fawn and Willow were boxer/pit littermates, adopted together at just 2 months, and they lived in the same house for the last 6 years, along with another, larger fur \"brother\". Willow has been adopted and Fawn hopes that it will be her turn soon to find a forever home.\n\nFawn was raised with and loves both kids and adults. She has lived with other dogs, but can sometimes be particular about her canine companions so either meet & greets or slow introductions to other dogs are advised. We are not sure about cats, though she did show some prey drive to woodland creatures around their home. Fawn is playful and loves toys - she's a fun & goofy girl. She's a nice medium size at around 38 pounds, too.\n\nFawn is a gentle cuddle bug who has now come back to us because her family has unfortunately lost their home and sadly cannot keep her. She is house broken, crate trained, and walks well on leash.\n\nPlease visit our website at www.EHRdogs.org to fill out an application today & be sure to mention this girl's name, FAWN!! She is patiently waiting for her new family to find her.",

We believe she was abandoned by her previous owners because of her vision loss. She has cataracts in both eyes, so she is vision impaired.\n\nWhen Petunia was found she was terrified, cold, and did not eat or drink for several days. If she had not been rescued Petunia would have died from starvation. After a few months of TLC  she was later transported to  Los Angeles so she could have a better chance at finding a loving forever home. \n\nPetunia is a couch potato and enjoys lounging around the house. She likes to be held and going out for short walks. Petunia gets along with other dogs and keeps to herself. She would be best suited in any home with a quiet, less active lifestyle. Petunia is microchipped, vaccinated, and spayed.\n\nIf you are interested in Petunia, please complete the on-line application that can be found on our website: www.adoptmerecue.org or contact us for more information.\n\nLOCAL ADOPTION ONLY.\n",

He is very affectionate and sweet: Hw-; 43lbs; 1-2 yrs old; bull mix; 11/19/2018\n\nTheo (now Axle) was returned 11/2020. Axle needs a home with no small animals or cats. \n\nAxle is a great dog. Axle knows how to sit and stay. He crates very well and walks nicely on a leash. He LOVES children of all ages and plays well with small children. He has no issue with older/bigger dogs. He has no food aggression. He has been an indoor dog since being adopted in 2018 other than going outside for playtime and potty breaks.  He is housebroken, but if left alone for an extended amount of time, he may have an accident, as would any dog. He has a fluffy chair that he lays in often, and we have fixed it up in his kennel for him. He seems confused and sad. \n\nHe is neutered, microchipped, housebroken, and used to being in a home with a family. \n\nAxle would be happiest in a home with no small animals, or access to small animals.\n\nHe is an extremely well mannered dog. He knows how to sit, walks on a leash, and is very affectionate.",

Ella can be a bit shy and submissive when meeting new people and dogs but within minutes she will be your very best friend. \n\nShe would do best in a home with older kids 15+ years old because of her tendency to be more on the nervous side. \n\nShe currently lives in a home with four other dogs and she loves every minute of it! Her ideal home would have at least one other confident dog for her to feed off and to mentor her on how to dog. Her foster takes her to work several times a week and she is a great office dog but is also great in a crate if she has to stay home!\n\nElla is crate trained and potty trained.

We think he might be a Lab-Boxer mix.\n\nMason loves to be pet and shake. He would do well in a home where he can get lots of exercise and activity. He's lived in a home with another dog (littermate) since he was born, but they started not getting along.  Which can happen when two puppies stay together. \n\nWe think for now Mason would do better in a home without adults and or adults and older teens without other dogs, he needs a bit of proper socializing in the doggo department. \n\nHe'd do better in a home with a tall fence (he's a jumper) versus an apartment or condo, he will bark when he hears noises or someone pulls up. \n\nMason does best crated when home alone.  He should be supervised in any new setting as he sometimes likes to sneak off and chew things he's not supposed to.  We think in the right home when he's getting the right amount of exercise he will grow into a good boy. \n\nHe is neutered, vaccinated, housebroken, and microchipped. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please go to www.luckylabrescue.com and complete an adoption application.\n",

They are approximately 7-8 months old, up to date on vaccinations, neutered & microchipped. \n\nSonny is just your typical 7-8 month old pup. He loves exploring new things, learning new tricks and showing his humans how good of a boy he is. He was apart of a litter that was unexpected and there was a plea to save the entire litter before the shelter was involved. We stepped right up to save these handsome fellas! \n\nSonny is house trained, kennel trained & knows his basic commands/manners. \n\nInterested adopters can fill out an application at canehavenrescue.com. \nAny possible questions about Sonny, please email canehavenrescue@gmail.com \n\nCane Haven Rescue will transport any of their adoptable dogs to the right home. We do require adoption fees that are based on the age & health status of the adoptable dog. The adoption fee covers every single dog in CHR with vaccinations, heartworm test, deworming, microchip, spay/neuter & medications. All CHR adoptable dogs are current on their monthly  heartworm and flea medication. A CHR representative will do a home check to ensure the pets are placed in a secure and loving home. \n\nwww.canehavenrescue.com",

Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\n\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com.

            "description": "Meet Jezabel, our precious and affectionate Malinois mix who is approximately three years old. The first thing you need to know about Jezabel, she loves her people, even more than treats often. She is very affectionate towards her people and will sing and dance (bark on her back legs) to welcome you back home in excitement. She seems to more independent, so she should be the only dog in the house, but she will also help make sure that no squirrels or other rodents have taken residence in your yard. She enjoys walks, but she does pull on the leash in order to get her nose to all of those good smells. She is ready to be in a home where she can bond with her human and show how good of a companion she could be. If you are interested in Jezabel, please fill out an application on our website or call us in the office M-Th between 10am-4pm to discuss her further. \n\nPlease note that Jezabel has been diagnosed with moderate to severe hip dysplasia. At the shelter, she has been receiving Adequan shots to microscopically build her cartilage back up. There are three more shots in this series and they will be provided with the adoption. She has also been receiving Underwater Therapy at Sierra Vet Specialists while performing rehab tasks everyday at the shelter. She has three more sessions at SVS and these are also included in the adoption price. Since her rehab efforts have begun, the vet noted that Jezabel's range of motion has increased, her muscle mass has increased, and she is less guarding of her legs. The daily rehab efforts will need to be continued in the home, but are also a great source of exercise, mentally and physically, for Jezabel. Jezabel enjoys walks, but her hips do get more sore if she pulls a lot on a walk, so she may need help learning how to be a better leash companion. This was accomplished in her foster home a year ago, but she has forgotten a little.",

            "description": "Please email info@prairiepaws.org to fill out an application and arrange an appointment to meet the pet. Want to get a head start on the application? Here's the link: DOG ADOPTION APPLICATION: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/PPAS/Dog\n\nVixen is a magical male heeler mix puppy. His estimated DOB is 09/23/2020. He came to our shelter as an owner surrender and his weight at intake was 12 lbs. He is so ready to venture into puppyhood with you! He is super smart and wants to learn how he can become your favorite family member. Are you ready to adopt? Are you ready for puppyhood? We estimate him to grow up to be a medium-sized bundle of joy. Vixen adoption fee is $225 and includes a medical exam, sterilization, age-appropriate vaccines, dewormer, heartworm test, and microchip\n\nVisual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. As we get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n\nAll PPAS puppies and dogs are up to date on all of their vaccines (including rabies if age appropriate), and will be micro chipped and registered in the adopter's name at the time of adoption. Adopters get a free consultation at an area vet partner within 14 days of adoption. Any dog that is six months of age or older will be tested for Heartworms and if found negative, will be kept on Heartworm prevention during their shelter stay, after the adoption it is up to the adopter to continue the highly recommended Heartworm preventative treatment. Also all PPAS shelter dogs are treated with a monthly topical flea/tick preventative and we ask that adopters continue that treatment as well. Per state law we sterilize all shelter pets before they begin their new fabulous lives with their new families.  \n\nOur animals change daily, so please check our lists of adoptable dogs and adoptable cats frequently. Once you find an animal you\u2019d like to adopt, the next steps are to complete an application and request a meet and greet with the foster. Make sure to be thorough and help us understand why you\u2019re interested in that particular animal \u2014 and why your home is a great fit. Based on your answers we may even have a better fit for you.\n\nAdoption fees:  Adoption fees must be paid in full at the time of adoption \u2013 no partial payments are accepted.  All major credit cards are accepted.  Adoption fees vary. \n\nTaking your animal home:  The State of Kansas requires that all cats and dogs must be sterilized (spayed/neutered) before going to their new homes.  In most cases, animals will have already been sterilized before being placed on the adoption floor and you will be able to take your new companion home with you the day of adoption.  However, if the animal is not yet sterilized, they will need to stay at the shelter and we will schedule the surgery on the next available date (usually within a week).  All cats must go home in a carrier.\n\nIf you are interested in this pet, please either email Prairie Paws Animal Shelter at info@prairiepaws.org, for an application or visit our website @ prairiepaws.org for more information.\n\nPrairie Paws Animal Shelter\n3173 HWY K68\nOttawa, KS 66067\n785-242-2967\nprairiepaws.org\ninfo@prairiepaws.org\n",

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out our dog adoption questionnaire and e-mail it to lauren.baird.htar@gmail.com\n\nDue to COVID-19 precautions, all animals for adoption through Homeward Trails can be met by appointment only. You can make an appointment to meet available dogs at our ADOPTION CENTER by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet and available cats at MEOW PALACE by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet1.\nFor animals in FOSTER homes, please submit an online application and an adoption team member will reply with next steps. We thank you for your patience as we work to keep saving lives during this difficult time.\n\nPLEASE VISIT THIS WEBSITE TO FIND THE ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE:\nhttp://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-forms/\n\nElijah was a stray. He just turned up on someone's porch one day in terrible shape, dragging about two feet of chain with him everywhere he went. Who knows how long he had been on his own! His fur was dirty and matted and clumps of hair were missing. \n\nAt first, he growled. He was scared, unsure what to expect from strangers. But as those strangers set about helping him--finally freeing him from the dragging chain, shaving the dirty mats off his body--he began to open up. With just a little kindness, he seemed to become a whole new dog. \n\nWe are still learning so much about Elijah. For instance, we're learning that he loves big fluffy beds and toys. He loves playing tug-of-war and playing with his tennis ball. For all we know, this might be the first time in his life that he has ever enjoyed such simple luxuries. It's hard not to spoil him!\n\nElijah loves getting head scratches. He follows you around and does great in his crate. He is looking for a home with limited stairs as his back legs do have some lameness. He also has some eyesight/hearing problems but that isn't stopping him. He is very mild mannered and patient. Can you give him a loving home that he deserves?\n\nAdoption Coordinator: Lauren B\nLocation: Foster Home\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $475. This fee INCLUDES spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program",

He has a hearing deficit but does very well.  \n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

He still plays and runs and enjoys life a lot, despite some arthritis in his legs. Herman gets along with all other dogs and likes kids as well. He is a very sweet boy, and loves attention and cuddling.\n\nHerman recently had his teeth cleaned and needed 9 extractions. his previous parents did not take very good care of him, poor guy.  He must have been in so much pain. The vet did a full exam and said Herman is a very healthy senior. He has a strong heart, and his blood work also came back normal. \n\nHerman is neutered, chipped, and up to date on all routine vaccinations. If you would like to meet Herman please contact us 661-724-0642 pawparent@gmail.com",

She absolutely loves people and always has a \"smile\" on her face! \n\nKarma has been in a foster home and foster mom says:\n\n\"She seems to be house trained.  We take her out every two hours or so but she has never had an accident. Twice she has sat in front of the back door to indicate she needs to go out. She never barks or scratches the door. \n\nShe has fallen in love with our neighbor\u2019s dog who is not returning the feeling. We think she would do best in a house with another sweet dog. \n\nShe is learning to walk on a leash. It is a slow walk as she sniffs everything!! \n\nOur adjectives are well-mannered, wonderful temperament, cuddly and quiet. She is playful on occasion but doesn\u2019t seem to understand fetch with a ball. Haha. She loves the Kong toy we got her, especially with\npeanut butter. Overall, just an easy, good-natured dog.\"\n\nWe rescued Karma and her 3 puppies as strays. Her date of birth is 11/5/2017 and she weighs 73lbs.\n\nYou can submit an adoption application for this sweet girl at http://www.fayettefcar.com/applicationform, where you can also review FCAR\u2019s adoption requirements.\n\nAll FCAR adoptable dogs have been spayed or neutered, are current on all vaccines, on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, microchipped, and come with a 30-day pet health guarantee. The adoption fee is $95 with an approved application. A fenced yard is required for Karma.",

While a little timid at first, I am a sweet loving pup looking for my forever home. I still become increasingly excited when my foster family plays with me. Although slightly older I am still full of life exhibiting my spunky, playful personality while playing with kids, dogs and toys. When not being active I love laying in the sun and being outdoors with others. I am crate and potty trained, but do not do well being restrained. I take pain medication for arthritis and am on a specific diet avoiding grain based foods which cause itchy lumps and bumps. I am an older dog but still love to play like a pup. I am looking for a family to love me unconditionally and accommodate my needs.\n\nIf you are interested in Diamond, please complete an adoption application at lastdaydogs.com",

Their elderly owners were unable to continue caring for them and asked us to find them a new home.  Medium in size, Bella is a pretty petite Lab mix and Lucy is a cute chunky Beagle/Cattle Dog mix.  Both listen well and are very well behaved loving pups.  Bella and Lucy are accustomed to being around older children and other dogs.  These ladies prefer a calm quiet household where someone is home most of the day.  Bella and Lucy are easy-going and just want to be your buddies.  They are perfectly content just hanging out around the house and making sure you\u2019re never lonely.  Neither is really into toys, but they do enjoy taking a daily stroll.  They also enjoy occasional trips to the park and ride well in the car.  Because of their prior situation, they may need some additional housetraining.  Both prefer going on grass if kept to a regular schedule.  A fenced in yard is needed to keep them safe when outside.  Bella and Lucy are really quite special and deserve a wonderful home.  Will that be with you?  \n\nTo adopt this pet, Click \"More About Us\" and then \"Adoption Application\" to be directed to our online HSNWGA application form.  You will be contacted by our Adoption Coordinator once your application is reviewed and approved.  Due to high volume of applications, we are only able to contact those applicants that best meet the needs of that individual pet.",

            "description": "Bella and Lucy are best friends that have been together their whole lives.  Now six and half years old, these girls are very sweet family dogs anyone would love to own.  Their elderly owners were unable to continue caring for them and asked us to find them a new home.  Medium in size, Bella is a pretty petite Lab mix and Lucy is a cute chunky Beagle/Cattle Dog mix.  Both listen well and are very well behaved loving pups.  Bella and Lucy are accustomed to being around older children and other dogs.  These ladies prefer a calm quiet household where someone is home most of the day.  Bella and Lucy are easy-going and just want to be your buddies.  They are perfectly content just hanging out around the house and making sure you\u2019re never lonely.  Neither is really into toys, but they do enjoy taking a daily stroll.  They also enjoy occasional trips to the park and ride well in the car.  Because of their prior situation, they may need some additional housetraining.  Both prefer going on grass if kept to a regular schedule.  A fenced in yard is needed to keep them safe when outside.  Bella and Lucy are really quite special and deserve a wonderful home.  Will that be with you?  \n\nTo adopt this pet, Click \"More About Us\" and then \"Adoption Application\" to be directed to our online HSNWGA application form.  You will be contacted by our Adoption Coordinator once your application is reviewed and approved.  Due to high volume of applications, we are only able to contact those applicants that best meet the needs of that individual pet.",

            "description": "Meet Drew! This handsome retriever mix is looking for a home to call his own! Drew has a comical, goofy personality, and is ready to make his new family laugh every day with his goofy antics. Drew is a high energy, fun loving dog who would love a family to take him on daily jogs through the neighborhood, and throw the ball for him in the backyard. He LOVES toys, and will happily entertain himself tossing his toys all throughout the yard. \n\nHis foster reports he is learning to play fetch with his ball, and is getting really good about bringing it back each time you throw it. Drew also enjoys swimming in his foster's pool, and has recently discovered how fun sprinklers can be! Drew loves to chew, and will happily chew on an antler or bone on a comfy bed to pass the time. Drew is a smart kiddo, and is looking for a family who will continue all the good manners he is working so hard to learn. This clever boy already knows how to \"sit\" and \"lay down\" when asked! \n\nDrew has worries about meeting new people, and is looking for a home that will make sure he feels safe and comfortable. He will do best in an adult only home, with a yard, in a quiet neighborhood. Drew does not do well with frequent changes in his environment, and lots of hustle and bustle in the house makes him nervous. \n\nHe is crate trained and house broken, and has already mastered the doggie door in his foster home. He is working on his leash manners, and does best when walked in a no pull harness. He rides well in the car as well, and would be a great errand running companion. If you are looking for an active canine companion, Drew is the one for you - schedule an adoption appointment today! \n\nTo learn more about Drew, watch this video: https://youtu.be/27U_Qzyyp1Y\nWatch Drew play with his pal, Colton: https://youtu.be/oEbi-bBJhBM",

So loving and sweet, Raven is always out for a little attention and maybe even a few treats. 1-year-old Raven has captured the hearts of both volunteers and staff, who adore her delightful personality. Eager to please, Raven walks very well on the leash and even sits for a treat. Though she came to us as a stray, Raven is very people-focused and loves to be pet. She even loves jumping up to give you sweet kisses. Raven can't wait to meet you, come pay this angel a visit!\n\n\n\nAll pets at this shelter are up-to-date on shots and will be altered and micro-chipped upon adoption.  Please visit our shelter to meet the many adorable orphans that are available for adoption.  When inquiring about a specific animal you saw on this website, please include the ID number associated with the animal. We are open 7 days a week from 12pm-4:30pm Monday thru Friday and 12pm-4:30 Saturday & Sunday. For information and/or directions call 732-922-0100 or email TintonFallsahs@ahsppz.org\n\nThere is an adoption fee required.  The Society cannot accept personal checks but we do accept Visa, MC, AE, and cash.\n\n                               IMPORTANT\n As part of our adoption process, we must have proof of residency.  Homeowners must show proof of ownership; a valid lease that states \"pets ok\" is required for renters before an adoption can be approved. If you do not have a lease with your landlord you will need a notarized letter.",

Quinn the character is an affectionate 7-year-old pit bull mix. Her friendly and playful personality is sure to capture the heart of a lucky adopter. Quinn loves being pet, going for walks, and spending time with her people. She really is as sweet as they come. She's got one of those ear-to-ear smiles that lights up the room, and a joyful playfulness to her energy. Her tail wag quickly turns into a wiggle butt and full body waggle that's so excited to see you come to take her for a walk! Quinn gets along well with most other dogs and probably wouldn't mind sharing a home with another dog.

I'm just not sure why. I have been going on walks with some dogs at the shelter. I've been told i'm a good leash walker. I'm not sure what that means. Maybe you can tell me when I get to meet you. I love playing fetch. One of my favorite volunteers plays fetch with me non stop. I will say when I like a tennis ball you'll know why! I tend to make holes in them. Don't worry though I am a smart boy who doesn't eat it or chew anything else up! Oh its getting cold and the staff and volunteers have been putting clothes on me. I do not mind it at all once I know you of course. If you want to meet me call to set up an appointment.",

He will need to be leashed outside until he is comfortable\nFood Aggressive: no, but is highly food motivated and will go after scraps\nWalks on Leash: yes\n\nBackstory: My name is Carl and I am a 5 year old gentleman! I was found in Kentucky as a stray, but I really like couches and table scraps, so I may have been in a home at one point before coming to Canada. That being said, I need parents who can teach me boundaries and proper training around couches and people food so I don't thinks it's always mine. It might take me a bit to warm up, but once I feel comfortable, I'm a happy boy. I would do better in an adult only home, because kids can be overwhelming for me. I'm a very loving boy who would do best in an active home (I love to run!) and who can help me get all my energy out. I love my toys and of course curling up on a soft bed. I am a hound who likes to follow his nose, so no little critters please and make sure to keep an eye on me when I'm outside - I can climb! I can't wait to meet you and be part of your family!",

We think he's a 'young adult'.\n\nHe sits to be leashed, likes to play with toys and will share them with his people. He does jump up and is a bit mouthy, but this is easy to work on with training. \nHe is very playful with other dogs, he's played with a male and a female here at the shelter. \n\nA volunteer who spent time with Jaypaz at the shelter reports: Seems young, VERY playful, a little mouthy but it's easy to redirect his attention with a toy. Enjoys attention and wants to give kisses. \nWATCH JAYPAZ'S VIDEO where he plays with his friend, Patches! \n\nAdoption fee includes vaccinations, spay/neuter, heartworm test, and microchip.\n*Dogs are pending behavior and other-animal assessment unless otherwise noted here.\n\n\nAvailable for adoption, foster, or rescue at:\n\nJefferson Parish Animal Shelter - Westbank\n2701 Lapalco Blvd; Harvey, LA 70058\n504-349-5111 \n\nPlease provide ID number when visiting shelter.

I tend to do well with most dogs, but have gotten into trouble with others.  I really need a quiet home, that I can just go for walks with my new owners and watch tv and just chill.  I also think a home without kids or cats would be a good move for me.  I tend to get overstimulated when the energy level goes up, so best to just have a quiet home. \n\nMeet-Your-Match Canine-ality color is: Orange Busy Bee!!\nFor safety's sake, we are looking for homes with physical fenced in areas.\nPlease fill out our online adoption survey at www.mackenzies.info",

Sheena is new to us but we can already see she prefers the company of women to men.  We are looking for Sheena to get into an only pet home with no children and only women.  Sheena may have had some bad experiences with men in the past and we want our adopters to have positive experiences with their new family members.  With time and training we're hoping Sheena can learn to trust males in the future.  Are you willing to give Sheena the life she deserves and show her what a wonderful world it can be?  Email us today!\n\nPictures in snow taken by Meaghan Susi Photography\n\n*PLEASE E-MAIL OUR ADOPTION COORDINATOR AT HEARTOFRIADOPTION@GMAIL.COM FOR A COPY OF OUR APPLICATION. Our facility is currently still closed and will be open by appointment only!*.",

            "description": "Axel is a 5 year old male Husky mix. A nice person found him as stray and brought him to the shelter. Check out his gorgeous black coat with silver highlights and then glance into his beautiful light blue eyes! This guy is a show stopper. This handsome boy most likely has never been an inside dog as he is scared of being indoors. Because he is still learning to adapt to being indoors, he would do best in a home that has a fenced in backyard for him to run around and explore. He would not do well in an apartment. Axel can be shy of new people at first, but once he warms up to you, he enjoys the attention. He has an independent personality but enjoys being petted and loves going on walks and performs well on a leash. Because he can be shy around new people, he would likely do best in a home with no children. He is friendly with other dogs and a happy natured guy. He is not housebroken at this time. Axel is heartworm positive but don\u2019t worry, the shelter pays for his treatment. He is also up to date on his vaccinations, microchipped and neutered. \n\nADOPTION HOURS: \n\nWe are currently adopting out animals by appointment only Tuesday through Sunday 1:00 P.M. through 4:00 P.M. with an approved application. To fill out an application, please go to: https://collierville.com/departments/animal-services/animal-shelter-pet-adoption and email it to: casinfo @colliervilletn.gov\nOnce your application has been approved, we will call you to set up an appointment.\n\n\n\n\n",

After months and months of cultures, skin scrapes, testing, etc... we FINALLY got her skin issue under control and her fur has grown back beautifully! \n*She is still currently on medications/sees a dermatologist for this issue and will need to remain on medications until possibly January or further. \n**Rockstar Rescue will continue to pay for and monitor her progress with these medications even after adoption.\n***Lizzy is currently NOT spayed, due to her ongoing skin issue, but once an adoption is confirmed she will be scheduled for surgery at Rockstar's expense immediately.\n\nLizzy IS ACTIVE! She needs activities. Hiking, running, etc... She requires a yard and MUST have a red ball at all times, LOL!\nShe was previously adopted to a family with a 3yr old and did magnificent! (She was returned due to her skin issue before we had it fully under control)\n\nLizzy is NOT for a first-time dog/pet owner. She needs an experienced handler/leader and lots of patience, understanding and love. She can be non-engaging at times when her focus is her ball. She can be a handful when she sees other dogs on walks, but quickly redirects and walks great!\n\nWe'd love for you to meet our girl but first tell us a bit about your living circumstances; house/apt, children/others in the home, work schedule, experience, etc...\n\nThanks",

He has a lot of energy during play time and is very calm when playtime is over. Pollock does very well when being walked on a leash, but will get excited and pull when he see's the ducks at the park (speaking from personal experience). He does very well sleeping in his kennel at night and has learned to use the doggy door to come in and out. Pollock also did very well with the other dog in the Foster house and they even get walked together at very close range. In a recent meet and greet, Pollock did not take well to a potential adopters dog. He became nervous on the drive to the meet and greet and that could have had something to do with it, but because of this, The foster believes that Pollock may not like car rides just yet and may be dog selective\n\nPollock needs an adopter who understands fearful dogs and can work with him. He needs to learn how to trust people and find out there is someone out there that will show him the love and patience he needs.\n\nIf you are interested in Pollack, please visit our website www.underdogaz.com for our application.",

I was adopted out a couple times, and came back within a week or so.  I tend to get super excited in certain situations, and my new owners just could not handle the energy.  I really need a patient home that can give me time to get used to my new environment, and take things slow with me.  I am a cuddler, and I love to walk, but need to be in more of a rural setting where I don't respond to all the noise of a busy bustling area.  I really could be your best friend.  I would need a home without kids and cats. They both make me nervous. \n\nMeet-Your-Match Canine-ality color is: Orange Busy Bee!!\nFor safety's sake, we are looking for homes with physical fenced in areas.\nPlease fill out our online adoption survey at www.mackenzies.info",

He can be a bit nervous at first when he meets new people here at the shelter, but it doesn't take long before he's wiggling his butt and asking for all the pets he can get.\n\nHe hopes to find a family that will give him lots of exercise, and help him practice commands so he can be proud and show off how smart he is.

I am a mix, but seem to exhibit a lot of GSD traits.  I am highly intelligent.  I know so many commands and have completed training courses by my previous owners.  I lived with a teenage girl and loved her very much.  I love to play, and like tennis balls.  I need a family with lots of structure and that like walks and exercise and lots of play in the back yard.  I like to just hang out with the adoption coordinator in the office to.  \n\nMeet-Your-Match Canine-ality color is: Orange Busy Bee!!\nFor safety's sake, we are looking for homes with physical fenced in areas.\nPlease fill out our online adoption survey at www.mackenzies.info",

            "description": "Wrangler is here to lasso your heart! He is about 1 to 2 years old but sometimes acts like an 8 week old puppy! We think he is a Lab and Pointer mix. Wrangler has a lot of energy and is looking for a very active family that can wear this boy out mentally and physically every day. Due to his size and puppy-like energy, he isn't the best match for apartment living and would do better in a home with a yard for him to gallop around in. He is also still figuring out manners and what not to put in his mouth - everything is a chew toy to this goofy guy! Once he masters his leash skills, he'd be an excellent running buddy and he's up for whatever high flying adventure you throw at him. He loves snuggles and giving kisses when he's not playing. He gets along well with the dog he is fostered with, although he does like being top dog, and so far seems to be leaving the cat alone in his foster home. The only time this happy boy's tail stops wagging is when he's sleeping. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting Wrangler, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue.

And maybe chew toys and treats-but almost every dog loves those, so they don't really count, right? My foster mom says I need a yard for exercise and an active person. I am excellent on the leash, and have only ever pulled at all when we saw a cat. I don't like cats by the way... I am working on learning commands, and sometimes don't listen when I know my foster mom doesn't have treats. I get along well with other dogs we meet, but probably won't be the greatest pet for a young child due to my energy. I love Kongs, Buffalo horns and other indestructible toys. I still loves to chew and eat things like all young dogs do.. I am house trained and crate trained, but I don't like being in the crate when when my foster mom is home. I am very affectionate and love everyone, sometimes too much according to my foster mom! I am about 45 lbs, still need to gain. I am very strong and muscular , sometimes get excited, and don't realize how big I am! But I am still a cuddle bug and would love to sit in my person's lap if I could.. I would love to find my furever home where I can learn more and go on lots of adventures with my person!",

He got adopted, along with another of our PMR pups and at first did well. Not sure what happened but he got himself into some trouble with the neighbor and had to be returned. Max is a smart little guy and needs to burn off his energy and use his brain for good. It seems that introductions and interactions on leash are bothersome to him so that needs work and management. All people should learn to approach dogs appropriately and not all dogs want someone coming up while theya re stuck on a leash with their person, hovering over and sticking hands and fingers in the face. Max is a lovebug at his foster home with his human and has met others humans this week and is doing well. Introductions to dogs off leash have gone well. Seems like the leash really plays a role in his issues. Max is also working on his potty training - we think because of his crate confinement so early on, he just can't figure out that he should wait to go outside - when you gotta go, you gotta go - but he's improving and LOVES to get praise when he goes outside - he seems to think it's pretty neat! lol - Max is a smart boy needing an adopter ready to commit to him AND training. He loves toys and food and treats - he's been learning to use enrichment toys and thinks the KONG wobbler is pretty neat for dispensing his food. This handsome boy deserves the best - is that you?",

            "description": "This sweet boy is Cowboy.  He is a 2-3 year old Australian Cattle Dog mix who weighs 40 lbs.  Cowboy was found running around a rural neighborhood after being dumped so we do not know his backstory but we know he is loving, sweet, and good with other dogs. \n\nCowboy loves to play!  He is an energetic dog (as many cattle dogs are).  He can be a little reserved meeting new people and dogs but once he warms up he is very loving.  Cowboy is good with other dogs.  He is at a daycare facility right now where he gets to play in group.  He seems to prefer female dogs.  \n\nCowboy would like a home where he is given lots of love and treated like a member of the family.  \n\nCowboy is not in a home but in a daycare facility so we are not sure if he is house trained.  He does keep his kennel clean.  He walks well on a leash.\n\nCowboy is neutered, microchipped, and current on his vaccines.  His adoption fee is $175.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Cowboy and make him a part of your family, please contact ForeverYoursOKC@gmail.com.",

You can make an appointment to meet available dogs at our ADOPTION CENTER by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet and available cats at MEOW PALACE by going to https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet1. \n\nFor animals in FOSTER homes, please submit an online application and an adoption team will reply with next steps. We thank you for your patience as we work to keep saving lives during this difficult time.\n\nPLEASE VISIT THIS WEBSITE TO FIND THE ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE: http://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-forms/\n\nHi, I'm Bo! I am the smartest dog at the Adoption Center! Yes, you read that right! I am an extremely bright dog and I have found myself in need of a home. Let me tell you about myself:\n\nI am a handsome 4 year old retriever mix. I know a lot of tricks that I would love to show off to you. I am excellent at walking on leash and I love to go explore new places with my people. I am great at meeting new humans while out and about.\n\nI love learning new things and then impressing people with my cool skills. When I'm tired out after walking or playing with my squeaky toys, I love to snuggle with my people. \n\nThe coolest thing about me is my recall. I have been practicing my recall from very impressive distances. I can sit and stay and then come back to you on command, no matter how far away you are. I have mastered the entire distance of my yard here, but I would like to try even farther if I have the chance. \n\nI am looking for a home with adults who want to continue my training. I never want to stop learning new things! You don't need any other pets if you have me-- I am endless fun and adventure, just waiting for you to find me! If you are looking for the smartest dog around, please make a special VIP appointment during the week to come meet me! I can't wait to show you everything I've learned!\n\nI am a part of the Go Fetch Program! My adoption fee is waived and I come with free bonus items when adopted!\n\nAdoption Coordinator: Adoption Center Staff\nLocation: Adoption Center\n\nINCLUDES spay/neuter and microchip. \n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program/",

She is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4503241.\n\nJackie was an owner surrender. She lived in the owner's yard with two other dogs and barked a lot. A neighbor reported the owners and they could not take Jackie into the home because of space issues. Jackie came into the shelter with her ribs, hip bones and spine showing. She is very fearful in the kennel, tries to escape from the play yard and is very wary of people. She is highly treat motivated. Jackie's behavior has improved in the shelter and she is no longer at risk of being euthanized. Despite her past she is showing amazing progress and just wants to be loved. Please remember Jackie was a backyard dog, so she still needs an experienced owner who will be patient with her and continue working on her training. If you're interested in meeting Jackie call the shelter today!\n\nTo visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show. We have been told that you can go straight to the shelter and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog. From what we understand, the shelter will squeeze you in. (Please know this is not a guarantee). We hope your adoption process is smooth and full of happiness.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

            "description": "Please note donations using the SPONSOR ME tab will not go to Fluffy Dog Rescue.\n\nTo Locate Our Application go to http://rescue.fluffydog.net/how-to-adopt.html\n\nOur listings are updated throughout the day. If there is an applicant, it will say PENDING ADOPTION next to the dog's name. If not, please submit an Application that can be found on our site, www.fluffydog.net. \n\nMY AGE: approx. 20 week s (1/26)  WEIGHT: approx. 20 lbs. (1/19) WHERE I AM FROM: AL (arrival 11/28) \n\nMY STORY: Miss Jingle has been with us for about a month now and I really need to update her bio. She's just so perfect, I'm afraid that someone will see her new bio and scoop her up and I'm just not ready to send her along yet. However, furever family, I know you're out there just waiting for your perfect dog and here she is.\n\nShe has grown into the most beautiful girl.Her mangey coat has filled in nicely and she's shiny and gorgeous. She is getting better at sit and while it's hard, patience for treats and not bowling everybody over, is coming along. She gets along well with my all female pack but loves to chase and chew on the kitties. Her feet, which were once oddly flat, have popped up like they should. Not sure why they were flat but they are perfect now and she loves to run on them and tear around in the snow. She is very \"hands on\" and uses her paws like raccoon feet, if that makes sense.\n\nDuring the day, she's a typical wild puppy but at night, at night she loves to snuggle and cuddle, as close as she can possibly get. \n\nShe's started shedding her baby teeth but is not chewing on anything inappropriate. We have lots of bones and soft toys for her to work on those teeth. \n\nShe's mostly housetrained. If I had to pick a number I'd say 85%, but maybe some of that is on us.\n\nShe's very smart and very gentle. If you're looking for a friend, Jingle is your girl. \n\n This dog does shed and is not hypoallergenic.\n\nHOUSEBROKEN?   GOOD WITH DOGS?  Yes  GOOD WITH CATS?unknown\n\nADOPTION FEE: $550\n\nTo adopt the FIRST STEP is to complete an APPLICATION. The application can be found on our site www.fluffydog.net, or by clicking on the purple Fluffy Dog Rescue wording found in the left corner of this page under the dogs name.\n\nOur dogs are located in foster homes throughout the state. We do not have a facility. Adopters must be 24 years old.We can not adopt to families with children under the age of six. We also adopt in WI, IL, and parts of MN. Most of our dogs are strays, so the breed is our best guess.\nWI License #270548.\n \nCheck out Fluffy Dog Wellness on our Home Page. Great Solutions to Enhance Your Pet's Health. www.fluffydog.net",

They are both small and no trouble at all) Abby would be a great addition to any family. She is good with older kids and other dogs. We aren't sure about cats. She is currently in boarding as that's the only way we could save her. So we would love someone to foster her OR foster to adopt her. The sooner the better. Boarding was supposed to temporary.

Bear weighs 80 pounds and is house trained. He is a mature and smart boy, and he\u2019s ready for a couch to nap on, a bed to sleep on, and an owner to spoil him! He deserves to live the rest of his life inside a home with a loving family.  Bear is super well housebroken!  He is finishing his treatment for heartworms. \n\nFill out the application below if you are interested in adopting sweet Bear. \n\nThe standard adoption fee for a puppy or a dog is $200 which includes  rabies vaccination, and spay or neuter.   ARF will adopt to residents who are out of state but will not furnish transportation.  Here are a few of our adoption requirements:  All adopters will be asked to fill out an  application. Adopters must be at least 21 years old. Renters must show proof that they are allowed to have pets, such as a rental agreement. If there is a pet deposit, please show us the receipt that this has been paid. Be prepared to take your pet home with you - bring a leash for all dogs, regardless of age or size (or a pet taxi for small puppies and dogs) and a pet taxi for all kittens and cats. \n\nFill out this form if you are interested in adopting a pet from Animal Rescue Foundation. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10mHOUH71ulyBm-xh0HZcOGsusvXJxrS3pXQHCz3f-tQ/viewform?edit_requested=true",

I'm around 6 years old, about 50 pounds, and I'm all set to move right into your heart & home today - already neutered, microchipped & up to date on vaccinations. \n\nI\u2019m a Siberian Husky through and through, with all the associated behaviors and personality! You know - loyal, intelligent, mischievous, the Houdini of the dog world, playful, high energy, athletic, free-spirited, good-natured. Experienced, diehard Husky lovers will know what I mean - and that\u2019s actually the exact forever human I\u2019m in search of. My ideal home will be adult-only (I play hard & love hard), probably where I\u2019m the only dog, with a human who knows that I\u2019ll keep them on their toes but wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. \n\nAs I mentioned the bit about Houdini, my home will also obviously have a super securely fenced yard, so I can\u2019t find a way out when I\u2019m in the mood for an extra adventurous day.\n\nSo, if you're that human I've described - who knows firsthand all about the fantastic quirks of my breed and the many benefits that come along with them when provided the physical & mental enrichment we thrive on - and you think I could be your new BFF, please email a completed adoption profile (found here - http://www.providenceac.org/adopt-a-pet/how-to-adopt/) to my good friend, Dayna (dvilla@providenceac.org), and she'll be in touch to set up an appointment with you to meet me.\nI'm looking forward to it for sure!  XO Jacob\n\nP.S. I almost forgot!  Someone is so excited for me to find my fur-ever home, that they have sponsored my adoption fee! That means I can join your family today for FREE! Woohoo!!\"\n\n_______\nProvidence Animal Center relies on adoption fees and donations to save pets! Adoption fees vary per pet. \n\nCan\u2019t adopt? Consider fostering or donating!

Very sad for them both. Romeo is 10 years old, current on shots, neutered, house broken, and owner said he does well with most all animals with proper introduction. He is super sweet and knows some commands like sit, shake, stay, down, speak, and will heel. He would love a home where someone is home most of the time if possible he does get anxious when left alone a d owner said he will pace the floor and howl. He just loves his human friends and misses them and hope they will hear his howl. All in all Romeo is a sweetheart so deserves to spend his \u201cgolden years\u201d being pampered and loved in a cozy and loving FOREVER home. Maybe you have the most am amazing FOREVER home for handsome Romeo?! Visit with him today and adopt him into your heart and home!\nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting another potential new furry member please bring him or her to the shelter and meet on neutral ground before adopting. No need to shuffle the animals around any more than necessary. Please know that 1 mosquito bite can create heart worms and they can be fatal if not treated. It is VERY important to keep your pets healthy and protected by keeping them on a once a month heart worm and flea/tick prevention. These animals are counting on you as their owner to provide them with lots a love and the proper health care so PLEASE make sure you are aware and prepared before adopting. Owning a pet is an extra expense and responsibility but is so worth every minute and penny you invest in them. They will add lots of joy and unconditional love if given a fair chance.\nThe shelter is open Mon.-Fri. 10-1, 2-5 and Sat. 10-4. Adopt a homeless pet and save a life. If you can not adopt right now come out and volunteer and make a difference in the lives of these animals while they await their FOREVER home.",

Needs slow introductions to larger dogs. Would do best with older children 12+. He is such a sweet boy who loves to give you kisses & did we mention how much of a gentleman he is on a leash? Casanova would love his own furever home, after having a rough life having ended up in the shelter with Heartworms to be shortly on death row. Casanova was rescued and now is all healthy, up to date on his shots, and neutered. Casanova is such a sweet boy and would love a family to call his own!

The rescue could not leave her behind at the shelter where she could be euthanized. Sadly she still sits in rescue looking for her furever home. She bonds quickly to one person and needs to be an only child and only pet. Ursula becomes very protective of her person and we feel a single person household would best fit her at this time. She has the cutest ears, and the most beautiful eyes. Ursula truly needs her hero to give her a fresh start to life and I promise she will love you to pieces for the rest of her life. She is spayed and up to date on Vaccines and preventatives. \n\n My adoption fee is $250 plus $20 for a current rabies tag\n\nhttps://www.kol-fl.org/adopt/adoption-application/",

            "description": "Cola was part of a cruelty case where he was left in a shed with his dog family for 4 months with no food, water or love. He's a fun and energetic cuddly lovebug estimated to be born in 2012. KOL rescued him and he has been a very grateful pup and doing well with his foster family. He now weighs 80 pounds and is amazing with children and people and is patiently waiting for his furever family to find him. He has some minor skin ailments due to his neglect and will need to eat hydrolyzed protein food and stay on a low dose of prednisone most likely for the rest of his life. He prefers a home with female dogs. \nFrom Colas foster mom: \"Oh my Cola dude ... where do I start ? He is a beast at 85 pounds but its 85lbs of pure love. He is crate trained & wont make a peep. He is house broken. He absolutely loves children and other dogs. NO CATS. He knows sit , stay , shake with his left paw and high five with his right. He is a pretty chill dude who can go for some tug o war. He loves his back and belly scratches & he is very loyal. He goes where I go but leaves space. He likes to be talked to and will nuzzle his face in your lap. He is a big , happy , extremely lovable mush. He is very treat motivated. Cola will make a wonderful, loving family dog. His adoption fee is $150 and to apply to adopt fill out the application here-\n\nhttps://www.kol-fl.org/adopt/adoption-application/\n\nAll adoptable dogs have been medically cleared by our attending veterinarian at Clear Lake Animal Hospital, up to date on vaccines, spayed or neutered and microchipped.

Someone to go for a walk with, or that will patiently listen to how your day went, and show you compassion and love and that he truly cares?? Hunter is one of those boys that will give you all of his attention, be at the door waiting for you and never want to leave your side. He's a very special dog thats waited a very long time for a companion to come along for him to love with his whole being. Hunter is one of the SWEETEST of the KOL crew (IMO) and his bowleggedness is extra adorable He loves all people and kids, and wants to be a part of whatever is going on, whether it be sitting around watching TV, cooking, going for a car ride, or playing outside, as long as someone is with him, he's in heaven. Hes estimated to be born in 2010.\nHe is a gentleman on the leash and very obedient but does have a high prey drive for small animals so needs a strong handler when out of leash walks. He was surrendered to the local animal shelter with his 10 y/o gf. She was killed after 2 days and Hunter became urgent when he was discovered in his kennel...crying for her. Kibblez of Love knew they had to save this broken hearted boy and now he deserves his forever family. He would prefer a home as the only pet. \nHis adoption fee is $150 \n\nPlease fill out an adoption application at https://www.kol-fl.org/adopt/adoption-application/ \n\nAll adoptable dogs have been medically cleared by our attending veterinarian at Clear Lake Animal Hospital, up to date on vaccines, spayed or neutered and microchipped.

Our best guess on her past life was that she was most likely used for breeding and she was then discarded when she was no longer useful. She lives with a foster family with young kids and another dog. With a proper intro she could be okay with dogs but considering her age may do well as an only pet solely because of her hearing. Nilla is slightly hearing impaired but what dog isnt! If you are looking for a low maintenance couch buddy Nilla is your girl. \nHer adoption fee is $125\n\nPlease fill out an adoption application at https://www.kol-fl.org/adopt/adoption-application/\n\nAll adoptable dogs have been medically cleared by our attending veterinarian at Clear Lake Animal Hospital, up to date on vaccines, spayed or neutered and microchipped. All dogs currently on heartworm and flea/tick prevention and parasite free.",

She leaves that life behind now and is on the search for a real family that will love and cherish her as much as she will them. Gracie is great with children and does best with large male dogs but can live with female large dogs with slow introductions. She should not be in a home with cats or small dogs. She knows basic commands and some extra ones too! Gracie is around 6 years old. She loves walks and car rides. She's a really good girl and would make a perfect family dog to your family. We would prefer her to be the only pet in the home. She is on a hydrolyzed protein diet and will need to maintain that for her allergies. Its a cost of $100 a month for the food. \n\nTo Adopt apply here- https://www.kol-fl.org/adopt/adoption-application/\n\nAdoption fee $250.00",

            "description": "Ivan IS AVAILALBE (updated 02-02-2021).To meet any of our dogs you must first complete our online adoption application on our website. For more information and the adoption application for Ivan, please visit our website belowhttp://www.coastalgsr.org/dog_profile.php?ID=22254&name=IvanIvan has made so much progress since his rescue. At the shelter, he wouldnt come out of his run. He was freaked out when they tried to leash him up, frantically bolting to escape, gator rolling to avoid being handled, and refusing to be coaxed out of his run with food and even a puppy friend. He wasnt a candidate for public adoption, so a rescue became his only option.Ivan joined us in January of 2020. Step one was to get him comfortable with us and step two was to get him on a slip lead. We made slow but steady progress, but it was clear that everything was new and overwhelming to him. We worked on building confidence, trust, and obedience.After months, he was comfortable enough to go for a walk around the neighborhood. After another few months, we started getting him comfortable with getting in a car, which terrified him at first. He can now go on walks with volunteers and enjoys checking out the local message boards.Ivan has had a long road, but we think hes ready to join a family: a family who understands that he's still fearful of the unknown and hes going to need help and time to get used to their routine. A family who can show him structure, is patient, and knows that the time they put into working with Ivan will pay off ten fold. A family who can show Ivan there are people who consider dogs part of the family and dont just leave them outside until they decide to dump them at shelters. A family who will love him and get a loyal companion in return. The minimum adoption donation for adults is $375 and the adoption donation for puppies is $500. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is tax deductible. The adoption donation provides that all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis ( i.e., puppies who will need to be altered by 6 mos old). Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.",

A few kind families would feed & water them. They eluded Animal Control for years. Trooper is a real sweet heart! He can't tell us about his life but his scars can. He's had a round life on the street. He had an encounter with a porcupine. He still has several quills broke off deep in facial tissue. This causes a small area under his right eye to swell. He's seen 3 Vets & they all conclude the quills will have to come out on their own due to how deep they are. This doesn't affect how loving & sweet Trooper is. We named him Trooper because of all he's endured & the sweet disposition he still has.$75 adoption fee includes spay/neuter, vaccs and chip.\nBig Spring TX\n Exit 174 off I20 West",

WE are a high intake No Kill Shelter ran by a staff of 4 and do not always have time to answer every question asked by so many. If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced. It is never our intention to ignore a request about an adoptable animal in our facility.\n\nSandy Brown, Director, PAW Animal Shelter\n\n319-372-2274",

He loves to be active with his people, whether playing fetch, going for walks or rides in the car. He seems to smile when he knows you are going to do something fun! Maxwell may seem to play hard-to-get when first meeting people, but he warms up once he knows you are a true friend who is up for going for a jog or cuddling on the couch. If you happen to be up for training and brain games, then Maxwell is your match. He already knows many commands, is eager to continue learning and loves treats! Given his height, he may try to stick his snoot in your treat pouch to sneak some snacks - he is such a funny boy! This sweet boy is looking for an adult-only home that will go at his pace when meeting new people, given his sense of loyalty. He wants to make sure he and his people are safe. While not playful, Maxwell does appreciate other dogs and could go home with one of similar size. Smaller dogs and kitties are enticing to him, so likely not the ideal housemates. Maxwell is house-trained and can be left free to roam in the house. Maxwell is ready for a home to call his own. Could it be yours? Come meet this funny boy!",

            "description": "GOOBER is an 8 year old Terrier mix taken in on 11/13/20 when his owner was incarcerated. He was living inside a house without electricity or water. As you can see from his photos, Goober looks hairless. He has a severe yeast infection all over his skin and is now being treated to remedy it. The infection not only looks bad, but makes his skin feel very itchy, compelling Goober to want to spend a lot of time rolling on his back in the grass. His skin irritation is no laughing matter, but the high number of cycling reps Goober executes with his back legs is amusing. Following a lengthy roll in the grass, we were able to get some photos of this fantastic doggo. Goober has a great demeanor. Simply put, he's a real friendly, easy going dog. Goober's a great walker, super sweet and gets along with everyone: people, cats and dogs. He is housebroken. Goober's adoption fee is $75. He's altered, current on shots, wormed and treated with monthly flea and tick preventive. Goober was heart worm positive at intake and has been treated. He will need to complete filtration in February.",

Following that, if you feel like it could be a good adoption fit, shelter staff will help coordinate a socially-distanced meeting in person so that you can meet your potential family member up-close and personal.

            "description": "Wyatt is estimated to be about 3-4 years old and was found dragging a chain wrapped around tire.  He was not reclaimed from the shelter.  He is a sweet and friendly boy, who gets along well with other dogs, and loves all humans. He is a bit of a \"houdini\" dog, so will need a home with a 5' -6' fenced yard or a walk only home.  We do not adopt to homes with tie outs or trolleys. He loves human attention and  the companionship of other dogs.  He would do best in a home with another dog. He is fine with children,  He is a little too interested in cats to be trusted alone with them.    If you do not have 6' secure fencing, you must be an adult only home and committed to walking the dog. We recommend obedience training for all newly adopted pyrs, to help you create a special bond with you and your new friend, and so you have a well behaved canine. Great Pyrenees are willing to learn, but are not as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds. They are bred to be independent thinkers. Applicants must be over 25, own their own home and all children in household must be over 5 years old. Your resident pets must be up to date on vaccines, sterilized, you must have a good history of vet care for them, and you must have used heartworm preventative year round for your dogs. \n\n\nWyatt will be placed as an inside pet with outside privileges. You MUST have a 6' securely fenced yard accessible from your home. Invisible fencing does not work with this breed and they will take the shock for the freedom.  Great Pyrenees are bred to roam and will create their own territory if not secured, which can led to them being lost, hit by vehicles or shot by people who see them as a threat. The breed is not a good off leash dog, and cannot be trusted to not run away.  A Great Pyrenees off leash is a \" DisAPyr.\" \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please complete the appropriate application on our website, www.igpr.org under the Adopt tab. \n\nAll of our dogs marked as needing foster homes are also available for adoption.  If a dog is listed on this site, it is available.  No need to contact us to see if it is,  We do require you  complete the adoption application prior to meeting a dog.\n\nWe also offer a foster to adopt program. You foster the dog, and have first right of refusal on them if an approved application is submitted for them. \n\nIn fostering a dog, the dog comes to you fully vetted. and groomed. You provide good quality food, grooming, and we provide the heartworm preventative and medical care, if needed* .(*Based on approval from IGPR.)\n\nAdoption fee is $300",

Rosie was dumped in neighborhood and after seeing her wandering for weeks with the local children and neighbor dogs, a good samaritan took her in and asked for help in finding Rosie a safe and loving forever home of her own.  Rosie is good with other dogs and kids, obviously, and is a sweet dog and true to Black Mouth Cur nature, is loyal and protective.  She is also house and crate trained.  We do require good vetting history, a fenced yard, and a live or virtual home visit for approval.  Fee:  $200.

Tucker's dad was heartbroken to say goodbye to his best friend, but he knew he had to do what was best for him.  \n\nTucker is approximately 3 and a half years old and is a bit of a chunky fella.   The volunteers are working to get some weight off of him.   Tucker is also having some issues with his left ear.  The medical team is working with the vet on getting that cleared up.   Tucker is such a good boy, allowing the volunteers to put medicine in his ears twice a day.\n\nTucker walks well on a leash and is a kind of chill fella.  He enjoys car rides and snuggling under the blanket.  Tucker has been around kids before but he hasn't ever lived with little humans.   Due to this, we think he would be fine with older kiddos!   Tucker has also been around other pups before and done well, but he hasn't lived with any.  \n\nIf you are interested in meeting Tucker or fostering him while his ears heal, please go to our website, www.crcpa.org, and complete an application!",

With excellent house manners, she does not need a crate.  Her favorite place is wherever her people are.  Mindy is also good with other dogs but seems to prefer the company of her people,  Every night she curls up in her foster\u2019s bed as if she has been doing it for years.  Her gentle, mellow personality makes her a great companion.  Mindy will need a fenced yard.  (No underground fences). \n\nSubmit an application at wetnosesanimalrescue.org.",

He loves car rides, older children, and does tricks for treats. He\u2019s a sweet, gentle boy who loves attention but he\u2019s also a bit of free spirit who would happily dig an escape route to check out the world so he will need a home with a secure fence and a watchful eye. \nThough he gets along well with other dogs the majority of the time, he would be happiest as an only dog because he can be a bit lap protective.\nShadow is a happy, smart, cuddly guy who would love nothing more than to spend his whole day at his owner's side-- riding in cars, being carried around, eating treats, watching tv from the couch, and sleeping in a warm bed at night. \n\n\nThis dog is currently being fostered in Rochester, NY and cannot travel prior to adoption. Meet and greets available in the surrounding area only. Visitors welcome.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Unless otherwise written, all of our puppy mill survivors will require a secure fenced yard, another small dog in the home, and an experienced owner. Dogs rescued from puppy mills will have started to learn but cannot be expected to be fully potty trained at time of adoption.\n\n\nPLEASE READ ALL OF THE INFORMATION BELOW:\n\n\nWe currently adopt in the states of NY, NJ, Eastern PA, DE, and some areas in MD. We cannot accept applications from other states at this time.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out our adoption application which you can find on our website at www.dutchcountryanimalrescue.org/adopt.html \n\nWe will reply within one week if your application meets the criteria for this dog. \n\nOur adoption fees are on our application.\n\nAll of our rescues are spayed/neutered, up to date on rabies and DHPP, heartworm tested, treated for worms and fleas and most are microchipped.\n\nWe are not a shelter, we are 100% volunteer public charity. All of our dogs are in foster homes until they are adopted. Since we are not a shelter, we do not receive government funding. We are a public charity that relies solely on funds through our adoption fee, fundraisers, and private donations. Since we are 100% volunteer based, all funds collected go directly towards the rescue and vet costs of our dogs.\n\nWe take each rescue personally and spend a lot of effort trying to match the right dog to the right family. Thank you for considering one of our rescued dogs.",

Approx 3 years old and 45 lbs and very gentle and loving!\n\nJewel and her baby Jude (also listed for adoption) were rescued by from death-row at the shelter a few months ago.  Their skin was covered in mange and sores, and they were missing lots of hair.  They were petrified of people, and afraid to even eat.  \n\nAfter their medical conditions were healed, they went to a loving foster home with daily TLC.  They are still shy with strangers, but have come a long way!  You can see the spark in their eyes and pep in their step now! What a transformation! Hard to believe their before photos!   \n\nA home is needed with dog experienced adults, no human kids (they are too active and make them nervous), a doggie friend, and a good secure yard to run and play in.\n\nJewel is about 3 years old and Jude is a little less than a year!  \n\nIt would be great if they could stay together!  But if not, they definitely need to be in a home with another dog. \n\nLooking for some new best friends?  Email info@redcollar.org ?\n\nAdoption applications can be submitted on our website, redcollar.org.\n\nAge - 3 years\nWeight -  45 lbs \nDogs - yes - Jewel would love a friend!\nCats - unknown\nKids - no, they are too active and make Jewel nervous\nVaccinated - yes\nNeutered - yes\nMicrochipped - yes\n\nwww.redcollar.org\nwww.facebook.com/REDCollarRescue\n\n\n",

He has been very confused and upset since losing his person, but still has spurts of playful moments with us. It will take time for him to open up fully and trust another human, so he will need someone who is patient and willing to do what it takes to allow him to settle in and feel at ease. Once adjusted, we believe that he will be a wonderful companion and cuddle bug. Because he is very easily startled, we do not recommend him for a home with larger dogs, cats, or small children.",

It\u2019s been no doubt an incredibly upsetting experience for Jack Frost, as he had spent so long with his family, but when they welcomed another dog into the mix, Jack Frost and him did not get along, and so, he was surrendered to Famous Fido Rescue. He still has a lot of energy, and loves to play and jump around, but he does need a little guidance and would benefit greatly from some training. We\u2019d love to find him a home where he could be spoiled in by calm family as an only dog. He does react out of fear at times, so we would not recommend him for a home with young children. But, he has a very sweet nature that will work with a patient guardian that wants to see him through for life. \n",

In that time Uki was left in an apartment, with someone dropping by each day to feed her. Going without her person for so long has definitely lead to her feeling bouts of sadness and anxiety, and we know she will likely grieve for some time. She will need someone who is patient, calm and caring to help her feel at home again. She tends to seize up around larger dogs, but smaller, less active cats or dogs might be okay for her to share a home with. She loves people, and desperately craves attention and love.  Uki would do best in a home with no young children as she likes to take it easy and isn't a fan of fast / loud movements / actions.",

They are both beautiful, sweet, and playful dogs. They are somewhat of a work in progress though, and will need dedicated attention for training, so we do not recommend them for a home with other animals or small children. We do think they have a lot of potential and would make wonderful lifetime companions for an experienced and committed guardian. The pair are like two peas in a pod, and will sleep and play together happily. We would love for them to find their forever home with someone who will keep them together.",

Being a chocolate purebred Labrador doesn't happen very often in those places. Found out that Fisher was purchased in a puppy store in Miami then dumped on the street of Naples Florida, just like this. No one came for him and we started to wonder why? Only Fisher can tell us what happen to him and how he end it up homeless. He is in good health and really needs a home. We are looking for a very active family who loves running, walking and do things. He would be best if he was an only dog in the house. He will need an experience handler. He is a sweetheart but likes to push the limit as well. He is now in training for the past 3 months in near Ocala and is doing great. A fenced yard is a must  and no condos or apartment. Of course he loves the water and swimming. Fisher is a really good dog who just need someone knowledgeable about the breed. if you are interested in meeting him please email us at pets@findahomegiveahome.com. Sorry we do not adopt to family with children. \nHe is up to date on all of his vaccines, neutered and microchip. His adoption fee is $650.00",

Even though she may be shy at first, she warms up quickly, and you will know that she trust you once she asks for a long belly rub.She knows her manners, she is crate and potty trained and loves to be pampered. \nSophie is dog selective so she needs to be the only pet in a household and she would do best in a structure and energy balanced home with kids older than 12 yrs. Sophie loves car rides and will be a fantastic hiking and a road trip companion. She enjoys attention and has a lot of love to give. \nSophie will be an amazing addition to active families.",

A kind neighbor put out food, but Lanie and her littermates had no social interaction with people until they were finally trapped. Lanie was nearly a year old before she was trapped. After a few months in a boarding kennel situation with her sister Meg, Lanie and her brother Winston were moved into a private home, where they were exposed to all the usual sounds of a household with people, dogs and cats. At this point, neither Winston or Lanie would allow anyone to touch them.\n\nAs of January 2021, Lanie is still shy, but much less so than before. She will allow the people she knows and trusts to pet her, but she can still be reserved with people she does not know. She and her brother Winston started attending doggy day care two days a week in January for more socialization with new people and new dogs. She is already making great progress in becoming less shy in just a couple of weeks.\n\n Lanie loves to go on her daily walks. She is more adventurous on walks than her brother Winston is. She is becoming much more interested when she sees approaching people and other dogs walking by. She loves to go on new routes and explore more places. She does not mind walking in light rain or chilly temperatures.\n\n Lanie can get a bit excited about the cats, but not so much as her brother Winston. \n\nLanie and Winston would love to be adopted together. They are best friends.",

Fast-forward to today: Biggie is now between 3-4 years old. He is likely a boxer/Great Dane mix, and he weighs just under 100lbs. He is a complex boy who needs a very specific home, but we are confident we can find him the most perfect forever! In general, Biggie is apprehensive of all new people, but in particular of men and deep voices. He needs a home environment with minimal visitors. And when there are visitors, he needs his own space and a family who will follow a specific protocol for his needs as outlined by the awesome trainers who have been working with him. He also needs a 6ft(+) fenced-in yard. Biggie is not a dog that needs (or necessarily wants) to take walks; the commotion and stimulation of the encounters experienced on walks are stressful for him. He would also do best in a home with no young children and no cats/small animals. Biggie has lived successfully with other dogs, but the other dog(s) in the home should be quieter, to be a calming force for Biggie. Biggie has also started on some anxiety meds and they have helped him tremendously! He is much happier and more carefree. He truly is such a sweet, sweet boy who just needs to find his people/person. Once he is comfortable with you, he will love you like none other! Biggie knows basic commands, is potty-trained and crate-trained, and does do best crated when home alone due to experiencing some slight separation anxiety when his humans are away. His favorite activities include just hanging out with his people and especially snuggling. We would desperately love to get Biggie out of boarding and into a foster/adoptive home. Please share his handsome face far and wide! \n\n \n\nIf you are willing to foster Biggie, PLEASE reach out to us (via either private message or by submitting an application at https://newleashdogrescue.com)!\n\n \n\n**Biggies $200 adoption fee includes his neuter, vaccinations, heartworm test, and microchip.",

            "description": "This handsome dude is Titus, and he is looking to bust out of boarding and into a foster/adoptive home of his own before the holidays! He is a 2 year old pittie mix who is still young and impressionable, and needs a person/family who will help him continue to build his confidence and learn how to simply be a dog. Titus has what we would call an immature play style, so he does need another dog in his foster/forever home who matches that play style and can help show Titus the ropes. He tends to view the world as big and scary, so he needs a calm home, a family that will help him maneuver new experiences at his own pace, and who will continue to work on his training with our amazing trainers at Fun Fur Pets. Titus has learned so much from the crew at FFP, and they have also been able to pinpoint the type of home environment that will best help Titus succeed and thrive. He needs a fenced-in yard (his safe space where he can run, roam, and play), and children in the home should be ages 16+. He is such a fun and playful boy who has so much love to give! He especially loves his 4-legged playmates, playing fetch, and with his toys. He is kennel-trained and potty-trained. He does need to go to a home without cats. More than anything, we would love to get Titus into a home (whether foster or adoptive) of his own, so if you can help this boy PLEASE reach out to us! \n\nIf you are interested in fostering/adopting Titus, please either private message us or (if not already completed) fill out a general application at https://newleashdogrescue.com. \n\n**Titus $200 adoption fee includes his neuter, vaccinations, heartworm test, and microchip.",

            "description": "Introducing GUS (known to SAAP as Sosa).\n\nI met this stunning 7 year old boy just yesterday ... and apparently he though i was someone else as he came bounding out to my car like we were long lost friends and planted kisses on my face when i leaned over to accept his hugs. I felt honored to have earned the trust and friendship of this boy so quickly. But then, after taking him around town . . . I realized it wasn't just me! He hasn't met a stranger. If you look at him or say hello, you're his new best friend and you're gonna get a hug, some butt wiggles, a bit of a dance and if your face is close...you're gonna get your face cleaned with a couple quick licks from his giant tongue.\n\nWhen he arrived at my home he was fearful of my open stairs...but he took it slow and cautious for the first time, then he got braver and braver with each trip up. And just like that, he learned it was all ok.\n\nWithin minutes of arriving, i showed him where his \"toy trunk\" was and tossed a few toys out to see how he would react. He loves toys and he loves tug of war. . . but he doesn't destroy them, he just plays.\n\nGUS loves to be close. . .he follows me from room to room and sits at my feet (in the office), curls up next to me on the couch and snuggles up close in bed. He is a great sleeper, and has all kinds of different \"snores\" that I wish I could interpret.\n\nHe is listed as an \"only child\" because at some point in his last home he got into a scuffle with another dog that wanted to have the same toy at the same time. So while he hasn't shown any aggression to any dog he has met on our walks or visits to daycare, something happened at some point to spark this new behavior so that's to be noted.\n\nToday we went to the photo studio to get his glam shots and he was a champ, he took direction well and seemed very confident. He may have been a celebrity earlier in his life, or in a past life as the firing strobes from this puparazzi didn't give him pause.\n\nSo that's what i've learned in my first 24 hours about GUS (aka as Sosa on the SAAP website).\n\nOh, I almost forgot, so far, I haven't heard a bark. His snore has been the loudest thing so far.\n\nP.S. THANK YOU to Allie's Walkabout for donating food for this guy while he is in this foster home.All SAAP animals are vet checked, UTD on vaccines, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, and given flea and heartworm preventative as age appropriate.\n\nOur website is: http://www.adoptastray.com/\n\nTo check if this animal is still available visit our master pet list on our website at:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/adoptable-animals/\n\nHave questions:\nPlease email us at saap@adoptastray.com for more information about this animal or to answer any questions you may have.

            "description": "Please read Winston's entire description before applying.\n\n Winston was part of a litter born to a semi feral husky mix mom under a vacant house. A kind neighbor put out food, but Winston and his littermates had no social interaction with people until they were finally trapped. Winston was about 15 months old when he was trapped. After a few months in a boarding kennel situation, Winston and his sister Lanie were moved into a private home, where they were exposed to all the usual sounds of a household with people, dogs and cats. At that point, neither Winston or Lanie would allow anyone to touch them.\n\nAs of January 2021, Winston is much less shy, but he can still be hesitant around people he does not know. Once he knows and trusts you, he will be happy to have lots of pets and head massages.  Winston is an affectionate boy,  and he loves to kiss your face in return. Sometimes he gets a bit too rambunctious, and his nose can hit your face harder than you expect.  \n\n Winston and his sister Lanie started to attend doggy day care twice a week in January 2021 for more socialization with new people and new dogs. He is doing well, and has become a bit less shy after just a couple of weeks. \n\n  This playful boy likes to chew on bones and play with toys and other dogs. He can deftly pick up toys and other items (shoes, socks, etc.) without breaking his stride. He likes to shake and toss these items until he is asked to give them back. \n\nHe loves to go on walks, and after the initial excitement wears off, he rarely pulls much on his leash. New routes and new places to walk still make him nervous, but he does love to go on his regular walk in his own neighborhood and along the nearby creek.\n\n Winston does not mind walking in light rain or chilly conditions.\n\n Winston has NEVER bit or snapped at any person, even when he was first brought into a home and he was scared to death of everything.\n\nHe has been exposed to cats in the house, but sometimes he has shown a desire to corner them. At this point, I am not sure it would be a good idea to have him in a house with cats, unless there was always human supervision.\n\n Winston is crate trained, and has not shown any tendency to get on the furniture.\n\n Winston and Lanie would love to be adopted together. They are best friends.\n\n",

            "description": "One look into Augustus' big brown eyes and you'll be hypnotized! This boy will definitely steal your heart with his sweetness and silly antics. Since Augustus is deaf, he asks that his adopters be patient with him, as he is still working on learning hand signals. That's ok, he's smart and he's picking it up quickly. Augustus loves people but would benefit from being the only pet in the home. There are some great advantages to adopting a deaf dog. They aren't noise sensitive, so they won't be bothered by things like fireworks, construction sounds, or thunderstorms. They also won't hear you sneaking into the kitchen for a midnight snack. But on a more serious note, learning to train a deaf dog can vastly improve your dog handling skills and is often no more challenging than training a hearing dog! If you are interested in adorable Augustus, please complete a dog adoption survey at la.bestfriends.org/adopt for a team member to reach out to you.",

And if you have treats, I'll pretty much do anything for you! I am house trained and know multiple commands, but I have A LOT of energy. The staff here like to say I have springs for feet! Because of my high energy and drive I would do best in an active home (maybe even with another furry dog friend) where someone will be consistent in what they expect from me. I am looking for a new home that has no children and I would not do well in an apartment. I can be fearful with new people and need a confident leader to show me everything's okay! Agility might be a fun thing to try! Who knows? I am just a young excited guy looking for a new family to start my life with!

The first step in meeting any of our dogs is to fill out an application on our website**\n\nMeet Lilly! Lilly is an approximately 3 year old girl that has been through a lot in her short life. She was transferred here from the South with some serious surgical needs. She needed some extensive leg surgeries to fix some abnormalities in her legs, and she is now all healed up and ready for adoption! Lilly would love to curl up on the couch with you after a nice stroll around the neighborhood. She wants her parents all to herself, so she would be best as the only animal in the house. She would also do best in a home with children age 12+.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting one of our pups please fill out an application on our website https://petsstophererescue.com/. After the reference check is completed we will be contacting you to schedule a meet and greet. Our adoption process is as followed: application, reference check, landlord approval (if needed), meet and greet, home inspection and home trial run (aka sleepover). Please note we are a volunteer based rescue and work timelessly to ensure all our dogs find the best homes possible. Our Petfinder page is updated regularly, if we receive multiple applications for a pup we will review ALL of them and pursue the best fit. Adoption fees range from $250-$400. Our dogs come fully vetted. Any questions please contact Kaylee at kglidden312@gmail.com. We look forward to helping you find your new best friend!\n\n*PSA: We ONLY adopt to residents of Rochester, NY and surrounding towns. Out of state / country applications will be discarded (including Canada) due to different breed restrictions. Thank you for understanding and we apologize for any inconvenience's.*",

At the age of three, Oro Valley Animal Rescue (LOVAR) pulled her from Pinal County Animal Care Center (PCACC) in order to treat her medical conditions. She does have an ongoing medical condition of valley fever and is controlled with medication. Sweetie was adopted by an older couple who were looking for companionship. She is now seven and has been in a perfect home for the past four years as an only dog, which was her preference. Sweetie sat next to her pet dad and was very loyal to her humans.. Sadly, both of her humans passed away within one week of each other. She not only lost her family but her home as well. Sweetie is grieving and needs to heal with a loving compassionate person or family in either a foster or a permanent home but no other pets.She is a love bug and will melt your heart.

Austin may be a 15-year old senior dog, but he sure doesn't act like one. He likes to take walks and when he's ready for a nap he likes to snuggle. Austin has lived with another dog, but he does need time to get to know new dogs. Also, his new home needs to be without small children because he startles easily and gets grumpy when awakened or scared. If you want a walking and snuggling buddy, Austin Powers is your man! Austin weighs 12 lbs., his estimated birth date is 9/17/2005 and his adoption fee is $175. If you want more information about Austin Powers, please submit a survey at https://furkids.org/dog-adoptions/application. At this time, meeting our dogs is by appointment only. After submitting a survey, an adoption counselor will contact you to give you more information about the dog you are interested in adopting and to arrange for you to meet the dog. Must be at least 21 years of age to adopt.",

Once she came to us we were able to provide her with that treatment and she is now in a foster home healing. Ophelia is a 5-6 year old, spayed pit bull mix. She has been fully vetted and just recently had FHO surgery on her hip due to the car accident. She is heartworm/lymes negative, flea treated, wormed, and microchipped. Ophelia is housebroken, crate trained, and knows some commands. She loves people and is a bit of a velcro dog. She does seem to be dog selective. She would do best with no cats or young children. If you are looking for a new best friend, this girl wont disappoint! You will love her the moment you meet her. ** Applications will not be screened if they do not meet the listed requirements.**",

            "description": "Jax is a 4 year old bully mix about 74 pounds. He's lived around kids of all ages and does well with other dogs but we would want a home with a female no other males at this time. He's not good with cats. He was owner surrendered due to them not being able to keep him in their apartment. He's house and kennel trained and knows basic commands but will need his new family to keep up the training. \nHe is currently in Fort Worth, TX but can make the trek to Olympia, WA scheduled to arrive on Saturday Dec 5th with a pre-adoption which is the only way to secure that he will for sure go home with you! Pre-Adoption means getting your app in, approved and paying the adoption fee to secure the ride.  His adoption fee is $395 which covers his neuter, vaccinations, HW testing, chipping, health certificate and transport fees. All our dogs come with a 30 day, money back, trial period to make sure they are the right fit in your environment. Tall Tails Rescue has a commitment to these dogs for their lifetime and we hope you do too! If you are interested in pre-adoption you can click the link here or copy/paste and fill out the app to get started: https://form.jotform.com/PNWdogs/ttrt-pnw-ap",

Ben has been vet checked, tested negative for heartworm, neutered, is up to date on vaccines and on heartworm & flea preventative.  We ask a donation of $190 cash.

This boy came to us after supposedly being found as a stray, although, sadly, we believe the person claiming to be the finder, was in fact his owner. You know what they say - one mans trash is another mans treasure! Piglet is absolutely adorable, he's a tiny 47 lbs, with the most adorable eyes. Piglet likes other dogs, and becomes playful! He knows a bunch of commands and also thinks he's a lap dog. He does seem to have issues with strangers, and seems more comfortable with women than men, so a savvy, patient owner would be best for this little meatball. \nIf you are interested in learning more, please contact our placement team: T: (516)785-5220 E: Adoption@tohmail.org E:Foster@tohmail.org E: Rescue@tohmail.org",

She had 10 puppies and was an incredible mom while she raised them for 12 weeks, but now it's time to find her forever home. She is sweet, loving, playful, and all around... an incredible friend. She would make a wonderful addition to any family.\n\nMarsha is dog selective. She would do best with one-two calm dogs, or a patient person that can SLOWLY integrate her over the course of several days. She gets overwhelmed being thrown into a pack of new dogs or meeting dogs with higher energy. This does not mean she isnt a good dog, she is sitll one of the best. She just needs a little stability before meeting higher energy doggos.",

I was told by my rescue family that I am very high energy and would be a perfect friend for you to do just that! I love to play with humans and dogs.  Breed and sex do not matter to me as long as I get to run.

He loves to be right next to people and constantly rolls over for belly rubs. He has superb Fetch skills and can't wait to have someone to play with him everyday in his own yard. He would also be a great hiking buddy! Rusty is not too fond of 4 legged friends but would do well in a home with older children. He is here, waiting for you to come meet him!\n\nIf interested in meeting Rusty please email adoption@sdsanctuary.com.",

True to his breed, he can be a little dominant and will not tolerate any heavy handed boss tactics.  He is a great dog if you are willing to have a partner, and once he understands what you want he is more than willing to comply.  Rocky will need a fenced yard so he is not challenged by the wrong people should he wander off.  Rocky is a medium sized dog and would prefer a home with no small children.\n\nIf you would like an application go to our website (https://humanesocietypc.com/) and download one and email it back as a Word or PDF document. Please no Google documents.\n\nThis dog's adoption fee is $190. That fee includes spaying/ neutering, microchipping, deworming and vaccinations.",

But there are pros to that. I don't bark when people knock or when fire trucks pass or when there is pesky wildlife being noisy in the middle of the night. I'm very smart and can sit on command even though I can't hear - all you have to is hold your fist palm-down in front of me and I know what to do! I love treats so I'm willing to learn more hand signs if you're interested. Unfortunately, I would do best as the only animal. I get a little jealous when it comes to being in your lap, so teenagers or older would be best for me. My adoption fee is $100!\nTo adopt one of our animals, please visit our shelter, open Tuesday-Friday from Noon-6pm and Saturday from Noon-4pm.
